I'm 27M, have started going to gym around start of this year and have lost weight. Coffee doesn't usually effect me until last Thursday. For context, I had a pretty tough childhood, I married the love of my life but things haven't been great lately but I don't think it's the main reason. 

So last Thursday I had coffee at around 10 PM. I came home, I work late hours so I thought coffee would wear off by the time I go to bed. At 1 am I started having palpatations, numbness on the left side of my body and sever anxiety which lead me to believe that if I sleep I won't be able to wake up at all. During this time I kept monitoring by BP, Pulse rate and saturation and three of them were very normal and consistent. I drank lots of water but the palpatations won't go away. 

The next day, I was in car with my wife. We had a small argument to which first I had a very unreasonable crazy reaction followed by me crying which I couldn't understand why? As my wife said it made her anxious too because I don't usually cry even in situations where I should've. Then my mother called me, I hung up in the middle of conversation and started crying again. 

Later that night, I took of my shirt and we find out that my left chest was a bit swollen, we brushed off the Risk of heart related disease because a day prior to palpatations I pushed myself a little too much in gym and we thought the pain is because of that. 

I know the post is confusing because I'm very confused right now as well. The swollen chest and back make me think that it was because of gym but the panic attacks are still a mystery to me ( I never had anxiety or panic attacks prior) but now for three days my left side mainly my face goes numb. Has anyone faced this sort of situation? Is it anxiety? I'm scared to go to the doctor because of obvious reasons. What should I do. 


TLDR: Had palpatations after having coffee late night followed by panic attacks and now my left side goes numb sometimes ",1,1734977354.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hktlxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1hktlxk/i_work_in_a_warehouse_for_lost_luggage_the_bags/,I Work in a Warehouse for Lost Luggage. The Bags Are Watching Me,"When I first started working at the lost airline luggage warehouse, I thought it would be the kind of job you could do on autopilot. You know, sorting through suitcases, matching tags, and occasionally finding weird stuff people leave behind. Like that one time someone packed an entire taxidermied raccoon. But after a few months, the novelty wore off, and it became just rows and rows of unclaimed baggage, waiting for someone who was never going to show up.

The place is massive, like a graveyard for forgotten lives. We hold onto bags for 90 days. If no one claims them, the contents are auctioned off, and the cycle starts over. My supervisor, Dale, once joked that every suitcase holds a secret, but most of the time, it’s just dirty laundry and chargers for phones no one uses anymore.

But then I noticed something strange. A section of the warehouse I hadn’t paid much attention to before. It was tucked in the back, past the rows of unclaimed bags. The area was marked with a faded sign that just said “Claimed.”

At first, I didn’t think much of it. I figured they were bags people had come to collect, but the weird thing was, they were all still there. Perfectly stacked, perfectly clean. No dust, no tags, no signs of wear. And they didn’t show up on the logs.

One night, during inventory, I asked Dale about it. “What’s the deal with the ‘Claimed’ bags?” I said, trying to sound casual.

He didn’t even look up from his clipboard. “Some things are better left alone,” he muttered, then changed the subject to tomorrow’s auction prep.

That answer should’ve been enough for me to let it go. But the bags stuck in my head. Something about how pristine they looked, like they didn’t belong there, or maybe belonged too much, like they’d always been there.

The thing about working late in a place like this is that your mind starts to play tricks on you. The warehouse is dead quiet after hours, except for the hum of the overhead lights and the occasional creak of the metal shelves. It’s the kind of silence that makes you jump at your own shadow.

One night, I was wrapping up some inventory when I heard it- shuffling. Something was moving in the far corner of the warehouse. My first thought was a stray animal, maybe a raccoon that snuck in somehow. Or, knowing Dale, it could’ve been some dumb prank to spook the new guy.

I grabbed a flashlight and headed toward the sound. The shuffling stopped as soon as I got close to the “Claimed” section. There was nothing there, just the same neat rows of pristine bags, untouched. But when I looked closer, one of the bags was out of place. It had been moved to a different aisle. I was sure of it.

I called out, “Dale? You messing with me?”

No answer.

I stood there for a while, listening, but all I heard was the hum of the lights and my own heartbeat. Finally, I chalked it up to me being tired and went back to my work.

The next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about that bag. It didn’t make sense. No one else had been in the warehouse that night, and the logs didn’t show anything unusual. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to take a closer look.

I picked a bag at random, a sleek black duffel with no tags or identifying marks. My hands were shaking as I unzipped it, half expecting to find something gruesome, like those urban legends about body parts in lost luggage.

Instead, I found... my childhood.

The first thing I pulled out was a tattered copy of The Hobbit, the exact same edition my dad used to read to me when I was little. The corners were bent in the same way, like someone had dog-eared the pages. Then there was a faded red jacket- my mom’s jacket. I hadn’t seen it in years, but I recognized the frayed cuffs and the small ink stain on the pocket.

And then I saw the photo.

It was a picture of me as a teenager, standing in front of what looked like a campfire. But the people around me? I didn’t know any of them. They were smiling, leaning in like we were all best friends, but I couldn’t place a single face.

What really got me, though, was the photo itself. It wasn’t just old, it looked... wrong. The edges were warped, like the image had been stretched too far, and the sky in the background was a sickly shade of green.

I zipped the bag up and shoved it back on the shelf, my heart pounding. Maybe it was some kind of elaborate joke. Maybe someone had found my stuff online or dug through old records to mess with me.

But deep down, I knew better.

I should’ve let it go. I should’ve zipped that bag up and walked away for good. But when you see pieces of your own life staring back at you. things you can’t explain. you can’t just ignore it. At least, I couldn’t.

The next night, I stayed late again. I told myself I was finishing inventory, but really, I couldn’t stop thinking about that bag. I needed to see if what I’d found was still inside. Maybe I’d imagined it. Maybe someone was screwing with me. But when I opened it, the contents had changed.

It wasn’t the book or the jacket anymore. This time, there was a watch- my watch. The one I’d lost three years ago on a camping trip. Next to it was a folded-up piece of paper, and when I opened it, I nearly dropped it. It was a note, written in my handwriting: “You’re almost there. Keep looking.” But I didn’t remember writing it.

And then there was the toy plane. It was identical to one I used to have as a kid, right down to the chipped wing and the faded blue paint. It couldn’t have been coincidence. It just couldn’t.

I zipped the bag back up, my hands shaking, and shoved it back on the shelf. For the rest of the night, I tried to act normal, but my head was spinning. What the hell was happening? Who could’ve put those things in there? And why?

The next day, things got weirder. Dale was jumpy, more than usual. He barely looked at me when I clocked in, and at one point, I caught him on the phone. He was pacing near the break room, muttering under his breath, but I swear I heard him say, “Another one’s getting close.” When he noticed me, he hung up fast and walked off, pretending like nothing had happened.

Other people started noticing things, too. A couple of the guys joked about hearing whispers when they passed the ""Claimed"" section. One of them, Chris, said it sounded like someone calling his name, but he laughed it off. “This place is creepy as hell at night, man,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m not going near that corner again.”

And then the dreams started.

The first one wasn’t bad, just strange. I was sitting at a dinner table with a family that felt... familiar. Like I should’ve known them, but I didn’t. They were laughing, talking, passing dishes around. It was warm, comfortable, but when I woke up, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I don’t have a family like that. I never have.

The next dream was worse. I was standing in a church, wearing a tuxedo, holding someone’s hand. A bride. I couldn’t see her face, but I knew... I knew I was supposed to know her. My heart was racing, not from fear, but from something else, like longing or regret. When I woke up, I felt this crushing emptiness, like I’d lost something I never even had.

Every night, it was something new. A birthday party I’d never been to. A road trip I never took. A life that didn’t belong to me, but somehow felt like it did. It was like the bag wasn’t just holding objects, it was holding memories. Pieces of a life that I was starting to think might’ve been mine, or could’ve been mine.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I couldn’t stop going back.

\-

It was around midnight when I was finally alone, and I decided to investigate anything that could tell me what was going on. I only had enough access in the computers to check data on the main luggage we sorted. Dale was a stand up guy, but not the smartest when it came to technology, so getting into his account was easy. His password was on a sticky-note under the monitor. 

The ""Claimed"" section wasn’t in any of the official documentation. It was like it didn’t exist.

The first thing I noticed was how sparse the records were. There were no flight numbers, no names of passengers, no airports of origin. Just dates and vague location tags. But then I scrolled further back, and my stomach dropped.

The logs listed names. Names of people- former employees, frequent travelers, even a couple of warehouse delivery drivers. Each name was flagged as ""unaccounted for."" Missing. The timestamps in the logs didn’t make sense either. They showed dates weeks, sometimes months, after these people had supposedly vanished. Like the system was still tracking them, even though they were gone.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every sound in my apartment made me jump, and every shadow felt like it was creeping closer. By the next morning, I knew I couldn’t keep this to myself.

I cornered Dale during lunch, catching him off-guard as he stood by the vending machines.

“Dale, what’s going on with the 'Claimed' bags?” I asked, keeping my voice low.

His expression shifted instantly. It wasn’t just fear, it was resignation, like he’d been waiting for this.

“You’ve been poking around too much,” he muttered, glancing nervously toward the security cameras.

“Why are there names tied to the bags? People who went missing? What the hell is this place?” I demanded.

Dale sighed, his shoulders slumping. “You weren’t supposed to dig this deep. Look, those bags... they’re not normal. They don’t belong to any airline, any traveler. They belong to... people who’ve been taken.”

“Taken? By who?”

“Not who. What,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Those bags are like... anchors. They’re tied to something else, somewhere else. When you open one, you’re inviting it in. It starts pulling pieces of you, rewriting things. The more you interact, the harder it is to stay here. Eventually, you just... go.”

I stared at him, trying to process what he was saying. It sounded insane, but every strange thing I’d seen in that warehouse suddenly felt like a puzzle snapping into place.

“Why didn’t you warn me?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“I tried,” he said. “But curiosity always wins. It’s why they keep sending people like us to work here, people who need the job but won’t be missed if something happens. Now, you’re in too deep. Whatever’s in those bags... it’s noticed you.”

That night, when I walked into the warehouse for my shift, the first thing I saw was a new bag in the ""Claimed"" section. It wasn’t there before. It was smaller than the others, almost like a carry-on.

My name was printed on the tag.

I froze, my stomach twisting into knots. The bag was locked, but as I stood there, I heard it- faint tapping from inside, like someone was knocking to get out.

I knew I was in over my head, but by this point, the bag with my name on it was all I could think about. It wasn’t just curiosity anymore, it felt like a compulsion, a pull I couldn’t ignore. That night, I waited until the warehouse was empty and the cameras were angled away. My hands were shaking when I unzipped it.

Inside, there was no clothing or trinkets, no personal items. Just... a shimmering, mirror-like surface. It was unnatural, almost liquid but solid at the same time. I leaned closer, and my reflection stared back at me, except it wasn’t quite right. My face looked... older. Tired. The scar on my chin from middle school wasn’t there. Before I could process it, the surface rippled, and I felt myself being pulled forward.

I tried to step back, but my legs wouldn’t move. The world around me blurred, and suddenly, I was somewhere else.

The warehouse was still there, but it wasn’t the same. The lights flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows. The air was thick, suffocating, and everything was silent. Not the kind of silence where you could hear your own breathing, but a void, like sound didn’t exist. The aisles stretched endlessly in every direction, and every bag in the ""Claimed"" section was there, stacked high and moving ever so slightly on their own.

Then I saw him. Another me.

He stepped out from one of the aisles, and I almost screamed. He looked just like me, but older, maybe by ten, twenty years. His eyes were sunken, his skin pale and gaunt. He moved like every step was painful, but there was something worse than his appearance. It was the look on his face: desperation.

“You shouldn’t have opened it,” he said, his voice hoarse but clear. “You need to leave. Now.”

“What is this? Who are you?” I demanded, though my voice cracked halfway through.

“I’m you,” he said, his voice tinged with something close to regret. “Or I was. And if you don’t leave, you’ll become me.”

I didn’t understand. How could I? But he kept talking, fast and frantic, like he was running out of time. “The bags aren’t just lost luggage. They’re markers. If you open yours, you’re bound to this place, this... other version of the warehouse. You’ll lose everything- your life, your memories. You’ll become part of it.”

I tried to speak, but then I saw them. Shadowy figures emerging from the aisles, moving slowly but deliberately. Their forms were vague, like smoke trying to take shape, but I could see hints of faces- some anguished, some expressionless. They were the ones who had opened their bags. Victims, trapped here forever.

“They’ll take you if you stay,” the other me said, his voice trembling. “Please, don’t let them get you.”

I could barely breathe. The figures were getting closer, the void-like silence pressing down on me. The other me reached into his own bag- his version of my bag, and pulled out the mirror-like surface. “This is your way out,” he said. “Use it. Don’t look back.”

I hesitated, my mind racing. But then I saw the figures reach for him. His face twisted in panic as he shoved the mirror toward me. “Go!” he screamed.

I grabbed it and felt the pull again, the same sensation as before but reversed. The distorted warehouse blurred around me, and suddenly, I was back in the real one, sprawled on the cold concrete floor next to the bag. It was zipped shut like I’d never touched it.

The silence was gone, replaced by the hum of the fluorescent lights. But my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I stared at the bag, half-expecting it to move, but it didn’t. I scrambled to my feet and ran, leaving everything behind.

\-

When I went back the day after opening my bag, something felt... off. I walked into the break room, and my usual coffee mug, this old, chipped ceramic one with my initials, wasn’t on the counter. Instead, there was a sleek, brand-new travel mug I’d never seen before. Someone probably just moved it, I thought. But then I opened my locker.

The photos of my niece and nephew that I’d taped inside? Gone. My spare hoodie, gone. In their place were things I didn’t recognize: a set of car keys I didn’t own, a pair of sunglasses I’d never seen before. They weren’t just random items, they felt like placeholders, substitutes for my own life.

When I asked Dale about it, he gave me this blank look, like he didn’t even know who I was. “You new here or something?” he asked, scratching his head. The guy who trained me, who signed off on my first paycheck, was now acting like I was a stranger. I thought maybe he was screwing with me, but the way he looked at me, confused, almost scared, it didn’t feel like a joke.

The worst part was the ""Claimed"" section. My bag wasn’t there anymore. I combed through every aisle, every shelf, but it was gone. Instead, there were new bags, ones I didn’t recognize, and I swear some of them were moving ever so slightly, like they were breathing.

I couldn’t stay there. The warehouse had changed, or maybe I had. Either way, I left. I didn’t even bother clocking out- I just got in my car and drove, telling myself I’d never go back.

For a day or two, I thought I was in the clear. I stayed in bed, ignored my phone, and tried to convince myself that everything was fine. But then the bags started showing up.

The first time, it was in my car. I unlocked it to drive to the grocery store, and there it was- sitting on the passenger seat like it had always been there. It wasn’t the same bag I’d opened in the warehouse, but it was unmistakably one of those bags: pristine, untagged, and humming faintly with that same low, static sound. I left my car in the lot and walked home.

Then one appeared outside my apartment door. Same type, same unnerving hum. I didn’t touch it. I stepped over it, slammed my door, and shoved a chair under the handle. When I finally worked up the nerve to peek through the peephole a few hours later, it was gone.

But they kept coming. On my walk to the park, I saw one sitting on a bench, perfectly placed, as if waiting for me. Another was on the side of the road, half-hidden in the weeds, but I knew it was meant for me.

They’re not just bags anymore. They’re markers. Warnings. Reminders. And I can feel them closing in.

\-

I thought quitting would end it. I thought walking away from that damn warehouse would mean I could finally sleep, that I could leave all of this behind. I was so wrong. But the bags, those Claimed bags, they don’t leave you alone.

After I left, I moved back in with my parents for a while. The thought of being alone in an apartment made my skin crawl. Even now, I keep my blinds drawn and double-check the locks on every door, every window. Not that it helps. The paranoia is always there, like something just out of sight, waiting.

The bags don’t stop. Or at least the feeling of them doesn’t. Sometimes, when the house is quiet and I’m trying to fall asleep, I hear faint tapping. It’s soft, rhythmic, like someone drumming their fingers on the floor. It always comes from places where something could hide- a closet, under the bed, even the trunk of my car once. I’ll sit up, heart pounding, and tell myself it’s nothing. But I don’t go looking. Not anymore.

Every now and then, I dream about the warehouse. I see the rows of bags stretching into infinity, a maze I can’t escape from. Sometimes, I hear Dale’s voice echoing through the aisles, warning me to stay away. Other times, I see myself- not me as I am now, but a different version of me. One who stayed, one who opened all the bags, one who never left. And he just smiles, like he knows something I don’t.

I’ve tried to piece it all together, to make sense of it, but there’s no explanation that satisfies. The ""Claimed"" section wasn’t just unclaimed luggage- it was something else. A doorway, maybe. A trap. Or maybe just a cruel joke the universe decided to play on me.

I don’t want anyone else to go through what I did. If you ever lose your luggage, pray it stays lost. Because if you see your name on a bag that isn’t yours, don’t open it. Not even once.",1,1734977281.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin.

1hktj6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hktj6a/need_help_understanding_water_chemistry_tww/,Need help understanding water chemistry. (TWW Example),"Hello fellow espresso enthusiasts!

As a next step of my coffee journey I decided to get into water chemistry and it's composition. I have a somewhat generic understanding of what makes a coffee water: TDS, GH, KH, pH and EC. I currently have 4 main ingridients, besides de-ionized water, I experiment with:
- Epsom Salt Heptahydrate
- Calcium Citrate
- Potassium Bicarbonate
- Sodium Bicarbonate.

What I am having issues with is trying to understand how TWW Espresso profile claim to be 150 TDS. Any calculations I do for the published formula I go way beyond 150 ppm. What am I doing wrong?
Here is the published recipe for 1 Gallon sachet:
- 1050mg Epsom Salt Heptahydrate
- 300mg Calcium Citrate
- 150mg Potassium Bicarbonate

This means, for 1 Liter we have (for easier mg/L aka ppm contribution) :
- 277.5mg Epsom Salt Heptahydrate
- 79.3mg Calcium Citrate
- 39.6mg Potassium Bicarbonate

Epsom Salt Heptahydrate is almost 52% water, so it contributes to 133.2 ppm of TDS, and GH 110.7 ppm. 

Calcium Citrate contributes to 79. 3 ppm of TDS, and GH 31.8 ppm. 

Potassium Bicarbonate contributes to 39.6 ppm TDS, and KH 19.8 ppm

I means, TWW Espresso in reality has: 252.1 ppm TDS, 142.5 ppm GH and 19.8 ppm KH.

Hello,

I am struggling with extreme heartburn and weird feeling in stomach for ~2 years. Also diagnosed gastritis. Nothing helps to cure it

Occasional brain fog, stool minor issues.

I’ve made “homework” and evaluated some analyses i’ve had for past 3 years.

I identified two analyses which suggests celiac for me. AgA igA positive as well as Gen test.

Trying to remove celiac drastically helped to remove heartburn even if i drink alcohol or coffee/tomato sauce. Like a magic pill.

Is it enough to say I have Celiac indeed, or i still need to find power suffer 1 month with Gluten to make endoscopy with biopsy?

The word of wisdom says to avoid addictive substances, but then goes on to say coffee specifically. However my issue is we have these members who wake up every morning and drink sugary sodas. In my mind I don't understand how it's ok to drink a sugary energy drinks like monster and redbull every day, but then if I drink an iced coffee now and then I get the weirdest looks ever.

I'm not trying to be bitter or salty either this is just me genuinely asking why is it that it's okay to drink a sugary soda at 10:00am but a coffee isn't?

If the wow was written for today would it have included sodas in it? Bc as far as I'm concerned in the 1800s sodas were not as readily available / a big concern at the time. People also didn't drink them for ""energy"".

Ultimately I believe the wow is all or nothing. I have friend who avoids caffeine and soda - you may say that's silly but I actually respect him for that. You see what I mean?

Idk I'm not trying to come off heated bc I do like the church and I do have a testimony, but I feel like my relationship with the lord hasn't changed bc I drink coffee.

It's just the church culture that gets under my skin sometimes.

Anyways I'd love some good insights please 🙏 


Edit* in my mind drinking a redbull/monster/soda to wake up is no different then drinking a coffee and in my mind could be considered healthier. Addiction is still Addiction even if it's not with the wow.

So for these reasons I think coffee is just an example of something we could be addicted to. So then it's surely ok to drink every now and then, right?

Printed pieces in the cabin include kicked off shoes and relaxed socks. The minfigs come with helmets to protect their eyes and ears from sunbeams that spread just like a pox. Other unique printed pieces include a space atlas showing their recent departure from Uranus.

I’m going to need consistent temperature and pressure for selling coffee from my apartment (with plans to make a coffee cart later), and I’ve always dreamed of owning a La Marzocco. For reference, this is the grinder I plan to pair with the new machine: **Fiorenzato AllGround Sense**.

Now, I’m stuck between two machines: the Linea Mini R and a 2022 GS3 MP. The GS3 has always been a dream of mine, but it’s always been out of my budget until now. I found a 2022 GS3 MP for $400 more than what I’d pay for a brand new Linea Mini R, so I’m really debating what to do.

Here’s where I’m torn:

1. **The Look**: The black Linea Mini is just so clean. If I went with the GS3, I’d definitely want to upgrade it with black and wood accents down the road, but that’s an extra cost I’d need to plan for.
2. **Light Roasts & Controls**: I love light roasts, so the GS3’s profiling options are super appealing. But honestly, I’d rather have volumetric controls than the manual paddle especially with the new brew by weight feature on the Linea Mini.
3. **Morning Workflow**: Every morning, I make about 20 drinks (half hot, half cold) for myself and my neighbors. With that kind of volume, I feel like volumetric controls would be way more efficient for what I’m doing than getting into profiling, even though I’d enjoy it for personal use.

Now, here’s a random thought: Do y’all think it’s worth posting something to see if anyone in Texas might want to trade a GS3 MP for an AV? I’d happily drive anywhere in the state to swap, and obviously, we’d both make sure the machines are in great condition before trading. Has anyone ever seen or done something like that?

Would love to hear your advice especially if you’ve had experience with either machine!

What can this be? 
Sorry this is so long -
Let me preface this with somethings- prior to this episode, about two years, I was diagnosed with Hashimotos and am on a low dose of levothyroxine 25. I’ve always had a history of IBSC. 

I had begun working out around 4-5 days a week starting the last week of October 2024. I was also tracking my calories and was staying within 1300 daily. I am 5’1 female and weighed 152 pounds at the time. I mostly do a lot of cardio- spin classes and started incorporating some strength training. My ibs was near gone I was going regularly. 

November 12th 2024 I attended a spin class and spinned for an hour and a half with mainly vigorous activity. - I’ve done about an hour before but this was obviously more. 
My heart rate after a workout would go down almost immediately to 80s and after like 20 minutes, normal.

I noticed when I got home that my heart rate stayed very high- 93 resting and jumping to 120s with movement. I ate and took a bath to see if that would help- it did not. I ate more thinking it had to do with the fast- it did not. 
It continued- and has progressively gotten worse 

My normal heart rate prior to this class was :
Mid to low 40s sleeping, mid 50s laying, 60s low sitting , 70s- very low 80s upright and walking- for lifting I would hardly go above 115

My sleeping hr now is high 50s low 60s, my laying down is 70s -80s and standing upright is 90s-130s and over that if doing things. 

My initial symptom was just noticing that with movement my heart rate just increases by like 30-50bpm. And my resting heart rate continues to increase 

Rest and ice helps- and I’ve been really just laying out and restricting everything else because it just continues to increase. I haven’t been able to return to normal activity- no gym and cut out everything but work- no social life, barely able to take care of myself with washing hair- teeth- cleaning- 
I used to be a big coffee drinker…can’t anymore. 

My daily resting heart rate before this was 54 now I’m almost at 70.
I’ll go up to 145 showering or walking and even brushing my teeth 
120 crying 

I got labs done, checked by thyroid and adrenaline. I’ve done a holter monitor, an echo cardiogram and a stress test. Everything was normal. 

My HR increased recently when my GI, after weeks of being constipated, had me do the golytely prep. It seemed my heart rate was going down- enough that I felt I could wash my hair- and then I had the worst coldness in my hands and toes and whole body tremors. With the whole prep I only had 5 bowel movements and I’ve noticed and increased tightness/ tenseness of my bowels and sphincter. My resting heart rate as 100 when this happened- I went the the hospital the next day and my labs were normal but I felt extreme nausea and a burning feeling in my hands and feet and increased heart rate- from base. 

Now it’s: laying :80 sitting 85-90 moving: 120-150 

Initial symptoms: 
Shortness of breath 
On and off again fevers 
Lightheaded 
Intense pressure in head 
Easily fatigued 
After stress test I had chest pain 
Blood pressure: higher diastolic number 


New symptoms 
Inability to use bathroom constipation 
Not peeing as much as I drink - difficulties
Heat intolerant 
Double vision/inability to focus 
Fingertips and toes tingles/ swelling/ rush of heat/ coldness / decreased sensation 
Spasms pulsating in back for hours 
Awaken from sleep high hr- low sleep 
Losing weight - nausea- heart rate increases when I’ve eaten
Difficulty thinking and getting out what I’m thinking 

I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. 
My doctor wants to put me on metropolol (?)  but my blood pressure and heart rate before this were low. 

My cardiologist says “I’m stumped” I’m not sure where to go from here- he recommended another cardiologist that is unresponsive for POTs- 


Is this POTS? Does it develop from exercise like this? Does colon prep make it worse? Does it increase with every movement ? 
I’m scheduled to start pelvic floor pt this week and worried about moving-

On paper I've got a great life. I've got a pretty good Marketing and Communications job where I've got good healthcare and make around 60k.

I've got a wonderful girlfriend. She lives about an hour away though. I currently work hybrid so I'm planning on moving closer to her and just commuting an hour and a half a couple times a week.

I grew up in a big catholic family that very much has this crab bucket mentality. ""Who do you think you are?"" ""What makes you so special?"" ""You better not move too far"" ""Oh you're not ready for that"" are phrases burnt into my subconscious.

On top of that, someone very close to me came out has having been abused by a priest when I was in middle school. This caused me and my immediate family to stop attending mass.

There is still some pain I'm dealing with from this. It really shook things up with my immediate family and I felt like I was adrift at sea emotionally for awhile and like I lost my family in a way. My family and I are all still close but it really affected us.

I sought refuge and got very close with several of my cousins growing up after that news. To the point where I often preferred hanging out with them rather than make new friends. I made some new friends in high school but none of them have really stuck. I have some great friends from college but we are all kind of going our seperate ways. I think I'd prefer to move on from defaulting to hanging out with my cousins. There is a familiarity and safety there, but I just feel boxed in and trapped sometimes hanging out with them. Several of them also still attend mass which feels like a betrayal in some ways.

I also generally struggle with bringing up the priest abuse thing with people I try to befriend. It's tricky because a fair amount of people you encounter on the street or in a coffee shop are religious and my worldview is just so far removed from that.

The idea behind the move is to be closer to my girlfriend, develop some new adult relationships, and get involved with some hobbies/activities so I'm not constantly leaning on her. I know I could do it in my current town, but I still just feel this malaise when I see people I know from growing up.

I'm in therapy right now which absolutely helps, but I just want to get on with my life. I graduated from college during covid and feel like the world has gotten tossed in the blender.

Any thoughts, words of affirmation, or experience would be much appreciated.",1,1734976251.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Blood test are good and stool samples aswell.

I'm lost and anxious on what should I do, i've been reading (perhaps too much) on the subject and completly lost. I've decided not to take the pantropazole this morning and my stomach burns (Ive read that this is normal when you stop). Small gerd aswell (never really had it before)

What would you guys do? Normal to have symptoms that long after treatment? I still drink a coffee in the morning but i'm following the diet.

May the New Year bring acceptance letters from the schools of your dreams. May you find a program that feels like home, with advisors who recognize your potential and peers who share your passion.

May you discover a topic that sparks joy, curiosity, and excitement every single day. May your early experiments and readings light the way to a fulfilling and meaningful project. And may you never forget that asking questions is the heart of research.

**To those knee-deep in coursework and research**:

1hksvuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1hksvuq/looking_for_recommendations/,Looking for recommendations,"First off, I want to say that I’m trying to find more budget friendly scents (below $60).

I love soft smelling florals, sweet fruity things but not sweet like candy.
Some of my favorite notes are peach, vanilla, amber, green tea, citrus, almond, coffee, cocoa and anything smoky/woodsy. Feminine or unisex perfume is ok. Anything nutty or clean smelling works for my skin.

As far as dislikes, I stay away from anything powdery, heavy florals, and candy like scents.

About 30 minutes ago I received a phone call from a random number telling me he was an Amazon delivery guy. He told me I was about to receive a 6 digit code by whatsapp and to give it to him to confirm the delivery. I'm usually very careful and thankfully have not fallen for phone or text scams before. I immediately checked my Amazon account and saw that my wife had two orders on the way (probably a coincidence). After checking this, I told the guy that it's weird that he was asking me for a code because on the rare occasion that Amazon does require a code it's sent directly to my email. He said that this was because the order was being shipped through a third party. I don't know if it was because I haven't had my morning coffee yet or because he sounded like a nice guy but I gave him the 6 digit code.

I immediately received a notification from whatsapp asking me to confirm if I wanted to give access to an android phone. I have and iphone and that's the moment I realized this was all a scam. I clicked no, and then activated two step security. I got about another 5 notifications of the same android phone trying to get access, I kept clicking no, while at the same time the guy was getting pretty intense trying to get me to click yes.

I blatantly told him ""man you almost got me"", and he completely switched his nice voice tone to more sinister voice and just said: ""you got scared huh, fuck you"" then hang up.

I immediately unlinked all my devices and made sure nothing was wrong with my whatsapp. Thankfully nothing else happened and I'm very grateful to whatsapp for asking me if I wanted to give access to that phone after I had already given him the 6 digit code. Had I not seen that weird phone trying to get access I would've been fucked as I do a lot of business through whatsapp.

I'm sharing this because I used to laugh at people falling for these kinds of scams but I was one click away from making a very costly mistake. Be careful y'all and make sure to activate two step verification security on your most important accounts.

I have a Bambino Plus and after a year of using it, I want to upgrade my grinder. I’ve watched countless hours of YouTube videos on different grinders and still finding it difficult to narrow the right one for me. 

So far I only drink espresso (Milk based), I want to do single dosing, I use Dark roasted beans.

Not sure whether I want conical or flat burr grinder but the coffee I enjoy from coffee shops use commercial grinders and I assume it’s flat burr. How does anyone know whether they prefer the taste from conical or Flat before buying their first grinder? From the research I’ve done, there doesn’t seem to be much difference in taste between Flat and Conical burs when milk is added.

The list of potential options are:
-Df64 Gen 2
-Df54
-Varia VS3
-Eureka Mignon Oro
-Niche Zero 
-Baratza Encore ESP

I am swaying towards the DF64 Gen 2 due to the price (on sale currently), 64mm flat burr, can try pour over coffee in future, option to upgrade burrs, can do single dosing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of us have heard the saying, ""Drink eight glasses of water a day,"" but is this guideline based on science? Exploring the science behind how much water you should drink in a day reveals a more complex picture. Understanding your body's hydration needs involves considering several factors.

The human body is made up of about 60% water, which is essential for many bodily functions. Staying adequately hydrated supports digestion, absorption of nutrients, and kidney function. When considering how much water to drink, it's essential to understand that different factors play a role in your personal hydration needs.

### Factors Affecting Your Water Intake

Your daily water intake can vary based on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can lead to increased sweating, which requires more fluid intake.
- **Physical Activity:** If you exercise or engage in other activities, you'll lose more water and need to replenish it.
- **Diet:** Consuming salty or spicy foods can make you thirstier, while eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, which contain water, can lower your water requirements.
- **Age and Gender:** Older adults may require less water, while men often need more than women due to differences in body composition.

### General Guidelines for Daily Water Intake

The Institute of Medicine suggests the following general guidelines for daily water intake:

- About 3.7 liters (or 125 ounces) for men
- About 2.7 liters (or 91 ounces) for women

These recommendations include all fluids consumed, not just water. It’s important to listen to your body’s signals. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need more fluids. However, relying solely on thirst may not be sufficient, especially during intense physical activity or in extreme temperatures.

### Hydration and Health

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health. Some of the benefits of adequate water intake include:

- **Improved Digestion:** Water helps to break down food so your body can absorb nutrients effectively.
- **Healthy Skin:** Adequate hydration can help keep your skin elastic and vibrant.
- **Weight Management:** Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger. Drinking water before meals can help control appetite.
- **Kidney Function:** Proper hydration helps your kidneys filter waste from the blood.

When discussing hydration, myth-busting is necessary. Many people believe that drinking a lot of water can flush out toxins quickly. However, your kidneys effectively eliminate toxins when they are functioning correctly. Overhydration can also lead to water intoxication, a rare but serious condition.

### Signs of Dehydration

Not drinking enough water can lead to dehydration, which is a risk in various situations. Common signs include:

- Dry mouth and thirst
- Reduced urine output
- Dark yellow urine
- Fatigue and dizziness
- Headaches

To prevent dehydration, balance your water intake with your activities and environment. Carrying a water bottle with you during the day can help you stay aware of your consumption.

### Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated

Here are some practical strategies to ensure you drink enough water throughout the day:

- Begin your day with a glass of water.
- Set reminders on your phone to drink water at intervals.
- Add flavor to your water with fruits or herbs like lemon or mint.
- Include water-rich foods in your meals, such as cucumbers, oranges, and soups.

Remember that individual hydration needs can differ widely. By paying attention to your body and incorporating hydration into your daily routine, you can help maintain optimal health and well-being. Knowledge is key: the more informed you are about how much water you should drink in a day, the better you'll be at meeting your personal hydration needs.

The Role of Hydration in Physical Performance
---------------------------------------------

Hydration plays a crucial role in physical performance, influencing both endurance and strength. When your body is adequately hydrated, it functions optimally. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, decreased coordination, and slower reaction times. Understanding how hydration affects your performance can help you manage your water intake properly, especially during physical activities.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Basics of Hydration

Your body is composed of about 60% water, which is essential for numerous bodily functions. Water aids in:

- **Regulating body temperature:** When you sweat, your body loses water. This helps cool you down but requires replenishment.
- **Transporting nutrients:** Water helps to carry essential nutrients to your muscles and removes waste products.
- **Maintaining joint lubrication:** Proper hydration keeps your joints well-lubricated, reducing the risk of injuries.
- **Supporting cellular functions:** Every cell in your body relies on adequate water to perform its functions effectively.

### Understanding Water Loss During Exercise

During physical activity, you lose water primarily through sweat and respiration. The amount of water you lose can vary based on several factors, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Intensity of exercise:** High-intensity workouts lead to increased sweating, meaning you need to replace that lost fluid more diligently.
- **Duration of exercise:** The longer the duration, the more water you lose. Long-distance runners, for instance, need to hydrate often.
- **Environmental conditions:** Hot and humid weather accelerates fluid loss, while cooler conditions may lessen the sensation of thirst.

### Signs of Dehydration

It’s vital to recognize the signs of dehydration early to maintain performance levels. Common symptoms include:

- **Thirst:** This is your body’s primary signal that it needs water.
- **Dark yellow urine:** This indicates that you may be dehydrated. Clear or light yellow urine is a good sign of hydration.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or sluggish can result from inadequate hydration.
- **Dizziness or headaches:** These symptoms often occur as the body struggles to maintain normal function.

### How Much Water Do You Need?

Determining how much water you should drink daily can vary, but general recommendations suggest:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **General guideline:** Aim for about 2 to 3 liters (8 to 12 cups) of water per day.
- **Exercise considerations:** Increase your intake based on the intensity and duration of your workouts. It’s recommended to drink an additional 1.5 to 2.5 cups (400 to 600 mL) of water for every hour of exercise.
- **Personal factors:** Remember that individual needs can vary. Factors such as age, weight, and climate should influence your water intake.

### Best Practices for Staying Hydrated

To optimize your hydration for physical performance, consider the following tips:

- **Drink regularly:** Don’t wait until you’re thirsty. Make a habit of drinking water throughout the day.
- **Hydrate before and after workouts:** Drink water before you start exercising and rehydrate afterward to recover lost fluids.
- **Include electrolytes:** During prolonged exercise, consider sports drinks that contain electrolytes to replenish lost salts and enhance hydration.
- **Monitor your body:** Listen to your body, and stay attentive to signs of dehydration. Adjust your intake accordingly.

### The Benefits of Adequate Hydration in Performance

Staying well-hydrated leads to improved physical performance. Some key benefits include:

- **Improved focus:** Staying hydrated helps maintain focus and cognitive function, reducing mental fatigue during exercise.

Hydration is paramount for anyone engaged in physical activities. Understanding how much water you should drink and how hydration affects your performance can lead to better training results, enhanced endurance, and overall improved health. By prioritizing hydration, you give your body the essential support it needs to perform at its best.

Myths and Facts About Water Intake
----------------------------------

Water intake is a vital part of maintaining good health, yet there are plenty of myths surrounding how much water you should drink daily. Understanding what’s fact and what’s fiction can help you make informed choices about your hydration needs. Let’s clear up some common misconceptions and share the truths about this essential element.

### Myth 1: You Must Drink Eight Glasses of Water Daily

One of the most widely circulated pieces of advice is that you need to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day, often referred to as the ""8x8 rule."" While this guideline serves as a convenient benchmark, the reality is more nuanced. Individual water needs can vary greatly based on factors such as:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Your age
- Your weight
- Your activity level
- Climate conditions
- Your overall health

Listen to your body; thirst is a natural indicator that you need water. Rather than fixating solely on a specific number, focus on drinking enough to satisfy your thirst and keep your urine a light yellow color.

### Myth 2: All Fluids Hydrate You Equally

While it’s true that beverages like coffee, tea, and even juice contribute to your fluid intake, not all drinks are created equal. Caffeinated and alcoholic drinks can lead to dehydration. Why? These beverages may cause your body to lose more fluids than they provide. Instead, prioritize water as your primary source of hydration. Consider incorporating:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Herbal teas
- Fruit-infused water
- Broth-based soups

These options can help you stay hydrated while offering additional nutrients or flavor without the dehydrating effects that some drinks can have.

### Myth 3: You Only Need to Drink Water When You Feel Thirsty

Although thirst is a great signal from your body, relying solely on it can lead to underhydration. Some people may not feel thirsty until they are already dehydrated. This is especially true for older adults. Aim to drink water regularly throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty. A good strategy is to:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Keep a reusable water bottle with you
- Refill it several times a day
- Set reminders on your phone to drink

Making these habits a part of your daily routine can ensure you meet your hydration needs effectively.

### Myth 4: Drinking More Water Will Help You Lose Weight

While drinking enough water can support weight loss by promoting a feeling of fullness, simply increasing your water intake won't automatically lead to weight loss. Studies suggest that:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drinking water before meals can help reduce calorie intake.
- Proper hydration can enhance your metabolism.

The key is to use water as a tool that complements other healthy habits, like eating well and exercising. It’s important to create a balanced lifestyle that includes various factors for successful weight management.

### Myth 5: Clear Urine Means You're Overhydrated

People often believe that if their urine is completely clear, it means they are drinking too much water. However, clear urine can simply indicate good hydration. The color of your urine can vary based on:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- The foods you eat
- Medications
- Your hydration status

Light yellow urine typically signifies that you’re well-hydrated. If your urine is dark yellow or amber, it’s time to drink more water. Moderation is key—monitor your body and adjust your water intake accordingly.

### Myth 6: You Can Drink Too Much Water

Although rare, it is possible to drink excessive amounts of water, leading to a condition known as hyponatremia, where the sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low. This condition can be serious and may require medical attention. It's important to find a balance based on your individual needs, exercise level, and environment.

Ultimately, staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health. Keep these myths in mind the next time you reach for a glass of water. Ensure you hydrate responsibly, listen to your body’s signals, and incorporate water regularly into your routine.

How Age and Lifestyle Affect Daily Water Needs
----------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, and understanding how age and lifestyle influence daily water needs can help you stay healthy and hydrated. While the common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, the reality is that individual hydration needs can vary greatly. Several factors contribute to how much water you should drink, including your age, gender, activity levels, and overall lifestyle. Let’s explore these aspects more closely.

### Age and Hydration

Your body's water needs change as you age. Children have higher water needs in proportion to their body weight but can easily become dehydrated because they may not recognize when they are thirsty. Adults typically require a steady intake of water to maintain bodily functions. However, as you grow older, your sense of thirst may diminish, making hydration less intuitive.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Children (Ages 1-4):** About 1.3 liters (44 ounces) per day.
- **Children (Ages 5-8):** Approximately 1.6 liters (54 ounces) per day.
- **Adolescents (Ages 9-18):** Around 2 to 3 liters (68-102 ounces) per day, depending on gender.
- **Adults (Ages 19-50):** Roughly 2.7 liters (91 ounces) for women and 3.7 liters (125 ounces) for men.
- **Seniors (Ages 51 and up):** About 2.7 liters (91 ounces) for women and 3.7 liters (125 ounces) for men, but may need less due to lower activity levels and reduced thirst.

### Lifestyle Factors

Your daily activities and lifestyle choices also play a significant role in determining how much water you need. Here are some lifestyle factors to consider:

- **Physical Activity:** If you are physically active, your water needs increase. For every hour of exercise, you may need an additional 0.5 to 1 liter (17-34 ounces) of water.
- **Climate:** Living in a hot or humid climate can lead to increased sweating, which makes extra hydration necessary. On average, you could add another liter (34 ounces) on hot days.
- **Health Status:** Certain health conditions, such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, can deplete your body’s water supply rapidly, necessitating increased water intake.
- **Diet:** Your food choices can affect hydration. Diets high in salt or sugar can increase thirst. Conversely, eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, which contain water, can help with hydration.
- **Alcohol and Caffeine Consumption:** Drinks like coffee, tea, and alcohol can act as diuretics, causing you to lose water. It’s essential to compensate for this by increasing your water intake.

### Listening to Your Body

While general guidelines exist, it’s vital to listen to your body. Personal thirst levels can be a good indicator of when you need to hydrate. Also, keep an eye on the color of your urine. Ideally, it should be a light, pale yellow, which indicates proper hydration. Darker urine signifies that you may need to increase your water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Pregnant women should also consider their fluid needs more carefully. It’s generally recommended that they drink about 10 cups (2.3 liters or 78 ounces) of fluids daily, while breastfeeding mothers should aim for about 13 cups (3.1 liters or 104 ounces) to stay well-hydrated and support milk production.

### Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated

Here are some simple strategies to help you stay hydrated throughout the day:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Keep a water bottle with you to sip on throughout the day.
- Add flavor to your water with slices of fruit or herbs for a refreshing change.
- Set reminders on your phone or use hydration tracking apps to encourage regular water intake.
- Eat more hydrating foods, like watermelons, cucumbers, and oranges.

Understanding how age and lifestyle affect daily water needs can empower you to make informed hydration choices. By paying attention to body signals and adjusting your water intake according to activity levels and environmental factors, you can optimize your health and well-being. Stay mindful, stay hydrated, and remember that your water needs can change over time.

1hksojt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hksojt,Finding Bike Magic ,"I had a great time riding all fall. I was doing a bunch of bigger rides while the weather was still flirting with warm temperatures. I hit the Katy Trail for some gravel grinding, did some solo rides, and even got Lauren out for her first gravel ride. Weekly neighborhood laps usually include coffee shops and Tower Grove Park lap.

Lately, I’ve been commuting about 40 miles a week. A few mornings have been just under 20°F, but I’ve stayed warm so far. I wear thin merino bottoms under my pants, paired with merino socks and Simple OG shoes. For my upper layers, I stick to merino tops for everyday wear, and a Patagonia Nano Air keeps me plenty warm once I get pedaling. It’s tough to start out, but after half a mile, I’m all good. I got the Nano Air off eBay five years ago. I’m a sweaty boy and it works incredibly well for me. I also carry wool-lined leather gloves and a merino neck buff in my bag, just in case.  My glasses get fogged AF when I wear the buff over my face, so I try and not need it.

I started having some leaks on my rear tire. I battled that UD Cava for like 2 months. I finally got annoyed and put on some way thicker rubber and started running tubes. I’ve run tubeless since 2015 and I’ve never had such a frustrating run with a tire. The UD Mars I put on are fine, but they feel slow compared to the Cavas. The Cavas ride like the Veloflex tubulars I rode a long time ago. I’m ready to battle my rear tire again. I want the feel. I bought a bottle of sealant a few weeks ago. Just need to build up the emotional fortitude.

I absolutely love having a dynamo setup with lights. Last winter, I commuted with rechargeable lights, and it sucked when I’d forget to charge them and lose my light a mile or two from home. My headlight has been up and beaming for a bit now, and I recently got a taillight wired up. It’s a dream for me. I had Lauren’s bike built with a Shutter Precision dynamo, and it’s been fantastic so far. Her headlight is always on, which takes a lot of stress out of winter riding. With our dynamo lights, we’ve been able to squeeze in an extra ride or two each week.

I ordered a front rack a few months ago and finally committed two hours to get it mounted and the light moved and wired up. I love the blue color and feel lucky with how well it matches the other anodized parts. This is the first front rack I’ve ever had on a bike. 

The picture outside June Coffee is with my buddy Mat. He was one of the first people who got me into cycling.

This is the first time Lauren has really put miles on a bike. We have been dialing in her fit little by little. She rode my Brooks Cambium for a minute. I let her try the Berthoud for a bit, and it’s permanent home is the Stumpjumper now. 

Most of the pictures were taken in and around St. Louis, but a few are from East Tennessee and Birmingham, AL.

I love bikes, and I’m just a big bike dork. Thanks for reading.

1hkshas,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1hkshas/231224/,23/12/24,"It’s Christmas time so it’s family time and my family is such a nightmare to deal with. The easiest person to get on with is my dad and he’s an alcoholic with anger issues who can hardly engage in a conversation if it’s not about engineering. My brother who I actually like is too depressed to talk or see me even though he lives 20 minutes away. We don’t talk to any of our extended family because my parents either pushed them all away or never bother to contact them

My mum fills me with genuine disgust. Of course she could be worse but I think I’ve developed a trauma response to her whole existence due to what she did in my childhood. She quit drinking cold turkey when she got arrested and I can respect and appreciate that but that’s about it. She still smokes like a chimney and the house stinks of it yet she criticises me for anything unhealthy or a ‘waste of money’.

The sound of her voice immediately puts me in a state of unease and irritation and the things she says are even worse. I’ve never met anyone who was literally constantly negative, you cant say anything to her without her getting aggressive. This morning I asked where the new bag of coffee was and she said “It’s in the fucking shopping bag, obviously!!” When it’s all of us together it’s really apparent, everyone is talking normally and she’s just there always chipping in with something negative with a loud bitter voice. She complains that we don’t help her around the house and she’s right, it’s because she’ll always complain about what we’re doing and start shouting even though there’s no argument. If she just said “could you wash the dishes today? we should also figure out a schedule” then I genuinely would 100% do it. But when it’s “who’s going to fucking wash up? why do I always do everything?” I can’t help but retreat from the situation

My biggest fear is that I’ll turn out like her

My sister is stereotypically bipolar, probably not clinical bipolar disorder, it’s just that every time she enters the room you don’t know if she’ll completely ignore you no matter what you say to her or if she’ll give you a huge hug and goof around or whatever. She constantly victimises herself, the worst example of this was when she lied to her best friend that her and ME were pimped out by our father when we were CHILDREN. She also maintains this claim that from ages 8-12ish I physically bullied/abused her and no one else in the world remembers this because no one cared about her.

She was in a year long relationship with some weird guy who apparently was horrible to her and verbally abused her but she would never show me the messages. She broke up with him finally but wouldn’t block him and enjoyed how he would constantly blow up her phone. Today she came into my room crying because she got back with him but doesn’t want to and expected me to support her but after she refused to take my advice, break up block him, I told her to fuck off. I get that abusive relationships can be complex but she’s not financially dependent on him, she’s not threatened by him, they have zero mutual relationships, she just wants to be a victim. 

I hold this victim mindset too but I judge her for her actions. When we were children we WERE victims but everyone, counsellors, police, family, friends, teachers were so scared of saying the wrong thing to us and making us feel different or flawed, they just pretended we weren’t going through anything. I think this made us internally go “hey!! I’ve been victimised by something!” But our child brains didn’t quite understand what so we make things up. ",2,1734974229.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

I previously owned other watches but it wasn’t anything “serious”.

1. First entry was de Moonswatch. I really love the Omega Speedy but is far from my budget (even more when I bought de swatch), so when they released this collection it was an obvious buy.

2. My most precious watch, the Tissot PRX. Bought it as a gift to myself for my engagement, and I engraved it with my wedding date. Love this watch for its looks and its meaning.

3. Micro-brand Brew Retro. As a coffee lover myself, the brew retro had something I loved from the first moment I saw it. Some time later, I finally made the commitment and my mother chipped in a couple bucks as a wedding gift!

4. Seiko. Bought it on the honeymoon so it also marks a really special moment! First diver added to the collection and one with the most wrist time.

5. Casio World Timer. It was a Christmas gift from the wife! Live the watch and the Vario band I bought for it, really levels it up!

6. The Hamilton is the last addition to the family, I’ve wanted this watch for a couple years now and finally had the opportunity to get it! It’s pre-owned from one of my best-buds and since he is also upgrading his collection, gave me a special price.

Next in sight is my first really “luxury” watch, the BB58! I want to mark with a watch the birth of every children I have in the future, so since the first one is already in plans, I’m already saving up for this piece!

Hi everyone, I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has had a similar experience in early pregnancy and how it turned out!! I'm currently 6w+4, we found out we were pregnant 2 weeks ago on Wednesday. I ended up with BV around the time I tested positive, apparently the hormones messed up my bacterial biome. I did topical flagyl and after day 3 (Friday 12/20, so I was 6w +1) I had strange clear with coffee-ground-ish discharge and a couple of strange pinkish-white ""chunks"" that resembled pregnancy tissue, around the size of black beans. I consulted with my OB and had an ultrasound that day due to concerns. However, when we did ultrasound we found the gestational sac and yolk sac intact and everything looked normal per the results. The ultrasound tech told me the baby was likely too small to see at that point. The plan is for me to repeat an ultrasound on Monday 12/30 and at that point I will be 7w+4, but I'm just terrified that we'll do the ultrasound and not see anything so I'm wanting to know if anyone has had a similar experience with an early ultrasound? How did it turn out? I'm currently experiencing all of the normal pregnancy symptoms and have had worsening nausea over the last couple weeks, still have VERY small amounts of this clear and coffee ground-ish discharge daily but all this time I have had no bleeding/anything resembling a period and no cramping.

This post is quite long so forgive me if it's not well structured as I'm trying to include the most important bits.

Situation: was dating a girl where marriage was discussed as the long term goal. Both 34 at the time. She made herself out to be this good girl where she refrained from doing anything intimate first two dates. I'd planned, organised and paid for activity based dates as she didn't like the standard coffee date. By the end of date two, she revealed she was asexual for the last 9 months and that sex other than conception was most likely off the table. 

She also asked me about my bodycount which I told her the honest answer and she found it a red flag but overlooked it because we had a connection. I was too invested and touched starved by then to walk away with nothing so I reluctantly agreed thinking that she's the type of girl who's mostly been in relationships. 

Later in the relationship: I started learning that she was a serial dater and that she'd used to hook up with so many other guys (majority much younger as well) which really eaten me up. It felt that, ""what do they have that I don't have"" sort of thing and I doubt they're all nice guys or legitimately good men. 

I used to get so many doubts in my head, question her about her past and felt a visceral rage of upset about being given the different treatment despite bending over backwards, simping, and making all the dutiful boyfriend effort in every capacity. She kept insisting I was good-looking and her type but I felt more like the safe guy than the truly desired man.

Mid relationship: we did eventually engage in sexual intimacy after visiting her home country after 3 months and eventhough it was a long wait, I felt it was at least a win thinking that her sexuality was truly regained. It was only then engaged every other month when we travelled together and stayed in a hotel (neither of us had our own place).

Towards the end: she became asexual with me again after and it got to the point where I'd take her out, we barely went dates without a kiss (she was extremely funny about PDA, including handholding).

It did create a strain in our relationship for a long time but then we eventually reconciled. She had some family and health issues which she needed me to be there for her but I felt this wasn't properly communicated with me, I had a bit of a sexual mishap which created a massive scare where she was so angry and I gave her space. This all accumulated into her being really cold and hostile towards me.

Even on the day of my birthday when she drove near my house to give me some gifts, she told me, ""I think we're both comprimising"" in regards to unmet needs. What really hit me hard was when I told her that I treat her well and her response was, ""being treated well isn't a prerequisite for sex. I'm not gonna have sex with you just because you treat me well"".

End of relationship: Eventually she had the breakup talk with me where we'd then argued, tried to reach a mutual understanding etc etc. I thought I could gracefully move on but even to this day the RJ still kills me. That other guys got to enjoy the hot girl experience for free whereas I made all the effort in the relationship and got the tame experience (she barely dressed up or did her hair for me).

Conclusion: I took this L hard (even my own gf is questioning why i stayed in such a relationship and did so much for her despite being treated like rubbish). I neither expect nor want the virgin, trad wife given my experiences but I would never go again for a girl with a promiscuous history as they're not relationship material (even if they're not bad people per se). I'm im a new relationship now with someone who's been with a lot of men but not casually sleep around and the result is she treats me so much better. Just tread at your own discretion, that's all I'll say. ",5,1734973852.0,retroactivejealousy,4,1.0,False

1hksabf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hksabf/stimulant_side_effects/,Stimulant Side Effects?,"For the past four years, I have been taking Focalin along with Zyn pouches and Coffee every morning together. The combined effects were beyond euphoric, but left me feeling jittery and anxious when the effects wore off everyday. This led to me having the need to do cardio twice a day before having the ability to even start what I needed to do for said day.

Recently I had a baby girl, and this made me reduce my stimulant intake ultimately to only my Focalin 20mg and the occasional coffee. I stopped taking the Zyn (Nicotine) exactly 1 week ago (Yes I have cravings but will not cave in). I noticed when I was cutting back my stimulants, I switched from Focalin to vyvanse and i started experiencing brain fog at night when it wore off. I never had this issue before. Then I switched to Concerta, and the same issue persisted, but less apparent (Brain Fog). Finally, 3 days ago my doctor put me back on Focalin because we theorized that my anxiety was due to the excessive nicotine ingestion, and we were right. No more anxiety or jitters.

So now I only take my 20mg Focalin XR in the morning, and I feel amazing for 4.5 hours. I am able to get everything done with the focus and precision I aim for. But after those 4 hours, my brain starts shutting down. For instance, yesterday I went to Walgreens to pick my child up some stuff as well as flu medication for the upcoming season. I walked into the store and I was walking around for 20 mins just looking for the things I came for, forgetting what I came for, and then repeating this process until I got back into my car. It has gotten slightly better in the past month, but it is still bothering me.

Any guesses as to what is going on? I am talking to my doctor about it this week, but I am just getting really annoyed with this brain fog. I have never had this issue with my focus, memory and overall cognitive abilities.

1hksa1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hksa1a/hf_charlies_long_walk_home/,[HF] Charlie’s Long Walk Home,"Charlie Daniels came home from Vietnam in the fall of 1971. The first thing he noticed was how quiet it was. No whir of helicopters, no gunfire cracking through the air, no shouted orders echoing through jungle thickets. The silence should have been comforting, but instead, it pressed down on him like a weight.

He stepped off the plane, duffel bag slung over one shoulder, wearing a uniform that didn’t fit quite right anymore. His mother was there, crying and hugging him, but he barely felt her embrace. The war had hollowed him out, left parts of him behind in the rice paddies and the humid jungles. The boy who’d left home at 19, full of fire and patriotism, didn’t exist anymore. What came back was a man haunted by memories he couldn’t shake.

At first, he tried to settle into the rhythm of normal life. His father got him a job at the auto shop, where the smell of oil and grease felt familiar in a way the rest of the world didn’t. But the loud clang of metal on metal reminded him of explosions, and the buzzing of power tools was too much like the sound of helicopter blades. He lasted six months before he quit.

The nights were the worst. He’d lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, the weight of his horrible memories pressing down on him. When he did sleep, the dreams came—dreams of firefights, of friends who didn’t make it, of the wide, staring eyes of a young Vietnamese boy he’d shot during a raid. “It’s us or them,” his sergeant had said, but that didn’t make it any easier.

He started drinking. At first, it was just to get through the nights, but soon, it bled into his days. A six-pack turned into a case, then into bottles of whiskey he hid around the house. His mother worried, his father grew distant, and the few friends he’d had before the war stopped calling. He didn’t blame them. He wasn’t very good company.

By the time Charlie turned 30, he was living alone in a tiny apartment above a laundromat. He got by on odd jobs—painting houses, fixing cars, loading trucks at the docks. He didn’t stay anywhere long. People would ask too many questions, and Charlie never had answers. What did you do in the war? Did you kill anyone? Are you okay?

No, he wasn’t okay. He hadn’t been in years

In 1983, he met Linda at a bar. She was a waitress, younger than him by a decade, with a quick laugh and tired eyes. She wasn’t put off by his silence or the way he flinched when someone slammed a door too hard. They started spending time together, and for the first time in years, Charlie felt something close to hope.

They got married in the spring of 1984. It was a simple ceremony at the courthouse, just the two of them and the judge. Linda didn’t care about flowers or a big reception; she just wanted Charlie to be happy.

For a while, he was.

They bought a little house on the edge of town. Linda worked at a diner, and Charlie found steady work at a hardware store. He liked the routine, the way he could lose himself in the simple tasks of stocking shelves and helping customers. He even started going to the VA, where he met other vets who understood what he was going through.

But the past had a way of sneaking up on him. Some nights, he’d wake up screaming, the sound of gunfire still ringing in his ears. Other nights, he’d sit in the dark, smoking cigarettes and staring at the wall, lost in memories he couldn’t shake.

Linda tried to help, but there were parts of Charlie she could never reach.

In 1992, their first child was born—a boy they named Tommy. Holding his son in his arms for the first time, Charlie felt a surge of love so strong it terrified him. He promised himself he’d be a good father, that he’d give Tommy the life he never had.

But promises were hard to keep.

By the time Tommy was five, Charlie’s drinking was out of control again. Linda threatened to leave more than once, but she always stayed. She loved him, even when it hurt.

One night, after a particularly bad fight, Charlie packed a bag and left. He spent a week sleeping in his truck, parked near the river, drinking himself into oblivion. When he finally came home, Linda was waiting. She didn’t yell or cry. She just looked at him and said, “You need help, Charlie. If not for me, then for Tommy.”

He started going to therapy after that. It wasn’t easy, but it helped. He learned to talk about the war, about the things he’d seen and done. He learned to forgive himself, little by little.

The years went by. Tommy grew up, and Charlie tried to be the father he’d always wanted to be. He taught his son how to fish, how to change a tire, how to throw a curveball. He was still a quiet man, still haunted by the past, but he was there.

By the time Charlie turned 60, his body was starting to betray him. The years of hard labor and heavy drinking had taken their toll. His hands shook, his knees ached, and his lungs flared in pain with every breath. He spent most of his days sitting on the porch, watching the world go by.

Tommy, now a grown man with a family of his own, came to visit often. He’d sit with Charlie on the porch, drinking coffee and talking about everything and nothing. Sometimes, they’d sit in silence, and that was okay too.

On a cool October morning in 2015, Charlie woke up feeling lighter than he had in years. The weight he’d carried for so long was gone, and for the first time, he felt at peace. He sat on the porch, sipping his coffee and watching the leaves fall from the trees.

When Linda came out to join him, she found him slumped in his chair, his coffee cup still in his hand. His eyes were closed, and there was a faint smile on his lips.

Charlie Daniels had walked a long, hard road, but in the end, he found his way home.

1hks9tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1hks9tw/leprosy/,Leprosy,"Don’t know where else to post this. This sub seems educated yet relaxed enough for a sort of off topic yet still medical post.

I’m reading the memoir “Papillon” by Henri Charriere, who was wrongfully charged escaped prison in 1945.

In one scene, he describes meeting lepers on an island, and described one: “his nose was completely eaten away, flesh and bone; there was only a hole in the middle of his face.”

He then goes on to describe how when the man was handing him a bowl of coffee, one of his fingers fell off and stuck to the bowl.

The man describes himself as having “dry leprosy” and says he’s not contagious.

Now, could this be accurate, or was the author fabricating details for drama? I didn’t think people with leprosy actually lost fingers - isn’t it just damaged tissue?

It seems I have made a grave mistake. My girlfriend has a full list of about 30 items for Christmas, and I waited until yesterday to order something. It will not be coming until after Christmas.

I partially did this out of being salty and partially because we have been super busy. We have been on a two-week straight vacation, mixed in with one day at home between, and then I went to Atlanta to visit a friend and returned last night. I have been super busy, so has she, and I just have not had time to focus on getting a gift.

Additionally, I have been a little frustrated with her gift-giving process with me. In the past, she has gotten mad at me for not taking holidays seriously. For example, the first year we were dating, I did not have anything fully planned for Valentine's Day (3 days before) so she didn't think I would have anything planned by the day of Vday and she went off on me for not taking it seriously. There have been other moments like this, and they have caused me to overcompensate for every gift-giving holiday that comes up now. For her birthday, I always buy her way more gifts than anyone else. For the past Christmas, I got her a bunch of gifts, when her parents only got her one or two.

The reason I am frustrated is because my birthday was about a month ago and she didn't get me any presents. Nothing. Usually, I don't care at all about presents, but since she has created this unneeded stress for me about presents, I felt like I was being played when she didn't get me any in return. About 3 weeks after my birthday, she got me this coffee mug... something I did not need at all and will probably just end up being a gift she uses more than me. I was appreciative that she got me something and I didn't complain about it but it just kinda felt like she didn't put in any effort into getting something I needed. And I have no clue if she getting me a Christmas gift, because of this precedent she set.

Therefore, I held off on getting a present and didn't take it seriously. I was frustrated with how she made this 30-item long Christmas list when I didn't feel like I was being treated the same way. I know it was immature to act like this, but I feel like it was valid... idk. I ended up ordering the gift today from her list and it says it won't come till the 29th. AITA for this? Additionally, when I was in NYC last week, I bought her some nice/expensive earmuffs since she's been asking for earmuffs, as well as a nice Christmas candle. I feel like I have done my job at showing I care, but she feels different. When I told her that I was sorry and her gift might be a few days late, she started going off on me about how I didn't take her priorities seriously. She specifically said this

""The first time you spend Christmas with my family and you can't even care enough to make sure you have something on time""

The morning sunlight crept through the blinds, casting soft golden streaks across the shared bedroom. Tyler woke up first, his eyes drifting to the small, curly head of his little brother peeking out from beneath the covers. Caleb was still fast asleep, his tiny body curled around Rudy, the beloved reindeer stuffed animal he took everywhere.

A playful grin spread across Tyler’s face. He tiptoed over to Caleb’s bed and gently kissed his brother on the top of his head. Caleb stirred slightly but didn’t wake. Tyler carefully pried Rudy from Caleb’s arms and held the stuffed reindeer like a prized treasure.

“Let’s see how this plays out,” Tyler whispered to himself as he hid Rudy behind a stack of books on the nearby shelf.

Caleb began to stir minutes later, his curls bouncing as he sat up groggily and rubbed his eyes. Tyler was already sitting at the edge of his own bed, trying his best to look innocent, but the smirk tugging at his lips gave him away.

“Morning, squirt,” Tyler said cheerfully.

“Morning, Ty,” Caleb mumbled, stretching his arms before instinctively patting the spot next to him. His sleepy movements stopped as his hands searched the bed. His eyes widened, and he turned to Tyler with a mix of confusion and alarm.

“Ty! Rudy’s gone!” Caleb exclaimed, his voice high-pitched with worry.

Tyler feigned surprise, putting a hand to his chin. “What? Rudy’s missing? Are you sure you didn’t drop him in your sleep?”

Caleb scrambled out of bed, his little feet padding against the wooden floor. “I didn’t drop him! He was right here! He’s always here!”

“Well,” Tyler said, standing up dramatically, “this sounds like a job for the Great Detective Duo. I’ll help you look for him!”

Caleb’s panic shifted to determination as he nodded vigorously. “Okay, we have to find him. Rudy can’t just disappear!”

The two brothers began their search. Tyler “searched” under the bed, opening a drawer and peeking inside with an exaggerated expression of effort. Caleb, meanwhile, was frantically checking every corner of the room, flipping through blankets and pillows.

“Maybe he went on an adventure,” Tyler suggested slyly, watching Caleb search with single-minded focus.

“But Rudy can’t go anywhere without me,” Caleb replied seriously, his brow furrowed.

Tyler crouched beside Caleb, putting a hand on his shoulder. “You’re right. Rudy would never leave without telling you. Which means... someone must have hidden him!”

Caleb gasped. “A sneaky bad guy?”

“Or…” Tyler paused for dramatic effect, “... maybe a big brother who wanted to see your detective skills.”

Caleb blinked at him, realization dawning in his wide brown eyes. “Ty! Did you take Rudy?”

“Guilty as charged,” Tyler admitted with a grin, reaching behind the stack of books to reveal Rudy, safe and sound. He handed the stuffed reindeer back to Caleb, whose face shifted from frustration to relief as he clutched Rudy tightly.

“Tyler!” Caleb scolded, his tone a mix of annoyance and gratitude. “You scared me!”

“I just wanted to see how good you are at finding stuff,” Tyler said, ruffling Caleb’s curls. “And you did great! You’re like a super sleuth.”

Caleb looked down at Rudy, then back up at Tyler. His lips quirked into a small smile. “I guess I am pretty good at finding stuff. But don’t do that again!”

“Promise,” Tyler said, holding up a hand. “Now, how about we go grab some breakfast? Detective work makes me hungry.”

“Okay,” Caleb agreed, hopping off the bed with Rudy still clutched tightly in his arms.

As they headed downstairs together, Caleb couldn’t help but think that even if Tyler was a little bit of a troublemaker, he was the best big brother a kid could have. And Tyler? He knew that moments like these were what being a big brother was all about.



**The Pancake Pact**



Tyler and Caleb raced down the stairs, Caleb clutching Rudy like a victorious trophy. Their mom was already in the kitchen, flipping pancakes on the griddle. The smell of sizzling butter and maple syrup filled the air, making Caleb's tummy growl loudly.

“Good morning, my little detectives,” Mom said with a smile, glancing over her shoulder. “What’s all the commotion?”

“Tyler hid Rudy!” Caleb exclaimed, holding up his stuffed reindeer for emphasis. “But I found him! I’m a super sleuth!”

“Oh, is that so?” Mom asked, raising an eyebrow at Tyler.

Tyler shrugged innocently. “I was just testing his skills. He passed with flying colors.”

Mom chuckled, shaking her head as she flipped a golden pancake onto a plate. “Well, I hope you’re both hungry because I made extra pancakes this morning.”

Caleb’s eyes lit up. “Can we have whipped cream and chocolate chips?”

Mom nodded. “Only if you two set the table first.”

“Deal!” Tyler said, grabbing plates from the cupboard. Caleb followed, carefully balancing forks and napkins in one hand while holding Rudy with the other.

As they ate, Caleb chattered on about how he had searched the whole room and solved the case of the missing Rudy. Tyler listened, grinning at his brother’s animated storytelling.

“You know,” Tyler said between bites, “if we were real detectives, we’d need a clubhouse. Somewhere we could keep all our top-secret stuff.”

Caleb’s eyes widened. “Like our treehouse?”

“Exactly!” Tyler nodded. “We could call it… The Detective Lair!”

Caleb bounced in his seat with excitement. “And we could put a sign that says, ‘No bad guys allowed!’”

“And a secret code to get in,” Tyler added.

Mom, overhearing their conversation, smiled as she poured herself a cup of coffee. “You know,” she said, “your dad’s been talking about fixing up the old treehouse in the backyard. Maybe you two could help him this weekend.”

“Really?” Caleb and Tyler said in unison, their faces lighting up.

“Really,” Mom confirmed. “But you’ll have to work together—and no hiding Rudy during the project,” she added, giving Tyler a playful look.

Tyler laughed, holding up his hands. “Promise.”

Later that day, after breakfast, the boys ran out to the backyard to inspect the treehouse. It was nestled high in the sturdy branches of the oak tree, still standing strong.

“This is perfect,” Caleb whispered, clutching Rudy tightly.

As they stood beneath the tree, planning their renovations, Tyler couldn’t help but ruffle Caleb’s curls again. “You know, squirt, you’re not just my little brother. You’re my partner in crime—and now, my partner in solving mysteries.”

Caleb beamed up at him. “And you’re the best big brother ever, even when you’re a sneaky bad guy.”

The new year brings with it a chance to start fresh, and that includes your career! Make 2025 a banner year for your career with these 10 resolutions that will help you on your journey to success.

For many, the new year brings a sense of optimism and a chance to start over with a clean slate. But we all know how easy it is for those New Year's resolutions to be a distant memory in just a short time. The key is to take those large-scale ambitions and break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. If “New Year, New Job” is on your list of resolutions, you’ll need a solid plan to put those positive feelings into action and make 2025 the year to move forward in your career. In this article, we’ll help you do that with 10 new year’s job resolutions. 

**1. Make your online time work for you**

# 💡Expert Tip

Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media, schedule “productive online time” each day.

 An important New Year's resolution for job seekers is to look at your internet habits. Are you being productive or wasteful with your time online? Try auditing your internet usage and replacing some of that time with career-focused activities to help you meet your career goals.

Your scheduled “productive time” might include:

* LinkedIn research and networking
* finding opportunities to learn new skills. 
* Curate your “following list” to include industry leaders, areas of interest, or sources of industry information.
* Clean up your own online presence to ensure it fits in with your personal brand to “reinvent yourself” professionally.

No one’s saying you can't ever scroll TikTok again, but make sure you spend some time each day using the internet to support your career goals.

**2. Build up your skill set**

# 💡Expert Tip

Instead of just saying, “I need to develop new skills,” resolve each month to find at least one new class, online course, or industry-relevant certifications you can earn to broaden your skill set.

The “new year, new career” attitude might begin with gathering new skills! A new year is the perfect time to assess your existing skill set, especially the ones we call “transferable skills.” Transferable skills are qualities or skills you have, like organizational skills or problem-solving abilities, which are relevant and useful no matter what role you’re in. After doing this, you may notice some gaps in your knowledge, such as specific skills, technologies, or abilities listed on job descriptions that you just don’t have. To move your career forward, make a resolution to start your professional development.

It doesn’t have to be overly time-consuming or expensive. Formal online courses and certifications are great things to pursue, but even just familiarizing yourself with a subject through webinars or YouTube tutorials can go a long way toward closing those skill gaps. If you can, find a personal project or volunteer role that can show off your new skills in a tangible manner. Your professional development will bolster your resume and show employers that you are committed to building and improving your skills—always a good thing!

**3. Grow your network**

# 💡Expert Tip

Instead of setting a resolution like “I want to have 150 more LinkedIn connections this year,” try goals like “I want to build relationships with at least five people in Company X”, or “I really want to increase my presence as an expert in the \_\_\_\_\_ industry.”

A critical professional New Year's resolution for your career is to build out your network. Yes, we’re constantly talking about networking. But there’s a good reason for that: it’s important! Not only does effective networking build your chances of finding a “non-listed” job, but it also gives you a support system as you transition into a new role, even if you are an introvert. But adding people to your LinkedIn network isn’t enough (although it's a great start). You should be smarter and more targeted with your networking. So what does networking look like?

* Re-establishing contact with former co-workers
* Interacting positively with colleagues at your current job
* Volunteering with local organizations
* Becoming a member of industry organizations
* Attending networking events, career fairs, or industry meet-ups
* Finding industry-relevant online groups
* Making connections with recruiters

By focusing on networking quality, and being specific in your efforts, you can have more energy and time to focus on really building relationships, which will pay off in the long run. 

**4. Get back into your community**

# 💡Expert Tip

Instead of spending all your time focused on finding a new job, take some time in your busy schedule to volunteer with local projects or organizations.

Not only is it a great networking opportunity, but volunteering or getting involved in local projects or organizations will help you reconnect with the things you value most. As a result, you’ll have a better understanding of what makes you happier at work and will be able to target jobs that will meet those requirements. Not only will you be helping others, volunteering helps by:

* Getting experience in a new area or “trying on” a new career
* Developing new skills
* Keeping your motivated
* Learning about new industries/fields
* Improving your physical and mental health

If you’re struggling to understand your identity outside of work, or aren’t sure where to start, try volunteering for a role that uses some skills you already possess. For example, if you work in finance and accounting, there’s probably a local organization in your community that could use some help managing their finances. Whatever you do, volunteering shows your passion for your community and your resolve to stay active. Both are very appealing to employers and can help you land your next job.

**5. Find a mentor**

# 💡Expert Tip

Don’t go it alone. Resolve to spend time each day cultivating professional relationships and identifying someone to act as your mentor. Once they’ve agreed, set up a regular schedule of meetings and “check ins” to get the most out of your relationship.

Finding a mentor can help you meet your career goals, since they’re a person in a similar career as you who has more experience and helpful information to share. They differ from a career coach in that they’re not paid for their services, but choose to be mentors because they want to help others in moving their career forward. A mentor is someone who can be objective about your progress in a way that your friends and loved ones can’t. It’s important to seek out their advice and absorb as much of their knowledge as you can.

Start by identifying someone you can learn from, and forge a relationship with them. Ideally, this is someone in your field who is a few years ahead of you and has established a career that you admire. Make sure when approaching someone to be your mentor you express enthusiasm and communicate your goals for the relationship. Then, set up regular times to connect, whether it’s a phone call, meeting for coffee, or a formal mentorship session. Don’t be disappointed if the person says no; people get busy and they may not feel they can give you the attention you deserve. Just keep trying!

**6. Update your resume**

# 💡Expert Tip

Don’t just tweak your old resume: start from scratch. Consider using career.io’s [Resume Builder](https://career.io/resume-builder), which will help you create an effective resume quickly and easily.

If you’re looking for New Year resolution ideas for work, the simplest of them all: bring your resume up-to-date. It’s probably been a while since you’ve updated your resume. That’s okay; it’s why it’s on our list of resolutions. But don't just slap some new information on there. Take some time to reflect on your new skills, accomplishments, and goals. This doesn’t have to be done in one day, so set aside a block of time each day to spend on it. To update your resume:

* Make sure it has the appropriate sections, such as the current contact information, professional summary, work history, and education.
* Remove any outdated or irrelevant information.
* Provide quantifiable data to back up your accomplishments, when possible.
* Add any new degrees, certifications, or skills.
* Make sure to tailor each new version of your resume to the job you’re applying for, including keywords from the job description.
* Choose the best [resume format](https://career.io/career-advice/types-of-resumes) for your situation.
* Make sure your resume is [ATS-optimized.](https://career.io/career-advice/how-to-make-an-ats-friendly-resume)
* Have someone else proofread your resume for typos.

# 7. Make sure your social media accounts are employer-friendly

# Hiring managers these days don’t just look at your resume; they’ll be checking out your social media accounts as well. Up to 74 percent of hiring managers check out a candidate’s social media presence to see if they’re a good fit for the position. But this doesn’t mean you have to become a corporate robot; you just have to curate your accounts carefully. To stay “job ready,” take the following steps to keep your social media from derailing your new career:

* Make your social media accounts private.
* Deactivate old, unused accounts. You can live without that “My Space” profile.
* Curate your profile photos and make sure they’re “employer friendly.”
* Create a custom URL for your LinkedIn account.
* Post or share articles, photos, or links that are industry-related.
* Follow companies or thought leaders in your field.

**8. Establish a personal brand**

# 💡Expert Tip

Choose to market yourself as a desirable, hireable professional. Create a list of your goals, values, interests, talents, and what makes you unique, which is the core of your personal brand and make it a part of your day-to-day work.

When you think “personal brand,” you might picture a social media influencer. But that’s not necessarily the case. Developing your personal brand can set you apart from the crowd by defining what makes you unique and the professional qualities you embody—going above and beyond your resume by demonstrating “in real life” why you’d be a great hire. 

To do this, make a resolution to take the time to map out your personal brand. Start by defining your brand by identifying what makes you unique, your values, and what you bring to a position. Then, take the following steps to put your brand into action:

* Find companies that align with your personal brand, and reach out and let them know how you can solve their issues.
* Make connections with colleagues and other people in your network who share your goals.
* Use the same photo across all your social media accounts.
* Create and post original content to your social media accounts that support your personal brand and position you as an industry “person to watch.”
* Consider creating an online portfolio to showcase your accomplishments and examples of your work.

**9. Organize your home workspace**

# 💡Expert Tip

If your home office is a bit cluttered, spend 15 minutes each day organizing one aspect of it, such as cleaning your desk or tossing out old pens that no longer have ink.

If your home workspace is a bit untidy, get rid of anything that doesn’t support your career success. This includes tossing out old papers you don’t need, or even buying yourself a new chair. Other things you can do include:

* Go through your files and shred anything you no longer need.
* Delete unneeded files from your computer (or copy to a flash drive)
* Clean your screen and your mouse.
* Keep only the personal items that “speak to you.”
* Separate your personal documents from your work documents.
* Invest in some organizational supplies such as pen holders, file dividers, or an in-box.
* If your computer system is still wired, tie up any loose or dangling cords.

Having a clean and orderly workplace will boost your confidence and ensure you have all the documents you need right at your fingertips—a great way to start 2025!

**10. Practice your interview skills**

# 💡Expert Tip

Ask a friend to help you practice your interviewing skills by conducting a mock interview so you can sharpen your skills. Consider recording the session so you can identify where you need a little help.

Interviewing skills are an area where most of us could use a little improvement. But don’t throw up your hands and say, “Oh, well!” Resolve to do something about it. You can become a more effective interviewee with a little time and effort. To practice your interview skills, try the following:

* Choose what you want to focus on in that practice session.
* Make a list of questions that have tripped you up in the past. Consider this list of [common interview questions](https://career.io/career-advice/questions-you-will-hear-in-your-next-job-interview) to get you started.
* Find someone to act as the “interviewer.”
* Go through a mock interview from start to finish.
* Listen and absorb constructive feedback.

If you don’t have anyone to help you practice your interviewing skills, don’t stress. You can [use AI](https://career.io/interview-prep?ga_utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=20381045486&utm_adgroup=USA-interview-prep&utm_custom=Career.io%7CUS%7CPS%7CNB%7CInterviewPrep&utm_content=711105471095&utm_term=ai%20interview&matchtype=p&device=c&location=9021610&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiApNW6BhD5ARIsACmEbkXsITTf9y37YmrzYQHeY-SQbIH8cuyI_r-lpugHpfCdSYBlY5TaCDkaApM0EALw_wcB) as an interview partner, or even practice by yourself. Regardless of how you do it, setting some time aside regularly will help you build your confidence, strengthen your brand, and get feedback, all at one time! A resolution worth keeping.

This mushroom deserves respect and understanding. I love this mushroom beyond its effects. ,"Decarbed Amanita Muscaria 15 grams using the lemon juice simmer method and macro-dosed with my gf. And we had complete different experiences from each other. (Beautiful nonetheless)

So I’ve done large amounts of research regarding Amanita muscaria and how to convert the Ibotenic acid into muscimol. I have lived in the forest and picked my own as well but didn’t have the confidence to start experimenting since chemistry was intimidating to me at that time. But since then, I have done far more research and and actually kept the samples of the fly agaric air tight in a jar after 2 and half years of sitting around. I finally worked up the confidence to make my brew after I ordered a different batch of closed caps online from the Nordic region. I did use the ones I ordered as well as the local ones I picked here in Arizona. (They were all high potency either way but I wanted to blend different batches for a full spectrum result)

This amazing teacher exceeded my expectations overall. 

(I did not have proper equipment as far as a PH meter or properly measuring out my volume of water to material ratio) but still ended up with fantastic results. 

1. First I grind up my mushrooms into a fine powder, make sure they have about 1% - 4% moisture content, you want them very dry but not stale.

2. I add about half a gallon of water to a large steel pot and bring it to a boil, once it hits a boil, bring it to a low simmer and stir in generous amounts of lemon juice, I went out of my way to freshly squeeze the lemons myself using a citrus juicer, I’ve found fresh lemon juice to be the best option due to high vitamin c content and flavor. I used a minimal of 4-5 whole lemons fully juiced. (Sorry I don’t have accurate measurements) 

3. I add the 15 grams of mushroom material immediately after adding lemon juice and stir it up well and cover it. Then let it simmer on low for 1 hour and a half to 3 hours max. ( you can inhale the steam for an intoxicating effect, pretty interesting) make sure the lid remains closed. The longer you let it simmer, the more muscimol you’ll have to ibotinic acid, but it’s a different experience depending on what ratio you decide to go with. I personally did 1 hour and a half and that worked great with the very potent batch I used.

4. After your time is up, let the brew cool down until it’s no longer steaming anymore (to allow the conversion to finish properly for better product) then strain the material using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth or coffee filter. Squeeze and drain the remaining liquid from the material. Id store the leftover product in a glass bottle or jar in the refrigerator. (Dont leave in UV light)


While still luke warm, I pour my girlfriend and myself about 10oz - 12oz cups of the fluid and we drank it. Shortly after I began to feel the effects, roughly 15 to 20 minutes after drinking it. (It doesn’t take long) 
I remember I started feeling like I was slowly melting. I felt an intense body sensation that separated my mind from my body that I have never felt before. I quickly experienced loss of balance, a sense of contentment, and an extreme body high with waves flowing through me. My mind felt as if it entered into a deeper, newer state of mind, despite being borderline delirious. I felt like I was moving in slow motion, as well as time slowing down as well. This is about 45 mins into the experience and I decided to use some ceremonial cacao along with a prayer, but my girlfriend did not take part in the prayer for she was dealing with the “come-up” We both took our dose of healing chocolate and strangely enough, we ended up having 2 entirely different experiences from one another, despite both of us having taken the same dose. I began dancing and singing and feeling a sense of childlike excitement (keep in mind that it was 11:30 pm at night) and here I am amazed at the void I am submerged in. You can quite literally shut your eyes and drift off to another dimension on command. I felt a sense of power from the experience, a feeling of internal love and abundance. They spoke to me in ways I’ll still never understand. 

My girlfriend on the other hand, she had a completely different experience. For the majority of the entire night, she was pretty much a zombie that could barely move.
In fact she was wide awake and conscious but appeared to be asleep. She could not make a single coherent thought. Eventually admitted that she did not vibe with the experience, for it was “too numbing and sedating” for her liking. As I am someone who enjoys being couch locked, this makes sense that I was able to utilize this amazing experience and have a blast while doing it. While she struggled to stay conscious (understandably so) I was in the amanita realms. I did experience visuals to an extent, like your vision being consumed by whatever you focus on, the world looked more 3D. I was slurring my worlds and stumbling around. My girlfriend fell asleep before me. And I decided to give up myself and instantly fell into the deepest rest I’ve probably ever had. We both woke up still slightly feeling its effects the next morning. What I would describe as an (after glow) she would describe as a “hangover or brainfog” I woke up feeling euphoric with no negative effect on my energy or mood. It was definitely far more intense than I was expecting. But it’s a lot easier to navigate a high dose with amanita muscaria than it is with psilocybin mushrooms. The experience with amanita is much more physically stimulating than it is mentally stimulating, which I personally enjoy. Thanks for taking time to read my experience with this beautiful mushroom! 

This mushroom is my absolute favorite. I’ve grown to understand and respect this mushroom. I did learn about this mushroom by encountering it in the wild during my forages. I feel as if I earned its respect before indulging in it. Don’t fear this mushroom but respect this mushroom! I know this is somewhat of a “trip report” so I’ll go ahead and express that you should go out and forage some. ",16,1734972833.0,herbalism,8,0.9,False

So, I'm kinda getting into my mid 40's and started my life on all sorts of sports bikes in the early noughties. Took some time off (you know life getting in the way) and 18 months ago bought a loaded MT07 for sh\*ts n giggles (ie learn wheelies, which I never did....grrr). It's the perfect bike for my needs so far as I just ride local B-road around SE when I can on sunny weekends. I avoid larger roads as it gets a bit wheezy. I also didn't want to sink too much ££ into a bike I would use a dozen or so times a year.  However, things have now changed and realising my perpetual mid-life crisis I'm eager to try something new! Conversely, as I don't do more than 2k miles a year I would love each of those miles to be an event and count for my time on 2 wheels.

So, I have a shortlist (which is a bit all over the place) but if there's anything you can give me more insight on, I would love to hear from you.

**Ducati - 1299 Panigale/ 1200 Monster/ Diavel -**

I guess they would both feel pretty special  in ownership and just as much as riding them I would love to open my garage to one or sit having coffee admiring the sight of one. Yep, superficial I know but we all like to be in the company of something that turns heads. I've ridden a first gen Diavel and loved it, so was thinking maybe an X-Diavel? However, seeing I want to do at least a couple of TDs this year probably a 1299 would be better bet. Trouble is, given the crap state of the roads and all the traffic in SE would I be cursing this? Also are they that much ££ to maintain?!

  
**KTM - 1290SDR or 890/990 R -**

I've just got to try these for all the stonking performance I hear about them. Biggest turn-off is of course the KTM reliability woes. Is it worth the risk or would I be inviting problems into my life? P&H nearby me have closed down so not much support if it goes kapputt.

  
**Honda - CB1000 Hornet -**

Rave reviews so far and a lot of bang for the buck and BREAND NEW. Or should I wait it out and get a tried and tested s/hand bike with a bit of bling?

  
**Suzuki GSX- 1000S -** 

I'm drawn to this streetfighter since meeting a guy with one at a TD at Cadwell last year. Any experience? A lot of bang for the buck.

  
**Yamaha - MT09SP or MT10 -**

I've extensively ridded a Gen 3 MT09 and loved it, but hard to get over it being ugly sin so the enjoyment will be more in riding it. Test ridden a 2024 MT10 and what lovely engine, but felt a bit too firm for the roads.



**Triumph - Rocket 3R! -**

I know this is going to be at least £13k s/hand. But as a leftfield choice it will be an event to go and ride it each time. It will also be a very different experience in riding and ownership. However, will I soon tire of its immenseness? But then again, if not now... when ? May be too old for the size in a few years.

  
So if you currently own or have owned one of these bikes or have any other suggestions.... make my life easier to decide! ",0,1734972742.0,MotoUK,4,0.5,False

It was hard work and I was exhausted afterwards. Was I making a “living wage”? No, but it is was it is. 

With Seattle’s new minimum wage going into effect really soon, most food industry workers are finally reaching a level playing field. As a result, I’ll no longer be tipping more than 5-10%.

“DAD, WHERE’S MY FISH?!”

My hope for a pleasant and quiet morning just melted like Glosso in a tank with low light and no CO₂.

Where is that stupid betta? I’d just upgraded him to an 8-gallon aquarium to give him more space—why did he decide to explore outside the tank now? That was in September, and to this day, his disappearance remains a mystery.

What’s not a mystery is how I got hooked on aquascaping. It all started on a rainy Saturday night when my daughter asked for a fish to celebrate her 3rd birthday.

“Sure, that’s easy enough.”

So off I went to the store, picked up a betta, and grabbed one of those tiny ""betta tanks."" A few weeks later, staring at Mr. Fish cramped in that little tank started to bother me. His discomfort was obvious—at least to someone like me, a designer who spends 12 hours a day in what feels like a tiny human tank.

“Mr. Fish deserves better.”

https://preview.redd.it/sd2tvfahmm8e1.jpg?width=1516&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cbdbd4251be7a1910943a8e23a18531dc6a8158

Back to the fish store I went.

An 8-gallon tank? Sure. A filter? Why not. A heater and thermometer? Makes sense. Special food? Of course, everyone deserves a balanced diet. Fake plants and a decorative arch? Perfect.

“How much?!”

This fish was getting a bigger lifestyle upgrade than most people I know.

“Welcome to your new house, Mr. Fish. I hope you enjoy your new crib.”

But just two weeks later, Mr. Fish decided to pack his bags and move to that big farm upstate. I was left with an empty aquarium, a few fake plants, and a stupid arch.

That empty tank gnawed at me. I’d spent that much money, and now it just sat there, idling, teasing me. Every time I looked at it, I remembered the guy at the store warning me that temperature fluctuations could stress the fish. Maybe I was bitter because the outside thermometer displayed 36ºC (97ºF)—in fall.

Back to the fish store I went. Yes, I needed new fish for my tank. What kind? That shiny one, that orange one, and the one that looks like tiny sharks—definitely that one.

For a week, my aquarium was full of life again. Then both neon tetras decided to move to the Upstate New York Farm. That farm must be incredible, because the next week, my molly and yoyo loaches packed up too.

“Hey ChatGPT, all my fish are ‘moving away to a farm.’ What am I doing wrong? Water parameters? Hardness?”

Back to the store I went—plants, driftwood, every water test kit imaginable.

“How much?!”

This hobby was starting to get expensive. But now it was a matter of pride. I would either make this work or go bankrupt trying, because dad taught me never to be a quitter

Back home, I threw everything into the tank and waited. But by then, it was too late—YouTube had me pegged. It started suggesting aquascaping videos daily.

Then I learned about Amano.

A landscape photographer who transformed aquariums into living art? This wasn't just about keeping fish alive anymore—it was about creating underwater landscapes that told stories. Each carefully placed stone, each stem of plants swaying in the current, became part of a larger composition waiting to be captured through my lens.

My first aquascaped tank sits before me now. The rocks might not be perfectly positioned, and the golden ratio probably laughs at my attempts at composition. But when I look at it, I don't see the ghost of Mr. Fish or an expensive hobby gone wrong. I see my own slice of nature, a living photograph that changes every day. And maybe that's worth all those trips to the store.

Because sometimes the best stories start with a simple birthday wish and end with creating mountains underwater

She already had a solid following and occasional brand deals, but she kept hitting a ceiling. The bigger brands she wanted to work with wouldn't work with her because she was just a creator and not a ""business owner.""

She told me she formed an LLC so her online presence was actually a business. Suddenly, she was able to work with those same brands that had been hesitant were reaching out to her for brand deals. She ended up telling me that a CPA told her she can write off her ring light and coffee shop ""office"" meetings. She also got the benefit of separating her personal and business income.

Moral of the story, it’s incredibly valuable for content creators to have an LLC and separate their business and personal income and expenses. It only gets more complicated as your online presence grows. In this day and age, with all the ways people can make money online, many don’t realize how important these backend processes really are.

Think of it as the next big version of the internet, but instead of scrolling on a screen, you’re actually inside it, using virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR).

Here’s why the metaverse is exciting and why it might change how we use the internet:

1. A New Way to Meet People

In the metaverse, you don’t just text or call your friends—you can hang out with them in a virtual space. It’s like being in the same room, even if you’re miles apart.

Example: Imagine attending a virtual concert where you can dance with friends and meet new people, all from your living room.

2. You Can Create Anything

The metaverse isn’t just a place to visit—it’s a place where you can build. You can design your own home, start a shop, or create games for others to play.

Example: Someone could open a virtual clothing store and sell outfits for people’s avatars.

3. A Virtual Economy

In the metaverse, you can buy and sell things, just like in the real world. These could be clothes for your avatar, land for a virtual home, or tickets to an online event.

Example: You could own a virtual coffee shop and sell digital drinks that people can enjoy in the metaverse.

4. Learning and Working

The metaverse isn’t just for fun—it can be useful too. You could attend a class where you explore space or ancient history in 3D, or work in a virtual office with teammates from around the world.

Example: Instead of boring video calls, imagine brainstorming with coworkers in a virtual room that feels real.

5. Better Gaming Experiences

The metaverse takes gaming to a new level. You can carry your character and items from one game to another and explore games in a fully immersive way.

Example: Your character’s outfit in one game could be used in another, giving you more freedom to play how you want.

The Road Ahead

The metaverse is still new, and there’s a lot to improve. For example, not everyone has access to the tech needed, like VR headsets. Privacy and safety are also important, so we need to make sure it’s a secure space for everyone.

Why It Matters

The metaverse could change how we connect, create, and live online. It’s not just a game—it’s a new way to experience the internet, and everyone can be a part of it.",2,1734971434.0,BuildOnWYZth,1,1.0,False

We're sitting on my front porch talking about boundaries and turn-ons and stuff (cause, y'know, *consent is important!*), and up walks one of my other guys. Nbd, I was about to explain I'm on a date and politely send him on his way, but then dude straight up gets on one knee and freaking proposes!!! 

Like, wth, I am literally on a date here! And marrying this dude would throw off my whole dynamic! (plus, marriage = commitment = eeewwww!) 

So of course, I turned him down. He got a little butthurt about it, but I thought everything was cool. New guy took it like a champ, and we went back to our conversation like nothing happened. 

Things started to get a little steamy, so we headed upstairs for obvious reasons, only to discover *marriage dude had broken into my house and was just sitting there playing on my computer!*

I sent him home and went back to my new guy, but dude just sat there on the computer. The whole time. Watching us. It was sooo creepy when I looked up after and realized he was still there. So I sent new guy home and promised to call him tomorrow, and then broke up with marriage dude. He...was not happy. And he STILL refused to leave!

This is because most people haven’t truly studied the mindset of successful entrepreneurs and the creative industriousness that sets them apart from the crowd. It should be obvious, but there is indeed a huge difference between “dreams” and “wishes.” And if you don’t believe me, take it from Dolly Parton.

[Helluva talk if you haven’t seen it. Click here to watch the YouTube video.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryDumb/comments/1h0o9an/if_you_adopt_a_countrydumb_mindset_the_money_will/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

And though most people on this Earth would like to have more, few are willing to develop and deploy a realistic strategy to achieve their dreams. And instead of structuring their days, hours, and minutes in the attainment of that goal, most get up every morning and do the same thing, day in and day out, which always involves “wishing” for a different outcome...but doing nothing to foster that same wish into existence.

This way of thinking is toxic, because it paralyzes people with a fear of failure, and prevents them from welcoming the very tool that true entrepreneurs know is the secret sauce to success—failure! Yes, failure. Because is you are smart about losing, it means two things:

1. You’re constantly learning how to better yourself.
2. You’re putting yourself in a realistic position to succeed.

There’s no better illustration for this than the stock market, because to the entrepreneur, the whole game is a combination of psychology, business, risk-management, and stellar competition with a standard scorecard for wins and loses.

If you see red, that’s a loss. Green is good.

But this very scorecard is what terrifies the average investor, and causes them to play the game to prevent loss, rather than implementing a methodical risk-management strategy to encourage wins.

 

**Playing “Not to Lose”**

Yesterday, while making a pot a coffee at work, some goofus came on the TV talking about planning for retirement, and I laughed the whole time, because it was the same trite bullshit Wall Street’s elite are always peddling. The 10-minute infomercial encouraged diversification and even admitted, “Every four years the market will lose 20%, but if you’re diversified and stick to the plan, you will achieve a consistent rate of return of 12% over the long run.”

Really?

Because I remember all them old heads at work losing 50% of their portfolio in 2009 with Fidelity’s recommended 60/40 diversified strategy, then having to work an extra decade just to get back to their 2007 balance.

And why?

Because the diversified portfolio is intentionally designed to weather 20-25% corrections, but not 50% Black Swan events. So the very tool that is supposed to prevent loss, actually creates a devastating susceptibility to substantial risk during a bear market.

I should know, because when COVID happened, I lost half of my portfolio just like the plant guys did back in 2009. And that’s the day I started to manage my own portfolio, and decided to “play to win” instead of “not to lose.”

But how?

First, let’s take a look at the traditional diversified portfolio, which generally averages about 12% annual returns. But in my case, I got laid off, so I couldn’t make any further contributions or bank the employer match. So, by sticking to the diversified portfolio, excluding any bear market or 20% correction, I could expect to grow a $100,000 retirement balance to a respectable $357,000 over the next 10 years.

https://preview.redd.it/8z84vff7gm8e1.jpg?width=1473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=984e1d49168af39cda7095d3ad031fdf2b6b2da1

This would have worked fine for most, but I had a “wish” to retire early and a mental-health “necessity” to reduce my stress and get better sleep. The only problem was, I didn’t yet have a realistic “dream,” which would require a tangible plan to grow my portfolio to $10 million without taking on substantial risks that could prevent me from retiring at the tradition age of 65, should things go wrong.

What I did have, was a numbers problem.

Because I knew in order to grow $100k into $10 million, I had to take on more risk, but how? And I knew the only safe way to do this effectively would be to take a[ lesson I learned from a Mayfield Milk Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryDumb/comments/1hiiigi/making_a_fortune_in_the_stock_market_lessons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and dedicate a small portion of my portfolio—say 10%—to one high-risk/high-reward trade per year.

But if you look at this strategy through the lens of a traditional diversified portfolio, if none of those 10 trades work over the course of ten years, my ending balance would tally a terrifying $109,000 instead of the expected minimum of $357,000, had I stayed the coarse and took no additional risk throughout my life.

https://preview.redd.it/qib3ddcbgm8e1.jpg?width=1474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ddd612b2faad14aa4b8f7aa8adce6a58c51e4a5

In short, there’s no smart way to “play to win,” if you’re depending on a Fidelity Freedom Fund to help you “not to lose.”

 

**Playing to Win**

The goal of any business should be to generate cash through growth. Businesses that try to preserve cash turn into zombie companies and are the exact kinds of stocks most investors try to avoid because they have no earnings. That’s why I chose to set up my portfolio like an actual growth company, which throws off huge amounts of cash each year—a portion of which can then be safely allocated to high-risk/high-reward speculation.

This is the most basic principle I used while at the poker table:

* Never bet big unless you have first generated the extra cash to safely play out the hand.

The purpose of this is to keep any one hand from wiping you out of the game.

And if I didn’t win for a while, I NEVER bet big until I had first built up the cash reserves again and could afford to safely take on more risk. **The worse thing anyone can do in the event of a loss, is to try to double-down with a riskier bet.**

**Defining the Strategy**

Warren Buffett once said he were starting out from scratch, he could easily make a consistent 50% annual return with very small amounts of money. And I’ve found this to be true in my own case, because micro-cap and small-cap companies, are the easiest way to make fast money.

On the other hand, if you’re dealing with a $30 million portfolio, it would be nearly impossible to make a 50% return playing this game because most of the real opportunities will come with volume restrictions that would prevent a mega-millionaire from allocating 10% of his/her portfolio to a particular stock.

But for the average investor with $100,000, it’s really easy to spread that same $100k across 10 stocks for $10k each. And if you pick a basket of 10 stocks with 10-bagger potential there's a huge margin of safety built into the math. For example:

* If five of those stocks go broke….
* One stock makes a 300% gain….
* Two tread water….
* And the remaining two only do 500% gains….

Get this!

Your overall portfolio will still grow to $130,000, which is a 30% rate of return for one of the shittiest winning percentages I could dream. But when you set up a portfolio like a true business, which is designed to generate huge amounts of cash, then the savvy stock picker has the ability to safely take a few shots down field in the coarse of his/her lifetime.

And the best part....

Even if you’re a complete stock-picking moron and none of your 10 high-risk/high-reward trades pay out, the ending balance in your portfolio will still look a helluva lot better than the diversified investor who played his whole life “Not to Lose!”

https://preview.redd.it/89hkne72gm8e1.jpg?width=1476&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a0f5efca7ede40e27a6c0d6c25c0ef24b6a30c6

**NOTE: This strategy will only work if you wait for a severe correction before you buy your basket of 10 stocks.** Trying to execute this strategy at the top of a bull market leaves the investor with no margin of safety and will likely end as badly, or worse, than the diversified portfolio in the event of a downturn. **Right now is the time to hoard cash!** For more on the subject of finding your entry point, [click here, and remember ""Cash is King!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryDumb/comments/1gys3pt/how_to_slit_wall_streets_jugular_remember_cash_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

My go to has been a white chocolate mocha so something similar, but open to any sweeter recipes using chocolates or caramel. ",1,1734970738.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Kahit in public places. Lagi kong sinasaway yun pero lighthearted na saway lang and pinagtatawanan lang namin dalawa.

Kanina, however, nainis talaga ako kasi we had a fun date night and had coffee sana to cap off the night. While nagsasalita ako panay hikab ba naman na sobrang lakas while nakabuka pa ang bibig. Medyo na-offend na talaga ako and I told him off. Alam mo yung feeling na parang bored na bored syang kausap ako. Pero imbes na magsorry, tinaasan pa ako ng boses na bakit ko daw ba pinapansin eh di naman daw yun na-cocontrol. Inaantok lang daw talaga sya and mainit pa dun sa coffee shop.

So lalo akong na-offend, and imbes na masaya ang gabi namin, nag-away pa nga.

Bakit tingin ko ako ang gago: My husband works at a  very taxing job. 9-6 ang pasok nya, but madalas OTTY ng 1-2 hours. Dumarating ng bahay at 8 or 9 PM, dinner lang kami then by 10PM work ulit. So, more often than not, 4-5 hours lang tulog nya on weekdays at sa weekends lang nakakabawi ng 10+ hrs na tulog.

Pero hindi lang sya, damay ako, dahil kada magtatrabaho sya sa gabi, kasama nya ako. Hindi man ako nagtatrabaho, finoforgo ko din ang pagtulog ng maaga-aga para samahan sya sa coffee shop to do what he has to do. I also work 8-5PM but relatively more lax ang workload. This has been our routine for the past two years.

it's weird because starting on 50mg I felt the opposite: having no motivation, headaches, and brain fog. I know in reality it's probably nothing but it does make me a bit anxious and I guess all I'm looking for is to express this somewhere and maybe get a bit of reassurance lol",2,1734970680.0,zoloft,2,1.0,False

What do you take, dose age, and what is your experience? What was your indication to need both? I started on methylphenidate 5 mg 2-3x a day. Worked great, felt great, helped my anxiety especially social anxiety but then would crash, even with coffee, become super tired when it wore off. The methylphenidate ER 10 mg keeps me more even throughout the day but experiencing irritability and doesn’t help my symptoms as much. Also a slight increase in anxiety. I also take Prozac daily. Any info and shared experiences would be appreciated TIA",1,1734970505.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
