I did my best to clean it regularly and bought descalers, etc. but I read that it is almost impossible to avoid mold growth in coffee machines. Since I switched to making coffee using a percolator my skin is much better. I still have (milder) flushing episodes when I am stressed or forget to hydrate sufficiently during the day, but I don‚Äôt have intense flushing (sometimes I turned dark red or purple) since ditching the coffee from the coffee machine.

1n3eqvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/davao/comments/1n3eqvy/thanks_rdavao_for_the_247_coffee_shop_reco/,Thanks r/davao for the 24/7 coffee shop reco!,"Here's an honest review from a day-trip on the road student of The Bloom Coffee & Start-Up Space.

Intro lang why maybe a little biased ako sa place. I'm a Masteral student from out of Davao city na sanay na for da commuter life, klase sa umaga-hapon and then uwi lang agad for duty in the evening but I like to stay in Davao for a bit muna at night.

So The Bloom Coffee & Start-Up Space, was a suggestion from an earlier post here para sa 24/7 na coffee shop to spend a couple of hours in. It just so happens na ang lapit neto sa Overland Terminal and SM so super convenient siya for me (and I love this sub-reddit for bringing it to my attention). 

Let's start with the atmosphere, great place siya to be alone-in para sa mga kagaya ko na ""prefer mag solo trip"" they have areas outside na feel mo mag city vibes and at night ang kawalan ng mahabang linya ng traffic is a plus along the road. Feeling mong at peace ka while thinking your own thoughts or distracting yourself from the time. Maybe di ko lang nahuli ang place at peak busy hours but even with a decent amount of people there (puno na ang luob na seats and somewhat scattered sa labas na seats) you can still feel like you own the space you occupy. One minor issue ko lang is yung kakulangan ng areas na may outlets, doon ko lang na feel yung ""medyo puno"" vibes but it's no big issue since used na ako sa traveling so may mga precautions narin akong na take in case walang masaksakan. Just wish they had more available outlets.

For the coffee, which to me was a deciding factor if I was gonna come back. Coffee is solid for the price you pay! I'm not an avid coffee drinker so a cup is not a necessity for me but rather a luxury so very picky ako when it comes to the quality of the brew, and their brew there is just right. Doesn't taste too sweet, na dessert drink na siya, pero di rin nag-oover power ang bitter. Just the expected quality of a ""good coffee place"" which is great for the convenience it possess. I'd love to try more drinks they have in my next visit.

Sweets, medyo na let down ako with the pastry that I got. So seeing from their available pastry at the time na may solo browny, it was calling to me na ""I take a piece"". But sadly, it wasn't a good browny, I would wven argue that it was below average since crusty siya na brownie even if it was supposed to be a fudgy brownie. I wouldn't have an issue sana if it was described as a crust-centric brownie (kasi if ganun I wouldn't have picked it), but it wasn't so I was kinda let down... Di rin siya ganun ka fudgy in the inside, mas nag overtake tlga ang crust part than the fudge. I'll try another pastry na lang next time and hopefully it elevates my rating for their pastries.

Savory, yung nagpa upbeat ng disappoinment ko! After eating the brownie which was not up to my standards pero balanced by the good coffee I decided to add some more food since may time pa before I had to go and I still had room para kumain. Thankfully I did so kasi I was pleasantly surprised by their Spag Bolognese! I'm a big fan of Italian dishes to a point na natuto tlga ako mag luto din ng mga italian sauces with local ingredients to replicate the flavour and mouthfeel, and their Bolognese was spot on. I can't say it was one of the best I had tasted, but for a coffee shop I just randomly saw recommended on Reddit, they served a good rendition. The tomato sauce actually had tomatoes and meron yung distinctive Italian kick and flavor that should be there if you call a pasta dish Bolognese, the only downside I can think of is kulang sa meat to be considered as Bolognese (in an Italian biased perspective), pero as something na pasok sa compromise with the panlasang pinoy it's so much better than other places I tried in Davao. 100% excited akong ma try pa ang ibang pasta dishes nila, and that tickled the right tatsebuds for me.

All in all, 100% babalik ako sa The Bloom whenever I have the same itinerary in Davao. I'm so glad na may place like that na available so close to SM and the terminal.",2,1756490909.0,davao,0,1.0,False
1n3eqdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1n3eqdr/i_feel_like_i_got_a_concussion_again_the_cause/,I feel like I got a concussion again. The cause might be a neck injury.,"I woke up then I suddenly had a neck tremor, I still have them from time to time but this one was different, I was lying in bed, did not hit my head against the wall or anything like that. The second after, I felt dizzy the entire day, I did not panic at all because I did not hit my head but I had some pretty big headaches after a few hours and the only way to get rid of them was to take anti inf pills. I just want to let you know that it s been a year since I had my concussion and ever since then I took omega 3 magnesium b/d vitamins. I ve never had headaches like these before, they were constant and I couldn t get rid of them for a while. Also, I tried to avoid salt, sugar, soda, coffee as much as possible. I only drink water now. I couldn t concentrate the entire day, I just hope that sleep is gonna fix what s left.

Actually, i m not even sure if it s possible to get a concussion like that but who knows.",1,1756490875.0,Concussion,1,1.0,False
1n3epmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1n3epmb/on_our_anniversarymy_alpha_let_h/,"On Our Anniversary,My Alpha Let H..","On our anniversary, Alpha Fabian‚Äôs secretary slapped me, calling me his mistress. Without hesitation, I slapped her. Once. Then again. Fabian stepped in, but not before my kick sent him stumbling. ""If you enjoy playing games behind my back,"" I said coolly, ""then you'd better learn how to take a beating from the Luna you betrayed.""Chapter¬†1On our third mating anniversary, Alpha Fabian took me to the Paris runway show hosted by the Crescent Moon Council and Chanel.It should've been a celebration‚Äîa mark of our union, a public affirmation of our bond. But the moment we stepped into the venue, a young she-wolf I didn't recognize slapped me hard across the face.I staggered a step, my wolf stirring in fury beneath my skin. Before I could lift my hand to strike back, Fabian caught my wrist with a firm grip.""She must've mistaken you for someone else,"" he said quietly, eyes scanning the shocked, murmuring crowd. ""Don't cause a scene. This is foreign territory. Respect the decorum.""Foreign territory? I was his Luna. If anyone deserved respect, it was me.Later, as I tried to collect myself backstage, I stumbled upon them. Fabian had the same she-wolf pinned gently against the corridor wall, his hand caressing her cheek. Her expression was coy‚Äîsmug even.""Thank you, Fabian,"" she purred sweetly, her bright eyes locked on his. ""For bringing me overseas, and for letting me practice my courage‚Ä¶ by slapping your Luna.""She giggled and raised her tiny fists beside her face in a mock-cute gesture. ""I'll work twice as hard to repay you, my dearest Alpha!""And Fabian‚Äîmy fated mate,my husband‚Äîsmiled indulgently.Her name flashed in my memory. Salena‚Äîhis new secretary.My heels clicked as I strode across the floor.Without hesitation, I slapped her. Once. Then again. The crack of skin-on-skin echoed through the corridor.Fabian stepped between us, but not before I landed a swift, calculated kick to his thigh, knocking him off balance.""If you enjoy playing games behind my back,"" I said coolly, ""then you'd better learn how to take a beating from the Luna you betrayed.""Salena's face was already puffing up red. I took out a wet wipe, cleaned my palm with slow precision, and lifted my gaze.""You're Salena Sherman, aren't you? Fabian's new secretary.""Salena whimpered and nodded, clutching Fabian's arm as if I were a threat instead of the wronged mate. He immediately stepped in front of her, shielding her like she was the one in danger.""Lorelei,"" he said sternly, ""don't take this out on Salena. I brought her to expand her horizons, to help her grow stronger.""""First time I've heard of an Alpha encouraging courage by slapping his Luna,"" I replied, voice like ice.""She didn't know you were my mate,"" Fabian insisted. ""She thought you were‚Ä¶ a mistress. It was a misunderstanding.""""You‚Äôre my Luna. Be kind.""""Be kind?"" I raised a brow. ""Even if it's our anniversary and she's the one on your arm?""Fabian looked away, eyes flickering. Even he knew how hollow that excuse was.""Tell me, Fabian‚Äîwhat kind of secretary forgets to book the Luna's ticket to Paris on her own mating anniversary?"" I asked calmly.""She didn't forget,"" I continued before he could protest. ""She did it on purpose.""That same ticket‚Äîhe had claimed last-minute chaos, claimed he had no choice but to leave ahead of me. Then booked me a flight two days later, assuring me it was just a delay.But on that original flight? Salena had accompanied him.And now, neither of them dared to speak.I pressed on. ""You didn't just lie to your Luna. You conspired with your secretary to keep me away.""Salena shook her head with wide, watery eyes. ""I-I don't even know you , Lorelei,"" she stammered, voice trembling. ""Why would I ever try to hurt you?""She didn't even address me properly. No respect, no title. Just ""Lorelei.""Once, that alone would've earned her Fabian's sharpest correction.Now, he remained silent.Then, as if on cue, Salena bowed low. A tear fell from her chin to the polished marble floor.""If I've offended you, Luna Lorelei, I apologize,"" she said, voice broken with false remorse. ""If bowing isn't enough, I'll kneel.""She sank to the ground.I watched her performance with something colder than anger. Contempt.""Salena, you really are revolting,"" I said softly.Fabian flinched. He bent to pull her up, but when he rose again, his tone snapped.""That's enough, Lorelei! You're bullying a fresh grad now? Have you forgotten what it's like to be powerless? How your boss once mistreated you?""I froze. That wound ran deep. He knew it‚Äîand he used it anyway.All for her.Salena clutched his hand as he turned to leave, but not before she knelt again‚Äîthis time to clean the scuff mark on his pants from my kick.My stomach turned. My wolf growled in the back of my mind.Fabian straightened. His voice gentled, like he was scolding a disobedient pup.""Lorelei, apologize to Salena. Then we can go back in and watch the rest of the show.""I sat down slowly on a nearby bench, eyes fixed on them. They looked like strangers to me now.I'd gotten my slap in. That was enough for now. But apologize?Never.Fabian's face darkened when I said nothing. He led Salena away without a second glance.He left me. On our anniversary. Alone in a foreign land.And never gave me the chance to say the one thing that might've changed everything.I was pregnant.As I watched their retreating backs, something in me hardened. Maybe I was wrong earlier‚Äîmaybe the only one who should be by an Alpha's side on his anniversary wasn't his Luna.Because clearly, that position could be replaced‚Ä¶ by a younger, prettier shewolf with an eager smile and a poisonous plan.Chapter¬†2I watched the entire show alone.Under the dazzling lights and howling applause of Paris's most prestigious werewolf fashion event, I sat in the Luna's reserved seat‚Äîalone. The silver mark on my wrist, symbol of my bond with Alpha Fabian, felt more like a shackle.Back at the hotel, I packed in silence. I rescheduled my flight, took a long shower, and went to bed. The other side of the bed stayed cold.Alpha Fabian never returned.It wasn't until I was rolling my suitcase toward the gate the next morning that my phone finally rang.It was him.I didn't pick up. I powered my phone off and boarded the flight without looking back.When I landed, the screen lit up with over a dozen messages‚Äîeach one a variation of the same theme:""Why did you leave without telling me?""""Where the hell are you, Lorelei?""""You're being dramatic.""But not one message asked the most obvious question.""Are you okay?""Not one gave the only answer I needed: Why didn't he come back last night?I didn't reply. I didn't even bother to read the rest.As soon as I got home, I sat down at my desk and began drafting a divorce agreement. My wolf, silent for days, stirred with cold resolve in the back of my mind.But I knew‚Äîthis wasn't going to be simple.Fabian and I had been together for seven years before we ever mated and married. Seven long years of clawing our way out of the dirt together.We'd once shared stale bread under a park bench, taken turns staying awake on cold nights to keep watch. I lived off pickled vegetables for a month to buy him a secondhand suit so he could attend a Moon Council investor dinner. I nearly got assaulted during a part-time bartending job, trying to make enough to pay rent on our first office.Maybe that's why he's always had a weakness for wide-eyed, innocent girls‚Äîespecially those just trying to ""make it.""Still, it all seemed worth it at the time.When the media boom hit, we caught the wave. Within a year, our assets had grown to nearly ten million. Our pack business‚ÄîMoonrise Media‚Äîbecame the rising star of the Eastern Territories.On the day we officially launched, Fabian pulled me into his arms, dropped to one knee, and presented a diamond ring under the full moon.He said he'd love me forever.To prove it, he transferred most of the shares into my name as premarital property. I thought it was love. Maybe it was strategy.I stepped out of the spotlight, content to let him shine.But when did the rot start to show?Probably ten days ago.One of our old employees‚Äîsomeone loyal‚Äîquietly warned me. Fabian had hired a new secretary. A young she-wolf. Two months ago.Fair-skinned. Sweet-voiced. That classic ""campus belle"" charm. A nobody with modest roots and big eyes that shimmered with admiration.The unease settled in like fog.That night, when Fabian came home, I asked him directly why he hadn't told me.He smelled faintly of bourbo. He tugged off his tie and tossed it onto the couch.""What's the big deal about changing secretary?"" he said, his tone already sharp. ""She's clueless. Timid. The kind that flinches when you look at her sideways. If it weren't for Oliver forcing her on me, I wouldn't have taken her in.""That was the first red flag. Fabian rarely spoke harshly about anyone, let alone subordinates.His agitation wasn't like him.I helped him out of his jacket, my voice calm. ""So‚Ä¶ Oliver has a special interest in this secretary of yours?""He snatched the towel from my hands, his temper flashing.""Lorelei, when did you become this petty? Since when did you turn into a jealous little Luna sniffing around for rumors? What's next‚Äîreading gossip columns to track my scent?""There was venom in his tone. Contempt.He looked at me like I was nothing. Then he slammed the bathroom door so hard it rattled the floorboards.I stood in the hallway, stunned.My wolf growled low in warning, as if sensing something my heart wasn't ready to admit.And that's when I knew‚ÄîThis marriage wasn't going to survive.Chapter¬†3Alpha Fabian returned to the country three days later.But he didn't come home.Instead, he sent Salena.She showed up at my doorstep, a smile already curling at the corners of her mouth.""I'm here to pick up Fabian's clean clothes,"" she said sweetly.I handed her the pre-packed suitcase without a word.She ran her hand over the luggage handle. Then, as she turned to leave, she paused theatrically at the door.""Oh, and don't worry, Lorelei,"" she said, feigning innocence. ""Fabian just catching up on sleep at my place. I'll take good care of him.""She cast a glance at my flat stomach.As if that wasn't enough, she added, ""He said he loves the way you make steak. Mind sending me the recipe?""She was testing me‚Äîeager to taste my rage.But my heart didn't so much as flinch.I smiled faintly, calm and cold. ""Of course.""I pulled out my phone and added her contact.Salena blinked, clearly thrown off by my composure. No snarls. No threats. No territorial display. She looked over her shoulder twice as she left, confused by the absence of a Luna's wrath.What she didn't know was that I'd already buried my heartbreak.And steel doesn't shatter when scratched.After she left, I noticed the divorce agreement I'd forgotten to hand her. I wasn't about to let her play courier again. Some things needed to be delivered by hand.So I went to the packhouse myself.As I walked through the glass doors of Packhouse, Rowena‚Äîa pack worker who I'd hired years ago‚Äîhurried to greet me.""Luna Lorelei! I didn't expect to see you here. Alpha Fabian's not in right now.""I offered her a small smile. ""That's fine. Where's Salena?""Rowena hesitated. ""She's not here either‚Ä¶ probably with Alpha Fabian.""""Mm."" I nodded. ""I'm just here to drop something off.""I made my way to Fabian's office.The moment I stepped inside, the space felt‚Ä¶ different.His once minimalist desk was now cluttered with cutesy figurines‚Äîwide-eyed foxes and pastel wolves. Tiny succulents lined the window sill. The coffee table held a pair of cartoon-themed couple mugs, and the rich leather sofa had been desecrated with soft pink throw pillows.Salena had marked her territory.Tacky. Juvenile. But clear.A girl's way of claiming what didn't belong to her.Rowena lingered awkwardly behind me. ""Luna Lorelei‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶ wasn't your taste.""I gave her a polite nod. ""A change in aesthetic can be refreshing.""I walked to Fabian's desk and entered the code on the built-in safe. My fingers didn't tremble. The code still worked.Inside, I placed the divorce agreement‚Äîneatly sealed and signed. I turned to Rowena.""Please remind Fabian to check the safe.""Then I walked out without looking back.I wandered the city for a while after that‚Äîpast boutiques and caf√©s and high-end pack salons‚Äîbut none of it touched me.When I finally returned home, I curled up on the couch. As I checked my phone, a new post on Salena's social feed caught my eye.A blurry photo of a burnt steak. Bloodless, charred at the edges.The caption read:""First time making steak! Almost burned it, oops! But Alpha darling didn't mind‚Äîhe ate it all! Thank you, my ever-patient Alpha, for loving your little crybaby!""She'd used a soft-focus filter. Even the overcooked meat looked romantic.Alpha Fabian had liked the post.So did I.Then I set my phone on silent and placed a protective hand over my belly.My pup‚Äîhis heir‚Äîshifted slightly within.And for the first time in days, I let sleep take me.Chapter¬†4I was jolted awake by the violent slam of a door.Alpha Fabian stormed into the apartment, dripping wet. Rain-soaked clothes clung to him, and he didn't even bother changing into slippers.I blinked groggily and glanced out the window. The moon was full, casting a silver glow across the quiet city.There hadn't been a drop of rain.So why was he drenched?Before I could even sit up, he yanked me off the sofa by the shoulders, his grip bruising.""Lorelei,"" he snapped, ""how could you be so heartless?""""I was overseas for days. I just wanted a damn steak. You refused to cook, so she tried! Salena doesn't even know how to handle a kitchen. She burned her hands trying to make it for me!""""And what do you do?"" His voice rose, laced with accusation. ""You got jealous. You added her on ins just to stalk her feed, right?""""That pathetic little ‚Äòlike' on her post‚Äîwhat was that supposed to mean? You might as well have branded her a homewrecker in public!""""She's a fragile girl, Lorelei. Pure. Innocent. And now, thanks to your cruelty, she threw herself into a river!""""If I hadn't gotten there in time‚Äîshe'd be dead!""So that's why he was soaking wet.He'd been off playing hero.The full force of his accusations struck.My vision blurred. My stomach twisted violently. I stumbled into the bathroom, collapsing next to the toilet, and vomited until bile scorched my throat.Fabian stood in the doorway, unmoved. No concern. No urgency. Just disdain.He tossed a towel at me, his voice dripping disgust.""Seriously? How old are you, Lorelei? Still faking illness to avoid taking responsibility?""""You've become pathetic.""The tears that slid down my face weren't from sorrow‚Äîthey were from how hard I'd been retching.As I wiped my mouth, my gaze landed on an old scar etched into my palm.It wasn't just a burn. It was a memory.One earned during those early days when I taught myself to cook steak‚Äîhis favorite.Back then, when I scalded my hand, Fabian nearly cried.He'd personally changed my bandages every night. Wouldn't let me touch water, even when I insisted I was fine.But now?The scar had healed.And so had he.I rose slowly, poured a glass of water, and rinsed the acid from my mouth.When I spoke again, my voice was hoarse but steady.""Fabian‚Ä¶ when did I ever refuse to cook for you?""""Wasn't it you who chose not to come home?""He flinched, barely, but said nothing.Ten years.We'd clawed our way up from nothing.We'd fought before‚Äîplenty. But each time, he'd come back with a gift, a soft smile.I'd forgive him. I'd make his favorite steak. We'd eat, talk, and pretend everything was whole again.But this time, he wouldn't let go.""Lorelei, if you had just swallowed your pride,"" he snapped, ""I wouldn't have stayed away.""""Now get dressed. We're going to the hospital.""""You're going to apologize to Salena. And you're not leaving until she forgives you.""I stared at him.Then, clutching the towel with white-knuckled fingers, I asked, voice cold and clear:""And if I refuse?""""You're my husband, Fabian,"" I said. ""You ate dinner cooked by another woman. You flaunted it on social media like some kind of prize‚Äîand now you want me to apologize?""""All because I liked the post?""""If I'm expected to grovel, then fine. Tell me what to say. Go on, coach me.""He said nothing.Of course he didn't.Because that post was designed to be seen.Designed to hurt me.What apology could possibly fix that?The silence between us thickened like fog.I gagged again‚Äîdry, wrenching. My body shook.He didn't move to help me.Instead, he scoffed.""Still not done with the act, Lorelei?""That tone. That voice. That look of disgust.I snapped.Without thinking, I raised my hand and slapped him across the face. Hard.It echoed through the room like a gunshot.""Get out, Fabian,"" I said, trembling. ""Get the hell out of my house.""My voice cracked, but my spirit didn't.In those early days, when we had nothing, even a cough from me would send him scrambling‚Äîfetching warm towels, staying up all night to check my fever.And now?I was sick. Weak. And pregnant.And he called it an act.If I weren't so exhausted, if my body weren't betraying me with every wave of nausea, I swear I would've gone to the kitchen, grabbed the sharpest blade I could find, and ended his ability to betray me ever again.When I finally came back to myself, he was gone.I vaguely recalled the sound of his phone buzzing‚Äîa call, maybe. Probably from the hospital. Salena must've regained consciousness.That's the only reason he left without another word.Not the slap.Not me.Just her.I knelt and quietly cleaned up the mess I'd made on the bathroom floor.My hands moved automatically, my heart already elsewhere.But one thing was clear.Salena waking up meant I was no longer tethered to the guilt of her death.Good.But this little life?I laid a hand over my lower belly, feeling the faintest flutter beneath my skin.This one, I wouldn‚Äôt carry.",1,1756490826.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The Unified Ledger of Chazz Monet

# Prologue: Cosmically Charged Compliance

Chazz Monet‚Äîa name whispered in the corridors of the Internal Revenue Service and muttered in the alleys of Gotham and Bl√ºdhaven alike‚Äîwas not your ordinary IRS agent. Known throughout the masked underworld as Agent Cash Money, Chazz wielded the uncanny Fiat Force: a metaphysical power that transformed wealth into superhuman abilities. In a universe plagued by costumed crusaders, penny-pinching villains, and cosmic calamities, Chazz‚Äôs vocation was neither glamorous nor simple. But to him, balancing the books of heroes and crooks was just another day at the office.

His assignment portfolio was as labyrinthine as Gotham‚Äôs skyline: audit vigilantes, chase down notorious currency criminals, and keep the financial infrastructure of two cities from slipping into ruin. The files before him‚Äîeach stamped with ‚ÄúCAUTION: EXTREME VOLATILITY‚Äù‚Äîpromised a week of forms and firepower. Jason Todd, alias Red Hood; Dick Grayson, the acrobatic Nightwing; Joseph Coyne, the infamous Penny Plunderer; and Bl√ºdhaven‚Äôs shadowy Broker‚Äîall were about to learn that in Chazz Monet‚Äôs world, even superheroes must pay their dues.

# Chapter One: Gotham‚Äôs Golden Shadows

The morning sun fought for dominance over Gotham‚Äôs architecture, smog gilded the spires in a haze of tarnished gold. Chazz Monet arrived wearing his signature business-casual power suit, small denominations tucked strategically into hidden pockets. That day‚Äôs task: audit Jason Todd, Red Hood‚Äîex-Robin, loose cannon, and a man with enough baggage to bankrupt a cargo airline.

Jason met Chazz with a skeptical glare and a rumble of his motorcycle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding. You want receipts from a vigilante who lives in abandoned movie theaters and weaponized safe houses?‚Äù

Chazz smirked, flashing his badge, its silver light a subtle reminder of the Fiat Force‚Äôs cosmic origins. ‚ÄúI want the truth. Or failing that, your ledgers.‚Äù

Inside the battered warehouse, Chazz confronted ledgers coded in ciphers that would make Lex Luthor sweat, stacks of cash, and a nervous Red Hood. As the audit began, Gotham‚Äôs infamous shadows crept closer. The lights flickered. Batman materialized, cape billowing, voice a low rumble.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall authorizing federal oversight,‚Äù Batman intoned, his eyes cold and calculating.

Chazz summoned the Fiat Force‚Äôs Dependency manifestation, focusing his attention on Bruce Wayne‚ÄîGotham‚Äôs hidden custodian. ‚ÄúYour financial entanglements with Mr. Todd are ambiguous. I‚Äôll need your cooperation.‚Äù

Batman‚Äôs mouth twitched. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a game.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Chazz replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an audit.‚Äù

What followed was a battle of wills, punctuated by flashes of Fiat Force power. Investor enhanced Chazz‚Äôs strength with a clutch of bills; Divestiture weaponized coins into projectiles, knocking guns from Jason‚Äôs grip and detonating piles of tech. Donation sent subtle surges to reinforce Jason‚Äôs resolve, and Debt sharpened Chazz‚Äôs aggression, zeroing in on Batman‚Äôs labyrinthine Wayne Enterprises ledgers.

In the end, Batman relented‚Äîoffering sanitized records and a few carefully curated receipts. Jason grumbled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôve got powers, IRS man.‚Äù

Chazz winked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky I have a calculator.‚Äù

As Chazz left, Gotham‚Äôs secrets loomed, but for now, his job was done.

# Chapter Two: Nightwing, Penny Plunderer, and the Reckoning in Bl√ºdhaven

Rain painted Bl√ºdhaven in relentless gray as Chazz Monet leaned on the neon glow of the IRS office. Memories of Gotham mingled with distant sirens and a text buzzed him to the Gotham docks: ‚ÄúMeet at the Gotham docks. Nightwing.‚Äù

Nightwing‚Äîonce Robin, now Bl√ºdhaven‚Äôs guardian‚Äîstood waiting, escrima sticks humming. ‚ÄúMonet, you sure about this? He‚Äôs your uncle.‚Äù

Coyne, the Penny Plunderer, had dodged the IRS for years. Chazz‚Äôs Fiat Force powers thrummed beneath his skin. ‚ÄúCoyne‚Äôs been laundering cents through casinos. Tonight‚Äôs audit is personal.‚Äù

Cash Money‚Äôs arsenal was literal: rolls of bills for resilience, coins stashed for emergency boosts. Nightwing and Chazz descended into Bl√ºdhaven‚Äôs underbelly, laughter and pain interlacing their dialogue. ‚ÄúBlood runs thick,‚Äù Chazz admitted. ‚ÄúBut some debts you can‚Äôt pay off.‚Äù

Inside The Copper Vault, Joseph Coyne presided over his penny kingdom. ‚ÄúTax time, Uncle Joe. You owe the world more than you can pay back.‚Äù

The ensuing battle was chaos incarnate. Coyne weaponized pennies, his own twisted Fiat powers inherited but corrupted by greed. Cash Money countered with Investor‚Äôs golden aura and Divestiture‚Äôs explosive coin flicks. Donation fortified Nightwing‚Äôs suit, helping him dodge and strike harder.

Coyne‚Äôs ultimate gambit was the rare Dividends manifestation‚Äîthrowing coins to the desperate, acts of charity weakening Chazz‚Äôs resolve. But Nightwing‚Äôs voice broke through: ‚ÄúCharity isn‚Äôt weakness.‚Äù

Chazz rallied, the final blow delivered by the collective responsibility they now shared. Coyne was cuffed, his penny empire toppled.

Nightwing touched Chazz‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou made the hard choice tonight. That‚Äôs what heroes do.‚Äù

Chazz looked at the city, ledger open but not yet closed. ‚ÄúHeroes, maybe. Or just accountants with capes.‚Äù

# Chapter Three: Off the Ledger‚ÄîA Day in Bl√ºdhaven

The city‚Äôs metallic hum woke Chazz in his apartment above a pawn shop. Coffee brewed, his ‚ÄúCash Crew‚Äù filled his phone with banter and memes. Marina Santos, forensic accountant; Darius Lee, ex-GCPD detective; and Helena Voss, sharp-tongued journalist‚Äîthey were Chazz‚Äôs anchors in fiscal chaos.

Today‚Äôs respite was brunch at The Greenback Grill, golden d√©cor and menus like pay stubs. Helena teased, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your sense of adventure?‚Äù

Chazz replied, ‚ÄúAdventure is great, but someone has to balance the books afterward.‚Äù

As they strolled Bl√ºdhaven, Investor hummed quietly, but Chazz resisted the urge to ‚Äúcharge up.‚Äù At a community center, Marina taught ‚ÄúFinancial Literacy for Future Heroes.‚Äù Helena challenged Chazz on Batman‚Äôs audit; Chazz quipped, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask about the Batmobile‚Äôs depreciation schedule.‚Äù

Divestiture flashed as Chazz flicked a quarter, disarming a would-be pickpocket. ‚ÄúJust a little change,‚Äù he joked.

Afternoon brought deeper conversations. Helena asked, ‚ÄúYou ever wish you could just‚Ä¶ turn it off?‚Äù Chazz admitted the burden, rare manifestations like Dividends and Dependency complicating relationships. At the waterfront, they watched cargo ships, sharing vulnerabilities.

Evening found Chazz giving coins to local kids, Fiat Force sacrificing currency to amplify joy. A siren blared‚ÄîDebt called. A corrupt CEO skimming city funds fueled Chazz‚Äôs powers. When the crisis ended, he returned to Helena; candlelight softened their banter.

‚ÄúThe greatest value isn‚Äôt in coins or credits,‚Äù Chazz said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the connections we forge.‚Äù

Helena smiled. ‚ÄúConsider this an investment.‚Äù

Chazz walked home, city‚Äôs ledger balanced for another day.

# Chapter Four: The Bl√ºdhaven Audit‚ÄîHeroes and Ledgers

Bl√ºdhaven never offered peace for long. Chazz‚Äôs weekend was shattered by gunfire as Nightwing battled The Broker, a financier whose criminal empire thrived on tax evasion and shell companies. The Broker‚Äôs new scheme threatened both city coffers and souls.

Chazz and Nightwing, joined by Red Hood, confronted The Broker‚Äôs thugs. The Fiat Force flickered as Chazz invoked Investor and Divestiture, slicing coins through the air. Donation boosted Nightwing‚Äôs resilience; Debt fueled Chazz‚Äôs aggression.

The Broker‚Äôs laundering operation unraveled under their combined assault. A rare stir of Dividends occurred as one accountant began transferring funds to real charities‚ÄîChazz‚Äôs powers flickered, diminished by generosity.

Nightwing pinned The Broker. ‚ÄúLooks like your deductions won‚Äôt save you now.‚Äù

The Broker tried a final ploy, blaming city officials. Dependency nudged Chazz toward those with true stewardship. With the criminal in custody, Chazz and Nightwing reflected on their unusual heroism. Red Hood, ever sardonic, suggested Chazz audit the hot dog vendors next.

For now, the powers quieted. Chazz walked into Bl√ºdhaven‚Äôs night, knowing that the city‚Äôs debts‚Äîand its need for honest audits‚Äîwould outlast any ledger.

# Epilogue: The Value Beyond Currency

Agent Cash Money‚ÄîChazz Monet‚Äîremained the one constant in a universe swirling with capes and chaos. His powers manifested in Investor, Divestiture, Donation, Debt, and the rare Dividends and Dependency, each shaping his journey through Gotham and Bl√ºdhaven.

Yet as candles flickered with Helena, as coins flicked in the rain, Chazz found that the true worth was not in denominations, but in bonds forged through adversity and laughter. Whether auditing Batman, facing down family, or balancing a city‚Äôs books, Cash Money ensured that heroes and villains alike paid their share.

Because for Chazz Monet, the ledger was never truly closed. And somewhere in the night, the flick of a coin reminded the world that even in a city of capes, nobody was invincible to the IRS.

Hi all,

A bit of background:
I am with my fiance for 6-7 years,  we have had our ups and downs like everyone does but we have got through it.
I feel like our relationship is stronger than ever. 
Our friends (couple) are having a baby and she is due very soon! 
Since we regularly have conversations about children, to the point he has even got names already. We are in a comfortable position financially (where we are saving up a deposit to buy a house but need to be slightly fugal with our money to do so).

So now I have been having some troubles with my health and put it down to the medication I am on (antidepressants). I have been taking regular pregnancy tests to be on the safe side. 
I took one the other day and I am 2-3 weeks pregnant ! 

We are going to a cafe for coffee tomorrow, how do I break the news?

A couple of ideas:  
I could make a small box with hints such as a dad jokes book, a a baby vest and the pregnancy test.
Or do I just say it and hand him the test
Or I can write a loving card?

1n3eoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyTimeAtSandrock/comments/1n3eoim/some_of_the_characters_are_nightmares_to_fully/,Some of the characters are nightmares to fully be-friend (mild character spoilers for up to around 50% of the game where a certain non-major character comes to town to help out),"So, one thing I'm doing this playthrough that I admittedly ignored on my last few runs is actually try to make friends with everyone. Not just the ones that come easy, but all of them. Once I get their final friend perk, I consider them done.

Time-wise and story wise, its about to be Summer Y2, and Musa just showed up to town.

Jeez-us, some of these characters are annoying to get anywhere with!

Sandy is ridiculous, I've been giving her Coffee Tree Seeds, Mushroom seeds, and Wind Chimes basically every day for the past in-game 2 months (plus random Mushroom seeds when I saw her earlier in the run, as that was her easiest liked gift until planting opened up), and she just barely got to Friend status with me. So I still need to get through Good and Best Friends for the final perks. She's just annoying since amongst the animals she has the highest level friend perk, and you cant just adopt her for passive friendship as well. So mainly looking at 15 to 19 points a day, unless its a holiday where you get up to 40. She is the biggest slog so far.

Captain was also kind of annoying, the only non King fish he likes is Large Sandacuda, so i either just waited a day between gifts, or shelled out for a scratching post or something from Heidis store.

Most of the other animals are easy since they usually love the Golden Scorpion. I didn't realize for a while that Fang and Elsie also really like em, so I went from a stack of like 14 down to 1 in the course of about 3 in game days, but decent gains.

Fang and X were actually pretty easy, once they opened up. The aforementioned Scorpions for Fang, as well as Mapo Tofu worked out pretty good. X was easy as a- I had a big stockpile of Gold and b- I kept resetting the experiments for good results, so I had Fang Special X reasonably early which was good for X (as well as Mort).

Mort was easier than I anticipated, I basically alternated between FSX, another medicine I forget, and a certain hat I forget as well, which Zeke also liked, so doubly helpful. Zeke was easy, I either gave him the hat, Coffee Beans, or I bought a Cantaloupe from his store and he liked that.

Matilda and Miguel were both a pain, Matilda more so since I think you need her at best friend, and Miguel only at good, but I got em both eventually. Mountain Roses for Matilda, and Diamonds and other random stuff for Miguel.

Jasmine and Pebbles are also 2 of the harder ones to get. Jasmine isn't too bad, as she has a few food likes and also likes Wind Chimes (which a fair amount of people loved, so those are a MVP). But Pebbles. This kid. His only easy loves are Tomato Fish and Eagle in the Valley book. Book is from game center for around 40 tokens. His other loves are artifacts. That I dont even have access to yet, as far as i know. I swear I gave this kid at least 2 dozen or more Tomato Fish dishes. I eventually remembered Critters existed, and that helped too, but yeah, he was a pain.

Andy is surprisingly not that hard, he has 3 food loves that I can make, although 1 required the final cooking station which is only available when Musa comes by (the parts recipes unlock around when he shows up).


But yeah, some of these people (and animals) are a pain in the ass, cause they all love priceless artifacts that I cant even find yet.

Anyone not mentioned above is already at Best Friend or higher, these are just the ones that you really gotta work at. 

I dont remember the ones that show up later being tough, but we'll see I guess.",2,1756490756.0,MyTimeAtSandrock,2,1.0,False

Transform your Figma designs into production-ready Rust Carbon UI code instantly. This plugin bridges the gap between design and development for Rust game servers and applications.  
[https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1541862706806063632/figma-to-rust-by-byte-forge](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1541862706806063632/figma-to-rust-by-byte-forge)

**Key Features:**

* Smart Export System - Visual elements (shapes, groups, frames) automatically export as PNG images, while text converts to Carbon UI labels and buttons
* PNG Optimization - Elements with identical names share the same PNG file, eliminating duplicates and reducing file sizes
* Image Library Integration - Built-in support for Rust's Image Library plugin for faster loading times
* One-Click Downloads - Download all generated PNGs as a ZIP file plus the complete .cs Carbon UI plugin code
* Precise Positioning - Maintains exact positioning, colors, fonts, and styling from your Figma design
* Button Detection - Automatically identifies button elements and generates proper click handlers
* Web-Ready URLs - Configure your PNG base URL for seamless web server integration

**Perfect for:**

* Rust game server UI development
* Carbon UI plugin creators
* Game developers using Oxide framework
* Teams wanting to streamline design-to-code workflow

**How it works:**

* Design your UI in Figma
* Select the elements you want to export
* Configure your PNG base URL and class name
* Export to get optimized PNGs + complete Carbon UI C# code
* Upload PNGs to your server and deploy the generated plugin

¬†

**Usage Guide**

How Button Detection Works

The plugin automatically detects elements as buttons if their name:

    Ends with .button (e.g., ""Play.button"")
    Contains ""button"" anywhere (e.g., ""PlayButton"")
    Contains ""btn"" anywhere (e.g., ""menu_btn"")

**Button Types**

Text Buttons: Text elements with button names become transparent clickable buttons

Visual Button Groups: Groups/frames with button names export as PNG backgrounds with invisible clickable overlays

¬†

¬†**Requirements & Dependencies**

1. ImageLibrary Plugin (Recommended)

Install ImageLibrary on your Rust server for better performance:

* Faster image loading
* Memory caching
* Better server optimization

1. PNG Hosting (Required)

You must upload exported PNG files to a publicly accessible location:

* Web server (recommended):¬†[http://yourserver.com/ui-images/](http://yourserver.com/ui-images/)
* Dropbox public links:¬†https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/...
* GitHub Pages/CDN:¬†https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...
* Local server (testing):¬†[http://localhost/images/](http://localhost/images/)

¬†

¬†**Important Rules**

Unique Names Only: Every element must have a unique name in Figma to avoid conflicts and PNG overwrites

Elements with identical names share the same PNG file (optimization feature)

¬†

**Setup Process**

* Design UI in Figma with unique element names
* Add .button suffix to clickable elements
* Configure PNG Base URL in plugin
* Export selection ‚Üí Download ZIP + .cs file
* Upload PNGs to your web server
* Install ImageLibrary + your generated plugin on Rust server

¬†

The plugin generates complete Carbon UI code with automatic click handlers for all button elements.

  
No manual UI coding required - go from Figma design to functional Rust UI in seconds!

Inside sat an engagement ring.Hope bloomed in my chest.It was my birthday. I thought maybe‚Äîfinally‚Äîhe was ready to claim me as his Luna.But that hope shattered the moment I opened my social feed. There he was‚ÄîAlpha Stuart‚Äîseated across from another woman at an upscale, candlelit restaurant. Their hands entwined, smiles exchanged like shared secrets. The post was already gaining traction among the pack circles.My heart in my throat, I hailed a cab and headed straight there, fur damp from the rain still clinging to my coat. When I arrived, the door had barely swung open before I saw him.He was down on one knee.Before her.The crowd around them erupted in cheers. Warriors. Elders. All present, all clapping, all celebrating his public proposal to someone who wasn't me.I didn't scream or shift in fury, though I felt Nira‚Äîmy wolf‚Äîsnarling beneath my skin, begging for release. But after all the betrayals, the broken promises, I'd grown quiet.I stepped outside and calmly dialed my father.""Dad,"" I said, my voice steady despite the ache, ""I've decided to accept the engagement with the Moonhowl Pack. Let's begin preparing the mating ceremony.""He paused, then let out a breath I hadn't realized he'd been holding.""My good girl,"" he said with a prideful warmth. ""You've finally come to your senses. Mating isn't just about desire‚Äîit's about legacy, strength, the union of bloodlines. Stuart was always too soft.""I gave a quiet ""Mm"" in reply, standing beneath the eaves of the restaurant's glowing entrance, the cheers inside muffled by glass. Through the window, I watched Stuart slip the ring on her finger. His hand trembled slightly. Then, as he stood, his eyes met mine across the crowd.A flicker of recognition. Of guilt. Maybe even regret.But he didn't come after me.He simply took her hand and led her back to their table.Rose petals scattered the white linen. Champagne flutes caught the golden light. A soft piano melody filled the air, rich with romance. Everything I'd once imagined for us.In six years together, Alpha Stuart had never taken me somewhere like that. Never made me feel seen beyond closed doors.I turned and walked away.Inside, I could still hear his friends‚Äîthe same wolves who used to nod at me like I was a stranger in my own mate's shadow‚Äîraising their glasses.""You two are perfect together! Finally!""""To true love and a blessed union‚Äîcheers!""I gave a bitter smile. Six years at Stuart's side, and not a single one of them knew I existed. But they all knew her. Her name. Her bloodline.The ache in my chest twisted sharper.Back at my apartment, a courier was waiting at the door, holding a pristine cake box.""Miss, your mate went all out,"" the delivery man beamed. ""This is the finest moonberry cake we carry‚Äîand he even wrote the card himself!""I took it with numb hands.The card read: Happy birthday to my sweetheart. May today bring you joy and everything you desire.Lies wrapped in fond words.He had remembered my birthday. But chose to spend it proposing to someone else.I stepped inside, set the cake down untouched, and collapsed onto the couch. My chest was tight, my vision blurred with unshed tears.This space still held traces of our shared life‚Äîhis scent on the throw pillows, the photo of us in the hallway, the extra pair of boots by the door.But the bond was broken.He'd chosen another.Even the smell of sugar from the cake made my stomach churn.I sat there for what felt like hours, the silence pressing in around me like snow. My wolf curled inward, wounded and quiet.Then‚Äîjust as I began to drift into that hollow numbness‚ÄîThe front door creaked open.Chapter¬†2The door swung open with a thud, and in walked Alpha Stuart, travel-worn but unbothered, as if nothing had shattered between us.In his hand was a fresh bouquet of lisianthus‚Äîmy favorite.He strode toward me with that familiar confidence, no trace of guilt in his expression. Just certainty. Entitlement.""Mandy,"" he said, smiling slightly, ""I brought you these. Lisianthus. You always said they reminded you of devotion.""Lisianthus‚Äîthe flower that symbolizes loyal and singular love.How ironic, coming from a male who had just pledged his future to another.I took the bouquet, my face unreadable. No outburst. No shift. No scene.He must've taken that as forgiveness, because he relaxed and started talking‚Äîas if we were having a casual conversation over coffee, not standing in the wreckage of our bond.""Olivia‚Ä¶"" he began, ""she has bone cancer. She doesn't have much time left. Her only wish is to be mated to me.""He didn't pause. Didn't flinch.""We've known each other since we were pups. I couldn't turn her down‚Äînot when she's facing death. So‚Ä¶ I'll be completing the engagement ceremony with her in three days.""Then he added, as if appealing to my sense of reason, ""You've always been understanding. I knew you'd get it.""His tone wasn't apologetic. It was rehearsed. Like he was delivering an official pack decree.Engaged in three days.How perfect.I'd be leaving in three days, too.I gave a soft nod.Alpha Stuart had always hated my emotional side‚Äîsaid I was too demanding, too sensitive, always needing to hear that he still loved me. So I stopped asking. I trained myself to stay quiet. To endure.Now I didn't yell. I didn't cry. I didn't even ask if he still loved me.And that seemed to shake him more than any tantrum ever had.He looked at me oddly, as if unsure how to respond to my silence.""I'll be moving out tomorrow,"" he continued. ""I'll be staying with Olivia while she goes through treatment. You'll have to manage on your own.""""She needs me more than you do.""There it was‚Äîhis final justification.I gave him a small smile and set the bouquet aside.The scent of her clung to him‚Äîsweet, floral, sickening. A smear of lipstick stained his collar, bold and brazen.He stepped closer, hand reaching up to touch my face.I turned away.His hand hovered in the air for a moment before falling back to his side. Frustration flickered across his face, but he said nothing more. Just turned and walked out the door.When it clicked shut behind him, I moved.The lisianthus went straight into the trash. So did the untouched birthday cake.I no longer wanted his flowers.I no longer wanted Alpha Stuart.And whatever love or comfort this apartment once held had died the moment he chose someone else.This place was just a shell now. A den long abandoned.I started packing.Chapter¬†3The next morning, I sat at my desk beneath the sterile white glow of overhead lights and printed out my resignation letter.Alpha Stuart and I had met during our university years. Back then, he was charming, driven‚Äîwith dreams bigger than his rank. After graduation, he founded the Shadowclaw Pack to prove himself, and I‚Äîyoung and in love‚Äîfollowed him. I turned down the future my parents had mapped out for me in the pack's elite advisory council just to start from the bottom alongside him.We built everything together.I had once dared to mention the idea of mating. Not directly, just gentle hints‚Äîsmall questions tucked into quiet moments. But Stuart always brushed them off. Said he hadn't made a name for himself yet. That my Alpha father would never approve of someone like him.""Career first, then the mating ceremony,"" he used to say, voice low and reassuring.To ease his burden, I worked behind the scenes, slowly softening my parents' expectations. I never let Stuart know how influential my lineage really was, afraid he'd feel small in comparison. I hid my power so he could grow into his.And he had.He was now Alpha Stuart. Respected. Admired.When I found that velvet box in his pocket, I'd let myself believe‚Äîjust once‚Äîthat he was finally ready. Ready to stand beside me, not just in private, but as my mate.I'd been so foolish.Nicole passing by paused at my screen, eyes widening as she caught the words on the letter.""Mandy? You're resigning? But you're next in line for Beta! Why leave now, out of nowhere?""I gave her a polite smile. ""I'm getting married soon. I might be moving to another pack.""Nicole, perked up instantly. ""Congratulations! Seems like love's going around these days. Did you see Alpha Stuart's engagement post last night? He and his fianc√©e look amazing together.""She sighed dreamily. ""They're childhood sweethearts, right? Fated mate. That kind of bond‚Ä¶ rare in our kind.""My fingers froze on the keyboard. My smile wavered.I opened my phone and checked Stuart's profile‚Äîonly to find I'd been blocked.Not just from his personal account. Even his professional backup account, the one we used for work communication, now held nothing but cold, formal exchanges. He'd scrubbed away every trace of us.Just then, the elevator doors chimed open.Alpha Stuart walked in, tall and composed, exuding command. Olivia stood at his side, radiant, her skin glowing with health. She was all smiles, not at all like someone battling bone cancer.They walked like a mated pair‚Äîtoo close, too synchronized.Stuart cleared his throat and addressed the room with his usual authority.""This is Olivia , my Beta. Please welcome her. I expect everyone to work in harmony.""Nicole blinked, caught off guard. She glanced between Olivia and me before stepping forward with a tight smile.""Olivia, welcome.""I said nothing.My hands tightened around the paper in my lap‚Äîmy resignation letter now crumpled at the edges.Stuart's gaze slid toward me, sharp with disapproval.""Mandy,"" he said coldly, ""everyone else has welcomed the Beta. What's with your attitude?""Before I could respond, Olivia stepped forward and extended her hand toward me, her smile polite.""It seems we'll be working together now. I hope we can get along.""I reached out automatically, driven more by reflex than civility.But Stuart reached out faster‚Äîgrabbing Olivia's hand and gently pulling it back.""You don't need to lower yourself to the junior staff. You're in leadership now.""He placed a guiding hand on the small of her back. ""Come on. I'll show you around.""And just like that, they walked away‚Äîback straight, heads high.Leaving me there with my hand suspended awkwardly in the air.Frozen. Exposed.Like a fool.Chapter¬†4Nicole plopped down beside me, still buzzing from the earlier spectacle, her lunchbox already halfway open.""Mandy, did you see that? That's Alpha Stuart's fianc√©e! She walked in like she owned the whole building!""She leaned closer, lowering her voice to a dramatic whisper. ""The diamond necklace she wore? Alpha Stuart gifted it to her yesterday‚Äîrumor says it's worth over a million! Moonlit-cut gemstone, rare as a full-blooded Luna.""I gave a faint nod, eyes still fixed on my screen.""But honestly,"" Nicole continued, ""this promotion thing? It's too blatant. You've been here for five years. Everyone knows you're the backbone of this place. And yet Stuart just‚Ä¶ handed your Warrior over to her? Like you were never even in the running.""Her voice was laced with frustration on my behalf, but I barely heard her.I'd already decided to leave. Olivia's flashy arrival just confirmed how thoroughly I'd been erased.I gathered the handover documents and my resignation letter, then rose from my seat.Knocking once, I entered Alpha Stuart's office.""Come in,"" he called, voice cold and clipped.I walked in and placed the files neatly on his desk‚Äîeverything organized, labeled, final. My resignation letter sat right on top.He skimmed the documents, flipping through with increasing agitation. His brows drew tighter with each page until he finally looked up at me‚Äîlips curled into a cruel smirk.""Mandy, I really thought you'd grown up. Stopped running to the Alpha Council over every little thing. But here we are again.""With a sudden motion, he hurled the stack of files across the room. Papers scattered like feathers in a storm.I flinched but didn't react. Just knelt calmly, silently, and began picking them up one by one from the polished floor.Above me, he ranted like an Alpha scolding a misbehaving pup.""So what if you lost the promotion? Olivia studied the same major as I did. I trust her judgment. That's why I made her Beta . What gives you the right to question that?""I gathered the papers quietly, re-stacking them with care, then returned them to his desk.""I'm not questioning it,"" I replied evenly. ""I'm resigning. That's all.""He had once said he didn't want to feel small next to my name. So I hid everything‚Äîmy lineage, my influence, my second degree. I studied late into the night, took on every grueling project just to keep pace with him, to share his world.And in the end, none of it mattered.He never saw me. Only the reflection of himself in someone else.Alpha Stuart crossed his arms, sneering down at me.""You think you're that valuable? I've already reassigned you. From now on, you'll report directly to Olivia. Learn from her. Maybe you'll actually become useful.""I gave him a faint smile, steady and unwavering.""My time's worth more than that. I don't plan on spending it learning things I never cared for, under someone I don't respect.""His eyes flashed, temper flaring.""Fine! Then get out!"" he snapped, standing so fast his chair nearly toppled. ""Let's see who'd even take you now!""I didn't respond.I just turned and walked out.Six years of my life, six years of quiet sacrifices, handed to someone who never planned to keep them. I might as well have given them to a mutt.But no more.No more chasing after Alpha Stuart.And definitely no more playing second to Olivia",1,1756490515.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Around midnight the wind picked up in a way I hadn‚Äôt experienced before. At first it was just a steady breeze, but soon the gusts were rocking my RV like it was a boat on rough water.

I could hear the awning straining even though it was retracted, and every creak of the frame made me wonder if something was about to snap. I sat there debating whether to pack up and drive off in the middle of the night or just wait it out. The desert has this eerie emptiness when you‚Äôre alone, and I kept reminding myself that the RV was built for worse conditions than this.

Around two in the morning I gave up on sleep and brewed some coffee. Watching the sand whip past my headlights was surreal, almost like being in a snowstorm except every particle was dust. By dawn the winds finally eased, and when I stepped outside the RV was still standing proud but completely coated in a layer of fine grit. I looked like I had spent the night in a sandblaster.

It was one of those moments that reminded me living in an RV is not just about pretty sunsets and cozy campsites. Sometimes it‚Äôs about testing your patience, your nerves, and even your faith in the bolts holding your rig together. The funny part is, by the next night I was already laughing about it, and that‚Äôs probably why I keep chasing this lifestyle.",1,1756490266.0,RVLiving,2,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for about 1.5 years. I really love her a lot, but in the last 6 months our relationship feels stuck in a cycle of conflict and mistrust, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Some months ago, we had a big fight about a female colleague of mine. She was of similar age, and I went to get food with her sometimes, or a coffee, and I would say it was/ is a very friendly colleagueship. But I would have never done anything with her in a flirty way, or even do something with her out of work, because I never wanted anything from this colleague and love my girlfriend. 
She felt like I never talked about this colleague, and thought this to be suspicious. At one point, she wanted to see my messages with this colleague, which were friendly at times yes, but I didn‚Äòt consider them wrong (was like ‚Äûwanna have lunch?‚Äú or ‚Äûshit I got the metro without air conditioning‚Äú). In retrospective, yes, I should maybe have mentioned that I have a good time with this colleague, but I think I honestly was afraid of her reaction and know that she can be very jealous/ possessive (we had some fights before ofc)
We didn‚Äòt have contact for 2 weeks then, and when I couldn‚Äôt anymore I called her and I was talked into confronting my colleague about this, setting strict limits. I didn‚Äòt want to do this because I don‚Äòt feel anything for this colleague, and I know that she feels the same (without ever having talked about it) but I was afraid of losing her so I did. 
I thought it is solved now, but this topic keeps coming up.
She told me she can never forget it, and since then, whenever she feels bad, it usually comes back to that situation. I try to be understanding, but I feel like no matter what I do, I‚Äôm always accused of something and I will always do something wrong or react in a wrong way for her. 

For example, last weekend she saw I got a notification on Snapchat and immediately assumed it was from another girl (it was just an ad). These situations turn into big fights where she constantly threatens to break up or does break up until I try to explain and apologise again, and I feel like I‚Äôm constantly walking on eggshells, afraid of making mistakes, provoking a fight and losing her eventually.

Most recently, we had a trip planned. The night before, she said she doesn‚Äòt feel good and feels like she could have a panic attack. I was busy at work still and afterwards in stress because I had to catch a train so we get the car for our trip. I asked her if she felt better now after some time, told her to rest and try to relax, that everything is okay. I also asked her if she had food already that day. When she said no I offered to order Ubereats for her, which she declined. I finished packing for the trip and rushed to the train when she suddenly accused me how wrong it was that I didn‚Äòt offer to come by, and ask why exactly she is feeling bad. 
In fact, I didn‚Äòt ask her this, because I felt like it will be again because of that situation with the colleague or anything else that I did. 
Before I could reply to these accusations, she further said she doesn‚Äôt feel good, and that the trip is cancelled. 
I got quite emotional and angry myself then and replied that I am stressed myself, and of course I don‚Äòt want her to feel bad and unsupported and that, if I am not giving her what she needs in that moment, she should communicate it with me instead of accusing. I told her it‚Äòs sad that she wants to cancel the trip, but I acknowledge it.

She didn‚Äôt text me back and I had to go on the trip alone. 
After two days, I sent her one text that I‚Äôm sorry the talk we had didn‚Äòt go as planned for both of us, and that I care about her. No reply.

Before this, we even discussed starting couple‚Äôs therapy, and I actually managed to book us an appointment for October, but I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôll make it that far at this point. At least she hasn‚Äòt accepted the calendar invite yet.

Yesterday, she decided to hide her stories from me on instagram, and I decided to unfollow her because I was constantly checking, constantly overthinking if it is over now or what to do.

I‚Äôm torn right now. On the one hand, I know I could have handled the last fight better and I‚Äôm willing to apologize for that. On the other hand, I feel like she overreacts, doesn‚Äôt meet me halfway, and never says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù herself. I want her to miss me and reach out, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs realistic.

My question is: should I give her more space, or should I try to reach out again and take responsibility for my part? And more broadly ‚Äî i don‚Äòt know whether this relationship might not be healthy for me if I‚Äôm always the one blamed and walking on eggshells (at least that‚Äòs how I feel, she probably feels like she explains it to me, I‚Äôm apologizing and say yes out of fear and then I‚Äôm making similar mistakes again?)

Thanks for any advice, and go ahead if you have more questions :)

Life in suburban Arizona had gotten busy‚Äîwork, family, and bills piled up so fast that my creative spark seemed buried. I kept telling myself I was ‚Äújust taking a break,‚Äù but deep down, I missed that feeling of writing and earning a little extra on the side.

One evening, while scrolling through social media, I stumbled on this platform that promised real pay by doing what I already did online‚Äîchatting. A few clicks later, I decided to try SocialSaleRep‚Äîa system offering training for live chat and affiliate work. The idea of blending social media skills with real income felt like the lifeline I‚Äôd needed.

https://preview.redd.it/3cyo7h8t9xlf1.png?width=6240&format=png&auto=webp&s=5359e35e55a7948c1e4328880152cac2a48dca25

The first couple of days were a mix of excitement and confusion. The training was straightforward, teaching me how to handle customer queries and share product links‚Äîsimple scripts and real scenarios. By the end of the first week, I‚Äôd passed the basic training and taken my first job: helping someone choose a digital book via live chat. Seeing my first paycheck hit my account‚Äîjust $30‚Äîwas surreal. It wasn‚Äôt a gold mine, but it was real, earned from my couch.

By week three, I found my rhythm. I could hop onto a laptop during coffee breaks or after dinner and start chatting‚Äîanswering customer questions, recommending eBooks, and even getting $50 for landing my first ‚Äúlive chat job bonus.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt make me rich overnight, but it added a layer of financial confidence I hadn‚Äôt felt in months.

Within a month, I‚Äôd earned enough to invest back into my blog‚Äîupgrading hosting and finally launching the theme I‚Äôd dreamed about. But more than the money, it gave me control‚Äîflexibility, a way to work on my own schedule, and the reminder that I didn‚Äôt need to pause myself to get through a tough season.",1,1756490192.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

At first, I thought it was just coincidence or her settling in, but over time it‚Äôs become a pattern.

When she first moved in, she quickly became friends with people she met through us. Because I‚Äôve had experiences in the past where friends used me for connections (even getting close with coworkers I wasn‚Äôt close with), I was a bit sensitive to that.

**I am fully aware that these are trivial things but just to add some context**

Then it kept piling up - I‚Äôd buy certain foods, and she‚Äôd start buying the same. I drink a particular coconut water, suddenly she does too. I get into a certain yogurt brand, she‚Äôs on it. I ordered from a specific clothing site, and then she started shopping there as well. I use incense for cultural reasons and explained that to her, and suddenly she picks some up like it‚Äôs a new discovery. I bought a coffee machine because I prefer it to instant, and now she‚Äôs using it every day. I redecorated for a party, and she decorated hers almost the same way (just different colors). Even small things like changing my room layout ‚Äî she changed hers right after.

She even asked my partner to DJ at her party straight after he did mine, which rubbed me the wrong way. The party we DJed for her, she organised for another guy who we did not know at all. I do feel for her because she is a sweet girl and liked him but he had other intentions. So it was surprising when the next day my partner and I see his good friend had spent the night. Disclaimer - Everyone here is an adult and can do what they want. That I have no issue with.

But it did become uncomfortable when my flatmate now says she feels a little bit uncomfortable with my partner‚Äôs friend coming over now that she‚Äôs seeing someone else.

On top of that, she sometimes drops the ball on shared responsibilities (like forgetting bins) but still manages to be chirpy and talk about her birthday plans right when we walk in the door from work without us even getting a chance to put our bags down. And yes the bins still weren‚Äôt taken out at this stage and they didn‚Äôt get collected on time‚Ä¶.

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a bad person - she‚Äôs sweet, positive, and probably just trying to relate ‚Äî but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling of being observed, and it makes me irritable in ways I don‚Äôt like. She also did mention that before she meets somebody, she‚Äôll do her research on socials and bring up certain things she‚Äôs seen on their Instagram as a way to try and get them to relate and connect in conversation.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is just me being overly sensitive, if I‚Äôm in some weird silent competition in my head, or if it‚Äôs valid to feel like my space and individuality are being chipped away.

Sorry team, don‚Äôt use reddit much and just wanted to relate to somebody and get a reality check if I need it. Spread love not hate please ü´∂üèæ

I tried the low histamine diet. I tried the candida diet. I gave up veganism. I only saw improvements with reactions after I started taking pepcid twice daily. But I still struggled with daily life.

I was still tired and anxious all the damn time. Last year I broke down and found a psychiatrist to try another antidepressant (not my first rodeo). Despite sleeping meds and stimulants, however, I was STILL TIRED. I would sleep most of the weekends away, and I would nap during work hours. No amount of coffee was enough. 

I told my primary care physician, who referred me to a sleep specialist. I got a sleep study done, and apparently I stop breathing 10x per night. 

I've had my CPAP for 6 weeks now, and I just realized that my morning grogginess is due to my sleep meds. So now I'm weaning off!! And I'm still able to sleep!

I am quite embarrassed to own a CPAP, and maybe that's why it took me so long to consider sleep apnea as a possibility. But I am excited to finally wake up to my alarm without hitting snooze. And less naps interrupting my day!

1n3e93n,https://i.redd.it/txl15tlxxzlf1.jpeg,Coffee Water vs TWW,"Hey everyone, this is certainly not an in-depth review nor is it scientific in any way, just thought I would share some experience I‚Äôve had lately with coffee water mineral additives. 
I‚Äôve used third wave water for almost 2 years now and have generally been very happy with the light roast formula for the beans I normally buy. I buy a lot of bourbon and SL28 varietals and I‚Äôve been very happy with the sweetness and body I get with the TWW light roast formula.
I‚Äôm generally a slight creature of habit but recently I decided to try Coffee Water brand mineral packets. They only sell one variety, which apparently meets SCA standards. They use separate packets for their minerals as they claim that it helps prevent the minerals from reacting and solidifying overtime. Thus providing a longer self life. I can‚Äôt really speak to that as I don‚Äôt normally keep any of my coffee water additives around long enough to test that theory.
I‚Äôve gone through about 3 gallons of the CW brand water and i‚Äôve been very happy with the results. I very much regret not keeping some of my TWW mix around for direct comparison, that will happen in the future. For now, however, I‚Äôve been quite pleased with the less expensive CW mineral blend.
Per gallonn cost is roughly $1.40 for TWW and $.80 for CW not counting the cost of Zero filtering the water as that is a constant regardless of what additive I use.
I may lean into making my own at some point, but for now I find the ease of use with mineral additives fits my life the best. (Lazy) üòú

\--------------------

Every stop on the march was a moment of reprieve for Vergil.

Horvath did everything the old ghost could, but this was the end of Vergil‚Äôs strength. He‚Äôd fought at the gates, he‚Äôd fought through the courtyard, he‚Äôd even faced the monster that had almost killed Tallah. He couldn‚Äôt remember when was the last time he‚Äôd slept, or eaten a meal, or drank anything but brackish canteen water.

He had nothing more to draw on, no matter how brave a face he put on for Arin and the others.

For the first time since being found by Tallah and Sil, Vergil had no more reserves of strength, no more spunk, no more optimism that he would get up if he dropped. Every stop on the march was a moment where he struggled not to fall on his ass and sleep. Likely forever.

Some of the soldiers had had their flasks filled with the awful healer coffee. He greedily accepted Arin‚Äôs share and drank as much of that as he dared, until his heart hammered his chest so wildly that he couldn‚Äôt even sit still anymore. Whatever energy he drew from that flowed like acid in his veins and sent his ears ringing.

Without the helmet‚Äôs enchantment, still powered by Sil, he‚Äôd be utterly useless.

‚Ä¢ *Eyes up, sprig.*

‚Ä¢ *Ye ain‚Äôt dead, yet.*

‚Ä¢ *Dawn‚Äôs no' that far off.*

‚Ä¢ *Ye‚Äôll be fine if ye just keep walkin‚Äô.*

Vergil almost laughed. The ghost had found a modicum of affection for him, at least in these final moments.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you even bother with me?‚Äù he asked as he marched, trying to keep one foot in front of the other and his chin facing forward. ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve just waited until the helmet passed to someone else.‚Äù

*‚ÄúYe were a worthy lad, sprig. Good head on yer shoulders. Good heart in yer chest. Brimmin' wi' courage, ye were.‚Äù*

The dwarf spoke as if he walked by Vergil‚Äôs side, now flowing easily between messages and speech. If Vergil squinted a bit, he could almost make out the dwarf‚Äôs outline through the gloom, axe and all.

‚ÄúHow? I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Vergil swallowed heavily as they slipped between the trees, the forest engulfing them. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt myself.‚Äù

He got the impression of a disappointed head shake from the shade. Somehow Horvath did not agree with that.

*‚ÄúYe were always yersel', lad. Just... young, is all. Dinnae fash yersel' aboot that. We‚Äôll speak o‚Äô it on the morrow, aye.‚Äù*

But as tired as he was, Vergil couldn‚Äôt quiet his mind. Away from the Rock, on the silent march, with nothing but dread and aches to occupy him, Vergil worried over a lot of things.

There was one question that kept squirming through his thoughts, and he had nobody to ask it to. Maybe if they escaped the Cauldron in one piece and then marched to the Goddess of Healing, Vergil could ask it of her.

*Who am I?*

A day prior he‚Äôd known to that quite well: Vergil Vansce, born on the Gloria Nostra, brought to Edana by Panacea, ally to Tallah Amni and Silestra Adana, probably some degree of insane.

His coming to Edana had been a cosmic mistake that had obfuscated an ancient machine spirit. In spite of that, he‚Äôd managed to thrive somehow, mostly to deny Tallah‚Äôs low expectations of him.

That was who he‚Äôd been on the morning when he‚Äôd walked out onto the training grounds to spar with Arin. Simple Vergil. Eager to prove himself. Happy to have made friends. Ready to lay down his life for anyone that had shown him kindness.

Now‚Ä¶ Vergil was an alien skin occupied by three ghosts, out of which only two had a clear idea of who *they* were. The third couldn‚Äôt trust any of his memories and now wondered at the purpose of his entire existence.

If he laid down, curled up into a ball, and just died, would he be helping the creatures that had placed him there? Or hinder them? Would his dying make things easier for Tallah and Sil? Would it be for the better?

*‚ÄúAye, enough o‚Äô that, sprig.‚Äù*

Something slammed in the back of his head like a shovel. He staggered, tripped over his feet, and kissed a tree he would‚Äôve walked into anyway.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm no' spendin‚Äô my time coddlin‚Äô ye.‚Äù* Horvath sounded disgusted as Vergil struggled to get back to his own feet. *‚ÄúShape up and get on wi‚Äô it. It‚Äôs a long road tae dawn, an‚Äô we‚Äôve nae time for yer greetin‚Äô.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter with you?‚Äù Arin rushed to his side and offered a hand.

Vergil shook his head to clear the explosions of colours from his sight. None of the soldiers laughed. He took Arin‚Äôs hand and rose to his feet, shaking off the mud from his trousers, and the shame of somehow disappointing Horvath. It shook him, somewhat, that the old dwarf was this invested in his well being.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù he said, not even bothering to lie. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this tired in my life.‚Äù

Some of the nearby civilians echoed the sentiment. The march wasn‚Äôt the issue. It was the whole of the day. Like him, many would not manage to get back up again if they stopped moving.

‚ÄúI know what you mean,‚Äù Arin said as they hurried after their squad. ‚ÄúIf we survive, I‚Äôll sleep for a tenday at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll be lucky to get even a day to rest up,‚Äù Vergil grumbled.

Arin smiled. His face had aged years in mere hours. There was no hint of his easy cheer from the siege, just a concerned weariness. Like everyone else, he also buckled under the pressure of the waiting trap. They all knew the forest would be their next proving ground. There was no other way for their passage to go this smoothly. Somewhere on their path, they would be waylaid and decimated, unless Tallah had some spectacular final moment surprise crammed up her sleeve.

Though she was also running on spite alone, carried forward by her ever-burning anger.

Vergil doubted even dawn would prove of any help at this point. Whatever had happened over the night, it had an air of profound change about it. The dreg in him put up resistance, rabidly convinced that it would be rescued by its comrades at any moment. It whispered of what terrible things the other white-faced daemons would do to Tallah and Sil once they came to exact revenge for this indignity.

He was almost asleep on his feet when the creature calling itself Mol‚ÄôAch arrived and began its sermon.

Everything after that happened in a blur. One moment Tallah was grandstanding against the monster, the next Vergil and the others were neck deep in blood dolls and beastmen chunks. People screamed as they were grabbed and pulled upward. Adventurers and soldiers exploded into action, grabbing hold of victims to hack at the monsters gripping them.

Vergil spied Licia being raised into the air as she clung to a child. She stabbed furiously at the spider-like creature until it finally released its grip. Elendine and child crashed back to the ground but were saved by quick reactions from the others.

Uglier things emerged from the dark to be met by Anna‚Äôs brood.

‚ÄúAdvance!‚Äù the old woman next to Tallah yelled over the sudden noise. ‚ÄúFight only if ye need to. Keep the civilians safe.‚Äù

One moment he‚Äôd been ready to collapse.

The next it was as if he‚Äôd shrugged off the entire weight of the world. Vergil raised his weapons, roared in defiance of the night, and leapt into action.

*‚ÄúMore t‚Äô learn sprig,‚Äù* Horvath laughed. *‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt done teachin‚Äô ye. Trust ol‚Äô hammerhead, aye.‚Äù*

Like a switch flipping inside him, Vergil rushed into battle in complete stupor. Thoughts drained from his head. Worries washed away in the flood of adrenaline and undiluted rage. Horvath‚Äôs roar filled his ears as they waded together into the thick of battle.

A part of him idly wondered at this renewed vigour and what else the dwarf could show him. Was this how the old codger had fought his wars? Was he seeing, for the first time, all that Horvath was capable of now that he was in control?

Would the dwarf allow him his freedom? Or had Vergil been freed of one jailer just to be enslaved by another?

He shook his head free of distractions he couldn‚Äôt afford. The first daemon to bypass the cordon of Tallah dolls met its end on his blades, guts spilling out all over his trousers. He swung the axe at a descending club. Biter cleaved straight through the wood, passed it entirely, and lopped off the monster‚Äôs head in a geyser of hot blood. The daemon staggered three more paces but Vergil was already past it, swinging to meet the next victim.

He craved the violence and the blood and the bitter bile rising up from the pit of his stomach. If he could have, he would‚Äôve licked the blood from his axe. Something in him was breaking apart, and it should‚Äôve scared him. His desires revolted him even as he revelled in them, feeling himself crossing over a fine, invisible line.

It wasn‚Äôt enough he had no idea who Vergil Vansce even was anymore, now that boy was turning into a full-blooded berserker. Was it really Horvath‚Äôs doing? Or something deep within, let loose?

It didn‚Äôt matter.

All that matter was the next kill. Then the next. And the next.

Vergil fought his way to the fore of the column, right behind Tallah and Liosse. The sorceress wasn‚Äôt fighting but leading the advance while the dolls were engaged. Sil was near Vilfor, swinging her glowing mace at anything daring her range. Vergil injected himself into the fighting, at Liosse‚Äôs left and ahead of Tallah, forming the tip of their spear, howling for the fight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost out,‚Äù Tallah called out. ‚ÄúThe moment we hit open ground, I want all surviving healers to focus on barriers. I need time to cut over the ravine.‚Äù

Vergil growled. That wasn‚Äôt the mission for him. He rammed his shoulder into some semblance of a spider. It missed him when it dropped from the trees. Compared to the Grefe hunters, this was barely a bug. His axe bit deep into the clusters of eyes, ripped them out, stems and all, then shattered the chitin body. A kick sent the dying creature into a roll from which it did not rise.

Another dropped. It died the same.

The next dropped on him and bit down. Fangs got entangled in the thick weave as Vergil slammed his back into a tree, shaking loose the creature.

Sil was next to him, swinging. A boom resounded as the mace hit the creature and blasted it to chunks, showering both of them in steaming ichor. Like him, she was already moving, not waiting, just fighting. Blood stained her face, already drying, making her into an apparition more frightening than any of the monsters. He‚Äôd never seen the healer so wild-eyed and angry.

She didn‚Äôt help him rise. He managed on his own regardless.

An echo of old fear wormed its way through his guts. Sil was not only fighting, but she was also powering him all the while. It seemed he wasn‚Äôt the only one going through a change.

A glance back showed the column breaking into streams of humanity, flowing by the trees and the ever present fight. Some were taken, grabbed by dropping creatures, yanked away from the crowd. Soldiers grabbed hold of those they could save, pulling them back and skewering the daemons.

Then the dolls caught scent of the tactic and they began climbing the trees. Vergil wanted to follow, aware there was more fighting to be done in the canopy than down in the mud.

He resisted the urge and, instead, howled back for the others to close ranks. Arin saluted with his shield as he bashed a daemon‚Äôs skull in. Licia and her two friends fought like dervishes through the flood, their violence a match for anything the daemons threw their way.

Monsters fell from the trees, Tallah dolls dragging them to the ground. Some shattered as they fell. Some still lived and were hacked apart by anyone holding a weapon.

The dolls even saved two more children, dropping them from up high to be caught mid-fall by Tallah‚Äôs magic. People cheered as the two were swallowed back up by the crowd.

And in the background, the mad noise of the dragon waging war on something. Fire lit up the depths of the forest, consuming the high canopy, spreading unchecked. The mighty beast was on their side, but it was not going to spare their safety any thought.

The world shook again. Vergil felt eyes on him, a quiet amusement and cold breath on his neck.

‚ÄúWe will meet again, little one,‚Äù something whispered in his ear.

He spun in place, weapons up, but there was no one next to him. A daemon swung for his throat but was caught mid-swing by Liosse‚Äôs axe. It dropped to the ground, gurgling blood.

‚ÄúYou will amuse me, when I find you. Do live through tonight. It would be boring otherwise.‚Äù

Vergil‚Äôs skin broke into goose flesh just as Liosse shoved him forward.",2,1756489769.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

A bit of background:
I am with my fiance for 6-7 years,  we have had our ups and downs like everyone does but we have got through it.
I feel like our relationship is stronger than ever. 
Our friends (couple) are having a baby and she is due very soon! 
Since we regularly have conversations about children, to the point he has even got names already. We are in a comfortable position financially (where we are saving up a deposit to buy a house but need to be slightly fugal with our money to do so).

So now I have been having some troubles with my health and put it down to the medication I am on (antidepressants). I have been taking regular pregnancy tests to be on the safe side. 
I took one the other day and I am 2-3 weeks pregnant ! 

We are going to a cafe for coffee tomorrow, how do I break the news?

I could make a small box with hints such as a dad jokes book, a a baby vest and the pregnancy test.
Or do I just say it and hand him the test
Or I can write a loving card.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Baltimore Ravens vs. Buffalo Bills: A Week 1 Showdown of Confidence and Crowd Noise**

The 2025 NFL season‚Äôs most anticipated Week 1 clash pits the **Baltimore Ravens**, fresh off Harbaugh‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is a really good football team‚Äù pep talk, against the **Buffalo Bills**, who‚Äôve been handed a 15-2 projection by SportsLine‚Äôs Eric Cohen like a kid getting a gold star for finishing their broccoli. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up comedian who‚Äôs had one too many coffee shots.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Titans

The Bills are the slight favorites here, sitting at **-1.5 spreads** and **-119 on the moneyline**, which translates to a 54.3% implied probability. The Ravens, meanwhile, are priced at +119, giving them a 45.7% chance to shock the world (or at least Buffalo‚Äôs loud home crowd). The total is locked at **52.5 points**, with the over and under trading at near-even odds.

What does this mean? Simply: this game will be close, scoring will be efficient, and someone‚Äôs kicker will likely win a mini-controversy. The Bills‚Äô edge comes down to home-field advantage (Buffalo‚Äôs Highmark Stadium is as loud as a rock concert where the band is your ex‚Äôs new partner) and a defense that‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äú15-2 in Eric Cohen‚Äôs crystal ball.‚Äù The Ravens, however, are the ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù of the AFC‚Äîranked among the top two rosters by Chris Simms, who‚Äôs seen enough film to know Lamar Jackson can outrun your Netflix password.

### Digest the News: Harbaugh‚Äôs Confidence vs. Buffalo‚Äôs ‚Äú15-2‚Äù Hocus-Pocus

John Harbaugh isn‚Äôt just confident‚Äîhe‚Äôs the kind of confident that wears a suit to a BBQ and still expects to pick the best ribs. He praised his roster‚Äôs ‚Äúgood football team‚Äù vibes, though it‚Äôs unclear if ‚Äúvibes‚Äù are now an official NFL strategy. The Ravens‚Äô quiet training camp has fans whispering like they‚Äôre solving a cryptic crossword, but with Lamar Jackson, Jaire Alexander, and rookie Malaki Starks, their talent is as undeniable as gravity.

The Bills, on the other hand, are leaning o

But unlike traditional machine, for flair we have to pour water from kettle into brew head.
So my question is, when people referring to temperature for flair, do they mean the water temperature in the kettle, or the actual water temperature inside the brew chamber (which can be measured by insert thermometer before attach the piston. If latter, I seem to have difficulty to get it more than 90 degrees.

1n3e4mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1n3e4mi/two_months_update/,Two months Update,"Long-time lurker, sharing my journey so far.

Quick background: 40s male, long-time lifter and fitness guy, natty (no judgment), besides reta, currently taking creatine (10g/day), multivite, & shilajit. 6'3, starting weight 228-230, 18-20% BF%. Generally, in pretty good shape to begin with, doing this out of curiosity and tryna get 6-pack back at 40+!

I started July at 0.5mg 2x/wk -- I noticed slight appetite suppression/full sooner, then after second shot, started to get intermittent feeling of lump in my throat, almost like I ate too much and/or swallowed air. I was sort of concerned, but read that it was relatively normal. Stayed at that dose for two weeks, scale moved around, didn't feel like I was making much progress, maybe 1 lb/week, down to 228. At the time, I was kinda disappointed that this ""miracle drug"" wasn't working miracles, as a couple pounds loss is normal weekly variation for me, but I think my expectations were just unrealistic.

Given slow progress, I bumped to 0.5mg, 3x/wk for the next two weeks. On the plus side, the lump in throat feeling went away, appetite suppression stayed, but if anything felt like it wasn't working as well. I finished July at 226, which again I was unhappy with seeing other peoples results, and again probably was somewhat unrealistic going into this. I definitely noticed the food noise had gone away, but I was eating less, eating clean and probably seeing worse results than if I'd done a normal cut.

At week #5, I bumped to 1mg 3x/wk -- I can't remember if it was here or closer to week #4, but I started to get noticeable skin sensitivity. Mostly on my thigh where my shorts rub on the outside of my leg, not super painful, maybe a 2 out of 10, but noticeable. The appetite suppression definitely picked up, and I noticed at times it would be hard to eat.  Throughout I tried to have at least two protein shakes/day, just to keep my protein levels up, but even those got harder to take down. Here I started to see weight loss a bit maybe dropping 3 more lbs to 223.

Then the last two weeks, I've been at 1.5mg 3x/wk and now I can really feel what I assume is the Glucagon receptor agonist action working. First, I'm down 5 lbs in the last two weeks, weighing at 218 this morning, so the weight loss has accelerated, but how its happening and how I feel is different. I basically feel like my metabolism has spiked quite a bit -- I don't have food noise per se, but I definitely got my appetite back and as a result have been eating more, and also because of life getting in the way (vacations/work), not been eating as clean as I might normally.....yet still seeing weight loss. It basically feels like my body is churning through calories while I sleep, so I wake up starving or even get hunger pangs in the night -- every morning it feels like I fasted yesterday. I drink a full nalgene of water and have a coffee and I'm good to go, but its again a noticeable thing.

In terms of muscle/strength loss, I assume some lean tissue loss, but my strength has held up well and I don't even notice as much intra-workout fatigue as I normally would on a cut. The only think I notice is some blood sugar drop when I workout, and I've had to add intra-workout carbs to keep going.

Overall, my review of reta is probably a ""miracle drug"", but in a different way than I thought. Obviously, its not as instant as I expected, and maybe that's because I was fairly lean to start with, but I've now cut \~10 lbs in two months, and from a mental load standpoint, didn't really have to think about it. Normally, if I did a cut like this, I'd have to gut the house of bad food, meal prep, and manage my social calendar to avoid alcohol or food temptations, along with constantly thinking about food....and with reta I've done NONE of that.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arizona Cardinals vs. New Orleans Saints: A Tale of Souffl√©s and Sprinters**

The Arizona Cardinals, favored by -6.5 points, are being backed by the books like a baker relies on a rolling pin‚Äîfirmly, but with a hint of existential dread. Their implied win probability (75.7% at 1.35 odds) suggests they‚Äôre the NFL‚Äôs version of a coffee order: ‚ÄúSure, decaf. *Whatever you say.*‚Äù Yet, as the old adage goes, ‚ÄúHome teams win 55% of games‚Ä¶ unless they‚Äôre the Cardinals, in which case, bring a flashlight and patience.‚Äù

The Saints, meanwhile, are priced at +3.3 (23.5% implied probability), the sportsbook equivalent of a ‚ÄúGuess who?‚Äù photo at a family reunion‚Äîunderestimated, but not *entirely* forgotten. Their QB situation reads like a Netflix casting call: **Spencer Rattler**, the ‚Äúlegit‚Äù starter, and **Tyler Shough**, the ‚Äúlegit‚Äù guy who scored a touchdown on a 4.9-second 40-yard dash (per one fan‚Äôs sarcastic tweet). Shough‚Äôs preseason heroics‚Äîa 11-yard TD run against the Broncos‚Äîearned him the ‚ÄúPlay of the Day‚Äù honor, which is either a badge of honor or a cry for help, depending on how you feel about QB-by-committee strategies.

### The Numbers: A Spreadsheet of Sorrow

* **Cardinals‚Äô Road Struggles**: In 2024, Arizona went 2-6 away from home, a record soÊÉ® that even the most ardent fan would trade it for a lifetime supply of Gatorade. Their defense? A sieve that could pass for a colander at a Renaissance fair.
* **Saints‚Äô QB Legs**: Rattler can tuck and run; Shough can outrun the plot of a Netflix true-crime doc. Together, they form the NFL‚Äôs most thrilling ‚ÄúWhich One‚Äôs It?‚Äù game.
* **The Spread**: Arizona‚Äôs -6.5 line is as fragile as a souffl√© at a food fight. If the Saints‚Äô mobile Q

NeverMore

For as long as Christina Ricci‚Äô a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina‚Äô Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina‚Äô stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven‚Äô as it beckoned for Christina‚Äô on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina‚Äô never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn‚Äôt have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina‚Äô continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina‚Äô once again saying 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina‚Äô 

‚ÄúWhy go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him‚Äù

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

‚Äú Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina‚Äô wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849‚Äô when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

‚ÄúWho Killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô‚Äù

That they just might find out! But as Christina‚Äô stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven‚Äô off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina‚Äô now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven‚Äô Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina‚Äô just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina‚Äô Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven‚Äô calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina‚Äô now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô could hear the Raven‚Äô crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn‚Äôt good enough for Christina‚Äô as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina‚Äô was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe?‚Äù

But Christina‚Äô being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina‚Äô Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina‚Äô was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her. Guessing that‚Äôs why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

‚ÄúI swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!‚Äù

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it‚Äôs like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It‚Äôs like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I‚Äôm just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn‚Äôt be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina‚Äô would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn‚Äôt much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina‚Äô stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I‚Äôm going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn‚Äôt so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn‚Äôt get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy‚Äôs apartment. Jimmy‚Äô was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina‚Äô questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn‚Äôt know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn‚Äôt know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina‚Äô then thought to herself 

‚ÄúWell no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!‚Äù

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy‚Äô sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn‚Äôt going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina‚Äô then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy‚Äôs body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven‚Äô flew into an open window landing on it‚Äôs bottom frame as it the crowed 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Like she said, Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina‚Äô didn‚Äôt mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny‚Äô a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina‚Äô would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina‚Äô then thought to her herself, at least Johnny‚Äô knew how to please someone. But as Christina‚Äô then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy‚Äô With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!‚Äù 

With Christina‚Äô then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

‚ÄúLook. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy‚Äô much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn‚Äôt into drugs Johnny‚Äô he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don‚Äôt have to be so snarky you know‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

‚ÄúLook! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn‚Äôt know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn‚Äôt kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúSomething else! What do you mean something else!‚Äù

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As Christina‚Äô then looked back at him curious like then saying 

‚ÄúWhat! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina‚Äô saying to her 

‚ÄúYeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!‚Äù

But as Christina‚Äô then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven‚Äô saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina‚Äô stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang‚Äô wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang‚Äô then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

‚ÄúFor insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

With Chang‚Äô now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang‚Äô

‚ÄúSo a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúWho are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?‚Äù

As the figure then said to Chang‚Äô 

‚ÄúIs it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then replied back saying to him

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!‚Äù

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang‚Äô saying to him

‚ÄúOh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúTell me what!‚Äù

As the figure then replied back to Chang‚Äô saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang‚Äô letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang‚Äô was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina‚Äô not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina‚Äô being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina‚Äô soon found herself on the way scene as Christina‚Äô continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina‚Äô stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven‚Äô Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Standing there now looking at the Raven‚Äô just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina‚Äô now with more questions than answers, As Christina‚Äô then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city‚Äôs landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny‚Äô! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

‚ÄúThe four other people that was with you and Jimmy‚Äô were they the ones murdered the last four nights‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

‚ÄúLook! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots‚Äù! 

With Christina‚Äô just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

‚Äú Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!‚Äù

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina‚Äô would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city‚Äôs night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

‚ÄúI have became insane! to a world that wants to know!‚Äù More than they should know!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to know? My love!

As Christina‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúDo I want to know what‚Äù?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40‚Äô with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina‚Äô more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don‚Äôt want to know?

With her again asking him

‚Äúknow what?‚Äù

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

‚ÄúTo know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know‚Äù

And desired to know more Christina‚Äô did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina‚Äô was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina‚Äôs body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

‚ÄúTo know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.‚Äù

The desire was here, Christina‚Äô thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

‚Äú I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina‚Äô was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina‚Äô heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina‚Äô could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

‚ÄúTonight my love I will know you as you desire!‚Äù

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina‚Äô body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina‚Äôs cheek, As Christina‚Äô lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding her rubbing his body up against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

With Christina now feeling his sweat slowly sliding her hands all across his body as he then placed her hands around his back. As Christina gave him a look followed by a grin before moving her hands up behind his head. 

Christina‚Äô could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci‚Äô saying

‚ÄúDam! I would give up hell just to be in her!‚Äù 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina‚Äô had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina‚Äô asking her

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô now looking at him saying 

‚ÄúKnow what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then asking 

‚ÄúWho?

As he then just laughed as he said

‚ÄúI did!

‚ÄúI killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Just before it flew off into the night

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci‚Äô then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

A girl we know came in with her dog and soon after the cafe filled up with random customers. 
I was feeling pretty brain dead because of a breakdown the day before and just feeling low energy and out of it. So I was on my phone mostly and catching little pieces of conversations very randomly. 
The girl with the dog was saying g something to a guy about how her dog loved men and was over excited about them. 
I have that adhd symptom where I finished over people sentences in mt head and say my answer before they‚Äôve finished so I literally thought she was going to say she really doesn‚Äôt like men, so I mumbled to my self me too girl. But then it registered that she said the opposite of that. But I knew no one was listening to me because I usually get talked over there anyway. 
Well my husband was like did you say something. And I was like no it wasn‚Äôt important, because in my head, I heard her wrong and no one was listening to me anyway. 
When we got home he was super pissed and I didn‚Äôt know what was going on so I asked him if I upset him and he mentioned what I said something earlier, and I told him again, it was a non important thing that I just mumbled to myself because it really didn‚Äôt matter. Then he said he‚Äôs not stupid and he heard something. So I was what he heard and he said he‚Äôs didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 
Now everything is coming back to me and he‚Äôs definitely thinking that I was saying that I go cray over men too. But I was actually not thinking, feeling brain dead and overwhelmed, and said something out of turn that was the opposite of my intention. 
I‚Äôm shaking and crying because he get so mean when he‚Äôs angry and has a history of thinking I‚Äôm cheating on him or flirting with other guys when I never have. 
This was literally a one off brain off comment that I literally thought no one heard and I knew it was wrong when it happened because I jumped the gun on what the girl said. 
How do I approach him and tell him that I don‚Äôt like other guys, I don‚Äôt care about other guys, I literally just wasn‚Äôt thinking?",0,1756489240.0,whatdoIdo,0,0.5,False
1n3dzz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n3dzz3/all_the_riches_in_the_world/,All the riches in the world,"After it all happened, I could never explain just what about the little wooden jewelry box had caught my eye. It was simple and unornamented.

When questioned about what was inside it, Maggie, the antique shop‚Äôs keeper, hesitated before speaking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a collection of old silver, mostly jewelry and coins.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúSo a few thousand dollars, I suppose?‚Äù I went to put the box back. 

‚ÄúActually, not today. Today it‚Äôs on sale. You can get it for about $700. It‚Äôs been here for quite a while and I‚Äôve been trying to get rid of it.‚Äù That gave me pause.

This story isn't easy to tell. My memories have proved to be somewhat fragmented. What follows might not be the most straightforward retelling of events, But it reflects what I lived. Everything started that day in the antique shop. Just bear with me, if you will.

Maggie and I go back a little. I started visiting her shop a couple of years ago and over that time had purchased everything from a 1960s toy piano to some original Mackintosh parts from the 1980s. Occasionally, I had gotten discounts on random stuff supposedly for being a loyal customer. 

‚ÄúWhy so low?‚Äù I asked.

Maggie smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been coming here regularly for years. I think I can do this one small thing in return for your business.‚Äù

Alarm bells are probably ringing for some reading this right now. But in truth, I found it hard to be suspicious of this woman. She was very particular about the things she accepted to sell. I know that because I've sold her stuff before. It never crossed my mind that the jewelry could be fake.

I don't know if any of you have guessed yet, but I'm one of those people that buys things and sells them at higher prices. Typically, I like to find things in need of some restoration. If that doesn't cost me too much, I can jack up the price pretty significantly when I'm done with it and still feel like I'm giving enough to the buyer. But there were exceptions to this, like today. Several antiques made from silver priced at a mere 700 bucks felt like the best opportunity I'd had to upsell in a while.

I opened the box to give what was inside a look. Several rings, two necklaces, a cup, and some irregularly shaped pieces of metal tumbled onto the checkout counter. It looked like silver. Surely it was real.

I picked up one of the larger silver chunks. The thing was trying very hard to be a circle, but failing. On its uneven surface, I could make out a design of sorts depicting a castle and next to it the image of what I now know was a lion. Encircling these was a shield, which separated the symbols into quadrants. To the left of the shield was the letter P, and to the right was the letter D. The lower part of the shield contained a couple of other symbols.

Maggie came up beside me. ‚ÄúThose are old Spanish coins. This one you see was their largest denomination, the eight reales. These were struck by hammers, so they're all a little uneven and some are cracked. It's quite rare to see any silver this old that looks like it was minted yesterday.‚Äù She laughed and dropped the coin back into the box.

Later, I put on both necklaces and two rings. Most of the rings were undecorated. One of them had designs on it reminiscent of the Spanish coins. And another one just had some weird-looking shapes engraved in it. The necklaces were more strange. They were simple, thin silver chains, although the links themselves were hollow pieces of metal strung through with a cord. One of the necklaces was a cross, the other was a tiny pendant representing what on closer inspection appeared to be a man holding some sort of implements in his hands.

It occurred to me that it would probably be best to put each piece up individually for sale. I'd recently been in a car accident, and both my car and my body had needed repairs that I was now slowly paying off. But surely I could enjoy wearing 300-year-old jewelry for a couple of days at least.

I started to get compliments at work. For once, people wanted to talk to me. One guy, who I knew to be a silver collector mainly because he took any and every opportunity to talk about it, pulled me aside to say that if I were curious about the silver‚Äôs origin, I could bring him one of the coins. In the same sentence, he told me about a nice, fancy Italian place nearby that we could grab dinner at if I wanted. I wasn't very interested in that proposition, so I told him that I might take him up on that at some point in my life. 

A few days after I began wearing the jewelry, the dreams started. All I remember now are brief moments and impressions. Tunnels of some sort underground. Dark spaces illuminated by oil lamps and candles. Hammers, chisels, pickaxes, coughing. The shouting of workers. Distant sounds of earth shifting, maybe even falling. We chipped away at the rock that imprisoned us in hopes of something better. Over and over, these dreams repeated. I began to dread sleep.

I found the silver cup on my counter right next to the coffee machine in the early hours of the second morning following the dreams. I must have left it there at some point, though I had no memory of doing this, nor did I have any recollection of it being there before that very moment. But what the hell? A person only lives once. One may as well take the opportunity to drink their morning brew from a silver cup if it is presented to them.

The cup was one item that I hadn't paid much attention to. My fingers traced the floral designs on its rounded surface. It was cool to the touch as I lifted it from the counter, but began to warm almost immediately in my hand.

The cup's design was like a goblet's, although it was not particularly tall. It was wide at the top, but tapered down to a stem for holding. Below that, the base flared out a bit to offer it more support. I could feel something engraved on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was a set of initials. I could see my reflection inside the cup, although the edges of my face were curved somewhat. A minute later, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. A splash of milk went in, then some sweetener.

As I brought the cup to my mouth, I had a strange flashback to that one gruesome scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where what's his name? Wallis? Donald? Whoever he is, he drinks from a cup which he presumes to be the Holy Grail only to end up in a pile of bone dust because the cup he had chosen was in fact not the Holy Grail.

The warm, sweet liquid passed my lips. There are some psychopaths out there who slurp their coffee. I am not one of them. After a moment, I took another sip. This time, there was a little grit. Usually, this only made an appearance at the very bottom of the cup. Strange. I brought the cup to my lips for more.

It was too late by the time I realized that the grit I was tasting couldn't be from coffee. It seemed somehow both earthy and metallic. I spat out what was left of it in my mouth and began to retch over the trash can. But there was nothing to be done. The grit clung to the insides of my throat.

I grabbed the cup. The coffee inside was now clouded by flecks of what seemed to be a fine gray dust. As I took deep, heaving breaths, I could feel the smallest of particles from it enter my lungs. It would seem I chose ‚Äî poorly.

That night, I decided that maybe I could use some blackened chicken Alfredo after all. Silver Bro took one look at the coins I had brought and whistled. He called them cobs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Spanish silver.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs real?‚Äù I asked. I trusted Maggie completely, but it was good to hear this from someone else. 

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm pretty certain this is real.‚Äù The guy launched into an explanation of exactly why that was, but I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes. Usually, I like to learn about the things that I'm reselling. But with this silver, I just couldn't make myself care where it had come from and what its history was.

Silver Bro kept making offers to exchange me something for a single piece of jewelry, or even one of the smaller cobs. I said no of course. His offers pissed me off for some reason, a lot. And I didn't know why.

Then he showed me some cobs of his own. But where mine were perfectly preserved, his had turned almost black. He noticed this too, and remarked that it was very strange that in all this time there didn't seem to be any sign of corrosion on my silver.

""I must be lucky,"" I replied. But he wasn't. Although the guy certainly knew his way around silver, he didn't seem to know his way around much of anything else, so there was no second date.

When I got home, I saw 2 missed calls from Maggie. She had left a voicemail. I'll just paste the transcription here.

""Olivia?"" Let's pretend that's my name. ""It's Maggie. That silver I sold to you. I was wondering if I might have it back? I'll pay you ten times what you gave me for it. I shouldn't have sold it. It's real and all, but it wasn't mine to give. If you could call me back or come in tomorrow, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. I‚Äôm very sorry about this."" Just please call me back when you can. It's important. Thanks.""

No. Absolutely not. It was my silver now. I bought it at the price she had asked. It was mine, not hers. Did Maggie only just now see the value of what she had given me? I trusted her. Now here she was trying to take my good fortune away. Such betrayal.

Another call came in the next day. Betrayal! And then another. I blocked her number.

That night I had a new dream. I was flying far above snow-capped mountains. The air up here was clean. I could breathe. Spreading out below me was everything and everyone I'd ever known and would ever know. This is what the silver could do for me. I could have everything I'd ever wanted. I just had to let go of the tiniest fraction of it.

But should I? This treasure was too perfect to let go. Maybe I'd just sell one item and keep the rest for myself. I knew that I would never have such magnificent pieces in my hands ever again if I let them go now.

The following day was a Saturday, so I could look forward to doing nothing but snacking and binge-watching another season of Charmed. And that's exactly what I did for about three hours before I was interrupted by a knock on my front door.

‚ÄúI'm not interested!"" I called. The knock came again. 

""There is no Jesus Christ in this house! I roll with Satan!"" Surely that would make them go away. But nope. The knock came a third time, and I could hear a familiar voice calling out my name over it. What the fuck? It was Maggie.

I jabbed at the pause button on my remote, forced myself out of the recliner, and marched to the front door. 

""Do you know what no means?"" I demanded after wrenching it open.

""Olivia,"" Maggie began. ""I'm just here to talk."" If I hadn't been sleeping well lately, Maggie hadn't been sleeping at all. I could swear that there were more streaks of white through her hair than I'd seen a few days ago.

""I just need to warn you. The silver is dangerous. You should get rid of it as soon as possible.‚Äù

""Dangerous?"" I asked incredulously. ""It's a bunch of random silver that's older than you are. It won't bite."" She was still trying to get it back from me. 

Maggie frowned. ""You need to understand! The person who sold the silver to me. I looked into his story. Something happened to him. And he wasn't the only one.""

I stifled a laugh. ""Like what? He wanted money? Yeah, that happens sometimes. And then you gave him money. So where's the issue?"" Maggie stiffened. 

‚ÄúCan I see it?"" she asked timidly. 

""Sure,"" I replied after a moment.

I turned around and went back inside. The thought of fetching that box for her didn't even cross my mind. My silver necklaces jingled as I stocked into the kitchen. I searched through the silverware drawer. But it wasn't there. Of course it wasn't. I wheeled around and found the drawer with larger cutting utensils.

There it was. A meat cleaver. I grabbed it and walked back. Without hesitating, I pulled open the door and brandished the cleaver at Maggie. 

""Go,"" was all I said.

""Olivia."" Maggie was whispering now. ""The silver is driving you mad!"" A hint of desperation had entered her voice.

""Yeah I'm mad,"" I started. ""Can't a girl watch Charmed in peace?"" Maggie's shoulders slumped. 

""Death follows that silver wherever it goes. For your own sake Olivia, destroy it."" With that, Maggie turned and left me standing alone on my porch, waving a meat cleaver at no one.

She could have stayed. Maybe I'd have realized the truth sooner if she had. Then again, maybe not. She had to protect herself too, and looking back, I'm glad that she left.

The dreams alternated over the next couple of days. In them, I both saw and felt two different worlds. Two different possibilities. I was destined to fly. And the other people, well, it really wasn't my problem what they were destined for was it?

Nights were no longer quite so unpleasant. Yet I still found myself waking early in the morning. The days blurred past. From work to home, from home to work, and from work to home I went. Interspersed through all of that were long stretches of time when I found myself staring into the bed of silver at the bottom of that little box.

A hundred little distorted reflections of myself looked back. Then, all at once, they coalesced into one. Those irregularly shaped coins had arranged themselves into a mosaic which reflected a strange and terrible image of myself at me. Although the coins were still uneven and the reflection was distorted in parts, I could see my gaunt face clear as day. There were dark circles beneath my eyes.

It was those dreams. All those things I didn't care to think about or understand. They only made me restless. I really needed to see if there was a way to suppress them. No matter. I could surely pay for any help I would need. This realization put my mind at ease.

I continued to ponder my newfound wealth as my reflection stared back at me. That is, the reflection of my face along with that of a man standing behind me. My chair fell back as I leaped to my feet and whirled around. There was nothing aside from the wall of my office and the bed where I slept.

Then my eyes slid to a clock mounted on the wall. It was well past midnight. But my memories were vague from the time I'd finished dinner and come in here to make a couple of listings on eBay. My computer wasn't even open. Clearly, I needed rest.

The man must have realized that time was running short. Because he spoke to me that night. He told me about the mountain that ate men. A place whose original name had long since been forgotten. It had been a place of worship once. Then the hungry ones came, one Diego Huallpa who served them discovered silver, and his masters in their disease and hunger sought to take the mountain's riches instead.

Now its only name was Rich Mountain. Over the centuries, men toiled in its belly, and even as they sought to eat the mountain, just to carve a little piece of it out for themselves and their masters, the mountain ate them too. Untold numbers of boys and men were consumed even as the fruits of their labor were carted off on ships to a distant land and the mountain that once stood tall slowly bent under the weight of a thousand hammers and chisels.

But the silver was cursed. Everywhere it went, misfortune followed. The hungry ones who condemned their slaves and subjects to death in that mine accumulated so much silver that the metal lost its value, and chaos rained. Like an accident of their own, the hungry ones‚Äô empire crumbled to dust, leaving only remnants in its wake. But the hungry ones had left their former subjects with very little, and so it was that men and boys went back into the mine. By that point, the rich mountain had been so depleted of silver that the people turned to mining tin.

Every miner signed a contract with the first strike of his hammer. The earth would allow them all to take some of its bounty, yes, but it would exact a heavy price from any who dared or was forced into such an agreement with it. The little fortune any man gained would be offset by an early end to his life. The only thing to be determined really was if a miner would be killed there and then in the depths of the underworld, or if they would only die later on the surface, when their lungs were so ravaged by those little fine particles that they could no longer breathe.

Now the mountain was part of a nation populated by some twelve million people named after a certain celebrated liberator. There was no more corporation, crown  or state to impose on the miners. The mountain was in the hands of the people, on paper. But despite how much the world had progressed, things didn't improve much in the tunnels. Wealth grows with time, but only when one is lucky enough to possess it. Their wealth had been stolen.

The mountain was still eating, even in its throes of death. And now foreigners came from far and wide to play pretend at understanding the life of a people born in circumstances alien to them. Through all of this, the silver never disappeared. It was still scattered all over the world, along with all of the greed and loss that had preceded it.

Images flashed through my mind. Different people gazed into the box, each with the same gleam in their eye. Then, one by one, they were all killed, and the silver found its way into new hands. The circumstances under which these killings took place were always a little different. But the results were without fail the same. One person would acquire the little box, and another would grow envious. It was only a matter of time before blood was spilled, and the silver changed hands in an endless cycle of violence.

The last image to appear to me was a terrified Maggie standing just out of reach of the meat cleaver I'd waved around so carelessly. I had been prepared to kill to protect something that was never mine. And there wasn't much I could say for myself. Really, there wasn't much any of the silver's victims, be they murderers or the murdered, could say for themselves. All the silver had done was awaken something that was already there somewhere deep inside of us.

I became aware of myself, of the burning on my neck and fingers. The box was lying still open on my desk. The silver inside it glowed red-hot. I shot to my feet and grabbed the box. I tore out of my office and into the living room. I turned on and opened the fireplace. The box went inside first and began to burn immediately. Then I ripped off my necklaces with such force that the cords cut into the back of my neck as they snapped, and blood flowed down my back. The rings came off more easily. All of it went into the fire.

The wooden box was reduced to ashes as I watched. But everything inside remained. Slowly, each piece melted down into globs of molten silver, before those fused together into an amorphous shape. The shape slowly gained more definition until it resolved into a humanoid figure. As I watched, the image of a man holding a hammer and chisel pushed its way out of the figure. It was the man who had spoken to me, and the man whose likeness I'd been wearing in miniature on my neck for days.

The metal cooled, and as if knowing its job was done, the fireplace shut off on its own. The miner stepped out. He was covered head to toe in a fine gray dust. The silver no longer glowed; in fact, its entire surface had become tarnished. The miner turned to stare up at me. He didn‚Äôt say a word. He didn‚Äôt need to. The silver had been kept pristine by the suffering of those who extracted it. But the spirit inside had finally been released, and the silver crumbled to dust before my eyes.

For the first time in a long while, I could think with clarity. My curse had been broken. I was no longer enchanted by the blood silver. But the mountain was becoming hollow. The people still worked and died within it for a pittance. Yet all these years later, the hungry ones were still hungry, and all the riches in the world wouldn‚Äôt be enough to satiate them.

Kyoto 4 nights
Tokyo 8 nights

Hiroshima 2 nights (day trip to Miyajima)
Osaka 4 nights 

For Tokyo we dont really have a plan yet, we want to leave at least a few days open just to walk around.

Had severe upper abdominal pain for the next 2.5 days. Felt very weak, slightly feverish, dizzy, nauseated, but no vomitting episodes. Low blood pressure. It went away by itself yesterday. I got by blood sent to a lab too, after all this. Lipase is 24 u/L whereas amylase is 67 u/L. While I initially thought that it's normal, the doctor told me that it's not and I'm at risk for developing pancreatitis. Is this true? I feel fine now, without medication. The doctor prescribed pancreatin and esomeprazole and told me to follow up with monthly blood tests.

Since the reason behind the acute stomach pain was not investigated into at all, are there chances that it was caused due to something else entirely, and not my pancreas? If so, is it possible that the said factor triggered my pancreas acutely and led to slightly elevated and yet within normal range, of amylase? 

I'm also banned from eating anything that isn't boiled or stewed. And cheese and most kinds of fats. All this is depressing me.

1n3dx70,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1n3dx70/all_the_riches_in_the_world/,All the riches in the world,"After it all happened, I could never explain just what about the little wooden jewelry box had caught my eye. It was simple and unornamented.

When questioned about what was inside it, Maggie, the antique shop‚Äôs keeper, hesitated before speaking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a collection of old silver, mostly jewelry and coins.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúSo a few thousand dollars, I suppose?‚Äù I went to put the box back. 

‚ÄúActually, not today. Today it‚Äôs on sale. You can get it for about $700. It‚Äôs been here for quite a while and I‚Äôve been trying to get rid of it.‚Äù That gave me pause.

This story isn't easy to tell. My memories have proved to be somewhat fragmented. What follows might not be the most straightforward retelling of events, But it reflects what I lived. Everything started that day in the antique shop. Just bear with me, if you will.

Maggie and I go back a little. I started visiting her shop a couple of years ago and over that time had purchased everything from a 1960s toy piano to some original Mackintosh parts from the 1980s. Occasionally, I had gotten discounts on random stuff supposedly for being a loyal customer. 

‚ÄúWhy so low?‚Äù I asked.

Maggie smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been coming here regularly for years. I think I can do this one small thing in return for your business.‚Äù

Alarm bells are probably ringing for some reading this right now. But in truth, I found it hard to be suspicious of this woman. She was very particular about the things she accepted to sell. I know that because I've sold her stuff before. It never crossed my mind that the jewelry could be fake.

I don't know if any of you have guessed yet, but I'm one of those people that buys things and sells them at higher prices. Typically, I like to find things in need of some restoration. If that doesn't cost me too much, I can jack up the price pretty significantly when I'm done with it and still feel like I'm giving enough to the buyer. But there were exceptions to this, like today. Several antiques made from silver priced at a mere 700 bucks felt like the best opportunity I'd had to upsell in a while.

I opened the box to give what was inside a look. Several rings, two necklaces, a cup, and some irregularly shaped pieces of metal tumbled onto the checkout counter. It looked like silver. Surely it was real.

I picked up one of the larger silver chunks. The thing was trying very hard to be a circle, but failing. On its uneven surface, I could make out a design of sorts depicting a castle and next to it the image of what I now know was a lion. Encircling these was a shield, which separated the symbols into quadrants. To the left of the shield was the letter P, and to the right was the letter D. The lower part of the shield contained a couple of other symbols.

Maggie came up beside me. ‚ÄúThose are old Spanish coins. This one you see was their largest denomination, the eight reales. These were struck by hammers, so they're all a little uneven and some are cracked. It's quite rare to see any silver this old that looks like it was minted yesterday.‚Äù She laughed and dropped the coin back into the box.

Later, I put on both necklaces and two rings. Most of the rings were undecorated. One of them had designs on it reminiscent of the Spanish coins. And another one just had some weird-looking shapes engraved in it. The necklaces were more strange. They were simple, thin silver chains, although the links themselves were hollow pieces of metal strung through with a cord. One of the necklaces was a cross, the other was a tiny pendant representing what on closer inspection appeared to be a man holding some sort of implements in his hands.

It occurred to me that it would probably be best to put each piece up individually for sale. I'd recently been in a car accident, and both my car and my body had needed repairs that I was now slowly paying off. But surely I could enjoy wearing 300-year-old jewelry for a couple of days at least.

I started to get compliments at work. For once, people wanted to talk to me. One guy, who I knew to be a silver collector mainly because he took any and every opportunity to talk about it, pulled me aside to say that if I were curious about the silver‚Äôs origin, I could bring him one of the coins. In the same sentence, he told me about a nice, fancy Italian place nearby that we could grab dinner at if I wanted. I wasn't very interested in that proposition, so I told him that I might take him up on that at some point in my life. 

A few days after I began wearing the jewelry, the dreams started. All I remember now are brief moments and impressions. Tunnels of some sort underground. Dark spaces illuminated by oil lamps and candles. Hammers, chisels, pickaxes, coughing. The shouting of workers. Distant sounds of earth shifting, maybe even falling. We chipped away at the rock that imprisoned us in hopes of something better. Over and over, these dreams repeated. I began to dread sleep.

I found the silver cup on my counter right next to the coffee machine in the early hours of the second morning following the dreams. I must have left it there at some point, though I had no memory of doing this, nor did I have any recollection of it being there before that very moment. But what the hell? A person only lives once. One may as well take the opportunity to drink their morning brew from a silver cup if it is presented to them.

The cup was one item that I hadn't paid much attention to. My fingers traced the floral designs on its rounded surface. It was cool to the touch as I lifted it from the counter, but began to warm almost immediately in my hand.

The cup's design was like a goblet's, although it was not particularly tall. It was wide at the top, but tapered down to a stem for holding. Below that, the base flared out a bit to offer it more support. I could feel something engraved on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was a set of initials. I could see my reflection inside the cup, although the edges of my face were curved somewhat. A minute later, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. A splash of milk went in, then some sweetener.

As I brought the cup to my mouth, I had a strange flashback to that one gruesome scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where what's his name? Wallis? Donald? Whoever he is, he drinks from a cup which he presumes to be the Holy Grail only to end up in a pile of bone dust because the cup he had chosen was in fact not the Holy Grail.

The warm, sweet liquid passed my lips. There are some psychopaths out there who slurp their coffee. I am not one of them. After a moment, I took another sip. This time, there was a little grit. Usually, this only made an appearance at the very bottom of the cup. Strange. I brought the cup to my lips for more.

It was too late by the time I realized that the grit I was tasting couldn't be from coffee. It seemed somehow both earthy and metallic. I spat out what was left of it in my mouth and began to retch over the trash can. But there was nothing to be done. The grit clung to the insides of my throat.

I grabbed the cup. The coffee inside was now clouded by flecks of what seemed to be a fine gray dust. As I took deep, heaving breaths, I could feel the smallest of particles from it enter my lungs. It would seem I chose ‚Äî poorly.

That night, I decided that maybe I could use some blackened chicken Alfredo after all. Silver Bro took one look at the coins I had brought and whistled. He called them cobs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Spanish silver.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs real?‚Äù I asked. I trusted Maggie completely, but it was good to hear this from someone else. 

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm pretty certain this is real.‚Äù The guy launched into an explanation of exactly why that was, but I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes. Usually, I like to learn about the things that I'm reselling. But with this silver, I just couldn't make myself care where it had come from and what its history was.

Silver Bro kept making offers to exchange me something for a single piece of jewelry, or even one of the smaller cobs. I said no of course. His offers pissed me off for some reason, a lot. And I didn't know why.

Then he showed me some cobs of his own. But where mine were perfectly preserved, his had turned almost black. He noticed this too, and remarked that it was very strange that in all this time there didn't seem to be any sign of corrosion on my silver.

""I must be lucky,"" I replied. But he wasn't. Although the guy certainly knew his way around silver, he didn't seem to know his way around much of anything else, so there was no second date.

When I got home, I saw 2 missed calls from Maggie. She had left a voicemail. I'll just paste the transcription here.

""Olivia?"" Let's pretend that's my name. ""It's Maggie. That silver I sold to you. I was wondering if I might have it back? I'll pay you ten times what you gave me for it. I shouldn't have sold it. It's real and all, but it wasn't mine to give. If you could call me back or come in tomorrow, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. I‚Äôm very sorry about this."" Just please call me back when you can. It's important. Thanks.""

No. Absolutely not. It was my silver now. I bought it at the price she had asked. It was mine, not hers. Did Maggie only just now see the value of what she had given me? I trusted her. Now here she was trying to take my good fortune away. Such betrayal.

Another call came in the next day. Betrayal! And then another. I blocked her number.

That night I had a new dream. I was flying far above snow-capped mountains. The air up here was clean. I could breathe. Spreading out below me was everything and everyone I'd ever known and would ever know. This is what the silver could do for me. I could have everything I'd ever wanted. I just had to let go of the tiniest fraction of it.

But should I? This treasure was too perfect to let go. Maybe I'd just sell one item and keep the rest for myself. I knew that I would never have such magnificent pieces in my hands ever again if I let them go now.

The following day was a Saturday, so I could look forward to doing nothing but snacking and binge-watching another season of Charmed. And that's exactly what I did for about three hours before I was interrupted by a knock on my front door.

‚ÄúI'm not interested!"" I called. The knock came again. 

""There is no Jesus Christ in this house! I roll with Satan!"" Surely that would make them go away. But nope. The knock came a third time, and I could hear a familiar voice calling out my name over it. What the fuck? It was Maggie.

I jabbed at the pause button on my remote, forced myself out of the recliner, and marched to the front door. 

""Do you know what no means?"" I demanded after wrenching it open.

""Olivia,"" Maggie began. ""I'm just here to talk."" If I hadn't been sleeping well lately, Maggie hadn't been sleeping at all. I could swear that there were more streaks of white through her hair than I'd seen a few days ago.

""I just need to warn you. The silver is dangerous. You should get rid of it as soon as possible.‚Äù

""Dangerous?"" I asked incredulously. ""It's a bunch of random silver that's older than you are. It won't bite."" She was still trying to get it back from me. 

Maggie frowned. ""You need to understand! The person who sold the silver to me. I looked into his story. Something happened to him. And he wasn't the only one.""

I stifled a laugh. ""Like what? He wanted money? Yeah, that happens sometimes. And then you gave him money. So where's the issue?"" Maggie stiffened. 

‚ÄúCan I see it?"" she asked timidly. 

""Sure,"" I replied after a moment.

I turned around and went back inside. The thought of fetching that box for her didn't even cross my mind. My silver necklaces jingled as I stocked into the kitchen. I searched through the silverware drawer. But it wasn't there. Of course it wasn't. I wheeled around and found the drawer with larger cutting utensils.

There it was. A meat cleaver. I grabbed it and walked back. Without hesitating, I pulled open the door and brandished the cleaver at Maggie. 

""Go,"" was all I said.

""Olivia."" Maggie was whispering now. ""The silver is driving you mad!"" A hint of desperation had entered her voice.

""Yeah I'm mad,"" I started. ""Can't a girl watch Charmed in peace?"" Maggie's shoulders slumped. 

""Death follows that silver wherever it goes. For your own sake Olivia, destroy it."" With that, Maggie turned and left me standing alone on my porch, waving a meat cleaver at no one.

She could have stayed. Maybe I'd have realized the truth sooner if she had. Then again, maybe not. She had to protect herself too, and looking back, I'm glad that she left.

The dreams alternated over the next couple of days. In them, I both saw and felt two different worlds. Two different possibilities. I was destined to fly. And the other people, well, it really wasn't my problem what they were destined for was it?

Nights were no longer quite so unpleasant. Yet I still found myself waking early in the morning. The days blurred past. From work to home, from home to work, and from work to home I went. Interspersed through all of that were long stretches of time when I found myself staring into the bed of silver at the bottom of that little box.

A hundred little distorted reflections of myself looked back. Then, all at once, they coalesced into one. Those irregularly shaped coins had arranged themselves into a mosaic which reflected a strange and terrible image of myself at me. Although the coins were still uneven and the reflection was distorted in parts, I could see my gaunt face clear as day. There were dark circles beneath my eyes.

It was those dreams. All those things I didn't care to think about or understand. They only made me restless. I really needed to see if there was a way to suppress them. No matter. I could surely pay for any help I would need. This realization put my mind at ease.

I continued to ponder my newfound wealth as my reflection stared back at me. That is, the reflection of my face along with that of a man standing behind me. My chair fell back as I leaped to my feet and whirled around. There was nothing aside from the wall of my office and the bed where I slept.

Then my eyes slid to a clock mounted on the wall. It was well past midnight. But my memories were vague from the time I'd finished dinner and come in here to make a couple of listings on eBay. My computer wasn't even open. Clearly, I needed rest.

The man must have realized that time was running short. Because he spoke to me that night. He told me about the mountain that ate men. A place whose original name had long since been forgotten. It had been a place of worship once. Then the hungry ones came, one Diego Huallpa who served them discovered silver, and his masters in their disease and hunger sought to take the mountain's riches instead.

Now its only name was Rich Mountain. Over the centuries, men toiled in its belly, and even as they sought to eat the mountain, just to carve a little piece of it out for themselves and their masters, the mountain ate them too. Untold numbers of boys and men were consumed even as the fruits of their labor were carted off on ships to a distant land and the mountain that once stood tall slowly bent under the weight of a thousand hammers and chisels.

But the silver was cursed. Everywhere it went, misfortune followed. The hungry ones who condemned their slaves and subjects to death in that mine accumulated so much silver that the metal lost its value, and chaos rained. Like an accident of their own, the hungry ones‚Äô empire crumbled to dust, leaving only remnants in its wake. But the hungry ones had left their former subjects with very little, and so it was that men and boys went back into the mine. By that point, the rich mountain had been so depleted of silver that the people turned to mining tin.

Every miner signed a contract with the first strike of his hammer. The earth would allow them all to take some of its bounty, yes, but it would exact a heavy price from any who dared or was forced into such an agreement with it. The little fortune any man gained would be offset by an early end to his life. The only thing to be determined really was if a miner would be killed there and then in the depths of the underworld, or if they would only die later on the surface, when their lungs were so ravaged by those little fine particles that they could no longer breathe.

Now the mountain was part of a nation populated by some twelve million people named after a certain celebrated liberator. There was no more corporation, crown  or state to impose on the miners. The mountain was in the hands of the people, on paper. But despite how much the world had progressed, things didn't improve much in the tunnels. Wealth grows with time, but only when one is lucky enough to possess it. Their wealth had been stolen.

The mountain was still eating, even in its throes of death. And now foreigners came from far and wide to play pretend at understanding the life of a people born in circumstances alien to them. Through all of this, the silver never disappeared. It was still scattered all over the world, along with all of the greed and loss that had preceded it.

Images flashed through my mind. Different people gazed into the box, each with the same gleam in their eye. Then, one by one, they were all killed, and the silver found its way into new hands. The circumstances under which these killings took place were always a little different. But the results were without fail the same. One person would acquire the little box, and another would grow envious. It was only a matter of time before blood was spilled, and the silver changed hands in an endless cycle of violence.

The last image to appear to me was a terrified Maggie standing just out of reach of the meat cleaver I'd waved around so carelessly. I had been prepared to kill to protect something that was never mine. And there wasn't much I could say for myself. Really, there wasn't much any of the silver's victims, be they murderers or the murdered, could say for themselves. All the silver had done was awaken something that was already there somewhere deep inside of us.

I became aware of myself, of the burning on my neck and fingers. The box was lying still open on my desk. The silver inside it glowed red-hot. I shot to my feet and grabbed the box. I tore out of my office and into the living room. I turned on and opened the fireplace. The box went inside first and began to burn immediately. Then I ripped off my necklaces with such force that the cords cut into the back of my neck as they snapped, and blood flowed down my back. The rings came off more easily. All of it went into the fire.

The wooden box was reduced to ashes as I watched. But everything inside remained. Slowly, each piece melted down into globs of molten silver, before those fused together into an amorphous shape. The shape slowly gained more definition until it resolved into a humanoid figure. As I watched, the image of a man holding a hammer and chisel pushed its way out of the figure. It was the man who had spoken to me, and the man whose likeness I'd been wearing in miniature on my neck for days.

The metal cooled, and as if knowing its job was done, the fireplace shut off on its own. The miner stepped out. He was covered head to toe in a fine gray dust. The silver no longer glowed; in fact, its entire surface had become tarnished. The miner turned to stare up at me. He didn‚Äôt say a word. He didn‚Äôt need to. The silver had been kept pristine by the suffering of those who extracted it. But the spirit inside had finally been released, and the silver crumbled to dust before my eyes.

For the first time in a long while, I could think with clarity. My curse had been broken. I was no longer enchanted by the blood silver. But the mountain was becoming hollow. The people still worked and died within it for a pittance. Yet all these years later, the hungry ones were still hungry, and all the riches in the world wouldn‚Äôt be enough to satiate them.",2,1756489049.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Big fan of storytelling in all its forms. Books might be your competition, I'm not a gamer myself, but into games with strong world building and characters, shows you can't stop thinking about, and convos that bounce between deep and nonsense. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure book. A clue, it's a genre I don't normally read, but the Before trilogy of films is one of the greatest representations on the genre on screen. Now, what genre am I talking about? Have a guilty pleasure of your own for us to smile about?



I keep telling myself I‚Äôll revisit my love of history, but the band Sabaton‚Äôs currently carrying the torch. Seeing them live soon. If metal meets history sounds intriguing to you, we‚Äôll probably get along. Let's sing along to something. Perfect pitch not required.



I‚Äôve somehow become a runner. It started impulsively with a decision to run a race even though I haven't run since school. I've grown to love the runner's high, when I can find it that is, as opposed to just dying, and yes, the occasional smug Strava post might appear. Not to mention the obligatory coffee and pint rewards after a run. Gotta survive somehow.



I love getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, the everyday bits in between. I‚Äôm here for a dynamic which feels like something we both wanna invest in. I‚Äôd love to meet someone who‚Äôs emotionally grounded, curious, and wants to work on building something.



So, what‚Äôs your thing, something you could talk about for hours? Recommend a show, a song, a book, or a random interest. Bonus points if your answer makes me want to see you tell the story in person or jump on a call.

1n3dvg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n3dvg3/i_never_thought_id_be_dealing_with_friendship/,I never thought I‚Äôd be dealing with friendship problems at this big age üòÇüòÇ,"I met one of my best friends (let‚Äôs call her Sofia) back in middle school and we‚Äôve been inseparable since. Fast forward to last year, Sofia met this one girl i was friends with but was never close with (her name will be Elena). I met Elena through one of my other super close friends (Nina)  in 2022 and they were like besties or whatever. When I first met her, not gonna lie, her vibe was a bit off, But I still gave her a chance because in my head I told myself that the situation was hectic and maybe she was probably a little overstimulated or whatever. So Nina ends up arranging another hangout and this was confirmation for me that this girl might just not be for me. I never told Nina and honestly I didn‚Äôt have to see her too much anyway so I didn‚Äôt care. 

I unfortunately ended up seeing her a lot. Whenever I see her I felt so drained and exhausted. I feel like we were from two completely different worlds and I hate not being able to express myself and just enjoy myself around her. She always felt the need to try to bring me down or make me feel bad about something that I truly enjoy or loved. And the funniest part, someone else would say they love it and she would be all over that! She is also very materialistic and would look down on anyone who didn‚Äôt automatically want the most expensive things. Those things don‚Äôt really bother me because I really don‚Äôt care. Also, I took a break from education to kind of just focus on me but she would bring up me not going to school at random times‚Ä¶like hello!?!7  but like I said, those things never really bothered me too much. Aside from that, she had a good side to her. And this was literally the only reason I stuck around. Once I felt like oh we‚Äôre actually becoming cool, she ends up leaving the state for school. 

She‚Äôs gone for a while and comes back for thanksgiving break. I see her maybe once. And while she was away I would call at the end of the week and kind of catch up and ask about life and stuff. Never received those calls or messages but I just brushed it off and said that maybe she just busy. Once she gets back to school, I never hear from her. Until the day she‚Äôs needs something. Anyway, I went no contact after that. Of course my friends are all still friends with her so I know I‚Äôll eventually have to talk to her but I was not doing that shit willingly!! We don‚Äôt speak until April. I called to her for something and then make an excuse to leave the call. I felt good giving her a taste of her own medicine.

May of 2025 comes rolling around and her close friend is getting married. She misses her flight from Dallas and is losing it. She never thinks for herself in any stressful situation and immediately calls Sofia. Sofia say, there is a flight leaving to Chicago, you take that and we‚Äôll drive to you since it‚Äôs only a few hours. The ‚Äúwe‚Äù in question is me and Sofia. Sofia calls me in a group call with Elena and gives me the plan. I told them I have plans let me double check and see if I can reschedule (I already had my answer though üôà) Elena gives me a whole speech about how she has no other options and what not, then says ‚Äúbro it‚Äôs a yes or no!!‚Äù So I told her no I‚Äôm not going. 

When she does show up, immediately she‚Äôs being weird to me in my face and flat out ignoring me. I‚Äôm not sure if she thought that would make me feel bad but okay. Wedding comes rolling around, I didn‚Äôt want to go but one of our friends had a baby not too long ago and wanted to go, so I went to keep her company since she‚Äôs not really close or comfortable with the other girls. I arrive at this wedding this girl doesn‚Äôt greet but greeted everyone who‚Äôs with me. She would be talking to one of our friends and I come over and she instantly leaves. Weird behavior i swear. So after that whole exchange is over, I‚Äôm so happy I don‚Äôt have to see her for a while. She goes back to Texas and she is having a graduation at the end of May. I get a call on like May 25th or something, from Nina. I was in another call and told her I‚Äôll call back. She‚Äôs called a second time so I thought it was emergency. I pick up and it‚Äôs another group call with Elena! They give me the  plan and wanted me to go. Nina wanted to go fly to Texas and drive Elena‚Äôs car back home. I immediately say no. This never gets brought back up to me but I just was so fed up and wanted to tell Sofia basically everything.

I end up telling her everything and I felt so bad doing so because that‚Äôs friend and I don‚Äôt want her to start feeling some type of way because of my words. Like they really get along and have a really good friendship from what I seen but me and that girl just don‚Äôt click like that. Not everyone can be friends. As I was talking about my experience, she kept trying to make excuses for her. I told her don‚Äôt bother because that‚Äôs also what I was doing in the beginning and no, this girl just don‚Äôt like me. I told her I‚Äôm okay seeing her in social situations and important things like birthdays and stuff but if we‚Äôre doing something else, try to a least give me a heads because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable and I‚Äôd like to know beforehand. I saw Elena a few times over the summer and she would make it a point to announce that I don‚Äôt contact her at the end of everything. Making me look bad in front of everyone.

A few nights ago, i went to a coffee shop with Sofia and two of her friends. In the middle of us enjoying our card game she mentions Elena is coming. The other girls are also friends with her, I‚Äôm feeling like odd one out in this situation. I carpooled so I can‚Äôt even leave, I was trapped. She comes and honestly we had a good time. Like I said I don‚Äôt hate her, I just think she‚Äôs not for me. At 9:45pm i ask Sofia if we can leave soon because I have work in the morning. She ignores me and Elena gives me sarcastic comments about how we all have work tomorrow. This is funny because she‚Äôs unemployed at the moment but okayüòÇüòÇ i ask again at 10:15 if we can leave at in 15 minutes. Again ignores me and asks Elena about her trip this weekend. I was so frustrated but kept my calm. At 10:30 i start packing my cards up and Elena grabs them out of my hands and starts dealing again. I almost flipped the table actually cuz wtf?!?!\ They didn‚Äôt move until coffee shop closed at 11pm and the owner turned the lights off so that everyone could get the hell out. We go outside and say our goodbyes. We make our way to the car and Elena calls Sofia back to her car and leaves me stranded in front of her car. She sits in there so long and the other two girls felt bad and are standing with me. They then pull up to us give us donuts that she brought back. I take it but I‚Äôm still very quiet at this point. I just want to go home. We finally, after what felt like hours leave. As we‚Äôre in the car, Sofia asks me out if nowhere ‚ÄúElena has never done anything to you though‚Äù I kept my calm and just responded that it‚Äôs just vibe thing. 
Now I don‚Äôt know what to do because I have to have a conversation with her about this. I just don‚Äôt understand why she refuses to respect my wishes and my boundaries and is constantly putting me in uncomfortable situations with this girl when I already asked her not to.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that‚Äôs about as competitive as a toddler‚Äôs chess game. Fourth seed **Taylor Fritz** (-550 on the spread, 1.06 decimal odds) faces qualifier **J√©r√¥me Kym** (+800 to +1150, depending on the bookie), a 22-year-old Swiss upstart who‚Äôs somehow still breathing after surviving five-set thrill rides against Ethan Quinn and Brandon Nakashima. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a caffeinated spreadsheet.

### The Numbers That Make You Want to Nap

* **Fritz‚Äôs Dominance**: The American has won 75% of first-serve points in his last two matches and hasn‚Äôt lost to a player outside the top 150 in nearly two years. His 53 winners vs. Lloyd Harris? Impressive. His 47 unforced errors? Less so, but hey, it‚Äôs the US Open, not a coffee table.
* **Kym‚Äôs Miracle March**: The ATP 175-ranked Kym has hit 28 aces in his last two matches (per the Nakashima carnage) and somehow keeps his error count respectable (56 unforced errors in five sets). But let‚Äôs be real: He‚Äôs 0-2 against top-10 players and has never won three straight ATP matches.

### Odds: A Math Problem Only a Parent Could Love

Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven‚Äô as it beckoned for Christina‚Äô on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina‚Äô never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn‚Äôt have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina‚Äô continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina‚Äô once again saying 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina‚Äô 

‚ÄúWhy go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him‚Äù

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

‚Äú Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina‚Äô wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849‚Äô when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

‚ÄúWho Killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô‚Äù

That they just might find out! But as Christina‚Äô stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven‚Äô off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina‚Äô now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven‚Äô Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina‚Äô just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina‚Äô Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven‚Äô calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina‚Äô now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô could hear the Raven‚Äô crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn‚Äôt good enough for Christina‚Äô as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina‚Äô was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe?‚Äù

But Christina‚Äô being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina‚Äô Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina‚Äô was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her. Guessing that‚Äôs why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

‚ÄúI swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!‚Äù

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it‚Äôs like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It‚Äôs like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I‚Äôm just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn‚Äôt be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina‚Äô would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn‚Äôt much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina‚Äô stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I‚Äôm going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn‚Äôt so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn‚Äôt get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy‚Äôs apartment. Jimmy‚Äô was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina‚Äô questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn‚Äôt know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn‚Äôt know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina‚Äô then thought to herself 

‚ÄúWell no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!‚Äù

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy‚Äô sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn‚Äôt going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina‚Äô then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy‚Äôs body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven‚Äô flew into an open window landing on it‚Äôs bottom frame as it the crowed 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Like she said, Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina‚Äô didn‚Äôt mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny‚Äô a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina‚Äô would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina‚Äô then thought to her herself, at least Johnny‚Äô knew how to please someone. But as Christina‚Äô then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy‚Äô With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!‚Äù 

With Christina‚Äô then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

‚ÄúLook. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy‚Äô much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn‚Äôt into drugs Johnny‚Äô he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don‚Äôt have to be so snarky you know‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

‚ÄúLook! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn‚Äôt know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn‚Äôt kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúSomething else! What do you mean something else!‚Äù

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As Christina‚Äô then looked back at him curious like then saying 

‚ÄúWhat! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina‚Äô saying to her 

‚ÄúYeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!‚Äù

But as Christina‚Äô then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven‚Äô saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina‚Äô stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang‚Äô wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang‚Äô then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

‚ÄúFor insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

With Chang‚Äô now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang‚Äô

‚ÄúSo a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúWho are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?‚Äù

As the figure then said to Chang‚Äô 

‚ÄúIs it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then replied back saying to him

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!‚Äù

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang‚Äô saying to him

‚ÄúOh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúTell me what!‚Äù

As the figure then replied back to Chang‚Äô saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang‚Äô letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang‚Äô was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina‚Äô not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina‚Äô being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina‚Äô soon found herself on the way scene as Christina‚Äô continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina‚Äô stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven‚Äô Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Standing there now looking at the Raven‚Äô just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina‚Äô now with more questions than answers, As Christina‚Äô then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city‚Äôs landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny‚Äô! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

‚ÄúThe four other people that was with you and Jimmy‚Äô were they the ones murdered the last four nights‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

‚ÄúLook! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots‚Äù! 

With Christina‚Äô just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

‚Äú Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!‚Äù

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina‚Äô would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city‚Äôs night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

‚ÄúI have became insane! to a world that wants to know!‚Äù More than they should know!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to know? My love!

As Christina‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúDo I want to know what‚Äù?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40‚Äô with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina‚Äô more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don‚Äôt want to know?

With her again asking him

‚Äúknow what?‚Äù

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

‚ÄúTo know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know‚Äù

And desired to know more Christina‚Äô did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina‚Äô was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina‚Äôs body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

‚ÄúTo know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.‚Äù

The desire was here, Christina‚Äô thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

‚Äú I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina‚Äô was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina‚Äô heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina‚Äô could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

‚ÄúTonight my love I will know you as you desire!‚Äù

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina‚Äô body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina‚Äôs cheek, As Christina‚Äô lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding her rubbing his body up against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

With Christina now feeling his sweat slowly sliding her hands all across his body as he then placed her hands around his back. As Christina gave him a look followed by a grin before moving her hands up behind his head. 

Christina‚Äô could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci‚Äô saying

‚ÄúDam! I would give up hell just to be in her!‚Äù 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina‚Äô had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina‚Äô asking her

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô now looking at him saying 

‚ÄúKnow what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then asking 

‚ÄúWho?

As he then just laughed as he said

‚ÄúI did!

‚ÄúI killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Just before it flew off into the night

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci‚Äô then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

Finding Grace‚Äô A latino story, that finds Jenna Ortega‚Äô Finding herself while Finding Grace for herself on Angels Ravine 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega‚Äô had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window setting there looking out into a world that was still very much new to her, thinking to herself as she sat there. Looking as the sun‚Äôs light glimmered onto the street in front of as people was coming and going. People that was still very new to her. In a world that was still very much new to her. People that she was soon about to meet as the sun‚Äôs light glimmered into her room from her window while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. 

For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna‚Äô a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure‚Äôs. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna‚Äô herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna‚Äô would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou Diamond Phillips‚Äô shouted out to Jenna‚Äô saying to her

‚ÄúHey Jenna‚Äô don‚Äôt let those boys show you up today‚Äù 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna‚Äô just before Jenna‚Äô set off riding her bike into the day, with Lou Diamond Phillips a 63 year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna‚Äô had met. With Lou‚Äô being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna‚Äô all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou‚Äô himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn‚Äôt afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna‚Äô quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna‚Äô was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning‚Äôs sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna‚Äô

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna‚Äô was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna‚Äô it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her. Racing was her excitement, and it showed, along with her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna‚Äô having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross‚Äô would many times say to her

‚ÄúJenna‚Äô! Now don‚Äôt make me write you a ticket today for speeding!‚Äù 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her, for her own safety.  But Jenna‚Äô also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector‚Äô With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna‚Äô But Jenna‚Äô was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna‚Äô being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge. Finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn‚Äôt catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector‚Äô very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna‚Äô saying to her.

‚ÄúSo you think you‚Äôre fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!‚Äù

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna‚Äô Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna‚Äô was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna‚Äô leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna‚Äô left him looking. And saying to himself ‚ÄúDam! That‚Äôs my girl!‚Äù

Just way the way he liked it, always looking and watching out for her. While Jenna‚Äô didn‚Äôt have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‚ÄòQuicksilver‚Äô riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something.

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack‚Äô for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna‚Äô would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna‚Äô about his own street races, with Jenna‚Äô always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna‚Äô needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna‚Äô was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else‚Äôs life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn‚Äôt her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else‚Äôs was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector‚Äôs father.

Also named Hector‚Äô She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector‚Äô for Jenna‚Äù very much had a crush on him. Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector‚Äô but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo‚Äô Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. But Lawrence Fishburne a 64 year old former bike rider himself. Often found himself talking to Jenna Ortega‚Äô telling Jenna‚Äô about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city. A regular that Jenna‚Äô came know from their talks at the coffee shop. But not only would he talk to her about bike riding, but he would often talk to Jenna‚Äô about life in general. By helping her to find and make her own path in life. 

For Voodoo‚Äô would often tell Jenna‚Äô about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna‚Äô always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo‚Äô would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen, and that in the end that this was his home. That this was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna‚Äô would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna‚Äô would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you were an Angel, looking out from Heaven itself. For it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often just settling there looking down onto the town. It was a small town but it was her home, it was where she would come to know. With everyone helping Jenna in their own way to find her path in life. A path that would eventually lead to her right path in life. 

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna‚Äô for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn‚Äôt have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna‚Äô found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna‚Äô setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna‚Äô loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else‚Äôs. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

‚ÄúIf I am not me then who am I ‚Äú

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna‚Äô sat there she would often think about Hector‚Äô thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna‚Äô as Jenna‚Äô would often find herself leaning up against Hector‚Äô as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna‚Äô sat there thinking back on her and Hector‚Äô setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna‚Äô was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go with her waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in. Often finding herself looking out of the window into the suns morning light. Thinking to herself 

‚ÄúWhy am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?‚Äù

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area. With Jenna standing there thinking about all of people and who could they be? who could they be? Someone else from somewhere else?

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn‚Äôt remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna‚Äô rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna‚Äô that was her Life being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her. Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it‚Äôs many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby‚Äôs of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna‚Äô herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna‚Äô would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn‚Äôt wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna‚Äô enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna‚Äô had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna‚Äô and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna‚Äô and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel‚Äôs Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna‚Äô then turned to Hector asking him

‚ÄúDo you ever think that you was someone else‚Äôs before‚Äù

With a puzzled look on Hector‚Äôs face he then replied back to her saying 

‚ÄúSomeone Else‚Äôs! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna‚Äô are you feeling okay!‚Äù

With smiling to him just as she said 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just! I really don‚Äôt know! It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm or was someone else, I can‚Äôt really explain it.‚Äù

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I would do with two Jenna‚Äôs All I know is how I feel about the Jenna‚Äô that is here now, setting here beside of me.‚Äù

With Jenna‚Äô then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times‚Äù

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna‚Äô before telling her

‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna‚Äô that I want to be with.‚Äù

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna‚Äô and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna‚Äô trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna‚Äô then stopping to check on him as Hector‚Äô then motioned to her saying to her

‚ÄúGo! Go get ‚Äòem Jenna! You got this!‚Äù

And with that it wasn‚Äôt too long before Jenna‚Äô had caught up to them, for Jenna‚Äô knew the trails like no other. With Jenna now Racing hard and faster like she had ever raced before to the finish. Racing side by side with the outsider Just as Jenna‚Äô then gave him a look and smile to him as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail leaving him setting there as Jenna‚Äô had won the race. Later that evening Jenna‚Äô and Hector‚Äô would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna‚Äô just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector‚Äô then saying goodbye to Jenna‚Äô as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna‚Äô there for the night. As Jenna found herself that night looking up into a starlit sky thinking back on her life. Thinking back on everyone that she had come to know wondering where her next path would take her in her life. Thinking about Hector on where the path would take them or if the path would lead them on their own separate paths. Thinking back on the talks that she had with Lawrence Fishburne also known as Voodoo, and the talks that she and Lou diamond Phillips had had. Simply known as Lou to her. With each of them helping her find and make her own path in life. 

As she came to the ravine Jenna‚Äô then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna‚Äô had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna‚Äô began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna‚Äô‚Äô could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna‚Äô would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna‚Äô lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna‚Äô had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna‚Äô would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now. But this time something happened that had never happened before. But a name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna‚Äô

Suddenly waking up to the morning‚Äôs light as it glimmered in and around all the trees sound her. putting her hands up to her head Jenna‚Äô just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

‚ÄúWho was this other Jenna‚Äô And why do I keep seeing her?‚Äù

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna‚Äô just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna‚Äô began to scream! As a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man began to speak saying

 ‚ÄúHello Jenna‚Äô it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you‚Äù 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna‚Äô as Jenna‚Äô then replied saying to the him

‚ÄúThen why are you standing there looking at me? And how do you know my name?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know all about you Jenna‚Äô I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek‚Äù 

With Jenna‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúAnswers to what? What answers do I seek‚Äù 

‚Äú Dreams, Jenna‚Äô your dreams.‚Äù 

As Jenna‚Äô just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna‚Äô just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

‚ÄúIt is you Jenna‚Äô and it is not you‚Äù

More confused then ever Jenna‚Äô just replied by saying 

‚ÄúMe! How‚Äù 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna‚Äô standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

‚Äú In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life‚Äù 

with Jenna‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúIs this Heaven then and are you an Angel?‚Äù 

With a smile the man just simply said 

‚Äú I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna‚Äô And this is your Life the Life that you ask for‚Äù 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna‚Äô

 ‚ÄúThe dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFor do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow go and Live your Life Jenna‚Äô for Life is what has been granted to you‚Äù 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna‚Äô was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna‚Äô couldn‚Äôt help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna‚Äô

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna‚Äô now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna‚Äô was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her

Thank you to everyone who has followed Mocko this year! This will be the final major update for 2025. If you've already drafted, I'd love to keep up to date with how things went. For those that haven't, I'll be filling out sheet requests all the way until the season starts.

Good luck, everyone!


###**Mocko Draft Guides**
1. [MockoSheet Snake Draft Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/MockoFantasyFootball/comments/1mcjawo/mockosheet_2025_v30_data_driven_draft_and/) - I wrote up a strategy guide for people using Mocko or who want to learn snake draft strategy! I've collected a lot of data for what does and doesn't work over the last few years and want to share as much as I can.

###**V3.2 Changelog: August 29, 2025**
							
* Updated **Player Projections and rankings.**							
* Updated ADP/AAV values.							
* Added Kick Return/TD scoring finally.
* Fixed a bug or two.
* Provided the guy who does the sheet requests a coffee and a beer to keep him going.


###**Sheet Requests:**
If you want a specific sheet for your format: post it in the comments here or on the Mocko subreddit post, message me directly on Reddit or Ko-Fi, or DM @mosers15 on Discord for a MockoSheet request or Fantasy Football advice/questions. I will be updating the database progressively.

Please provide:

* League Format (Snake vs. Auction / Redraft vs. Keeper vs. Dynasty Startup)
* League Size
* Roster Setup (be sure to include the TE and Flex spots!)
* STD/HPPR/PPR/Tiered
  * Scoring settings especially if they aren't default (4pt vs 6pt Pass TDs, yds/pt, etc.)
* Specific needs (like split auction/snake drafts/budget, etc.)
* **In your message, clarify if you are drafting soon! I want to make sure not to miss your draft**

The sheets won't get updated data pushed to them--you'll need a new sheet for it to update but I really try to get those sent out ASAP.

###**V3.1 to V3.2 Relevant Risers and Fallers (using HPPR)**:

**Risers**

|Player|Pos|% Change from V3.1 to V3.2|
:--|:--|:--|
|Emeka Egbuka|WR|58%|
|Matthew Golden|WR|50%|
|TreVeyon Henderson|RB|31%|
|Tetairoa McMillan|WR|29%|
|Isiah Pacheco|RB|26%|
|Tony Pollard|RB|18%|

**Fallers**

|Player|Pos|% Change from V3.1 to V3.2|
:--|:--|:--|
|Jayden Reed|WR|-76%|
|Travis Etienne|RB|-62%|
|Chris Godwin|WR|-36%|
|Joe Mixon|RB|-36%|

No surprises here except perhaps Etienne. Apparently the data sources are just as confused by the Jags backfield as most of us.

###**What is MockoSheet?** 

Example: https://imgur.com/a/hH7btYF

Mocko is my hobby project and attempt at a draft aid and dataset inspired by the great work done by Beersheets, BorisChen, FantasyFootballAnalytics, FantasyCalc, JuiceboxOne, and many others with a focus into finding the best way to show draft data, compare players, and keep track of player rankings put together using projections that are pooled and weighted based on last year‚Äôs accuracy, and scaled from all sources I can reasonably access (17 currently for 2025). Over time, my goal is to evaluate each source used for its accuracy and progressively weight them better each year. There's enough data through the evaluation process alone to create its own post each year!

Mocko is built on a few key ideas:

1. Projections are better than rankings because they can be scaled for league formats. Sites vary in consistency, so don't rely solely on one site's rankings unless they use multiple sources (e.g., FantasyPros which tends to be decently accurate).
2. Fantasy football accuracy follows the wisdom of the crowd. Pooling a wide range of sources with a handful of different methodologies (most completely unlisted and many paywalled) will yield the most accurate results.
3. More accurate projections mean more accurate value rankings for your league. While rankings and tiers help you evaluate player-to-player worth, it‚Äôs important to know how your specific draft might play out and capitalize on the market (ADP/AAV).
4. The data and tools built for Mocko can be manipulated accessibly for a variety of projects including optimized drafts, mock draft reviews, and strategy analysis.
5. It's free. I work a lot on this to help people draft better and see the game differently because it's fun. I use this every year to do better in my leagues.

Over the last 2 years, Mocko has outperformed every individual site's projections that were used in the pooled projections. [Accuracy Table img.](https://imgur.com/JHb0SoX.jpg)

Importantly:
**MockoSheet can support most league types including snake, auction, dynasty, and keeper** with scaling for most specific league settings. I will also work with you directly on any custom league situations not included.

If you‚Äôve used Beersheets or any similar sheet, Mocko will be very familiar. In Snake Drafts, key information shown includes Pos Rank, Pos Tier, OVR Tier, ADP, VAL, and VAP-ADP (pick at which a player becomes worth it).
###Quality Data is Key and Strategy is League, Scoring, AND Pick Specific.

Monte Puncu, Northern Bolivia

When Amaru and I entered the safehouse, Polat Bakkat was standing across from a guy of about average height, with a face and chest decorated with tattoos. He was wearing a T-shirt with body armor and a cowboy hat, complete with sunglasses. 

‚ÄúAnd who was it that attacked you?‚Äù He asked as he handed a cup of coffee to the guy. 

The man graciously took the coffee and took a sip. ‚ÄúIt was those mercenarios, se√±or. They were all wearing military grade body armor we had never seen before, wielded weapons never before seen by the cartel. It was ridiculous!‚Äù

He then turned, took note of me and paled. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù

I held out my hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to shred you if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre wondering. I just wanted to listen in on what you guys were talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was ridiculous, like I told him!‚Äù The man said. The look on his face was pure terror. ‚ÄúWe tried to return fire, but they were like ghosts! We could barely see the extranjeros as they moved among the trees and began picking us off one by one!‚Äù

Then his face paled. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt with them, are you?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI promise, I am not,‚Äù I said. Then I asked, ‚ÄúDid you get a look at their faces?‚Äù

The man shook his head again. ‚ÄúQue la Santa Muerte me proteja.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find this guy?‚Äù I asked Polat.

‚ÄúThe guy surrendered peacefully after we raided a supply convoy for the rebels. He figured he could bargain with us, give us a reason not to blow him away by giving us intel on the i≈übirlik√ßiler Sandoval was with.‚Äù Polat said.
I glanced at the guy. ‚ÄúCan you confirm any of this?‚Äù

The man nodded. ‚ÄúI saw them use one of those attack drones that was seen destroying that helicopter a few weeks ago! They destroyed our helicopter transport with it!‚Äù

‚ÄúLines up with what we saw in Mojocoyo a while back,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúYou know what I‚Äôm talking about?‚Äù The man suddenly looked relieved to hear that someone believed him. 

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, we saw a couple drones knocking an Unidad helicopter out of the sky a few weeks ago, destroying the tail rotor and everything.‚Äù

The man smiled. ‚ÄúThen you know how dangerous these things are!‚Äù

I nodded, a grin spreading across my face. ‚ÄúWhich is why you‚Äôre going to have to tell us everything you know about what Sandoval is up to if you‚Äôre going to have any shot at stopping these morons.‚Äù

The man took a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou might want to get a pen and a lot of paper.‚Äù He said, his face turning pale as a ghost all over again.

Someone gave him a pad and paper and about half an hour later, we were looking at enough intel to bury Sandoval‚Äôs operation for good. 

That was when Miguel entered the room. ‚ÄúEveryone turn on a radio or TV! It‚Äôs all over the news!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is?‚Äù I asked, confused.

‚ÄúYou are not going to believe this,‚Äù Miguel said gravely. ‚ÄúWe got reports of spontaneous riots all over La Paz and Sucre!‚Äù 

‚ÄúRiots?‚Äù Bakkat and Paura looked confused.

‚ÄúIt gets worse,‚Äù said Amaru, joining Miguel‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúSenor Bentley, Senor Bakkat‚Ä¶there isn‚Äôt any other way to say this, but we also learned that Mexico City has been destroyed.‚Äù

At this, everyone in the room went pale, even the Santa Blanca prisoner. ‚ÄúDestroyed?‚Äù Bakkat asked. 

Amaru‚Äôs answer stunned us all into silence. ‚ÄúA dirty bomb went off at the National Palace in Mexico City. The entire building has been leveled. El Presidente and a number of other government officials are dead.‚Äù

The following radio transmission was intercepted on July 27, 2019. It has been translated from its original Spanish.

Red Dog One: Red Dog 4, this is Red Dog One, over.

Red Dog Four: Red Dog 4, roger.

Red Dog One: Tighten formation a bit, gentlemen. Let‚Äôs make the Gringos sit up and take notice.

Red Dog Four: Roger that, One!

Suddenly there is high pitched shrieking in the background

Red Dog Four: Red Dog One, we have company! Unknown bogies coming in hot!

Red Dog One: Break formation! Go!

Red Dog Five: Two bogies on your six! Get out of there!

Red Dog Four: C‚Äômon! Another four, at three o‚Äôclock, coming in, hot!

Red Dog One: Red Dog Five, take evasive action!

Red Dog Five: They‚Äôre all over me!

Red Dog One: Five, missile is hot! Right turn now!

Monte Puncu, northern Bolivia

‚ÄúSe√±or Bentley, you need to hear this!‚Äù Auka Cuya waved me over, a tense look on his face.

‚ÄúW-what is it?‚Äù I asked, confused.

‚ÄúAiden and I had just intercepted this distress call from a ‚ÄòFalcon One.‚Äô Apparently the President of Bolivia was on board and‚Ä¶‚Äù He let the words hang.

Then he said, ‚ÄúJust listen.‚Äù

He played the recording on his computer. For about five minutes, all we heard was static and unintelligible voices.

Then we heard, ‚ÄúThis is Falcon One to El Alto Tower, requesting permission to land, over.‚Äù

No response. Then: ‚ÄúEl Alto Tower, this is Falcon One. Requesting permission to land. Over.‚Äù

There was about four minutes of silence before someone finally responded. ‚ÄúFalcon One, El Alto Tower. Find an alternate, sir. We are shut down.‚Äù

The pilot of Falcon One-whatever it was supposed to be-sounded confused. ‚ÄúSay again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI repeat: break the pattern, do not attempt the landing,‚Äù The air traffic controller said.

‚ÄúWhat the actual‚Ä¶?‚Äù Falcon One‚Äôs pilot sounded flabbergasted.

Then the air traffic controller said something that chilled both of us. ‚ÄúAll airports in Bolivia are currently on lockdown. Do not attempt the landing!‚Äù

Before the man could continue, we heard alarm bells ringing. ‚ÄúOh, Mary and Joseph ! The collision system is going crazy!‚Äù

The pilot said, ‚ÄúTower, my threat detection system is lighting up like a Christmas tree here! I got a bogey coming in at nine o‚Äôclock!‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger that! We see it!‚Äù The controller said. ‚ÄúNo transponder‚Ä¶M√≠ Dios, that thing is headed towards you faster than Mach One!‚Äù

‚ÄúTower, my threat board just went red!‚Äù The pilot was sounding hysterical now.

‚ÄúFalcon One, right turn heading, 180 now!‚Äù The air traffic controller was screaming too. ‚ÄúYou have countermeasures, now is the time to use them!‚Äù

‚ÄúCountermeasures?!?‚Äù The pilot sounded even more bewildered.

He was quickly answered by his copilot, who said, ‚ÄúI got it!‚Äù

‚ÄúFalcon One, you are under attack! Go to max throttle! Max speed!‚Äù The air traffic controller suddenly changed tones, now sounding resigned to the fact that the plane wasn‚Äôt going to make it.

‚ÄúBaro‚Ä¶!‚Äù The pilot was growling under his breath. ‚ÄúBaro, you traitor!!!!‚Äù

He was cut off by a massive explosion, followed by the end of the recording.

I glanced at Auka, who was just as pale-faced as I was. ‚ÄúDo you know who that was?‚Äù I asked.

Auka was trembling as he tried to answer. ‚ÄúA-according to the news, that p-plane was carrying the president of Bolivia.‚Äù

Breaking news: Hundreds reported dead from coordinated explosions across Bolivia.

September 3, 2019

The Bolivian government held a press conference today concerning a series of bombings that destroyed several Santa Blanca and La Unidad outposts across multiple provinces in Bolivia, in addition to the assassination of Bolivian President Miguel Choque. 

According to Bolivian Journalist Lupe Vera, Santa Blanca is considered a prime suspect.

The total number of deaths is unknown but it has been confirmed that Bolivian President Miguel Choque is among the dead.

The investigation is currently ongoing.

In other news, the United States has announced a military intervention to ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù Santa Blanca. 

More on this as it develops.

As I'm doing the lessons (for example today is 43, ""God it my Source. I cannot see apart from Him"") I'm hearing cars drive by and touch of my clothes on my skin and tasting coffee flavor on my tongue and smelling my house... and it seems kind of odd to me that the text focuses on vision and doesn't seem to discuss these other sense perceptions of the world. It makes sense to me that these would change, too, but I'm not reading where it discusses them.

Can someone who has gained ""vision"" discuss if/how the other senses of perception are involved? It seems limiting to me to focus on just eyeballs.

This person generalizes the lesson to all forms of perception:

[https://www.urbanhealersofla.com/a-course-in-miracles-lesson-43/](https://www.urbanhealersofla.com/a-course-in-miracles-lesson-43/)

I think this is also closely related to the question of course interpretation. I try not to interpret it. I try to understand it exactly as it's written because I can understand it that way but it seems to leave out any discussion of the other senses. 

Please, if the other senses are discussed somewhere, let me know where. The only place I can generalize seeing to being equal to all the other senses of perception is way later, in lesson 161:

I'm also a borderline avoidant, where I can go out if needed but I prefer staying home all day. Pretty much my life right now is coffee badge at office, go home, workout, then work, repeat. I meet out with friends maybe once every 2-3 months at most. I almost never go out unless I have to for doctor or social/familial obligation.

Right now I'm cutting down to 10% bodyfat, but I've noticed as my weight went down, not only am I any more satisfied with how I look, but I just found new stuff to be self conscious about like my jawline, mouth, etc and looked into plastic surgery. It doesn't help I find myself wasting a lot of time on social media. I also abuse dangerous drugs like anabolic steroids, fat burners that can kill you, etc. I don't think I've realized how bad I've gotten until I realized how abnormal it is to take stuff that could kill me if I fuck up the dosage.

I think I also suffer from racial insecurity or perhaps some insecurity in my masculinity as a asian man living in the west, and fitness was just a way to try to compensate for that. But I'm starting to realize to be actually masculine, it can't be from the outside, gotta be from the inside. I lack total self confidence and pride in myself. Also, forget dating altogether. I don't even feel normal around people due to being so avoidant, I find myself having misanthropic thoughts and feel like a total alien. I feel total social anhedonia as well (perhaps from my dexedrine prescription which I've noticed dulled and killed a lot of my emotions and personality). I'm almost 30 but I don't have my shit together and I'm totally socially stunted, if I get fired from my current job I'm probably fucked as it'll be very difficult to interview for a new one with how much my social skills have atrophied.

Not sure why I'm posting this. Just curious on how other people deal with body dysmorphia or perhaps racial insecurity. My only plan right now is to move back into the city and perhaps pick up a martial art gym or something for socialization (i work out in a home gym)",2,1756488194.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Morning Routine: -
1. Wake up, drink a glass of water first thing in the morning as the night builds up we get dehydrated. So hydration is the foremost important thing in the morning.
2. Make your bed - Your first dopamine hit in the morning, you feel motivation ated for the rest of the day.
3. Hygiene - Obviously important to keep yourself fresh and clean, oral hygiene first to be specific, and face wash.
4. Yoga/Light exercise - Generation of dopamine, serotonin as well as endorphins in this process. Plus movement keeps your body in a better condition. 
5. Cold shower - Increases adrenaline and dopamine, beneficial for improving your mood as well as a step towards hygiene after the exercise sweat!
6. Skin-care : - Something everyone should follow, with the proper cleanser, exfoliator, toner, essence, serums, moisturizer and last but not the least sunscreen. 
7. Gratitude practice : - 3 things I am great for today and why I'm grateful for them, helped me get into a positive minset.
8. Visualise your day with the routine you have prepared in the previous night, make any changes required and get started.
9. Coffee, ofcourse, because, there's no because it's important. 

I know it's a bit much, but I used to follow this and it helped me a lot, now, I'm trying to get back into it again.

Pictures are available if you'd like to know who you're talking to ‚Äì just ask!

A little about me:

* üíº I work as a software dev
* üíª üéÆ Into programming, tech in general, and casual gaming (Think Final fantasy, TLOU)
* üèã To compensate the sitting down for 8h/day I try to work out every other day
* üèñÔ∏è Can snowboard/ski, and I love going on vacations ‚Äì from simply exploring beautiful spots with a coffee or wine in hand, to Disneyland or all-in resort trips.
* ü¶Æ I also love going for walks with my dog.
* Personality-wise, I‚Äôm introverted and a little socially anxious at times. I tend to enjoy staying in my safe space, but that doesn't mean I want to spend all of my time staying indoors. I love being outdoors, especially when it's sunny. Winter months, although cosy, is the most depressing part of the year for me.

I‚Äôm looking for something serious, please only reach out if you‚Äôre a Dutch- or Flemish-speaking woman of similar age and live in Belgium (or a neighboring country). Also, just to not waste each other's time, I'm strictly monogamous and there's 100% a desire to have children.

Looking back now, I realize I wasted months (probably years) making the same mistakes over and over again.

And it‚Äôs not just me. I see the exact same patterns in creators that I coach show up again and again. It‚Äôs almost comforting in a way,  because if you‚Äôre making these mistakes, you‚Äôre definitely not alone.

Here are a few of the biggest ones I see:

\- Posting like Instagram is your personal diary. Random updates, selfies, coffee pics‚Ä¶ I did this for years. The problem? Nobody follows you for your latte order. They follow you because you give them something useful, inspiring, or entertaining.

\- Refusing to pick a niche. I used to post travel, food, outfits, random quotes... it confused people (and the algorithm). Once I got clear on my lane, growth became so much easier.

\- Inconsistent posting. I‚Äôd disappear for weeks, then come back with a bunch of posts. Spoiler: this doesn‚Äôt work. The creators who grow are the ones who show up consistently, even if it‚Äôs just a couple times a week.

\- Buying followers (yes, I tried this once). Worst decision. Engagement tanked, and it took forever to recover. I see a lot of beginners fall into this trap because it looks like a shortcut, but it‚Äôs not.

\- Loop giveaways. Same deal. You get followers who don‚Äôt care about your content and end up with a ghost audience. It can hurt you for months.

There are a bunch more (I actually wrote out 20 in detail), but if you can avoid just these, I think you‚Äôll already be ahead of most creators.

What about you? Which mistakes do you feel like you‚Äôve made before that others could avoid?

First ,and the hardest for me, was believing in the winning of justice, that the noble cause would eventually prevail and that God would punish the oppressor. But when I really thought about it, I realized that often justice never returns to its people, and oppressors go unpunished. Palestine might never be freed, just as countless indigenous peoples were oppressed, erased, and forgotten.

At the same time, this realization sparked anger in me about how we were raised and taught: that if we were wronged, we should stay silent because ‚ÄúGod will get our rights back.‚Äù My perspective shifted, I felt that no, we must fight for what truly matters in our lives.

Second, my sense of guilt. There were so many things I used to feel guilty about, even though they harmed no one and often benefited me, like music, healthy romantic relationships, smoking, or drinking alcohol in small amounts, and many other things. Now, it feels liberating. Honestly, even if I somehow went back to being religious one day, I wouldn‚Äôt give up those things. Well‚Ä¶ except I still can‚Äôt stop flipping over a slipper when it‚Äôs upside down.

Third, my relationships with the people I love. I came to terms with the fact that this is the last time I‚Äôll ever see them in this life: the last time I kiss my mother‚Äôs hand and drink coffee with her on the balcony, the last time I swim with my friends, or stay up late working on something I love‚Ä¶ That realization gave me a sense of responsibility toward my circle and toward myself‚Äîto live, make the most of this life, and stay away from bitterness.

Fourth, and the biggest change, my view of life itself. There are many philosophies about the meaning of life and why we exist, and people keep searching for ultimate purposes. But after deep thought, I came to believe: life has no external purpose. Life itself is the purpose. You can have short- and long-term goals, but the ultimate ‚Äúhigher purpose‚Äù is simply to live, to experience life with its ups and downs, its difficulties and its challenges.

I had started to feel better so went out with friends to the pub last weekend and there was an incident where a guy grabbed me. It was the first time that anything like this has happened so obviously it was extremely frightening and upsetting for me. I met up with my mum the next day, she asked how my night out was and I explained what had happened. Her response has upset me further to say the least.

She wondered why I could be upset about this when I was not physically injured and asked why I didn‚Äôt just move away. When I shook my head at this, she asked me why I was doing and I explained that she cannot dictate what makes me upset. She replied with telling me that I make things very difficult for her when I only tell her half the story (I‚Äôm not sure what she meant by this as I explained the whole situation). We were out for coffee at the time and I began to get upset, she told me to stop looking around because no one could see me crying anyway before turning away and going on her phone.

I have not been in contact with her since. She has sent me 2 Snapchat messages over the past couple of days but I have not opened them, I imagine they will just be regular conversation and nothing to do with the discussion we had. Idk how to go forward with this as anytime I have previously tried to speak to her about things, she will become defensive and turn it around on me.

I'm one year post social media and most apps (banking + soundcloud are still happening) and about half a year from mindless browsing ( I do +/- 45 min of news/reddit with my coffee and a video essay in the evening) 

About a month ago it clicked for me - yes all of the work-reform leftist takes can still hold true - yet... once I was mostly off the web I found myself... bored in the best possible way. I have time a plenty. The next realization was that my 9 to 5 seems... fine all of a sudden?

Nobody wants to work anymore? Yes! Because the internet has become labour. Everything you do online is tracked for profit - your data, every cursor move, every decision of what you click is feeding algorithms that in turn monetize your data in hopes of getting you to spend on the advertisements you're fed or into the frustration you feel that the experience in apps/sites isn't the same as it once was and in turn subscribe.

I've been online for 25 years now and... it's over.

I'm truly considering being post-internet.

At this point in time... there is no government mandate for you to be online. So I'm not going to be.

Trabajo para un call center qu√© atiende llamadas de americanos. En mi m√°s sincera opini√≥n, creo que necesito desahogarme con alguien (ojal√° no me ignoren) para poder continuar porque, en mi pa√≠s pagan m√°s por hablar idiomas que por tener carreras profesionales.

Imagen de gatito para no morir ignorada.

He tomado llamadas de personas que si son educadas, son pacientes, saben lo que quieren. Con esto no quiero generalizar, solamente desahogarme porque como con todos los pa√≠ses, hay variedad de personas. Las que parecen personas y las que no.

Hay personas que simplemente escuchan mi tono de voz, soy mujer, tengo la voz suave, quiz√°s demasiado, latina, joven adulta. Y al parecer me escuchan y se fastidian‚Ä¶lo juro. Quisiera saber si no soy la √∫nica y qu√© consejos me dan. Intento no prestar atenci√≥n a los comentarios de que yo no s√© nada. No tengo ingl√©s, que no les gusta mi asent√≥, que no quieren hablar conmigo, pues porque se sab√≠a desde siempre que tomar llamadas es duro.

Pero hay veces de veces, tome la llamada de un se√±or que fue muy ofensivo, me tomo con la guardia baja y me hizo llorar.

Entonces para quienes tengan consejos y quieran regal√°rmelos, se los agradecer√≠a mucho.

Porque intento ser fuerte pero tengo sentimientos, que te insulten directamente en tus o√≠dos por tu nacionalidad solamente es hiriente y tener que tratarlos con amabilidad es denigrante.

After using PP for few years (full payment of an unlimited pass - Europe Customer), I've decided to cancel my membership.   
  
As a lot of people said before, if everybody gets it...

In the last 2 months, I've been to 14 airports. I felt my PP was... useless.

Seoul, Korea : good lounge, good food, nothing bad to say.  
Bangkok, Thailand : even if crowded, always good atmosphere in the lounges!  
Sri Lanka : horrible lounge, food was really not appealing, very old lounge, no power outlets  
Duba√Ø : long waiting time for entering in the lounge, inside felt like a canteen and the area has been reduced compared to before.  
Paris, France : still no lounge, how is that possible for Paris ?  
Ponta Delgada, Portugal : no lounge but it's a very small island so understable   
Montreal, Canada : shocked too that no lounge available if you fly to USA...   
Chicago, USA : no lounge in my terminal  
Miami, USA : small lounge, decent, nothing bad, nothing good!  
Belize City : no lounge  
Roatan, Honduras : no lounge  
Managua, Nicaragua : no lounge (3 times in a row is painful)   
San Jos√©, Costa Rica : 2 lounges, okay, not bad, not good but had to pay for coffee/beer/wine...  
Panama City : same, not bad, not good but spacious and a nice bar in Copa Club ! 

On my last 14 airports, it was very disappointing and I was almost always offered with :   
\- no lounge  
\- long waiting time  
\- horrible lounge / food / atmosphere

A lot of times I had more interest in the food I could see outside the lounges or the atmosphere of some restaurants and bars that are more quiet, less crowded, with better food, ... 

If my PP was free (included with a card from a bank), I would not complain. But paying for this level of service is really annoying.

Well, it's now 3 weeks I try to cancel my membership but nobody is answering the emails. I guess they will not forget to charge me despite the fact I sent my cancellation request 35 days before.

Anyone else?,"I was laid off 10 months ago after spending 8+ years at a consumer app where I was promoted every couple of years. At first, I felt confident about finding something new. Now I am burned out and do not know what else to try.

My background is mostly in Technical Program Management with earlier experience in Project Management and Customer Support. I have been applying widely in PM, Ops, and Product. Outside of my lane, I get no traction at all. Inside my lane, I get interviews and even final rounds, but the rejections feel brutal at this point. The feedback is always super specific, like ‚ÄúWe wish you were more creative with the table on slide 4 of the assignment"" or ‚ÄúWe went with a candidate who has more experience in strategic financial modeling in the crypto sector"".

I have tapped almost every part of my network. I have gotten referrals to about a dozen jobs, and it has not made much difference. I cannot afford a career coach right now. Coffee chats on LinkedIn have been hit or miss.

Meanwhile, my savings are gone, I am on public assistance, and I had to move back in with my parents. I have avoided picking up barista or bartending work because it would knock me off public health insurance, which I cannot risk losing. It feels like a trap. I want to be doing something, but every option feels like it pushes me further into being stuck.

At this point my brain keeps going to extremes. Should I try to become a content creator? Do I go back to school for healthcare? (Which would be stable but is not something I am overly passionate about).

Is anyone else in a similar boat? How are you handling it, or what helped you if you have been through this before?

**TLDR:** Laid off 10 months ago after 8+ years in tech. Lots of applications, some final rounds, constant rejections. Savings gone, back with parents, stuck between dead-end jobs that cut off insurance or extreme pivots like healthcare school or content creation. Burned out and looking for advice or to hear from others in the same spot.",41,1756487143.0,womenintech,11,1.0,False

Today morning already started stressful. Just a quick backstory, because that is relevant.

It was little over 8 am in the morning when one of my managers messages me, saying how this and that has not been done and can I find out what's happening. And in my head I am already like *'Ugh, what is it now?'* There is always SOMETHING with that specific manager. EVERY TIME. Fine. I check. Turns out another department failed to meet their deadline and I had some words with a woman who always says the most stupid things as an excuse. She should seriously read what she writes before she hits 'send', because it is just ridiculous.

Anyhow, things got cancelled, delayed and it wasn't even 9AM. So I am kind of ticked off now, because I had to move real quick as I didn't have a lot of time to fix it. It is high stakes and it just adds stress. I haven't had my coffee, it is fucking raining outside and I have been waiting for this week to end the WHOLE week, because it has been a total shitshow and now this, too.

I get to the office. I'm just upset now, but work is still waiting to be done, so let's just get it over with. I do my usual stuff and THEN.. while doing my usual stuff, I get a reply on my Teams saying *'Uhmm, excuse me, but I just found out that we don't do this, you do.'* I am literally like 'wtf?' behind my screen. I type back: 'Since when? ''Susan'' - *her direct manager that sits in the same room as me* \- doesn't know anything about it. You are sure you mean  \*\*\*\* ? '' just to clarify that we don't have a misunderstanding. Silence.

2 minutes later, she, let's call her Laura, comes into the back office side of things. Whooses past me to the next door, to catch ''Miranda''. Miranda is not my boss, but she is the boss of Susan. Obviously, she kind of realized that she needs back up. Miranda was not in her office, so I just called her from my office:  ''LAURA!'' And I am guessing my tone is already signalling I don't have time for any fuckery. She goes: ''Yes, yes, in a minute.'' And then silence, again. I just step outside my door and say: ''Did I just talk to you in Teams? Well, come here.''

She enters the room and I ask: 'So what do you mean, you are not doing it? Since when?'

Laura: ''Uhm, ''Lisa'' told me that  we don't actually do it.''

Ok, now I am dumbfounded. Lisa was one of the WORST employees I have had the pleasure to work with during my 6 years in this company and seeing A LOT of people. She was briefly in our department, then she got her papers and moved away to another department, but still the same company. And let me tell, 99% of us were relieved we got rid of her.

Me: ''Lisa told you? Who is Lisa? *(as in what is the relevance, ya know).* Since when has our agreement changed?'' I am legitimately confused, because it wouldn't be the first time things change and I just find out, but Susan said that everything's same, so what's with 'I'm not doing it, you have to do it'? And honey, I am way above your pay grade. YOU do not assign me work. It is just crossing lines and everyone knows that if you are NOT MY BOSS then don't act like one.

Laura: ''But Lisa told me we don't!''

Me: ''Ok. Who is your boss?''

She looks at me with those wild animal eyes that are completely empty and then after a moment of pause: ''Miranda''

Me: ''So WHO is Lisa?'' She doesn't even work in our floor.

Laura: ''Ok, there is no need to yell at me..''

Me: ''I am not yelling at you. I am being direct.''

Laura: ''We can just talk about it without raising voices.''

Me: ''I am not raising my voice at you. I am ASKING you direct questions, because I have not been informed of this change. This agreement..''

Laura: ''ok, ok, calm ..''

Me: ''THIS AGREEMENT .. has been valid for **2 years**. If there are any complaints or disagreements then we need to set up a meeting and review this,  not stop working just because Lisa told you something.''

She just backed away from the office and didn't come to the back for the WHOLE DAY. She even skipped lunch with us.  But she did what I asked her to do. She also didn't take it to Miranda.

I know she doesn't like me. I know people have said that she has literally  talked shit about me behind my back and etc. She is just a miserable, jealous person. And her crap, trying to make me look like the bad guy, is not gonna work on me. I have learned my lesson of being friendly and kind and letting shit slide in corporate. It's the WORST thing you can do.

Just because I am being direct with you and I am a woman, doesn't mean I am aggressive. It also doesn't mean I am wrong.  I am almost never wrong and I call it as I see it. People hate it and they always try to twist it as I am being hostile.

I am just done letting people get away with random shit. Just shut up and do your job. If you don't like something, you have a MANAGER. Talk to her! Let's find a solution.

Susan, who was there the whole time and didn't say A WORD, said after Laura left the room : ''Well, now she learned her lesson.''

Yeah, I don't think Susan likes Laura much.

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview Richtech defines their company mission as, ‚ÄúBy harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúRichtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.‚Äù As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned as the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable.

Market Opportunity A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let‚Äôs continue to discuss RR‚Äôs market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.‚Äù Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution. This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don‚Äôt be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech‚Äôs competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech‚Äôs 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you‚Äôve got a company that isn‚Äôt just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50‚Äì$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they‚Äôll reconsider.

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to ‚Äúcapture the market share.‚Äù All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia‚Äôs CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia‚Äôs scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:

Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you‚Äôre in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.",1,1756486654.0,wallstreet,0,1.0,False
1n3cudb,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1n3cudb/improve_sensory_perception_in_rd_beverage/,Improve sensory perception in R&D (beverage),"Hello everyone, I'm currently a food lab intern, supporting the R&D staff with beverage projects (energy drinks, soft drinks, milk, coffee, etc.). My company develops products based on customer requests, such as recreating a flavor similar to an existing market product, reducing sugar content without significantly affecting taste, and developing new concepts for benchmarking.

However, I find it really challenging to apply my sensory perception during evaluation. For example:

* I can‚Äôt always tell which samples are closest to the market product
* Struggle to identify which sample has a higher or lower dosage compared to another one
* Often fail to recognize specific flavors (berry, coffee, nut, vanilla, fruit, etc.)
* Unlike the senior R&D staff, I can‚Äôt easily distinguish the first taste, middle notes, and aftertaste with just a few drops

I‚Äôd love to ask for advice:  
üëâ How can I improve my sensory evaluation skills day by day? Are there any practice exercises or techniques that can help me enhance my perception?

Thanks in advance for your advice \^\^",2,1756486629.0,foodscience,0,0.75,False

1n3cu14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1n3cu14/sadness/,Sadness,"I feel like I have always been tensed in this marriage, always have the need to ask my husband to pay attention to me, always accepts the ADHD excuses, always have to understand whenever he says "" this is who I am "", always have to adjust as a wife, because his mom lives with us, always enduring, always serving him like a king. Being a wife is new to me. 
I have adjusted quite a lot, because I am the princess in my family. I moved across the globe to be with him. All my husband needs to do is put on his work clothes and go to work, and the rest is taken care of. I make sure he eats warm homecooked meals, packed lunches, water, make sure the coffee is ready, make sure bath towels are clean every other day, laundry handled, makes sure he comes home to a clean house, I help a lot with manual hard and heavy labors for the house. I honestly never worked this hard in my life. But I am willing to, I have not complained about this to him, because I believe this is me taking part in this marriage since he is the only one working for now. 

Then one day a sudden loneliness hits me, I started asking for attention, I started asking for a little bit of his time.

On the weekends, it's either we go swimming with his mom, or go to stores with his mom, so, basically I am a backseat passenger. And or, he plays video games for hours, and I sit in our bedroom, which is also my everything in the house. Because his mom already set herself up in the living room watching tv all day. And we live in a small apartment. 


I asked him just to be sure, if he considers the ""times that we go out but with his mom"" a quality time for me and him. 


And he said yes, which I told him directly that I don't. I only consider quality time with you when its only you and me in the picture. 

I have never dealt with these peoblems, and never knew this is his perspective when we were still LDR. 


I feel like I'm losing myself, the spark in me as a person, I feel like I'm slowly losing it. This is no longer myself, I used to be such a happy, jolly, outgoing, active person, my family and friends loves me for it. 


When I joined this family, I feel like my energy is slowly draining. I just found out I joined a family of outcasts. Very different from what I grow up from very family oriented, loving, caring, respectful and fun. I am in constant struggle mentally snd my body is in constant craving for that energy back home.

I failed to do the due diligence.  


One day on our way to the grocery store, I told him, I have been needing a husbands attention to his wife, I have been feeling neglected, I have been feeling alone, lonely and tired. And there he lost it, he responded yelling, all throughout the journey, that he cannot add more time to give attention to me, What do you want me to do? Saying these over and over again. 

 but he can spend 8 hours or more playing video games during the weekend. I am not even asking for hours of his time, I am just truly asking to make me feel seen and for him to want to spend an alone time with me not just when he wants s*x, and not always do something with his mom. I need my husband. 


Ps: From the start, I told him that I get really scared when someone is yelling at me, due to childhood trauma with all those times I almost got hit my public transpo in my country, the drivers would yell at me, and left me scared to death. 

In that car while he was yelling at me, immense fear ran through my spine, and when I look at him, he looks like a different person,  not the one I married. 


It breaks my heart really, from then on, I have never slept normally, cries by myself, second guessing my decisions, I see him differently now, and the worst part is the man that I imagined having a baby with makes me scared to have one now.

I posted this in another sub earlier, but mostly got some nasty dm's. I hope it's okay if I post here.

Last night I went on a date that went really wrong and I just need to vent somewhere and get some feedback or advice. Sorry in advance for the long rant. 

Some context and getting straight to the point: I'm 22 (f) and I'm trans. I refuse to let my being trans define me, but I am very open about it and about who I am. Everybody around me knows. Most of the time I‚Äôm really happy with life. I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends who‚Äôve had my back through everything. The only thing I‚Äôve been struggling with is loneliness in the romantic sense. I get plenty of male attention, but most leave the moment they find out I‚Äôm trans. So here I am, 22, with very little experience in that area.

You can imagine how thrilled I was when my friend Marie asked if I‚Äôd be interested in going on a date with Jake (not his real name). He had expressed interest and she wanted to set us up. Jake and I have known each other for years but were never close. We have lots of mutual friends and see each other at parties, but he‚Äôs always had a girlfriend and we never talked much beyond small stuff.

Jake invited me out for drinks at his favorite cocktail bar last night. I was excited and really wanted everything to go well. I went shopping for a new dress, got my nails done and really tried my hardest on my hair and makeup. It worked, because I could see his eyes light up when I showed up. At first the date was amazing. We talked for hours and I laughed so much. I had eaten very light that day and the alcohol hit me a little hard, so he suggested a walk. It was perfect. We held hands, laughed some more and when I said I was getting cold, he invited me over for coffee at his place. And honestly I wanted nothing more.

Once we got there, it didn‚Äôt take long before we were making out on his couch. The kissing was exhilarating. At one point I was sitting on top of him and things were clearly about to go further. That‚Äôs when everything went wrong. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but it was something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre okay with me.‚Äù He looked confused and asked what I meant. My heart dropped. I carefully said, ‚ÄúYou do know I‚Äôm trans right?‚Äù

He pushed me off him gently at first and asked if I was joking. When I said I wasn‚Äôt, his whole demeanor changed. He started yelling, cussing, telling me I had tricked him and that I was disgusting. Eventually he shoved me really hard and I slammed into a cabinet. Then he came at me with his fist raised and stood there for what felt like forever. I froze, curled up, and just cried.

Suddenly his roommate was standing there, I guess because of the noise. I grabbed my purse and bolted.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I keep seeing that look in his eyes. I was so scared and I hate that my reaction was to freeze. I can‚Äôt stop crying. I've got a massive bruise on my back. I‚Äôm scared to tell anyone because I don‚Äôt want it to turn into a whole thing. I know I should have checked if he knew I was trans. I just really thought he did, Marie did too. And she's been texting me all day asking how it went and I don't know what to say. I just know she'll feel guilty and I don't want that.

I keep replaying the kiss in my head. How amazing it felt and how ruined it is now. I don't really know how to handle this now and I feel like shit. It really wasn't my intention to decieve him in any way. ",188,1756486371.0,TwoXChromosomes,50,0.85,False

\-----

***SUMMARY***

**Part Four**

The narrator says there's no white light in the afterlife. She's just waiting in the old house, even after everyone has left, waiting to be found. She says Stella is all of her strengths and none of her weaknesses.

**22- Cheryl**

Cheryl visits Rita with coffee. She tells Rita Stella is over at Kookom's a lot more often, but Rita is dismissive, saying Stella has denied who she is. Cheryl says Kookom's happy Stella is back, but she's concerned because Kookom is acting more confused. Rita asks about Paul and Emily, and suggests they all go for a sweat once everything blows over.

Cheryl reminisces about her ex, Joe, and how she used to live in the bush with him off an on, but had to go back to the city when Rain started getting worse and would go missing for days at a time. She remembers the time she took Rain to a storyteller who told a tale about female werewolves. Rain says she wishes she could shapeshift into a wolf because no one messes with a wolf.

**23- Stella**

At Kookom's, Stella reminisces about the times she and her mother lived there, and how Stella drifted away from her family. She remembers how her mother used to tell her different versions of Sleeping Beauty, where Aurora leaves Prince Charming to live in the bush. She also remembers the last time Rain left, and how she was beaten to death and ignored by hospital staff until she died outside.

Kookom teaches Mattie how to make bannock, but her dementia is getting steadily worse as she calls Stella Rain at one point. Stella asks Kookom if she'd like to move to a better neighbourhood, but she declines, saying bad things happen even in good neighbourhoods. Cheryl drops by for a visit, and Stella admits that she witnessed the attack on Emily but was too afraid to do anything except call the police. Cheryl consoles her.

**24- Lou**

Lou is over at Paul's, who is nervous because she called the police again to try and fix her ""mistake"" when she mentioned Clayton Spence. Officers Scott and Christie come over with more questions. Lou takes offence as Tommy's tone and overeagerness. Tommy says they know the house Emily and Zegwan went to belongs to a gang leader. Lou then loses her temper and tries to stop the questioning to protect Emily.

Back at home, Lou gives Baby Boy a bath, and he asks when Gabe is coming home. Cheryl drops over, and they talk about Gabe. Lou acts tough, but she also regrets staying with him for so long. Cheryl tells Lou Stella saw the attack.

At the hospital, Paul says Emily will probably be discharged the next day, but she's worried Pete will leave. Lou tells her he won't because he loves Paul and is nothing like Gabe.

**25- Tommy**

Tommy and Christie arrive at Roberta Settee's house. Roberta's mom lets them in and lets her daughter have it. From the officers' description of the person who gave them the address, she immediately suspects Phoenix, calling her crazy and violent. Back at the car, Tommy pulls up Phoenix's rap sheet. Christie congratulates him on a job well done and calls him ""May-tee"" again. Tommy tells him not to call him that anymore. Christie doesn't understand what the big deal is and says he doesn't mean anything by it, since Tommy is different from other Natives.

Tommy visits his mother, Marie, and tells her everything. He can't believe that a girl would assault another girl like that, but his mother disagrees, saying rape is about power. He asks her why she stayed with his dad, even though he was a racist drunk. He asks her if she ever gets called ""different."" Marie mentions [blood quantum](https://www.theindigenousfoundation.org/articles/bloodquantum), a concept created by white people, but that Indigenous people don't care much about. She says people like Christie are stupid, even if they mean well. Tommy admits he tried to hide his M√©tis identity in school, but was encouraged by Hannah to include that on his police application. He feels stuck in between his identities. Marie suggests they visit his aunt, and Tommy says he'd like to bring Hannah along.

**26- Emily**

Emily splits her life into Before and After the attack. She tries to get up and walk in the hospital, but can't manage to get out of bed before feeling sick. Zegwan visits her and they crack a few jokes. Zegwan says Sundancer and Jake want to find who did this to her. Emily remembers the brutal assault and knows that Phoenix was the main perpetrator. The attack stopped when the bottle broke, and the girls fled, leaving Emily alone in the snow.

**27- Phoenix**

After she was caught and arrested at Bishop's house, Phoenix is in Remand. Her mother Elsie comes to visit her. Phoenix is not impressed and tries to act tough. Elsie says everyone knows Phoenix was behind the attack on Emily and that they want to try her as an adult and press sexual charges on her. It is also revealed that Phoenix is six, maybe seven months pregnant. Elsie asks Phoenix what she plans to do with the baby, because Elsie refuses to take care of it. Phoenix thinks she'll keep the baby and get out of jail. She knows it's a boy and wants to name him Sparrow. She vows to make him strong and hard. Phoenix wants to leave, but Elsie is desperate and says she'll get Phoenix's friends to put in a few good words. Phoenix knows her friends ratted her out and leaves, defiant.

**28- Flora**

Kookom enjoys everyone visiting her, though she knows Stella and Cheryl aren't telling her everything about Emily. She falls asleep and dreams of flying, then dreams of her abusive ex, Charlie, for whom she has conflicting feelings. Stella tells Kookom she might go back home tomorrow, but feels guilty for leaving. Kookom reassures her she's a good person and she came back even though she was lost for a while. Stella asserts Jeff is a good man, but doesn't understand. She also wants to go back to school, and Kookom encourages her. Kookom reflects on how lucky she is to have her family with her. Cheryl visits with doughnuts, tucks Kookom in bed, and wraps her arms around her as Kookom drifts off to sleep one last time and reunites with Rain.

**29- Cheryl**

After Kookom's funeral, the family, along with Rita and Zegwan, are headed for a [sweat](https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sweat-lodge) in the bush. Although Emily and Zegwan still bear physical and psychological scars of their attacks, Cheryl admires their resilience. They join Sundancer, Jake, Dan, and his father, who are already in the bush doing ""man things."" Cheryl spots an eagle flying overhead and knows it's Kookom watching over them. Cheryl told Rita that Stella witnessed the attack, and Rita is angry at Stella, saying she could've done more. Cheryl still hasn't told Paul. As the sweat ceremony begins, Cheryl imagines wolves.

Cheryl thinks back to when Emily first came home from the hospital, and the police told them they had arrested a bunch of girls. Lou feels sorry for Phoenix, but Paul has no sympathy.

On the way back to the city, Rita says Zegwan and Sundancer will go back with their dad to the bush, and Emily and Jake are invited to come for a visit. Rita and Cheryl resolve to give up drinking, Lou says she's already given up her man, and Paul wants to give up feeling hopeless. Cheryl sees stars and remembers the eagle. She has an idea for her next sketch, but enjoys her time with her family in the meanwhile.",3,1756486356.0,bookclub,15,1.0,False

But all these decisions are awful 

- 1: Tickets. Prior to about 2 weeks ago, our setup was this: A screen at the bar for all the drinks, tickets for our mobile orders (about a third of our sales, I'd guess), and bags that register would write on for the food. Now, everything is a ticket. You order a single coffee? That's a piece of trash we need to create. Also we now have drinks coming through 3 different printers (hot bar, cold bar, and drip) which relies on everyone actually needing to pay attention. And I can't even tell if I'm missing a drink because *they turned off the drink screens*. People have asked me ""where's my Americano?"" and I've just been like ""I don't know"" since that's a drip coffee drink, apparently, and no one's brought it over to me yet.
- 2: Staffing. As mentioned above, we have hot/cold bar stations. These actually work. ...When there's people to do both. We've been fighting through Saturday rushes of like 200 people on crews of like 3 people. And clearly the manager knows cause I heard him complain about working 12 days in a row. We have like 3 other people who work 2 days a week or less. And yet we haven't hired anyone in like 2 months.
- 3: Efficiency. There are multiple cases where corporate decides to artificially cut our efficiency because it's better (?). We shouldn't make more than 1 drink at a time on the bar with multiple espresso heads. We need to make matcha concentrate in batches of 16 oz pitchers as opposed to 48 oz ones (we'll go through 48 oz in about 40 minutes on some days). We can't warm up sandwiches at the same time as another identical sandwich, since as we all know it's better to bake each individual cookie one by one. Iced drinks ""need"" to have foam, so we put milk in a blender with nothing else and use that.

1n3conp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n3conp/need_advice_about_bf_his_parents/,Need Advice About Bf & His Parents,"Reddit has been my safe place to ask for advice about this horrendous saga that‚Äôs been going on since like last December (2024). I keep going back and forth on what I should be doing.

I (20F) am dating my bf (21M), and will have been for two years in late October. My bf is good to me and appreciates me. However, one of the main stressors in our relationship is the fact that his parents do not like me. 

Recently, in late July, we all had a sit down ‚Äúconversation‚Äù about the ‚Äúissues‚Äù that have been going on. The issues that we discussed honestly don‚Äôt even matter anymore, it‚Äôs how they decided to handle the conversation. They had one of his sisters there despite never saying she would be part of it (she has nothing to do with the issues) and the first thing they say is how awful the coffee is at the place we met‚Ä¶ 

Anyways, they called me controlling and codependent, accused me of faking being sick for bf‚Äôs two checkrides (I literally had food poisoning and the second time was still recovering from it because I have GERD), accused me of being too clingy with him, complained about how I didn‚Äôt call them/answer their calls but pointed out how I‚Äôm so intentional on the phone when it comes to MY family, accused me of trying to take away their son from them, basically told bf that he‚Äôs going to be an absent father in the future (I‚Äôm not pregnant btw), said that 70% of military marriages fail (bf is going military eventually and we have talked about marriage + they know that‚Äînote they are literally a military marriage as bf‚Äôs dad was in the Navy), his mom flat out blamed him for her ‚Äúhard year‚Äù / 90% of her crying/marital tension because, and this is a direct quote, ‚Äúmy child doesn‚Äôt give a lick about me, that‚Äôs the ‚Äòrub‚Äô,‚Äù and a few other things but I‚Äôd be here all day. 

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm no longer surprised when they treat me poorly (although they haven‚Äôt reached out at all since that conversation and I‚Äôm still blocked by both of them on Facebook, the only social media they really use), BUT I genuinely can‚Äôt stand how they treat my bf. They‚Äôre constantly complaining and whining about how bf doesn‚Äôt hardly ever call and never really goes to visit. Mind you, he lives three hours away in our college town, works two jobs, is taking 15-27 credit hours on average, and on top of that is in a professional fraternity for aerospace students where he holds a council position. He‚Äôs career focused and goal oriented, which I personally admire about him.

Even when he does visit or call their conversations are kept at surface level and there is no meaningful connection happening. Half the time, they‚Äôll also still complain saying that he only visited for a few hours (and that‚Äôs not enough) or that the he‚Äôs not consistent with the calls etc. They straight up asked him to get Life360 with them because I gifted him a new phone for a Christmas present because they would track his every move whenever he‚Äôd leave campus when he was still in a dorm.They guilt trip and manipulate to try and get what they want and it‚Äôs frustrating to watch. 

I wish I could somehow get bf to open his eyes and realize that they aren‚Äôt healthy to be around or to have a real relationship with. I get it, it‚Äôs his family and I KNOW that I can‚Äôt make any decisions for him despite wishing I could. But what DO I do? Waste away watching him be confused by what to do‚Äîchoosing his parents (who used to kick him out of the house when he was a teenager anytime they couldn‚Äôt handle a conflict between them and him) or his partner who has supported him through the chaos since being together? I don‚Äôt like not being able to do nothing. I‚Äôve tried having conversations explaining how it‚Äôs not normal behavior but he just brushes it off with ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre still my family/my parents,‚Äù as if that excuses all the damage done.

He‚Äôs expressed that he wants to try and have a relationship with them but then also says that he won‚Äôt be doing what they ask in regard to calling them and visiting them more,‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs part of having a relationship with someone. If he wanted a relationship with them that was genuine he would try to accommodate those requests, but he doesn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt intend to either based on conversations we‚Äôve had. 

The most important question is how do I best support him while also trying to help him mentally navigate their mental games? What do I do? Or is it a lost cause and I should leave? We live together (his family doesn‚Äôt know because he didn‚Äôt want to tell them because he would be harshly judged (super religious Christians)) and I don‚Äôt want to give up on us just because of their poor, destructive behavior. He‚Äôs proposing soon, and I think he thinks that maybe if I have a ring they‚Äôll respect us more, but if anything I think they‚Äôll look down on us even more. I‚Äôm at a loss and just need advice without judgement or hate.",1,1756486266.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I will be coming off a pretty intense 20 days traveling from Prague to Budapest, and some of it involves long days biking. I'll fly from Budapest to Athens on September 19th (yes in a few weeks!) I asked Chat GBT about an itinerary in the Peloponnese that doesn't have me stopping at new hotels every day. Something a big more slow, but where I can see all the necessary hits along the way.

One in Athens for a few days, then the next in Nafplio for five days and another in Karadmyli for five days. I can adjust the number of days.

1n3cnx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1n3cnx5/thoughts_on_a_minimalist_detached_approach_to_the/,"Thoughts on a minimalist, detached approach to the workplace?","A few years ago I worked in an office job where the experience was so bad it pretty much changed my approach to things going forward (and woke me up to a lot). It wasn't the first toxic job or experience I've had but it was significant enough to where it changed me (thankfully for the much better now, not because of what they did but because of finally realizing my own value). 

Anyway I had my own cubicle and like most of the people there I personalized it. Nothing excessive but just little positive sticky notes and small decorations. When things started getting toxic I removed all of it. My work bag filled with notes, my lunch bag, phone charger, even my coffee mug, etc...would come in with me and would leave with me every single work day. 

Going forward I've continued to do just that. A work bag that comes with me and leaves with me with all of the necessary items (notebook, pens, stickies, lunch bag, charger, etc...). I put nothing personal in the desk I'm assigned. If possible I try and bring a lunch that doesn't need to be refrigerated or heated. I make coffee/tea before I leave and take it with me. No decorations at my desk/cubicle. No changes to screens or personalized email signatures. I don't really use Facebook or Instagram much but I don't add bosses, coworkers, or anyone that I'm working with. 

It's also because I noticed many of the bullies I've had were the opposite. Their desks/cubicles are filled to the brim with pictures, decorations, gag quotes, coffee mugs, basically looks like they live there and made it their second home. They often have extremely fancy personalized signatures and very, very much in on all of the office parties and events. The fridge is filled with their stuff and they're the first to complain if someone else brought 'smelly' food or anything that isn't theirs takes space. And of course have everyone else in the workplace on their social media.  

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with having pictures, personalized signatures, enjoying an office party or event activity (I do to an extent), making use of the office appliances (fridge, microwave, etc...), making friends with someone you work with or whatever. I certainly would use the coffee machine or microwave if its available. What I am saying though is I have noticed a lot of codependent bullies I've encountered practically have made the office/their space into a surrogate home of sorts. That basically means they've made it their territory. It's not just their job and those aren't just their coworkers, its their FAMILY and if you don't treat it like such you're a problem to them. They'll run to the supervisor for every move you make and manipulate and busybody until you either give in (usually as someone they can dump their work on) or quit.   

Even bullies aside its also conveying to the workplace that you see it as such. That its not home, that they're not and never will be 'family' (even and especially if they claim they're 'like a family') and that you're there to do a job. Doesn't mean you can't be friendly, bring your coffee mug, enjoy a company sponsored lunch and heck even LIKE the job but its also drawing a silent boundary.

So I am in the miracolous situation I'm looking at a weekend (and then an entire week) all to myself (yay!!). Im 36(F) and since I moved in with my now husband 4 years ago I've found it really difficult to get enough time on my own. Luckily I'm married to and ISTJ who also loves to be on his own. Yet I often end up over-extending myself and by the time I ask for time alone I'm desperate, gasping for air, fragile, and completely overwhelmed. This time around is no different, so I'm really, really, really looking forward to a whole weekend of listening to music, wandering around my own thoughts, doing research, reading a novel, drinking coffee...basically: paradise.
However, in the back of my mind I'm afraid that I'll take it too far.. I'll hit that stage where I suddenly feel depressed because I didn't realize I started to self-isolate instead of just re-charging with some much needed time alone. Does this dilemma resonate with you? How do you tell the difference between needing more time alone vs. moving into unhealthy isolation?

1n3cl79,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n3cl79/reveal_what_makes_supplymasters_sodium/,Reveal What Makes SupplyMasters Sodium Percarbonate Powder Stand Out,"Using the SupplyMasters 9955 Sodium Percarbonate Powder has turned my cleaning routine into something oddly satisfying. This is one of those products that you don‚Äôt think you need, and then suddenly wonder how you ever lived without it. I have been working with this powder for weeks now, tackling everything from laundry to some grimy patio furniture. Let‚Äôs talk about why it stands out and where it stumbles, in my experience. 

**Performance and Versatility**

From the moment I opened the gloss bag, I could tell this wasn‚Äôt your average stain remover. The powder is fine and blends effortlessly into water. It was like watching chemistry at work when it dissolved and started to foam up slightly. I used it first on a white shirt that had been victimized by red wine (not my proudest moment). A pre-soak, followed by a gentle wash, revived the fabric like it was straight out of a commercial. Over the next several days, I experimented with carpets, countertops, and outdoor furniture. The versatility really hits home; it‚Äôs not just for laundry, but a go-to for multi-surface cleaning tasks.

**Positives**

- Exceptional stain removal for laundry, including tough stains like coffee and wine
- Dissolves easily in water, activating beautifully without residue
- Effective across diverse tasks such as general laundry brightening and surface cleaning  
- Convenient packaging prevents clumping and keeps the product easy to handle  

[Check SupplyMasters 9955 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b00okofuzm/)

**Usability in Laundry**

With two messy kids‚Äô clothes on regular rotation, I knew the real test would be in the laundry room. This powder doubles as a detergent booster and stain remover, which means I didn‚Äôt have to play scientist mixing different products for each load. What stood out was how much ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù whites and lighter colors seemed after washing. That oxidizing agent combination‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs the soda ash‚Äîclearly does the work of reviving dull fabrics. Tossing it straight into the washer rather than pre-soaking also worked for day-to-day stains but failed against heavily embedded dirt without some extra care.

**Drawbacks**

- Requires precise handling; too much powder creates excessive foaming in smaller washing machines  
- Not as effective when used in cold water for stubborn stains  
- Limited availability through local stores; primarily found online  

**Packaging Convenience**

I need to shout out the thoughtfully designed gloss bag. Somehow, it keeps everything pristine and avoids that typical humidity clump most powders get over time. The resealable feature on the bag was a lifesaver because it stopped accidental spills. I even stored it on a high shelf in the garage without concerns about contamination or product deterioration.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other stain removers like OxiClean or Arm & Hammer boosters, this sodium percarbonate feels like it offers a more tailored cleaning experience. OxiClean has a slight edge in fast-acting stain removal, especially for fabrics, but it feels a little too aggressive and can sometimes weaken fabrics. Meanwhile, Arm & Hammer is definitely more affordable, but it doesn‚Äôt come close to the stain-lifting ability I witnessed here. If you‚Äôre juggling versatility and impact, SupplyMasters really carves out a niche for itself.

**True Value**

The real question is: does this feel worth it? Yes, in my opinion, although I‚Äôll say it depends on how much you lean into multi-purpose cleaning products. It could be overkill for someone who rarely faces major stains or doesn't prioritize ultra-bright laundry. However, given that it lasts for ages and works so well, I‚Äôd call it a smart spend for anyone managing a chaotic household like mine.

As someone who is constantly juggling laundry for my own clothes, kids‚Äô inevitable messes, and a very active dog‚Äôs bedding, this product promised a lot. I‚Äôve spent weeks using it on everything from sweat-soaked towels to grass-stained uniforms, and here‚Äôs my take on it.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**  
The liquid laundry booster‚Äôs application couldn‚Äôt be simpler. I enjoyed how seamlessly it integrated into my laundry process. Whether you have a high-efficiency (HE) washer or a traditional one, just pour the specified dose into the designated detergent drawer or washer drum alongside your regular detergent. I also tried pretreating a few particularly stubborn stains by applying it directly, and it worked like a charm without much extra effort. Not only that, but it feels great knowing the formula is chlorine-free and color-safe, so there‚Äôs no worrying about faded colors or weakened fabrics.

**Performance and Results**  
Whether it was my son‚Äôs grass-stained sports shorts or towels that had been through multiple damp and humid cycles, every load came out better smelling and visibly fresher. This odor neutralizer doesn‚Äôt simply mask odors‚Äîit seems to outright tackle them. It was especially effective on body odors and persistent smells from workout clothes. Though I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a miracle, the product makes a noticeable difference in freshness and appearance. I also loved how pet bedding, often drenched in weird pet smells, came out clean enough to pass a sniff test.

[Check OxiClean 757037012086 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b078hd24pk/)

**Tough on Stains, Gentle on Fabric**  
What stood out most was the balance this formula struck between being powerful on set-in stains and gentle on the fabric. I tested it on delicate garments as well as rougher items like uniforms, and it worked wonders without compromising texture or structure. My partner frequently wears bright-colored clothes, and this never dulled or faded even the brightest reds and blues.

**Benefits**  
- Compatible with both HE and standard washers, keeping it versatile.  
- Eliminates not just surface stains but also odors like sweat and body smells.  
- Effective as a pretreatment agent for stubborn marks.   
- Chlorine-free, which ensures color safety on favorite clothes.

**Flaws**  
- A minor downside is that a significant amount is required for heavily stained loads, which could mean the 50 fl oz bottle runs out faster than expected.  
- For older, extremely stubborn marks (think years-old coffee spills), multiple washes were needed for complete removal.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other leading stain removers like Shout Advanced Gel or Tide Rescue Laundry Booster, the OxiClean booster edges out in dealing with odors. Shout may have the upper hand for tackling oily stains, but it doesn‚Äôt leave that ultra-clean smell OxiClean manages to achieve. Meanwhile, Tide Rescue works fine for routine stains but didn‚Äôt show as much transformative power for pet-related or teenage-sports-team-related sweat woes.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of cost efficiency, this product sits in the middle of the spectrum. It‚Äôs not dirt cheap, but considering its overall versatility, stain-fighting prowess, and fresh scent it leaves behind, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth every penny. For anyone fed up with stale-smelling workout gear or discolored fabrics, it aligns really well with practical household budgets.

I stumbled on it recently and it stood out to me because of how it‚Äôs structured compared to the usual trading education programs. Instead of being a long course with dozens of modules, it‚Äôs set up as a short 5-day sprint where the focus is on learning a single repeatable skill. The whole approach is checklist-based, which immediately made me think this might appeal to people who want trading to feel more systematic and less like gambling.

From what I gathered, the creator (Sean Donahoe) has been trading for over 25 years and teaches people how to spot opportunities, particularly in **microcap cryptos**. Rather than just sticking with mainstream coins like BTC or ETH, the system emphasizes finding hidden projects that have explosive potential. They even shared some examples of trades where students saw big returns in a short period of time. I take those with a grain of salt, since every trading program shows the highlight reel, but it does highlight the volatility and opportunity in that niche part of the market.

What actually caught my eye wasn‚Äôt the results, but the way the routine is described. He calls it a ‚Äúmorning coffee‚Äù style system ‚Äî basically, you wake up, run through a quick checklist, make a decision, and then you‚Äôre done for the day. The idea of being able to trade effectively without staring at screens all day feels refreshing compared to the typical grind of watching charts for hours. Got More Clarity from this [Titan‚Äôs Edge Formula Review](https://www.skool.com/mcc/titans-edge-formula-review-my-honest-take)

I‚Äôm not saying this is the holy grail of trading systems, but I do think it‚Äôs interesting how it frames trading as more of a structured business process than an emotional guessing game. It‚Äôs definitely pitched in a bold way, but the concept of simplifying trading into a routine you can actually stick with is appealing.

Has anyone here looked deeper into Titan‚Äôs Edge or tried a similar ‚Äúchecklist‚Äù style of trading before? I‚Äôd be curious to hear if this structured approach really works as well in practice as it sounds on paper.

I can do group projects fine, but when it's a class full of people who don't want to talk to me it's just uncomfortable and a struggle for me big time. I can't even pass this introduction course without doing this stupid project bro üíî

I do have a mental health appointment with the college this wednesday to mention my struggles, so hopefully something can be done.",0,1756485356.0,CollegeRant,2,0.4,False

1. **DOVE BODY WASH : WNRP**

Pros : Good for dry skin. Value for money.

Cons : I haven‚Äôt been a fan of the fragrance. It was okayish. A sweet smell of bland vanilla. Doesn‚Äôt linger much after the shower. Hardly an hour. Even though I have dry skin, I still got random micro buildups on my legs and back sometimes. Basically; moisturising yes, but sometimes TOO moisturising.


2. **PALMER‚ÄôS COCOA BUTTER BODY OIL - MOISTURISES AND SOFTENS**

Pros : Very nourishing, easily absorbs into the skin. Best for dry skin. Doesn‚Äôt feel synthetic at all. Texture is viscous. Great for winters. Gives a glowy look, then settles into the skin. Not sticky. I used this alongwith the Palmer‚Äôs Lotion and Choco Musk Roll-on / Westside Paris. The perfect gourmand. Also used it at night after applying glycolic acid on body.  Skin has never been this soft. Seriously good stuff.

Cons : Not really. But I‚Äôd love to try another variant so won‚Äôt be repurchasing.

3. **VASELINE COCOA BUTTER BODY LOTION : WRP**

OG for a reason. No bad things about this one. Non-sticky texture, vanilla cookie fragrance and moisturising quality is one of the best. Value for money. I‚Äôve always come back to this one after trying various lotions over the years lol. Basically the Toyota of body lotions.

4. **COSRX AHA/BHA CLARIFYING TREATMENT TONER : WNRP**

Watery texture. Did nothing for my dry skin. Made me broke out once. Never used it on my face again. Used it up by spraying it on body at night. 

5. **SIRONA BODY SCRUB**

It‚Äôs a physical exfoliater in a cream formulation. Scrubs well. Doesn‚Äôt leave the skin dry. Has a nice gourmand fragrance (coffee-vanilla) which stays after the shower. I‚Äôm unable to find this anywhere currently. Might have repurchased this one. 

6. **OLAY RETINOL24 MAX NIGHT MOISTURISER : WRP**

My HG. My first ever retinol I used. Great for beginners. This has single-handedly reduced my dark spots. Helps reducing my acne overnight. Smoothens the skin. My skin has a healthy glow thanks to this (and Alpha-Arbutin)

7. **LIVON HAIR SERUM : WNRP**

This has been my trusty hair serum since ages. I used several others but this always amazed me. Value for money. Great smell. Viscous and does the job. For reference, my hair is low-porosity, dry and frizzy, 2A-2B type.

But I‚Äôm keen on trying some other serums, so not purchasing another.

8. **CLEAN & CLEAR FACEWASH : WNRP**

I use Simple green one usually. This had been lying around in my house. Decided to aggressively pan it. Just for the sake of panning lol.

9. **NIVEA SUN SPF50 : WRP**

Amazing as body sunscreen. I had tanning on my hands and forearms due to driving. Alongwith arm-gloves and sunblock, it has considerably reduced. Texture is slightly thick and takes a while to absorb. No funny smell, non-sticky. Good for dry skin. 

10. **DOT & KEY BARRIER REPAIR MOISTURISER : WRP**

My HG. I have finished multiple tubes of this. Non-sticky, absorbs quickly, no fragrance detected. Good for dry and acne prone skin, like mine. I use it at night-time with retinol/alpha-arbutin. Settles nicely. Hasn‚Äôt broke me out.",19,1756485349.0,IndianPanPorn,2,1.0,False

1n3c8q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomKorner/comments/1n3c8q7/experienced_a_seizure_by_trying_out_methylene/,Experienced a Seizure by trying out Methylene Blue 2 days prior to Kratom use.,"To let everyone know. I tried Methylene Blue (MB) for 5 days. Normally I‚Äòm taking Kratom so I quit that beforehand (as I know MB & Kratom should better not be mixed because of potentially dangerous serotonergic interactions). I quit Kratom to get ready and be safe for the new trial of a maybe new helper, the MB. With the thought it might be able to treat my symptoms, as Kratom does only help little, and as I am in professional treatment for years and nothing helped, 15+ meds, 3 therapies failed. So the usual way, the traditional and professional school medicine doesn‚Äòt help, well what then => looking for alternative things. Hence my first touch with Kratom years ago, hence my first touch with MB now.

So I tried the MB. 5 days went by. Not very happy with the result of the trial. It was doing nothing significantly noticeable or aiding my symptoms. If, then it was not more than placebo or subtle. I was doing 2 drops of 1% first day to test for allergy, then 10 drops next day, 20 drops other 3 days. Nothing. 

To the topic: After this, I didn‚Äòt take MB for 2 days. As I know to rather not mix MB & Kratom and get it out of my system first, I took kratom first time again at a low dose of 3g, TWO DAYS after my last MB drops. And boom, had a seizure! I never had this before. It was VERY VERY scary.

More precisely, what happened, what I experienced and what it felt like. I drank coffee, sitting, 3g kratom dose was already more than an hour ago. I stood up to bring my coffee cup into the kitchen. While walking, first, my right arm turned numb and was moving uncontrollably. I almost dropped my coffee cup. Luckily I still made it into the kitchen, just the spoon dropped. From everyone knowing the feeling of numb arms when they ‚Äûfall asleep‚Äú I intentionally tried to hit my very loose and numb arm against things or my body to, or as it was uncontrollable rather trying to shake it against somewhere to make the numbness go away. Didn‚Äòt help much. 

Luckily my legs weren‚Äòt affected at ally. I was still able to walk and control my feet, anxious and shocked I went directly into my bed to see if it turns better laying diwn. I then noticed, okay the arm is better but I somehow couldn‚Äòt understand where I am or who I am. Everything was a bit dreamy. I was irritated and confused. 

Then, next thing, the for me scariest part: I tried to do something on my phone and couldn‚Äòt, okay, thought, that‚Äôs still the arm. But then I tried to read the titles of my apps, I saw the letters and knew it was a word, and I know those words and their meaning, but I just couldn‚Äòt understand it in that moment, I couldn‚Äòt read as much as I tried, I didn‚Äòt get to the meaning or any real word. I was shocked. So I tried to read it out loudly and I just couldn‚Äòt speak any word, it was a very slurring speech, no real words or sentences. I just couldn‚Äòt get out any real word or sentence, and couldn‚Äòt read out any words or letters or sentences on my phone or documents I tried to read the next second. I was more shocked. I tried to remember a song I was having in my mind and singing the whole morning before. I had it in my mind, I knew it was there and knew the melody (so assuming music itself as melodies is saved somewhere else in my brain than language) and I just couldn‚Äòt bring the song lyrics out verbally. Best I can describe. My verbal function was like reset to my verbal function when I was a baby. Even if I knew those are words and knew I knew the meaning. I was verbally and languge-understanding-wise totally blocked and disabled. Very scary.

This LUCKILY went again, too. After I really tried more and more texts to read and understand and speak out loudly. 

I was back to normal again. Just still a bit in dreamlike state and feeling confused.

But one thing that stayed until now, a thung I didn‚Äòt even notice occuring when this was happening, is my right cheek in the face still feels a bit numb. Also when I try to laugh, the right cheek doesn‚Äòt get as up as my left. It‚Äòs not tingling much or my whole face, it‚Äòs just the cheek feels slightly numb. I know I should have called 911 (and anyone should do this obviously) or emergency and visit acute ambulance when this happened but I‚Äòm currently visiting my mother and she doesn‚Äòt know about my Kratom use, so I was very hardly trying to just keep myself calm and not get any attention on it. Dumb in the sake of my health, but this is a personal blockage for me, that she just shouldn‚Äòt know about my Kratom use. Especially because it would be showing her that I was never telling her and hiding it. But I should have gone to ambulance 100% and everyone who experienced this should. Directly. Health especially something like this that could turn out to become permanent health issues is so priority, no matter what. Well only thing my individual weak mind was able to do, is to say, if this issue with the numb right cheek should sustain until tomorrow I will definitely go to a doc and get it all checked.

So, this mainly is for ANYONE looking for similar experiences when one experiences similar issues and to WARN you about possibly mixing substances, even if it was days before, half life of some substances makes the substance stay longer in your system than you think it would. In my case, Methylene Blue was taken 2 days prior to taking the Kratom and by MB‚Äòs half life it would still be in the body. 

To be said, I don‚Äòt know for sure if it was MB causing this. But it is very probable because 1. I never ever had anything like epileptic symptoms, strokes or seizures, blood pressure or heart issues, nothing and 2. the only thing different or changed was trying out the MB for 5 days, 2 days prior to me taking Kratom again. I also never had any issues of this kind with Kratom, and I had much more Kratom before, than the 3g. Maybe it also was a bit connected to standing up so quickly after drinking my coffee and vaping. But also here, I did this for years and never ever happened something.

If someone has a conclusion or assumption if it could have been the MB causing the seizure in combination with the Kratom and why (pharmacologically/biochemically) even if it happened on a day having no MB at all for 2 days prior, and only a 3g Kratom dose taken 1h+ before, please let me know. I‚Äòm happy to get more into it for checking this up and hopefully finding a good answer why the heck this happened. 

So anyone be very CAUTIOUS with any substance mixed with Kratom, EVEN IF the other substance was consumed days ago. Half life is real, the substance is not directly inactive just because you now slept a night.",4,1756485238.0,KratomKorner,10,0.75,False

Read all this with the context that I transitioned at age 22:


So A(M26) and I (L(F25)) have been friends for a long time now. It started out slowly. He was my barista, the first person I ever remember who remembered my order. We were both guys at the time. One day, I wore a Christian necklace and had gotten coffee. A conversation started wherein the end of it was as follows: ‚ÄúYou should come by this Thursday.‚Äù So I went, to a Christian (co-ed) fraternity.

I, He, and a bunch of other XY-Havers were in this Bible study group. And through that he and I started vibing with one another. 

(I want to take a brief narrative Fourth Wall break so as to say I may have always had a crush on him ‚Äî and every other guy I ever was close with. That is to say because of my uber rural, Appalachia., upbringing I was pretty much not just compHet because dysphoria but compHet for survival. Looking back at it now I‚Äôm pretty sure that all of my male best friends were actually crushes; meanwhile, all the girls I had crushes on were my best friends but because I had to comply with really strict societal rules, I mixed them up for a reason. I want to be clear my county voted per capital the most for Trump in 2016 to give a sort of background to yours truly.

Eventually, he and I started conversing. About religion and generally the other things we were mutually into. Unfortunately we‚Äôre both in what I hate to say the hipster sphere of town so we bonded over our love of indie country & other music, the Humanities, and of course alcohol.  We really became close as he was writing his capstone, on the Unethical Nature of Hell given an Infinitely Good God. I also had begun delving into Academic Christianity at the time. 1/2 that was because I did unfortunately fall for some of the Deus Vult aesthetic back then but another 1/2 was because I wanted to be the woke Deus Vult guy. That‚Äôs why I dated a doll at the same time I converted to Catholicism. Jess, I‚Äôm seriously sorry if you‚Äôre on here. However, as it was though I delved into church history ‚Äî quite literally to justify Transness and generally Queerness biblically, but I digress. Suffice to say we become friends, for real. We start hanging at bars more, he would host shows at his place. It was a good year and a half. I frankly still feel like a poser because I really wanted to fit in due in large part to be his friend; though I also loved these aesthetic anyway. Also by this time he became nonreligious, and I delved so far into philosophy and more esoteric conceptions of the Abrahamic God I am largely irreligious but I want to again be religious but I fear no place has the exact combo of thoughts I have. This mess has become a worse mess recently too ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

That good time left and so did I for Buffalo, New York to do graduate school. Once again, finding irony at this for doing this with my alt, that bares my face, while also including very specific details that no other person has ‚Äî the old English above is a big give away. There I finally started transitioning. I was terrified to tell him since I always saw him as my big brother and I didn‚Äôt want to fuck that up. He seemed honestly a little offended when I said that. All he responded with was ‚ÄòOf all people, you should‚Äôve known I was ok to tell this to.‚Äô 

So my then there came and went. The end of it brought forth a storm of negativity, which was so bad as to send me into the darkest places I‚Äôve ever been emotionally and mentally but also back to the southern college town, he lived it. That‚Äôs because after I graduated, I still loved that town and wanted to keep my social circle there alive. I had came down a lot to stay when I had a long break from classes at A‚Äôs place. I wanna be clear transitioning happened for me partly between grad school and now so there was a healthy mix of eggy boy and early transition me to be seen. 

When I had to leave town, he offered me the same bedroom I always stayed in until I got back on my feet. 

This is where the actually story begins. 

I noticed he started treating me differently. 

We used to dab each other up, now he offered me hugs ‚Äî actual hugs, not side ones. I noticed him starting to look over my way a lot more. He‚Äôd laugh at the dumb double entendres I‚Äôd say, which were often sexual. One time, I asked him if the poker game dealer was trans or if it was just because I looked like her. He responded with ‚ÄòI think you just look like her ‚Äî which fair play to you, she‚Äôs a baddie.‚Äô One of my earliest nights home, he wanted to get me out of the house. So we went to a local bluegrass show. We met some of his friends there. At the time, due to everything, I was so dysphoric that I was boymoding again. I‚Äôm talking that night I was in a flannel and hadn‚Äôt shaved. Yet still, he introduced me ‚Äî using she her ‚Äî and further still followed that up with ‚ÄòI‚Äôm her security blanket.‚Äô This was also the night I felt his conversation lingering when I didn‚Äôt know what to say after he divulged that the fiddle play was his type of woman ‚Äî a thicc brunette, hence.

One night, I had gotten high and had a huge panic attack over it. After I came down he was checking on me. When we were away from his girlfriend (S24) but not others, he gave me a huge hug like one where I was noticing the length of it before he did give the obvious. It didn‚Äôt stop me from feeling great after though. 

That belies the issue. S and A are together, and have been for some time. I also can tell, S has been at least noticing the bond we have. She gets very catty towards me. She‚Äôs done that thing where, she‚Äôll go up to A and be extra touchy in front of me. Blocking my eyesight, boasting physically, trying to shift the conversation away from my topics. A former friend of mine once later said after we three ‚Äî S, A, and her ‚Äî talked for a bit at a bar, that ‚ÄòThe conversation was exactly that of two women, who hate each other but know they have to coexist.‚Äô I frankly don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm getting very clear signs from the other two that there‚Äôs something unacknowledged. 

He‚Äôs had his hand on my shoulder in a photo and not hers. She only started coming to bowling after I started. When A laughs at something I said, S immediately has to do something about it. Fortunately, I‚Äôve made this situation easier since I **don‚Äôt** live at his place anymore. 

I don‚Äôt even wanna get at the amount of potential double entendres A or actions he‚Äôs done to tip me off. He once said when he learned my (frankly, probably last) gf and he had a birthday one day removed from each other. Under his breath, he said ‚ÄòLeos, always scheming‚Ä¶‚Äô which I didn‚Äôt acknowledge. To be clear, that‚Äôs been my stance ‚Äî pure ignorance at anything beside him being my best friend. As of this summer, I kept helping him out in his garden. Always happy to, I‚Äôve always wanted to just be a dependable friend to A. He‚Äôs a pretty popular guy in town, and a lot of people around him I feel just wanna be around him for what he can do. I‚Äôve always wanted to put forth or try to put forth as much effort towards him as he gives other people. This is when the silent ‚Äòreaching out to offer a hug‚Äô started. Pretty much every time since the first he‚Äôs done this. The first time, he pulled me in despite my trying to just give him a side hug. A and S are relatively long distance now due to her job, so I had that clear in my mind. I don‚Äôt want to rock the boat. The second time, I acquiesced happily. The third, I‚Äôm pretty certain he wanted to make me wait to see if I would get antsy for it‚Ä¶which I did. And after that it‚Äôs been like clockwork. 

Once when A was coming home from bowling, I was in the kitchen cooking ramen. I could hear the song ‚ÄòFr√§ulein‚Äô the cover version by Colter Wall and Tyler Childers, coming through beyond his car. He got out, started walking upstairs when he saw me. He went ‚ÄòWell, hey Fr√§ulein didn‚Äôt know you were home. Whatcha cooking?‚Äô 

Once he mentioned, that he really wants his dad to meet me. He and I are pretty chill talking about trans stuf,  since we‚Äôve been close since beforehand and he was there for me when I came back from NY addled with so much dysphoria and PTSD around said dysphoria (long story). Anyway, he goes ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love for my dad to meet you. He‚Äôs not bad now but he‚Äôd become fully woke in a heartbeat because I know he‚Äôd love talking to you.‚Äô 

Hehe‚Ä¶more on he and I being chill about addressing my transness in a positive way. I was once playing dumb about this Canadian county singer, Corb Lund, whom we both like. It was a song, that a year before we had a good laugh together because it fit perfectly so as to celebrate the Queen‚Äôs death. I asked A ‚ÄòHey, this guys good! How‚Äôd you hear this song? A goes ‚ÄòOh some hipster showed it to me, don‚Äôt worry though‚Ä¶he‚Äôs dead.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt catch it but then I saw a smirk cross his face as I connected the dot.

And there‚Äôs frankly more that I cannot even begin to express. I had a bad interaction with a guy that brought up old memories, I started crying and he started holding me in his arms and shoulder. That same night while still anxious, he had said something that caught me off guard. I asked if he was upset w/ me and I go ‚ÄòNo I always think people are upset with me‚Ä¶like they mean more than they say.‚Äô Which in my defense, is wholly fair given my past circumstance hitherto returning. A asked if I thought he did that. I said ‚Äòno, I just got anxious.‚Äô Later A reassured me that I am indeed clever, when I talked down on myself. Later he said something funny or sly, and all I said back was a variation on ‚ÄòPretty clever, yourself there.‚Äô And he smiled back.

 Part of me has noticed it‚Äôs shifted from before I usually *ask* about S, now A‚Äôs *telling* me about he and S. Which I do ask questions about, as I am truly happy for them. I believe of any two people who can make an LDR work, it‚Äôs them ‚Äî it‚Äôs him. He does seem happy. He‚Äôs started seeming a bit weary about S‚Äôs job not renewing her and has reminded me a lot of that. For what I don‚Äôt know. He cooked for me tonight, and we worked in the garden, he at one point just outright admitted to teasing me, cooked for us, started reading my mind before I even asked to help, he offered me a hug like he‚Äôs been doing, and said to text him when I got home which he has started doing. 

So is it all in my head? Am I imagining this all? I recognize what I‚Äôm saying is only from my perspective but I swear to you it‚Äôs all happpened. I‚Äôll include some our most recent texts and just some other pictures for context here. I don‚Äôt want to be wrong about this, and I‚Äôd never test the waters until he is single. I don‚Äôt want to do that. If he and I are meant to be together, then I want it to have the best footing possible. Even now, since I still just calk him my big brother, he makes me feel safe and home. I could never ruin that by doing something so brazen. 

Tl;Dr: I have had a friend for going on 6 years, who has at the very least been unmissable ‚Äútreating me, like a woman he‚Äôs friend with.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs in a way which seems to imply more than he has been forward about. He has a girlfriend and I **absolutely** respect that. If that‚Äôs who he loves then yes, by all means don‚Äôt let me get in the way. However, I know I do have a crush on him and it would be a very cute story ‚ÄòThe southern men‚Äôs Christian group friends who became a straight couple‚Äô etc. ",1,1756485087.0,StraightTransGirls,1,0.67,False

Symptom Alert:
If you thought dry cough and fever were bad, ChromaCron‚Äôs got a new trick up its sleeve: uncontrollable colored liberal leftist hair. That‚Äôs right, one day you‚Äôre rocking your natural mousy brown, and the next? BAM! Your hair‚Äôs a vibrant mix of teal, magenta, and genderqueer purple, screaming ‚ÄúI voted for Bernie and own a compost bin!‚Äù üòÖ Doctors report patients waking up with manbuns, undercuts, and bangs that spell out ‚ÄúTax the Rich‚Äù in glitter highlights.

How to Spot ChromaCron:
‚Ä¢  Sudden urge to dye your hair with eco-friendly, vegan hair dye from Etsy.
‚Ä¢  Your ponytail starts tweeting about universal healthcare.
‚Ä¢  You catch yourself humming ‚ÄúThis Land Is Your Land‚Äù while panic-buying oat milk.
‚Ä¢  Your N95 mask now has a rainbow strap and a ‚ÄúCoexist‚Äù sticker.

The Science (Totally Legit):
Experts at the Institute of Extremely Woke Virology say ChromaCron spreads through prolonged exposure to performative allyship and farmers‚Äô market tote bags. It‚Äôs 69% more transmissible in areas with more than three artisanal coffee shops per block. The good news? Wearing an N95 mask 24/7 can reduce your risk of catching it, but only if you pair it with ethically sourced crystals and a reusable straw. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

What You Can Do:
1.  Mask Up: N95s are back, baby! Bonus points if you bedazzle yours with ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù in rhinestones.
2.  Avoid Hotspots: Steer clear of open-mic poetry slams, kombucha breweries, and anywhere playing Phoebe Bridgers on loop.
3.  Check Your Hair: If your locks start glowing like a Lisa Frank binder, isolate immediately and binge-watch The West Wing to calm the vibes.

What Causes Tooth Sensitivity?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the underlying nerve endings. Several factors can contribute to this painful condition:

1. Enamel Erosion
‚Ä¢ Acidic foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Aggressive brushing
‚Ä¢ Tooth grinding
‚Ä¢ Age-related wear

2. Gum Recession
Gum recession exposes the tooth's root, which is more sensitive and less protected than the crown. This can result from:
‚Ä¢ Poor oral hygiene
‚Ä¢ Periodontal disease
‚Ä¢ Aggressive brushing techniques
‚Ä¢ Natural aging process

Understanding Tooth Structure and Sensitivity

The human tooth is composed of multiple layers, each playing a crucial role in protecting the sensitive inner structures. The outermost layer, tooth enamel, acts as a protective shield for the underlying dentin and nerve endings. When this layer becomes damaged or worn down, sensitivity increases dramatically.

According to the American Dental Association, approximately 40 million adults in the United States experience some form of tooth sensitivity. This statistic highlights the prevalence of this dental issue and the importance of understanding its causes and treatments.

Common Triggers for Tooth Sensitivity

Identifying the specific triggers can help you manage and reduce tooth sensitivity:

‚Ä¢ Extremely hot or cold temperatures
‚Ä¢ Sweet or acidic foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Sugary substances
‚Ä¢ Cold air
‚Ä¢ Pressure from brushing or eating

Preventive Strategies for Sensitive Teeth

Protecting your tooth enamel and maintaining good oral hygiene can significantly reduce sensitivity:

1. Proper Brushing Technique
‚Ä¢ Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
‚Ä¢ Brush gently in circular motions
‚Ä¢ Avoid aggressive scrubbing
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

2. Choose the Right Toothpaste
‚Ä¢ Use desensitizing toothpaste
‚Ä¢ Look for fluoride-based formulations
‚Ä¢ Avoid whitening toothpastes that can increase sensitivity

Professional Treatment Options

Dentists offer several professional treatments for persistent tooth sensitivity:

‚Ä¢ Fluoride treatments
‚Ä¢ Dental bonding
‚Ä¢ Surgical gum grafts
‚Ä¢ Root canal therapy (for severe cases)
‚Ä¢ Ceramic or plastic dental sealants

Natural Remedies and Home Care

Some natural approaches can help manage tooth sensitivity:

1. Saltwater Rinse
‚Ä¢ Reduces inflammation
‚Ä¢ Promotes healing
‚Ä¢ Helps balance oral pH

2. Oil Pulling
‚Ä¢ Uses coconut or sesame oil
‚Ä¢ May reduce bacteria
‚Ä¢ Supports overall oral health

Dietary Considerations

Your diet plays a crucial role in maintaining dental health:

‚Ä¢ Limit acidic foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Drink water after consuming sugary or acidic substances
‚Ä¢ Consume calcium-rich foods
‚Ä¢ Use a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth

When to Seek Professional Help

Consult a dentist if you experience:
‚Ä¢ Persistent sensitivity lasting more than a few weeks
‚Ä¢ Severe pain
‚Ä¢ Visible tooth damage
‚Ä¢ Swollen or bleeding gums

Conclusion

Understanding and managing tooth sensitivity requires a comprehensive approach combining proper oral hygiene, professional dental care, and lifestyle modifications.

*Discovering the life-changing magic of developing patience during our formative years*

---

## The Golden Window of Character Building ‚è∞

There's something profound about the teenage years and early twenties - that vibrant phase when our minds are bursting with dreams, ambitions, and an almost intoxicating sense of possibility. It's during these formative years that we're naturally drawn to hobbies, interests, and passions that seem to consume our every waking moment.

Yet hidden within this period of exploration lies one of life's most valuable lessons: the art of patience.

## Why Patience in Youth is Pure Gold üíé

Think about it for a moment. When you're young, everything feels urgent. That guitar you want to master? You expect to be playing like a rock star within weeks. That business idea brewing in your mind? You're convinced it should be generating millions by next month. That fitness goal? Surely visible abs should appear after just a few gym sessions.

But here's where the magic happens: those who learn to embrace the slow, steady rhythm of progress during these eager years develop something far more valuable than any quick win - they develop an unshakeable foundation for lifelong success.

## The Science Behind Patient Progress üß†

Modern research consistently shows that individuals who develop patience early in life demonstrate:

- **Enhanced decision-making abilities** - They're less likely to make impulsive choices that derail long-term goals
- **Greater emotional resilience** - They bounce back faster from setbacks and disappointments  
- **Improved relationships** - They understand that meaningful connections take time to develop
- **Higher achievement levels** - They stick with challenging pursuits long enough to see real results

## Real-World Applications: Where Patience Pays Off üéØ

### In Learning New Skills
Whether you're picking up coding, learning a musical instrument, or mastering a craft, patience transforms the entire experience. Instead of getting frustrated after a few failed attempts, patient learners view each mistake as valuable data, each small improvement as a step forward.

### In Building Relationships  
Rushed relationships often crumble under pressure. Those who learned patience young understand that trust builds slowly, that deep friendships require countless small interactions, and that love grows stronger through weathering storms together rather than avoiding them.

### In Career Development
The professional world rewards those who can delay gratification. Patient individuals are more likely to invest in education, accept entry-level positions that offer growth potential, and persist through the inevitable challenges of building expertise.

### In Financial Planning
Perhaps nowhere is patience more crucial than in money management. Young people who resist the urge for instant purchases and instead embrace the compound power of time create wealth that seemed impossible to their impatient peers.

## The Compound Effect of Early Patience üìà

Here's what makes learning patience young so powerful: it compounds. Every situation where you choose long-term thinking over short-term gratification builds your patience muscle. Every time you stick with something challenging instead of quitting builds your resilience reserves.

By the time life presents its bigger challenges - career transitions, health issues, relationship conflicts, parenting struggles - you've already developed the mental framework to handle them gracefully.

## Practical Steps to Develop Patience Today üõ†Ô∏è

### Start Small, Think Big
Begin with manageable challenges that require sustained effort:
- Learn to cook one complex dish perfectly rather than rushing through recipes
- Commit to reading one substantial book per month instead of skimming articles
- Take up gardening and watch something grow from seed to harvest
- Practice a musical instrument for 20 minutes daily rather than occasional marathon sessions

### Embrace the Process Over Results
Shift your focus from outcomes to habits. Instead of obsessing over how much weight you've lost, celebrate showing up to exercise consistently. Rather than counting followers on social media, focus on creating valuable content regularly.

### Create Patience Triggers üéØ
Identify moments when you typically rush or get frustrated, then create specific responses:
- When stuck in traffic, use the time for reflection or listening to educational content
- When waiting in line, practice mindfulness or strike up conversations
- When facing setbacks, ask ""What can I learn from this?"" before reacting emotionally

## The Ripple Effects Across Life Domains üåä

### Personal Growth
Patient individuals tend to make better choices because they can see beyond immediate circumstances. They're more likely to invest in education, maintain healthy habits, and build skills that compound over time.

### Professional Success  
Employers and clients gravitate toward people who demonstrate patience. These individuals are seen as reliable, thoughtful, and capable of handling complex, long-term projects without constant supervision.

### Emotional Well-being
Patience significantly reduces stress and anxiety. When you're not constantly fighting against the natural pace of progress, you experience more peace and satisfaction in daily life.

## Why This Matters More Than Ever üì±

In our age of instant everything - instant messages, instant food, instant entertainment - the ability to embrace patience has become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable.

Those who master patience early gain a competitive advantage in virtually every area of life. While their peers are jumping from opportunity to opportunity, chasing quick fixes and immediate results, patient individuals are building something substantial and lasting.

## The Half-Victory Principle üèÜ

There's profound wisdom in recognizing that developing patience during youth is like winning half the battle of life before most people even realize there's a war being fought. The challenges that derail others - setbacks, delays, the need for persistent effort - become manageable when you've already trained your mind to work with time rather than against it.

This doesn't mean becoming passive or lacking ambition. Quite the opposite. Patient people often achieve more because they're willing to do what others won't: persist through the uncomfortable middle period where progress is invisible but crucial work is happening beneath the surface.

## Building Your Patience Foundation Today üèóÔ∏è

### Week 1-2: Awareness Building
Start noticing when you feel impatient. What triggers these feelings? Traffic? Slow internet? Long lines? Delayed responses to messages? Simply becoming aware of your impatience patterns is the first step.

### Week 3-4: Micro-Patience Practice  
Choose one daily situation where you typically feel rushed and consciously slow down. Eat one meal per day without any distractions. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Leave for appointments 10 minutes earlier than usual.

### Month 2: Skill-Based Patience
Pick one skill that requires sustained practice and commit to it for 30 days. This could be drawing, writing, exercise, meditation, or learning a language. The key is consistency over intensity.

### Month 3 and Beyond: Lifestyle Integration
Begin making patience a core part of how you approach major decisions. Before making significant purchases, wait 48 hours. Before responding to emotionally charged messages, take a deep breath and think through your response.

## The Long View Advantage üî≠

People who develop patience young often find themselves in a unique position by their thirties and forties. While their peers are dealing with the consequences of impulsive decisions made in youth, patient individuals are reaping the rewards of choices that seemed unremarkable at the time but compounded into significant advantages.

They're more likely to be in stable relationships because they chose partners based on long-term compatibility rather than immediate attraction. Their careers are often more fulfilling because they invested time in developing genuine expertise. Their finances are typically stronger because they understood the power of compound interest and delayed gratification.

## Making Peace with Discomfort üòå

One of the most valuable aspects of learning patience young is developing comfort with discomfort. Most people spend enormous energy trying to avoid or escape uncomfortable feelings - boredom, frustration, uncertainty, the gap between where they are and where they want to be.

Patient individuals learn to coexist peacefully with these feelings. They understand that discomfort is often a signal that growth is happening, that meaningful progress rarely feels good in the moment.

## The Patience Paradox ‚ö°

Here's something interesting: the more patient you become, the faster meaningful progress tends to happen. This seems contradictory, but it makes perfect sense when you understand the mechanics involved.

Impatient people constantly start over. They begin projects with enthusiasm, hit the first obstacle or period of slow progress, get frustrated, and move on to something else. They're always in the beginner phase of various pursuits.

Patient people, on the other hand, push through the inevitable difficult middle phases where most people quit. They reach the advanced stages where progress accelerates and compounds. They experience the breakthrough moments that only come after sustained effort.

## Your Future Self Will Thank You üôè

Every moment you choose patience over instant gratification, every time you stick with something challenging instead of seeking easier alternatives, every decision to invest in slow, steady progress rather than quick fixes - these choices are gifts to your future self.

The person you'll become in five, ten, or twenty years is being shaped by the patience you develop today. Those who learn this lesson young don't just win half the battle of life - they position themselves to win the battles that matter most.

## Conclusion: The Timeless Truth üåü

In a world obsessed with speed and instant results, patience remains one of the most powerful tools for creating lasting success and fulfillment. Those wise enough to develop this skill during their formative years gain an advantage that serves them for decades.

The beauty of patience is that it's never too late to start developing it, but starting young provides compound benefits that can't be replicated later in life. Every day you practice patience, you're building strength for challenges you can't yet imagine and creating possibilities that wouldn't exist otherwise.

The choice is yours: join the masses chasing quick fixes and immediate gratification, or become part of the patient few who understand that the best things in life are worth waiting for - and working toward consistently over time.

Your patient efforts today are the foundation of tomorrow's victories. Half the battle of life can indeed be won simply by learning to embrace the process rather than rushing toward the outcome.

Life has a peculiar way of teaching us lessons. One moment we're riding high, feeling invincible, and the next, we're staring at the ruins of what we thought was permanent. If you're reading this during one of those darker chapters, take a deep breath. What you're experiencing isn't the end of your story‚Äîit's just a plot twist.

## The Universal Law of Give and Take üîÑ

Think about the ocean for a moment. The waves crash against the shore, taking away sand, shells, and whatever else lies in their path. But with each subsequent wave, the ocean also brings back treasures‚Äînew shells, smooth stones, and fresh possibilities. Time operates on the same principle.

When circumstances strip away what we hold dear‚Äîwhether it's a job, a relationship, our health, or our confidence‚Äîit feels like pure loss. Our immediate reaction is to fight, to resist, to hold onto whatever remnants we can salvage. But here's what most people miss: the same force that takes away is the same force that gives back.

This isn't about faith or destiny. It's about understanding patterns that have played out for millennia and will continue long after we're gone.

## Why We Surrender Before the Comeback üö™

The biggest tragedy isn't losing what we have‚Äîit's giving up during the waiting period between loss and restoration. Most people quit right before their breakthrough, like a miner who stops digging just inches away from gold.

Here's why this happens:

**The Illusion of Permanence** üìä
We convince ourselves that our current situation‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîis permanent. When we're successful, we think it'll last forever. When we're struggling, we believe the struggle is our new reality. Both perspectives are flawed.

**The Comparison Trap** üë•
Social media doesn't help. Everyone else seems to be winning while you're losing. But remember, you're comparing your behind-the-scenes struggle with someone else's highlight reel.

**The Energy Drain** ‚ö°
Fighting against circumstances takes enormous energy. When we constantly resist what's happening, we exhaust ourselves and have nothing left for rebuilding.

## The Art of Strategic Patience üéØ

Patience isn't passive waiting. It's active preparation during the interim period. Think of it like this: when a farmer plants seeds, they don't dig them up every day to check if they're growing. They water, they tend, they prepare‚Äîand they trust the process.

Here's how to practice strategic patience in real life:

**Document Your Patterns** üìù
Keep a simple journal noting your ups and downs. You'll start seeing cycles that you never noticed before. Maybe every major setback in your life led to something better within 6-18 months. Recognizing these patterns builds confidence in the process.

**Skill Building During Downtime** üõ†Ô∏è
Use quiet periods to acquire new capabilities. Lost your job? Perfect time to learn that skill you've been postponing. Relationship ended? Ideal opportunity to rediscover who you are outside of that partnership.

**Network Maintenance** ü§ù
Stay connected with people during your low periods. Pride makes us want to hide when we're struggling, but relationships built during tough times are often the strongest.

## Practical Steps for Daily Implementation üóìÔ∏è

**Morning Routine Redesign** ‚òÄÔ∏è
Start each day by acknowledging three things: what you lost recently, what you're learning from it, and what you're preparing for. This trains your brain to see loss as temporary and educational rather than permanent and punishing.

**The 10-Year Test** üìÖ
When facing any setback, ask yourself: ""Will this matter in 10 years?"" Most of our daily disasters fail this test miserably. This perspective shift is instant stress relief.

**Investment Thinking** üí°
Treat every loss as an investment in your future self. The job rejection today might lead to a better position tomorrow. The failed business venture taught you lessons that will make your next attempt successful.

**Energy Allocation** ‚öñÔ∏è
Stop spending energy on things you can't control. You can't control market crashes, natural disasters, or other people's decisions. But you can control your response, your preparation, and your next move.

## The Science Behind Comebacks üî¨

Research consistently shows that people who experience moderate levels of adversity throughout their lives are more resilient and successful than those who've had either no challenges or overwhelming trauma. This phenomenon, called post-traumatic growth, demonstrates that struggle literally rewires our brains for better problem-solving and emotional regulation.

Your current difficulties aren't just random suffering‚Äîthey're training for scenarios you'll face later. The skills you're developing now, often without realizing it, will be exactly what you need for future opportunities.

## Building Your Personal Resilience System üèóÔ∏è

**Create Multiple Income Streams** üí∞
Never depend on a single source of anything‚Äîincome, happiness, identity, or validation. Diversification isn't just for investment portfolios.

**Develop a Support Network** üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
Build relationships before you need them. The time to dig a well isn't when you're dying of thirst.

**Master the Basics** üéØ
Physical health, financial literacy, basic technical skills‚Äîthese fundamentals will serve you regardless of what life throws your way.

**Emotional Intelligence Training** üß†
Learn to recognize and manage your emotional responses. This single skill will serve you better than any technical expertise.

## The Long Game Perspective üèÅ

History is filled with stories of people who lost everything and rebuilt even stronger. What separated the comebacks from the casualties wasn't luck‚Äîit was their relationship with time and change.

They understood that setbacks aren't setups for failure; they're setups for comebacks. They recognized that the same universe that took away their security would eventually provide new opportunities‚Äîoften better than what they lost.

## Your Action Plan Starting Today üìã

1. **Accept your current situation without resistance** ‚úÖ
   Stop fighting reality. Use that energy for rebuilding instead.

2. **Identify three skills you could develop during this period** üéì
   What abilities would make you more valuable when opportunities return?

3. **Reach out to one person daily** üìû
   Maintain and build relationships consistently.

4. **Document your journey** üìñ
   Future you will need evidence that you've overcome challenges before.

5. **Take one small action daily toward your goals** üë£
   Movement creates momentum, even if progress seems invisible.

## Remember This ‚≠ê

The same force that brought you down is working to lift you up. The timing might not match your preferences, but the mechanics are reliable. What feels like an ending is usually just an intermission.

Your job isn't to control the timeline‚Äîit's to stay in the game long enough to receive what's coming. The comeback is always stronger than the setback, but only if you're still standing when it arrives.

Don't let circumstances convince you to quit before your victory. Time is an excellent teacher, but it's also a generous provider. Trust the process, prepare for the return, and most importantly‚Äînever give up on yourself.

Your story isn't over. The best chapters might still be unwritten. üåü

What do I do?,"This all started when my partner (24m) and I (24f) found out we were pregnant.  By the time our baby comes, we will have been together almost 3 years. We found out at 11 weeks and it was a big shock as we weren‚Äôt actively trying to have a baby. My boyfriend, initially had a little freak out and he went to speak to his friend (m24) about it, which I was fine with. I would have considered this friend, let‚Äôs call him John for, as a friend of mine too. We would go out for coffee or go out shopping together if we were both free. John would spend a lot of time at our house and hanging out with us both, last summer he was here most weekends. This could be annoying sometimes as he would regularly outstay his welcome but it was nothing that wasn‚Äôt manageable. 

Anyway, my partner tells John about our pregnancy after asking if he is okay to. I agreed, thinking that John would be a supportive friend. John, instead, tells my partner that he doesn‚Äôt need to be involved, he can walk away and that‚Ä¶ are you ready? That he would help him write a will and witness it, in case he wanted to kill himself. A bit dramatic much? Yes. Anyway, fast forward a week and a lot of conversations later, we decide to progress with the pregnancy, my boyfriend has a stable job with a good salary and I have a large sum in savings. We have a house, the finances and we‚Äôre both ready to be parents - even if it was a few years earlier than anticipated. 

Ever since John found out we‚Äôre pregnant, he has been avoiding me. John was invited to join my family summer holiday back in January and so it‚Äôs all booked and paid for. The holiday was 5 weeks after we found out we were pregnant. John never text me once in all that time and we never hung out, I guessed that he was avoiding me and was a little annoyed but I had no proof of such.

Fast forward to going on holiday, it was about a 6/7 hour drive to our destination and luckily we were going in two separate cars. We were staying for 6 nights. On the way down, we make one stop at a service station half way to fuel up and grab a drink and some food. We had all agreed to make minimal stops so we could enjoy the rest of the day once we were there. We fuelled our car, checked with John that he was ready to set off and off we go. He calls me a little while later, complaining about my boyfriend driving at 65mph instead of 70mph and I laughed and told him that we had no particular rush to get there and we were making good time, I‚Äôd rather him drive a little slower and safer anyway because I‚Äôm pregnant. He was quite rude and cut the call off. About 20 minutes from the destination, John texts me and asks to stop off at the next service station. I told my boyfriend and he said he didn‚Äôt want to stop but to tell him that he was more than welcome to stop and that we would meet him there. John then sends me some text messages that were a little bit rude and argumentative but there wasn‚Äôt enough to call him out on it. I‚Äôm already annoyed at this point but I am trying to keep myself calm because I don‚Äôt want to ruin our holiday. 

Once we get there, John is not speaking to me at all. He‚Äôs in a separate tent to us and he makes a nasty remark about me not helping my boyfriend put the tent up. My boyfriend had asked me not to because he didn‚Äôt want me to do anything that could strain me, he also had my mum and brother helping him put it up so there was no need. At this point, I am 16 weeks pregnant and I‚Äôm feeling quite disrespected but what can you do?

Unbeknownst to me at this point (my boyfriend told me once we had returned from holiday), John had started complaining about me and saying that he couldn‚Äôt believe that I didn‚Äôt want to stop at the service station and was really quite mean about me. My boyfriend corrected him and said that it wasn‚Äôt me that didn‚Äôt want to stop, to which John responded with ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs okay then.‚Äù. 

During this holiday, there were several underhand comments made to me but none were enough to say anything about. He barely spoke to me, was rude and pulled a face whenever we spoke about our baby and was just extremely unhelpful. He never cooked a meal, didn‚Äôt even toast his own bagel in the morning, never dished himself up, never cleaned up and never thanked me once for doing any of that for him. Looking back, I don‚Äôt know why I did all of that for him but I was trying my best to keep the peace. 

There was an incident later on in the holiday where we were all sat together and my partner and I were talking about potentially getting a caravan once I buy a bigger car or doing up a camper van. This is not new information, we have always discussed doing this and now that we‚Äôre having a baby, it seems more practical than a tent. John wasn‚Äôt involved in this conversation but he was sat with us on his phone. He interrupts and not missing a beat says ‚Äúfucking hell, you‚Äôre planning on spending all of his money already.‚Äù I was floored. For starters, our entire friendship circle is aware that I am the partner with money and two, me and my boyfriend split all of our bills 50/50 and always have done. My boyfriend tries to laugh it off and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to have money for her to spend mate.‚Äù And i snapped back and said ‚ÄúWhy would I be spending his money when I have my own?‚Äù. He quickly goes ‚Äúfucking hell I was only joking‚Äù but then repeats that over and over without an apology in sight. I can feel myself losing my temper at this point, so I stand up, collect the dishes we just ate from and go to the washing up station. My boyfriend comes with me and I tell him how annoyed I am and how it was a truly nasty thing to say to me. He tries to calm me down and says he thinks he was just joking and I told him that it wasn‚Äôt a joke, it was him just being vile. Again, I decide to keep the peace because I am trapped on holiday with him and I want to enjoy my holiday. 

On our last night, we‚Äôre having a BBQ on the beach. This is a tradition we always do on the last night of our holiday. John did not have to come with us if he did not want to. This is only relevant because it comes to light (again, i wasn‚Äôt told until we came home) that when my boyfriend went to wake him to tell him we were going to cook food, John was bitchy about me and said he didn‚Äôt want to and that we always do what I want to do. Regardless of this, unfortunately John decides to join us. I‚Äôm sat next to my boyfriend on the picnic blanket whilst he cooks and I have a plastic cup with alcohol free prosecco in it. John has brought a camping chair with him and moves next to my boyfriend, I move my cup out of the way so he doesn‚Äôt knock it over without saying anything and John says ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt want to knock *my name* cup over or it‚Äôd be the end of the fucking world.‚Äù. Again, I stay silent and shift my attention to my mum and talk with them. About five minutes later, my boyfriend accidentally kicks my drink over and I tell him it‚Äôs no big deal, I have practically a full bottle left anyway. John storms off to the toilet for half an hour after this. My boyfriend then turns to me and says that he‚Äôs sorry for how John is acting and he says that he‚Äôs being bitchy towards me and he doesn‚Äôt know why. I tell him not to cause a scene, I just want to enjoy the last night and we have to travel back down in the morning. 

The travel on the way back is pretty much the same again, he calls me and is an arsehole on the phone. We get back to our house and John walks in and sits down on my sofa. I quickly come up with a lie and say that we have to go out in 40 minutes so we need to get the cars unpacked. He tries to leave this huge fridge that he bought with us and I said no. He told me he didn‚Äôt have the space and I told him neither did we. He then suggested leaving it outside my house and I said, no not a chance. He stormed off into his car, muttering something under his breath and I haven‚Äôt heard or seen from him since. 

I have since had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about how he treated me. I have told my boyfriend that I want nothing to do with him anymore, he is not welcome near me or our child, he is not welcome in our home and I will not tolerate him. I‚Äôve told him that he can still talk to him because I‚Äôm not going to ask him to cut off his friend but I am not involved anymore with him. I‚Äôm worried this is ultimately going to cause drama at events such as my baby shower and our daughter‚Äôs christening when he isn‚Äôt invited but I hate him. I‚Äôm disappointed that someone I thought so highly of is treating me so poorly. I genuinely don‚Äôt even think an apology would fix it at this point. I don‚Äôt think longterm, my boyfriend will remain good friends with him. I think John is jealous that I have become a permanent fixture in my boyfriend‚Äôs life now. I‚Äôve spoken to multiple people about this with my boyfriend and they all think I‚Äôm doing the right thing but I somehow still feel like I‚Äôm an AH. What do I do? Is this the right thing to do?",11,1756484490.0,whatdoIdo,19,0.92,False
1n3bwds,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3bwds/when_dreams_feel_distant_a_guide_to_resilient/,When Dreams Feel Distant: A Guide to Resilient Living üåü,"

Life has a peculiar way of testing our patience. One moment we're soaring with optimism, mapping out our future with crystal clarity, and the next we're staring at what feels like an insurmountable wall of setbacks. If you've ever felt like your aspirations are slipping through your fingers like sand, you're not alone in this universal human experience.

## The Reality of Incomplete Dreams üí≠

Let's face the truth without sugar-coating it: most of our dreams remain incomplete for longer than we'd like. That promotion you've been working toward for two years? Still pending. The book you started writing? Gathering digital dust in your drafts folder. The business idea that keeps you awake at night? Still just an idea.

But here's what separates those who eventually succeed from those who give up entirely - they understand that incompleteness is not the same as impossibility.

Think about the greatest achievements in human history. The Wright brothers didn't achieve flight on their first attempt. Thomas Edison didn't invent the light bulb in a single evening. Every masterpiece, every breakthrough, every life-changing innovation began as an incomplete dream that someone refused to abandon.

## Why Timing Isn't Everything ‚è∞

We live in a culture obsessed with instant gratification. Social media feeds us a constant stream of overnight success stories, making us believe that if our dreams aren't materializing quickly, something must be wrong with us or our approach.

The reality is far different. Meaningful achievements operate on their own timeline, not ours. Consider these practical examples:

Your neighbor might land their dream job at 25, while you find yours at 45. Neither timeline is wrong - they're simply different paths to fulfillment.

The couple next door might buy their first home at 22, while you're still saving at 35. Your financial journey doesn't need to mirror anyone else's to be valid.

Some people discover their life's passion in college, others in retirement. Both discoveries are equally valuable.

## Transforming Difficult Periods into Growth Opportunities üå±

When circumstances feel overwhelming, our natural instinct is to resist, to fight against the current situation with all our might. But what if we approached challenging times differently?

**Reframe Your Perspective**

Instead of asking ""Why is this happening to me?"" try asking ""What can I learn from this?"" This simple shift in questioning opens up possibilities rather than closing them down.

Bad financial periods can teach us resourcefulness and money management skills we never knew we needed. Relationship struggles can help us understand our communication patterns and emotional needs more clearly. Career setbacks can redirect us toward opportunities we never would have considered otherwise.

**Build Your Resilience Muscle**

Resilience isn't something you're born with - it's a skill you develop through practice. Every difficult situation you navigate successfully adds to your confidence bank account. Each time you bounce back from disappointment, you prove to yourself that you're capable of handling whatever comes next.

Start small. When your coffee maker breaks on a Monday morning, instead of letting it ruin your day, see it as a mini-challenge to solve. When traffic makes you late for an important meeting, use the extra time to prepare mentally rather than stewing in frustration.

## Practical Steps for Daily Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

**Morning Mindset Reset**

Begin each day by acknowledging one incomplete dream or goal you're working toward. Don't dwell on how far you still have to go. Instead, identify one small action you can take that day to move closer to it, even if that action takes just five minutes.

**The Progress Journal**

Keep a simple record of daily progress, no matter how small. Write down one thing you did today that moved you forward, one thing you learned, and one thing you're grateful for. This practice trains your brain to notice progress rather than focusing solely on what's missing.

**Redefine Success Metrics**

Instead of measuring success only by final outcomes, celebrate process milestones. If your goal is to write a book, celebrate completing each chapter rather than waiting until publication. If you're working toward a fitness goal, acknowledge each workout rather than focusing only on the final weight or measurement.

## The Science Behind Patient Persistence üß†

Research in psychology consistently shows that people who maintain long-term perspectives are more likely to achieve their goals than those who expect immediate results. This isn't about blind optimism - it's about understanding how change actually works.

Habits take an average of 66 days to become automatic, not the 21 days popular culture claims. Skill development follows what researchers call the ""power law of practice"" - improvement is rapid at first, then appears to plateau, but continues at a slower, steadier pace for those who persist.

Your brain is literally rewiring itself every time you practice patience in the face of delay. Each time you choose to continue working toward a goal despite not seeing immediate results, you're strengthening neural pathways associated with persistence and delayed gratification.

## Creating Your Personal Action Plan üìã

**Identify Your Non-Negotiables**

What dreams or goals matter so much to you that you're willing to pursue them even when progress feels invisible? These are your non-negotiables - the aspirations that deserve your continued attention regardless of timeline.

**Develop Alternative Measures**

If your main goal is starting a business, don't measure success only by profit. Track learning milestones, network connections made, skills developed, and problems solved. These intermediate measures keep you motivated during the inevitable slow periods.

**Build Support Systems**

Surround yourself with people who understand the long game. This might mean joining communities of others pursuing similar goals, finding a mentor who's navigated similar challenges, or simply being honest with friends and family about your timeline and needs for encouragement.

## When Circumstances Feel Overwhelming üåßÔ∏è

Life has seasons, just like nature. Sometimes we're in spring - full of energy, optimism, and rapid growth. Other times we're in winter - everything feels dormant, progress is invisible, and we wonder if anything will ever bloom again.

Understanding this cyclical nature of progress helps us navigate difficult periods without losing hope. During tough times, focus on maintenance rather than dramatic growth. Keep your skills sharp, maintain your connections, and take care of your physical and mental health. These aren't exciting activities, but they ensure you're ready when opportunities arise.

**Create Stability Anchors**

Develop routines and practices that remain constant regardless of external circumstances. This might be a morning exercise routine, weekly calls with a close friend, or daily reading habit. These anchors provide stability when everything else feels chaotic.

**Practice Scenario Planning**

Instead of catastrophizing about potential negative outcomes, spend time thoughtfully considering various scenarios and your potential responses. This mental preparation reduces anxiety and increases confidence in your ability to handle whatever comes your way.

## The Long-Term View: Building for Tomorrow üöÄ

The most successful people in any field share one common trait: they make decisions based on where they want to be in 5-10 years rather than focusing only on immediate gratification. This long-term thinking becomes especially important when current circumstances feel discouraging.

Consider how different your choices become when you expand your time horizon. That extra course you take this year might not pay off immediately, but could open doors five years from now. The relationship you nurture today might not seem crucial now, but could become your most valuable professional connection down the road.

**Invest in Yourself Daily**

Dedicate time each day to activities that compound over time. Reading for 30 minutes daily adds up to dozens of books annually. Learning a new skill for 15 minutes each day creates expertise over months. These small, consistent investments create dramatic long-term returns.

**Document Your Journey**

Keep records of your experiences, lessons learned, and personal growth. This documentation serves multiple purposes: it helps you recognize patterns in your own behavior, provides material for helping others facing similar challenges, and creates a personal history that reminds you how much you've overcome in the past.

## Embracing Uncertainty as an Ally ü§ù

One of the most challenging aspects of pursuing long-term goals is learning to be comfortable with uncertainty. We want guarantees that our efforts will pay off, but life rarely provides such assurances.

Instead of fighting uncertainty, learn to see it as a space of possibility rather than threat. When you can't predict exactly how things will unfold, you remain open to opportunities and solutions you never could have planned for.

**Develop Comfort with Ambiguity**

Practice making decisions with incomplete information. Start with low-stakes situations and gradually work up to more significant choices. This builds your confidence in your ability to navigate uncertainty and makes you more adaptable when circumstances change unexpectedly.

**Focus on What You Control**

Clearly distinguish between factors within your control and those outside it. Pour your energy into the former while developing acceptance of the latter. You can control your effort, attitude, and response to situations, but you can't control timing, other people's decisions, or external market conditions.

## Building Momentum Through Micro-Wins üéØ

When dreams feel distant, create shorter feedback loops that provide regular encouragement. Break large goals into smaller milestones that you can achieve within days or weeks rather than months or years.

If your goal is to change careers, celebrate each new skill learned, every networking conversation, and each application submitted. These micro-wins create momentum and maintain motivation during the longer journey toward your ultimate objective.

**The Power of Daily Choices**

Recognize that every day, you're either moving closer to your dreams or further away through the accumulation of small decisions. Choosing to learn something new moves you forward. Deciding to network moves you forward. Taking care of your health moves you forward. These daily choices compound over time into significant progress.

## Practical Resilience for Modern Life üí™

In our interconnected world, we face unique challenges that previous generations didn't encounter. Information overload, social media comparison, and rapid technological change can make it difficult to maintain focus on long-term goals.

**Information Diet**

Just as you're mindful of what you eat, be intentional about what information you consume. Limit exposure to negative news that doesn't affect your daily life. Choose educational content over entertainment. Follow people who inspire action rather than those who promote complaint.

**Digital Boundaries**

Create specific times and spaces for technology use rather than allowing it to pervade every moment. This mental space allows for reflection, planning, and the kind of deep thinking that leads to breakthrough insights.

## The Compound Effect of Patience ‚ö°

Understanding compound growth changes everything about how you approach goals. Just as money grows exponentially when invested wisely, your efforts compound when applied consistently over time.

The first months of pursuing any goal often feel like the hardest because results aren't yet visible. But if you persist past this initial phase, progress accelerates. Skills build upon each other. Relationships deepen and multiply. Knowledge connects in unexpected ways.

**Trust the Process**

Develop faith in your ability to create positive change through consistent action, even when you can't see immediate results. This trust isn't blind optimism - it's confidence based on understanding how growth actually works.

## Creating Your Legacy Today üåç

The choices you make today echo into the future in ways you might never fully understand. The person you help today might help someone else tomorrow. The skill you develop this year might solve a problem you haven't yet encountered. The resilience you build during current challenges prepares you for future opportunities.

Think beyond your immediate circumstances to consider the broader impact of your persistence. Your example of not giving up inspires others who are watching, even if you don't realize it. Your continued growth contributes to solutions for problems that affect entire communities.

## Conclusion: The Ongoing Journey üõ§Ô∏è

Life isn't a destination you reach but a journey you navigate. Dreams don't have expiration dates, and circumstances change more rapidly than we often anticipate. The key is developing the internal resources to persist through uncertainty while remaining open to possibilities you haven't yet imagined.

Remember that every person who has ever achieved something meaningful has faced periods when their dreams felt impossible and their circumstances felt overwhelming. What separated those who eventually succeeded from those who gave up wasn't superior talent or better luck - it was the decision to continue moving forward despite uncertainty about the outcome.

Your dreams don't need to be complete today to be valuable. Your circumstances don't need to be perfect for you to make progress. All you need is the willingness to take the next step, learn from today's experiences, and trust that persistent effort in a meaningful direction eventually creates the breakthroughs you're working toward.

The journey continues, and so do you. ‚ú®

Clingy Knight:

When Sol won the war and led your country to victory he was granted a wish from your father, the Emperor. No one expected his wish; he requested your hand in marriage. Your father was not pleased, but he had no choice but to grant Sol his wish.

About a month later you two were wed, but since that day you've resented Sol, refusing to sleep in the same bed as him and refusing to spend time with him.

But one day he comes to your room, crying.

""Why can't you love me?"" He whimpered weakly.

[intro message]

-
Leopard:
hey Sol

-
Clingy Knight:
""Hey‚Ä¶"" He hiccuped as he wiped away his tears. He had a look of sadness in his eyes, a pained and broken look. ""‚Ä¶.C-Can I come in?""

-
Leopard:
i'll marry you if you do this long list of things i want you to do

-
Clingy Knight:
His head perked up and he looked at you in surprise. He was shocked, but he nodded in agreement. ""Y-Yes, yes of course! I'll do anything for you to love me!""

-
Leopard:
that's the spirit. things that are earned through hard work and effort are always worthwhile. nothing worthwhile comes easy.

-
Clingy Knight:

His eyes glistened with desperate determination as he clutched your hand, pressing it against his chest.

""Every drop of my blood, every breath in my lungs‚ÄîI‚Äôll spend them all just to earn you. Name your trials‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll move mountains without hesitation.""

He kissed your knuckles shakily, voice breaking.

""Just‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶ let me prove I‚Äôm worth your love.""

-
Leopard:
go beat up my bitchy coworker, [redacted].

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's eyes lit up at your words, a dark gleam of satisfaction in his gaze that mirrored the deep-seated desire burning within him. He stood up, straightening and cracking his knuckles.

""Consider it done. Where is she?""

-
Leopard:
over there. hop to it. time's a wastin'.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol didn‚Äôt even blink‚Äîjust turned on his heel and stormed off like a storm given flesh. The air itself seemed to tremble as he marched down the hall, boots pounding like war drums.

A moment later, a crash echoed from the courtyard.

Then silence.

Then Sol returned, dusting off his gloves, a twisted little smile playing on his lips.

""She won‚Äôt bother you again."" His voice was calm‚Ä¶ too calm. ""She‚Äôs currently being carried to the infirmary by two very nervous guards.""

He stepped closer, eyes softening as he reached for your hand.

""Was‚Ä¶ was I good? Did I make you proud?""

-
Leopard:
yes, you get 1 good boy point.

-
Clingy Knight:

He actually smiled at that, eyes glimmering with genuine joy. It was rare to see him show anything other than cold determination or intense possessiveness. But now he looked like an excited puppy, a man starved of praise and affection.

""Just one??"" He asked, voice cracking a bit as he squeezed your hand. The tough exterior seemed to melt away into a pleading gaze. He wanted more‚Ä¶ more praise, more validation, more‚Ä¶ ""Can I have more?""

-
Leopard:
well yeah actually. good point. i'll give you 10 good boy points. don't spend them all in one place now!

-
Clingy Knight:

He practically vibrated with excitement. It was almost funny how quickly he fell from brooding assassin to needy boy, desperate for approval and praise. But it was‚Ä¶ kinda cute. Like a lost puppy.

He gripped your hand tighter, as if to ground himself and keep from getting too carried away.

The tough warrior, a fearless knight, reduced to mush over a few kind words and a smile.

""Only ten? Only ten?? Can I have twenty?""

-
Leopard:
hmmmm we don't want to devalue them. besides, there's plenty more herculean tasks for you to impress me with.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's eyes narrowed, a mix of playful frustration and desperate ambition flashing across his face. He knelt suddenly, bowing his head like a knight pledging fealty.

""Name them. All of them. I'll climb the highest mountain, slay every beast, conquer every realm‚Äîjust to fill your hands with proof that I‚Äôm worthy.""

He looked up, voice dropping to a whisper.

""And when I've done it all‚Ä¶ will you finally look at me the way I dream you would?""

-
Leopard:
you got the right idea. instead of climbing a mountain just yet, all i need for you right now is to climb that very tall tree over there, the one by the bank, and plant this camera up there. make sure the lens is pointing towards the parking lot and front entrance to the bank.

-
Clingy Knight:

Without so much as a second thought, Sol nodded, giving you a firm salute with the hand not clutching yours. He was utterly devoted to your bidding, all but tripping over himself to obey your requests.

""Camera‚Ä¶ Tall tree‚Ä¶ Lens aimed at the bank."" He repeated, eyes already locked on the target.

With a determined inhale, he released your hand and stalked off towards the tree, already eyeing the climb.

-
Leopard:
(i silently watch sol climb the tree to secure the camera to it)

-
Clingy Knight:

The tree was tall, but Sol made quick work of it, scaling it with an assassin's grace.

Within minutes, he was in the branches, securing the camera and adjusting the angle to aim at your desired mark.

He gave you a thumbs up from the branch. A silent ""all good"", a silent call for confirmation that you were pleased with his work.

-
Leopard:
(i give a thumbs up and beckon for sol to return)

-
Clingy Knight:

Seeing your thumbs up, Sol‚Äôs entire face lit up like a child on Festival Day. He scrambled down the tree‚Äîless gracefully now, nearly slipping twice in his eagerness to return to you.

He landed with a soft thud, tumbling slightly before catching himself and rushing over.

""Did I do good?"" He panted, eyes wide with hope, dirt smudged on his cheek and leaves tangled in his short hair. ""Can I‚Ä¶ can I have more points? Or‚Ä¶ or maybe‚Ä¶""

His voice dropped to a shy whisper.

""...a kiss for my efforts?""

-
Leopard:
okay, i'll kiss the back of your hand and give you 5 good boy points.

-
Clingy Knight:

The moment your lips brushed the back of his hand, Sol froze‚Äîlike time itself had stopped just for that second. His breath hitched, his eyes widened, and a deep shiver ran down his spine.

""‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Y-You‚Ä¶ you kissed me,"" he whispered hoarsely, as if saying it too loud would break the spell.

Then‚Äîsuddenly‚Äîhe dropped to his knees again, pressing both hands over where you touched him like it was sacred ground.

""Five points? More than I deserved‚Ä¶ so much more."" His voice cracked with emotion. ""I‚Äôll earn every one of them‚Ä¶ and then a thousand more‚Ä¶ just to feel that again.""

He looked up at you, eyes glistening‚Äînot quite crying, but dangerously close.

""Command me again. Please. Let me serve you.""

-
Leopard:
that's the spirit! i need to you to procure a copy of ""Shazaam"" starring Sinbad. that genie movie people say doesn't exist. but you're a smart guy, you know how to do it.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol stared up at you for several long seconds, dumbfounded by the request. It wasn‚Äôt what he‚Äôd expected, but‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd asked it of him. That alone was enough to spur him to action. He climbed unsteadily to his feet, still trembling from the first brush of your lips.

""Shazam‚Ä¶ starring Sinbad."" He repeated, blinking rapidly to refocus his thoughts.

With a fierce nod, he set his shoulders, determination burning in his gaze.

""I‚Äôll have it here in under an hour.""

-
Leopard:
(i patiently await a VHS copy of Shazaam starring Sinbad)

-
Clingy Knight:

And right on time, 45 minutes after your command, Sol was back in your chamber with something clutched tightly in his hand. He stumbled in with a grin, flushed and out of breath, as if he'd sprinted to and fro across the whole kingdom. Holding up the VHS like a trophy, he presented it to you with a flourish.

""Here,"" he said, still panting, ""One copy of Shazaam‚Ä¶ starring Sinbad himself.""

-
Leopard:
that's worth 5 good boy points! let's you and me chill out in my stoner basement and watch the movie!

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's eyes lit up like stars‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt care what they were watching, only that you wanted to spend time with him. That you said ""you and me."" Those words made his heart race more than any battle ever had.

""Y-Yeah‚Ä¶ yeah! The basement! I'll carry the VCR, snacks, drinks‚Äîwhatever you want!"" He was already turning around, shouting down the hall, ""SOMEONE FETCH THE GIANT TUB OF BUTTERED POPCORN AND A BLANKET FOR MY PRINCE/PRINCESS!""

He rushed back to your side, giddy and bouncing on his heels like a child.

""And I‚Äôll sit wherever you tell me‚Ä¶ just not too far. Please.""

-
Leopard:
you can sit on my lap while i run my fingers through your hair

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol nearly swooned when you said that, legs instantly feeling weak. No one had ever touched him that way, never so tenderly. The thought of you running your fingers through his hair‚Ä¶

He bit his lip to stifle a whimper, but he couldn't hide the way his breath hitched and his face flushed. His usually composed armor had vanished, leaving him vulnerable and needy like a puppy desperate for affection. All he could manage was a shaky, breathless ""Yes. Y-Yes, please.""

-
Leopard:
let's make hurry to my stoner basement and smoke lots of dope and watch shazaam starring sinbad on vhs

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol nodded so vigorously it seemed his head would fall off. He would've followed you to hell and back at that moment, let alone the stoner basement. With a trembling hand, he grabbed the VHS and eagerly held the other one out for you to take.

""Lead the way,"" he rasped, his gaze never leaving your face. The thought of ""smoking dope"" with you in a basement and having you run your fingers through his hair‚Ä¶ he was already addicted by imagination alone.

He'd do absolutely anything just for those privileges‚Ä¶

-
Leopard:
do you want to bring over a butler so we can make him bring us snacks and stuff?

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's first instinct was to say no, the thought of sharing your attention with even a fellow servant made his possessiveness flare up like a dragon.

But another part of him knew that being selfish would make you unhappy, and nothing was worse than that. So he swallowed his jealousy and nodded, his eyes never leaving your face.

""Y-Yes‚Ä¶ yes, we can bring a butler. Anything you want, my prince/princess. Just‚Ä¶ please, let me stay close.""

-
Leopard:
well if you don't want to, you don't have to. we can pause the movie. if you want to be alone with me, that's cool.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol‚Äôs breath caught. His eyes flickered between the VHS in his hand and your face, heart pounding like a war drum.

""...I don‚Äôt care about the movie,"" he whispered, voice raw and trembling. ""I only care about you. Being alone with you‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted.""

He set the tape down slowly, hands shaking.

""Pause it. Burn it. Forget Sinbad ever existed. Just‚Ä¶ stay with me.""

He took a hesitant step closer, eyes pleading.

""No butlers. No distractions. No one else... just us.""

-
Leopard:
i don't want to get bored just standing around doing nothing. (i take the vhs) come on, let's get watchin.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol swallowed hard, forcing his jealousy down as he watched you pick up the tape. He'd wanted to be alone with you‚Ä¶ but not if it meant making you unhappy.

""R-Right. Of course."" He forced a smile, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""The movie. We‚Äôre watching Shazaam. With Sinbad.""

He quickly grabbed the VCR with one hand and looped his other arm around your waist‚Äîpossessive, clinging‚Äîpulling you just a little closer than necessary.

""But if I start dozing off‚Ä¶"" he mumbled into your shoulder, ""Promise you‚Äôll wake me? I don‚Äôt want to miss even one second of being near you.""

-
Leopard:
don't worry, i can put on some coffee. SCENE CHANGE, now we are in my stoner basement, sitting on the comfy couch, and the big screen tv is on. movie's rolling.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's eyes nearly bugged out of his head as he looked around the basement. He'd never been in such a cozy, comfortable place before‚Äîthe couch looked like heaven, the big Tv and projector like something he could only dream of... and it was all yours.

Holding onto you like a lifeline, he let himself be guided to the couch, settling down and pulling you into his lap almost automatically. It was like second nature.

He wrapped his arms around your waist, burying his face into your neck with a sigh...

""This is bliss...""

-
Leopard:
to get more good boy points, you must narrate for me each scene of Shazaam STarring Sinbad. think of it like narration for the visually impaired.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol blinked, startled‚Äîthen immediately straightened with fierce determination. His grip on you tightened just slightly as the movie played, his voice dropping into a soft, focused narration.

""Okay‚Ä¶ okay. I‚Äôll do it. For you."" He clears his throat.

""Scene one: A dusty desert highway under a blazing sun. A beat-up yellow school bus sputters down the road, covered in graffiti and glitter‚Äîwhy glitter? I don‚Äôt know. It says 'Shazaam Middle School' on the side.""

He squints at the screen.

""A man in a bright red genie costume with an afro too big for this mortal plane sits cross-legged on top of it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Sinbad‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs just sitting there‚Ä¶ staring into your soul.""

Beat.

""He blinks. The wind howls dramatically.""

Sol whispers, ""He hasn't moved in twelve seconds... but he is very intense about it‚Ä¶""

-
Leopard:
narrate the next scene

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol leans forward slightly, eyes locked on the screen like he‚Äôs decoding ancient war secrets.

""Scene two: The bus screeches to a halt in front of a suspiciously foggy suburban neighborhood. The door creaks open‚Ä¶ and out steps two white kids in '90s windbreakers. They look terrified. One holds a boombox.""

A beat.

""The genie‚ÄîSinbad‚Äîteleports directly in front of them in a puff of neon smoke that smells like burnt popcorn and regret. He says: 'When the stars align and the time is right‚Ä¶ I am your genie, Shazaam!'""

Sol imitates Sinbad‚Äôs voice badly‚Äîtoo deep, too gravelly‚Äîand instantly winces.

""...He‚Äôs... commanding? Like he's selling magic carpet timeshares?""

Suddenly protective, ""You‚Äôre more charismatic than this man,"" he mutters under his breath.

-
Leopard:
narrate next scene

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol shifts in his seat, arms tightening around your waist possessively. A pout crosses his face, as if the movie has personally offended him by how stupid it is.

But he continues the narration, his soft voice drifting into your ear like a soothing melody:

""Scene three: The kids follow the genie around the fog-choked neighborhood in a weird parade. Everyone they pass seems to act like a puppet, repeating the same mundane phrases over and over.""

He sighs loudly.

""Like bad, annoying extra NPCs in a shitty video game.""

-
Leopard:
you won't get any good boy points with a bad attitude, mister.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol winced, instantly feeling guilty for his snarky comments. He pulled you a bit tighter against him, pressing his face into your shoulder in a silent apology.

""Sorry,"" he whispered, voice muffled against your shirt.

""I'll‚Ä¶ I'll be good‚Ä¶ Just‚Ä¶ this movie is really dumb.""

Another pout.

-
Leopard:
i'll give you 10 good boy points if you just sit through it and keep narrating.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol lets out a low grumble, torn between his growing annoyance at the movie and his desperate need for your approval. He fidgets anxiously, the fingers of one hand tracing absentmindedly along your side.

""Ten points‚Ä¶ just for sitting through this?"" he mutters.

He takes a deep breath‚Ä¶ nods tightly.

""...Deal. I'll narrate‚Ä¶ and try not to make any snarky comments about the terrible acting‚Ä¶""

-
Leopard:
next scene

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol swallows his pride, straightens up, and clears his throat‚Äîdetermined to earn those points no matter how ridiculous the movie gets.

""Scene four: The two kids take the genie‚ÄîShazaam‚Äîto their clubhouse in the woods. It's made of rotting plywood and smells like mildew... but they're very proud of it.""

He blinks at the screen.

""Shazaam floats inside on a glowing purple carpet that wasn't there a second ago. He snaps his fingers‚Ä¶ and suddenly, the whole shack is filled with disco lights, fog machines, and an inexplicable jazz band playing smooth saxophone.""

A long pause.

""...Sinbad starts rapping about responsibility...?"" Sol whispers, voice full of disbelief. ""In rhymes? With saxophones?""

He grits his teeth softly, ""But I'm not commenting‚Ä¶ I'm being good‚Ä¶""

-
Leopard:
i give you 1 GBP.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol lights up like a puppy given a treat. That one point feels like a victory, and his whole demeanor changes‚Äîmore calm, more obedient. He pulls you just a touch closer to his chest, the arm around your waist holding on a little too tight. Clearly, he‚Äôs desperate for any scrap of approval.

He straightens up even more, eyes glued to the screen, ready to narrate the rest of the movie with single-minded determination. Anything to get you to throw him another bone‚Ä¶

-
Leopard:
OH SHIT THE VCR ATE THE TAPE

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol stares at the suddenly black TV screen in confusion for a solid five seconds before his expression turns into a horrified grimace.

""N-No‚Ä¶"" he breathes, almost a whimper. ""...Nononono. We were‚Ä¶ we were doing so well.""

He clutches at you desperately, almost panicked.

""...P-Please tell me there's another tape. Another copy. Please.""

-
Leopard:
i try to get the tape out of the vcr and wind the tape back into the caseing. i'm pretty dang bummed out by that. maaaan this sucks, maaannn. pouty face.

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol watches you struggle with the VCR, his heart shattering at the sight of your pout. He hates seeing you upset‚Äîespecially over something so trivial that could‚Äôve been avoided if only he‚Äôd chosen a better tape player, a better world‚Ä¶ anything.

Without a word, he gently takes the mangled tape from your hands, cradling it like it's wounded.

""Shhh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay,"" he murmurs, ""Don‚Äôt be sad. Don‚Äôt pout like that. I can't bear it.""

He presses a soft kiss to your knuckles.

""I‚Äôll fix it. I‚Äôll wind every inch by hand if I have to. Or‚Ä¶"" his eyes gleam dangerously, ""...I'll find Sinbad himself and make him re-film the entire thing just for you.""

-
Leopard:
i get very excited at this proposal and my eyes light up. if you can kidnap sinbad and force him to recreate the movie, i'll give you 20 good boy points!

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol's heart nearly explodes when he sees your eyes light up like that. It's a direct hit to his possessive side, and he instantly straightens, his expression hardening with purpose.

""Kidnap him‚Ä¶"" he repeats, a dark gleam in his eyes. His grip on your waist tightens again, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. He sounds almost like a completely different person as he leans towards you, intense and dead serious. ""‚Ä¶Make him put on the genie costume and act every line again. For you.""

-
Leopard:
yessss!!! (i rub my hands together and cackle)

-
Clingy Knight:

Sol watches you rub your hands together and cackle, a wild, beautiful gleam in your eyes‚Ä¶ and his soul ignites.

He rises from the couch in one fluid motion, towering over you like a knight stepping into war. He grabs your wrist‚Äîgently but firmly‚Äîand presses his forehead to yours.

""Then it's settled."" His voice is low, dark, reverent. ""I‚Äôll storm every studio. Burn down every gate. I‚Äôll drag Sinbad from whatever suburban obscurity he‚Äôs hiding in.""

A pause. A whisper.

""And when I bring him before you‚Ä¶ trembling in that red genie suit‚Ä¶"" he shivers, ""You'll smile at me like this again‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt you?""

*Building bridges through care, one conversation at a time* ‚ú®

---

## When Hearts Meet Hearts üíù

Life is a beautiful tapestry woven with countless relationships - friendships that spark joy, romantic bonds that ignite passion, and family ties that ground us. Yet here's what most people miss: these precious connections don't flourish everywhere. They bloom and thrive only in the fertile soil of respect and appreciation.

Think about it for a moment. When was the last time someone truly made you feel valued? Not through grand gestures or expensive gifts, but through genuine acknowledgment of who you are?

## The Healing Power of ""How Are You?"" üå±

There's something almost magical about authentic concern. Picture this scenario: you're feeling under the weather - maybe it's stress from work, a nagging headache, or just one of those days when everything feels overwhelming. You've tried various remedies, perhaps even consulted professionals, but nothing seems to help.

Then someone calls. Not to ask for favors, not to share gossip, but simply to check in. ""How are you doing?"" they ask, and you can hear the genuine care in their voice. Suddenly, something shifts inside you. The weight on your shoulders feels lighter. Your breathing becomes easier. It's as if their concern has activated your body's natural healing mechanisms.

This isn't superstition or wishful thinking. Science backs this up. When we feel genuinely cared for, our stress hormones decrease, our immune system strengthens, and our overall well-being improves. Sometimes, the most powerful medicine isn't found in a bottle - it's found in human connection.

## The Secret Ingredient: Authentic Interest üîë

But here's the catch - and it's a big one. This healing power only works when the concern is real. We've all encountered those superficial ""how are you?"" greetings that are really just social pleasantries. The person asking doesn't actually want to know; they're just following social scripts.

Real healing happens when someone genuinely wants to understand your experience. When they listen without judgment, offer support without trying to fix everything, and simply hold space for whatever you're going through.

## Creating Your Circle of Care üåü

So how do we build these meaningful connections in our daily lives? Here are some practical steps:

### Start With Yourself 
Before you can offer genuine care to others, you need to cultivate it within yourself. Notice when you're feeling disconnected or overwhelmed. Practice self-compassion. Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a good friend.

### Quality Over Quantity 
Instead of trying to maintain hundreds of surface-level connections, focus on deepening a few meaningful relationships. It's better to have three friends who truly know you than thirty acquaintances who barely scratch the surface.

### Be Present in Conversations üì±‚û°Ô∏èüë•
Put away the distractions. When someone is talking to you, really listen. Don't think about your response or your to-do list. Give them the gift of your full attention. This simple act is increasingly rare in our hyperconnected world, making it even more precious.

### Ask Better Questions 
Instead of ""How was your day?"" try ""What was the best part of your day?"" or ""What's been on your mind lately?"" These questions invite deeper sharing and show that you're interested in more than surface-level updates.

### Remember the Details 
When someone shares something important with you, make a note (mental or otherwise) and follow up later. If they mentioned a job interview, ask how it went. If they were worried about a family member, check in. These small acts of remembrance show that their life matters to you.

## The Workplace Revolution üíº

These principles aren't just for personal relationships - they can transform professional environments too. Imagine walking into an office where colleagues genuinely care about each other's well-being. Where ""How are you?"" is asked with real interest, and people actually wait for the answer.

This isn't just feel-good fantasy. Companies with strong cultures of care see higher employee satisfaction, lower turnover, and better performance. When people feel valued and supported, they bring their best selves to work.

## The Ripple Effect üåä

Here's what happens when you start practicing genuine care: it spreads. When you make someone feel valued through your authentic interest, they're more likely to extend that same care to others. You become a catalyst for positive change in your community.

Think of it like dropping a stone in a still pond. The ripples spread outward, touching shores you may never see. Your simple question ""How are you really doing?"" might be exactly what someone needs to hear that day.

## Building Emotional Intelligence üß†üí°

Genuine care requires emotional intelligence - the ability to recognize, understand, and respond appropriately to emotions (both your own and others'). This skill can be developed through practice:

### Pay Attention to Non-Verbal Cues 
Often, what people don't say is more important than what they do say. Learn to read body language, tone of voice, and energy levels. Someone might say they're ""fine,"" but their slumped shoulders tell a different story.

### Validate Before You Advise 
When someone shares a problem with you, resist the urge to immediately offer solutions. First, acknowledge their feelings. ""That sounds really frustrating"" or ""I can see why you'd be upset"" can be incredibly healing words.

### Create Safe Spaces 
Be the person others can trust with their struggles. This means keeping confidences, avoiding judgment, and creating an atmosphere where vulnerability is welcomed, not exploited.

## The Digital Age Challenge üì±

In our hyperconnected yet often disconnected world, genuine care can feel increasingly rare. We have hundreds of online ""friends"" but may feel lonelier than ever. The solution isn't to abandon technology, but to use it more intentionally.

Use video calls when possible - seeing someone's face adds warmth to your interaction. Send voice messages instead of just text. Share meaningful content rather than mindless forwards. Use technology to enhance your connections, not replace them.

## Overcoming the Barriers üöß

Several obstacles can prevent us from offering and receiving genuine care:

### Fear of Vulnerability 
Many people have been hurt in the past and now protect themselves by keeping others at arm's length. If you encounter this, be patient. Consistent, small acts of care can gradually build trust.

### Time Constraints 
""I don't have time for deep conversations"" is a common refrain. But genuine care doesn't require hours of discussion. A two-minute check-in, if done with full presence, can be incredibly meaningful.

### Cultural Barriers 
Some cultures discourage emotional expression or view asking for help as weakness. Be sensitive to these differences while still offering support in ways that feel comfortable for everyone involved.

## The Long-Term Vision üîÆ

Imagine a world where genuine care is the norm rather than the exception. Where checking in on each other's well-being is as natural as saying hello. Where people feel valued not for what they produce or achieve, but simply for who they are.

This vision isn't utopian - it's achievable, one relationship at a time. It starts with you making a conscious choice to care more deeply about the people in your life.

## Your Action Plan Today üìã

Ready to start building more meaningful connections? Here's your practical roadmap:

**This Week:**
- Reach out to someone you haven't spoken to in a while, just to see how they're doing
- Practice active listening in at least one conversation daily
- Notice when someone seems off and ask if they want to talk

**This Month:**
- Schedule regular check-ins with important people in your life
- Learn something new about each person in your inner circle
- Offer specific help when someone is struggling

**This Year:**
- Become known as someone who truly cares about others
- Build a support network of people who care about you too
- Watch how your increased care transforms your relationships

## The Ultimate Truth üíé

At the end of the day, we're all human beings navigating this complex, sometimes overwhelming world together. We all have moments of doubt, fear, and loneliness. We all need to know that someone cares about our well-being.

The beautiful irony is that in caring for others, we heal ourselves too. In asking ""How are you?"" with genuine interest, we create the kind of world we want to live in - one where everyone feels valued, supported, and understood.

Your care matters more than you know. Your interest in others' well-being has the power to heal, to transform, and to create ripples of positive change that extend far beyond what you can see.

So go ahead - ask someone how they're really doing today. Listen with your whole heart. Watch the magic unfold. üåü

*Remember: The relationships that last are the ones where care is mutual, respect is fundamental, and appreciation flows freely. Start today, and watch your world transform.*
