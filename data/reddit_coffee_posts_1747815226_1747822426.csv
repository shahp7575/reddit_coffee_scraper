He is still sad but now he smiles. Lorenzo and I love watching them fluster on their coffee dates ‚Äúshe has been talking to herself in front of a mirror all day‚Äù Lorenzo says as me and my husband walk in the cafe ‚Äúhe has too.. I haven't seen him be a nerve-wracking scene our wedding‚Äù I tell Lorenzo 

‚Äúhaha‚Ä¶yeah I almost proposed to Lucy but chickened out‚Äù he says looking at Lucy In her beautiful blue dress and once my husband saw her he was starstruck just like how he used to be at me and I'm so happy for him ‚ÄúKevin, how have you been?‚Äù Lucy asks ‚Äúumm go‚Ä¶good sorry you look amazing‚Äù he responds ‚Äúhaha I know the feeling‚Äù Lorenzo says hovering over my husband and trying to tap his shoulder as my husband pulls her chair and they begin to talk 

‚ÄúThis was his favorite spot‚Äù Lucy says looking at my husband ‚ÄúI can tell why it's coffee is amazing and don't get me started on the chocolate chip muffins‚Äù Kevin says in response as Lucy laughs before she takes a sip of her coffee ‚Äúhey can I ask what was she like your late wife I mean?‚Äù Lucy asks 

‚ÄúQwin was smart, funny,... stubborn‚Äù he says tilting his head and shaking it ‚Äúshe thought she was always right‚Äù he continued ‚Äúwas she?‚Äù Lucy asks just as Lorenzo asks ‚Äúwere you?‚Äù And me and my husband say at the same time ‚Äúyes‚Äù I giggle

1kru5xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kru5xp/should_i_leave_my_boyfriend/,Should I leave my boyfriend?,"Hello, I'm completely new to Reddit and English isn't my first language so sorry if this doesn't make any sense ^^ this is probably going to be a very long post and I'll try to make the context clear.

So I met my partners in the beginning of last year through mutual friends. We pretty quickly formed a group, with me, my (future) partner that I'll call Paul, a girl I'll call Sophie and a boy I'll call Louis. I met Sophie first, and honestly we went along great. She told me from the beginning she was in love with Paul. At first, I was happy for them, they looked like they went along great and really looked cute together. They were often cuddling and talking privately about some subjects neither me or Louis was allowed to hear about, and I was ok with it. I eventually grew closer to Louis and we started dating. It lasted only a month, and after we broke up, he left the friend group.

So while I was with Louis, Paul and Sophie got even closer, which made me feel a little like I didn't belong in the friend group - there was a duo in the trio, basically. Paul told me he wasn't interested in Sophie, which kinda disappointed me. And then he started flirting with me, and when Sophie said he preferred me over her he'd agree. So after a while, I had a talk with Sophie, making sure she wouldn't be mad at me if I ever started dating Paul. She was ok with it, and so I talked to Paul about my feelings. The conversation dragged on for about a week, and we were only official two weeks after the first talk. Sophie stop talking to us for a while.

I suffer from hypersexuality, so the first two months were kinda hard on me. Paul would touch me often, kiss me often, get in cramped and closed spaces often with me, but we never actually went further than making out. He told me he was a virgin, so at first I tried being patient about it. After two months of us dating, I came to his place and we got intimate for the first time. He was poker faced the whole time and I felt awful afterwards, I really thought he didn't want it and I forced him and he hated it. Two more months goes by of us not having intimacy anymore. I end up drunk sleeping naked in some other man's bed, but we didn't get intimate. Paul is upset, obviously, and I stop talking to the man. Paul start initiating intimacy, and I always ask multiple times if he's ok with it. He says yes.

Later, I catch him dancing with a friend of ours and cuddling laying down on the grass with her. First time, he was drunk, I excused it. But then they start having conversations I can't listen to or know about, and I ask him to tone it down. He doesn't. After a month of me asking, he finally stops being so touchy with her, but they still talk regularly, and I end up accepting it.

A few months goes by, and Paul start seeing Sophie without telling me, going to the cinema then drinking coffee together, and I only know about it because Sophie sent me photos of them together. I confront Paul about it, he says he'll warn me next time. He didn't warn me next time they saw each other, so I ask him to not see her anymore. He says ok.

I start texting some man later, we get along pretty well but he sometimes try talking about sexual topics with me. Paul tells me to block him. I don't, but after a week end up blocking him.

Paul sometimes goes out, and often without telling me. So this one time, he went outside for seven hours and didn't update me. I blocked him, because I was mad at him. He contacts me through another account of mine, I explain why I'm mad and he says he'll fix it. He goes out the very next day and update me often in the two hours he's out, then admits he'd never let me go out of I don't update him or if it's twice in two days. He says he's going out again Tuesday of the next week, I say oh, he says there'll be no alcohol this time, I don't reply. Only time I've asked him if I could hang out with friends at night he said no. The day he's supposed to go out, he tells me he puts on his shoes and he's going, and I say I don't want him going, and he asks why, and I don't reply. He ends up not going.

Recently, I went through his messages with Sophie. And I found some really nasty messages about me, saying I didn't care about them, and some really intimate conversations too, with Sophie saying she'd love Paul to take her on every furniture of her house, and how happy she was because of he hickeys he gave her. Those texts were from the very beginning of our relationship, when we weren't officially together yet. They did make out, but Paul told me there never was anything more than making out and a bit of innappriate touch. He also tells me he's already been intimate with an ex of his, but only with hands, so it doesn't counts and don't seem to understand why I'm upset about him not telling me.

Through the whole relationship (that lasted about a year) there has been communication issues, and him asking things from me he'd never accept if I told him to do the same. And it's really been heavy on my moral, and I'm so lost. If I leave him, I have nobody to talk to because he made me block all of my male friends and I don't have female friends. I'm stuck in an abusive household, and he's supposed to help me move in with him next year. I can't stay with my family, but I'm really starting to feel very unhappy with our relationship, and every time I talk to him about it he just doesn't listen or doesn't even try to change what makes me uncomfortable. If we forget about this, he's a great guy, very funny, very cute, handsome, studying for a high pay job, I get along great with his family (except his mother). I don't know what to do, I'm so lost. I know I've did some really awful things in this relationship too, but what I've discovered during the last few weeks is really weighting on me.  ",1,1747822119.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

So my sleep schedule  looks like this :  5am to 1 pm (8hrs)



Time I have been taking naps : 3pm to 4pm or 9pm-12pm (even after 8hrs of sleep)





I feel so tired and exhausted even tho I have slept for so long. Even now, I'm very tired and wanna just take a nap.



I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Yesterday I was sleepy by 12am, but the moment I went to bed I started overthinking about college and couldn't sleep. I kept on spiraling and fell back to the same pattern of  sleeping at 5am.





I've tried reading books--limiting phone usage before bed, I have been having 3 healthymeals a days,

(Although I'm insanely stressed and anxious about my future and don't go out of my house much.)





Even coffee doesn't help. Any insight would be helpful thanks",1,1747822100.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

1krtzu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1krtzu5/jws_and_milk_a_controversy/,JWs and milk - a controversy,"
The borg encourages breastfeeding as mother‚Äòs milk is ideal for the baby (just google ‚Äömother‚Äòs milk‚Äò and ‚Äöjw.borg‚Äò on this). What they don‚Äòt mention, however, is that breastmilk does not just magically appear - it is made from the mother‚Äòs blood. Breast milk, to be precise, consists of white blood cells. And as we know, white blood cells are one of the four primary blood components that the creator of the universe (the borg) forbids. 


Now I know that a lot of people on here actually know about this but I just wanted to point out some of the most pressing logical failures this simple fact presents us with:

Firstly, according to the borg‚Äôs doctrine, Jehovah sets us humans up for inevitable failure in following his word as women have been feeding their babies forbidden blood components since the beginning of human life. So we‚Äòre all doomed by (God‚Äôs) design if we follow the JW interpretation that we should abstain from blood. 

The OT talks about the eating and ingesting of blood that is prohibited by God, and in the case of breast milk, it is not only transfused but properly ingested by the infant. Makes sense now why Stephen Lett called babies ‚Äölittle enemies of God‚Äò! 

And in this matter we should not only consider human breast milk but the milk from any other living being, e.g. cows. The white substance every JW puts in their coffee- an accumulation of a cow‚Äôs diabolical white blood cells! But Jehovah forbade any consumption of blood, and the OT unmistakably refers to the consumption of animal blood, does it not? So how can any devoted JW drink animal milk and not pour it out on the earth like water? 

According to the borg‚Äôs very own doctrine, every milk-drinking and breastfeeding JW should be subject to a committee. How I‚Äôd love to see mass trials instead of mass baptizing at the next convention over this!",2,1747821479.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

For the activities, we only got a photobooth. Do you think this is enough or should we get additional activities like perfume bar, live stamping, live painting, or game booths, etc.?

Also, can you guys share your timeline from postnup until the open hall? We want to mingle with our guests during cocktail hour but we also want to do the usual postnup session and empty ballroom (since we invested in reception styling).

I think I‚Äôve found a food that works for me and it‚Äôs sort of been my lifeline for the past two months.

I‚Äôll explain my situation first. I (19F) first started showing symptoms in November 2024 following a nasty infection, and after being brushed off by doctors one finally told me I have gastritis. I don‚Äôt know what type it is yet (my gastroenterology appointment isn‚Äôt until June as doctors kept forgetting to make a referral after I requested one üò≠) but in the last month my symptoms have improved so much I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll even show up that inflamed on the results if I were to get an endoscopy. I started off in November with really awful symptoms like constant bile vomiting, burning in the center of my upper abdomen, burping, shortness of breath and yellow diarrhea. I‚Äôd wake up every morning having a panic attack and if I didn‚Äôt get in a hot bath right away to dull the pain it would spiral out of control. Omeprazole didn‚Äôt help me at all. I was in agonising pain every morning and it would come back in waves through the day. But since my last flare up in April my pain has been minimal, even in the mornings. I haven‚Äôt had so many panic attacks lately and don‚Äôt even get burning in my stomach anymore unless I‚Äôm really hungry. I‚Äôve made a few changes to my diet after the flare up and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what helped me heal faster.

The thing that helped me the most was Huel meal replacement shakes (minus the chocolate and coffee flavours). It was the first thing I was able to get down after a week of hypersensitivity after my most painful flareup, and I‚Äôve been drinking 1-2 a day ever since. Because of the nutrition I think they‚Äôre perfect paired with a bland diet as my energy has been better since, and I can drink a little bit of one quickly in the morning to avoid my usual pains. I‚Äôve struggled terribly with loss of appetite throughout the illness and also found at some point that I‚Äôd even become sensitive to foods encouraged for gastritis sufferers like bananas and boiled chicken, but when I couldn‚Äôt stomach hardly anything at all that was always the one thing that stayed down without a problem. Baby food pouches as well. After drinking Huel with other scraps of bland food throughout the days, I started noticing my stomach was becoming less sensitive to foods that made me sick before and now I can tolerate a few more foods, even trigger foods like chocolate in small, infrequent amounts. I‚Äôm very careful not to aggravate my stomach too much though as I don‚Äôt want to go through another flare. The only problem I found with Huel is that they‚Äôre so easily digested that I get hungry quite shortly after I finish it, so it‚Äôs not really like a ‚Äòmeal‚Äô but it‚Äôs been helpful nonetheless. 

I‚Äôm sure these Huel shakes might not be for everybody, I‚Äôve heard a few people who have tried it and it hasn‚Äôt agreed with them. Everybody‚Äôs different ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Now I just want to know what works for everyone else. What foods do you guys find helps you, even if it doesn‚Äôt strictly apply to the gastritis diet?",2,1747821265.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

(sniff) It is a deep picture of how capitalism works today. Not with violence, not with open exploitation‚Äîbut with boredom, with stupidity, with fake smiles and sad birthday parties.

Michael Scott‚Äîah!, the idiot boss. (sniff) But he is not just a fool. He is what we call in psychoanalysis the ‚Äúobscene father‚Äù‚Äîhe is both funny and scary. He wants to be loved, he wants to be your friend, but at the same time he controls your life. This is how power works in modern capitalism: not with fear, but with love. You are supposed to love your job, love your boss, even if they make you miserable. (sniff sniff)

And Jim, yes, everyone says, ‚ÄúJim is the smart one!‚Äù But no! He knows everything is fake‚Äîhe sees through the nonsense‚Äîbut he does nothing! (sniff) He just makes little jokes, plays pranks. This is the perfect capitalist subject today: you laugh, you roll your eyes, but you still come to work every day. You know it‚Äôs all stupid, but you do nothing to change it.

Pam‚Äîah, Pam is a tragic figure. She has dreams, yes, but she always waits. She always says ‚Äúlater.‚Äù Later I will go to art school, later I will be free. But ‚Äúlater‚Äù never comes. (sniff) Capitalism tells you: yes, you can have your dreams‚Äîbut not now. Wait. Always wait.

And the form of the show, the fake documentary style‚Äîit looks real, yes? It feels like real life. But this is the trick. (sniff sniff) It looks real so you don‚Äôt question it. You say: ‚ÄúThis is just how things are.‚Äù This is the most dangerous kind of ideology‚Äînot the one that lies to you, but the one that makes you feel seen, so you stop fighting.

You watch The Office, you laugh, you say, ‚ÄúHaha, my job is just like that!‚Äù And in this moment, you are caught. You accept your life as it is. You feel better, but nothing changes. (sniff)

So I say: The Office is not comedy‚Äîit is horror. It is a prison with birthday cake and a coffee mug that says ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Boss.‚Äù It is how capitalism keeps you calm, keeps you tired, keeps you quiet.

Evening shifts rarely ever remake the lobby coffee because there's almost no demand for it. We aren't allowed to pull the coffee because coffee is complimentary and 24/7. This means that a lot of the time, it sits in the urns for well over 16 hours and goes cold or sour or a mix of the two. I wouldn't drink from them.   
  
The thing is, if we remake the coffee every 4 hours per the guidelines, we would be wasting a LOT of coffee grounds and hot water because guests don't drink it most of the time. Each urn uses up 8oz of grounds, so if I work an 8-hour shift and remake it twice, that's 16 oz of coffee grounds wasted a shift. I know I'm not the one biting the expenses, but on a personal level I don't like waste and try to prevent it if at all possible.  
  
As I come in at 11pm, there's no good reason to make it if I don't see a soul until 5am. Sometimes, evening shift won't touch the coffee at all because demand for it plummets after checkout, some days no one even gets a cup until the next morning. It's a catch 22. 

So, I have a self-imposed schedule to have it started at 4am and always have it out by 4:30am. That's usually early enough to catch the early birds and not too early to go bad by the time Breakfast closes.

I've encountered at least one guest a week who comes down in the twilight hours between 2-3 am and ask if coffee was ready for the morning. Que an awkward and guilty look from me.   
  
""It's from last night, it hasn't been remade for breakfast yet."" Is usually my response, before offering to make them a fresh urn (ETA 5-10 mins depending on the speed of the machine in the back). Some are kind and tell me to not worry about it, but some guests give me so much grief over it not being ready or fresh. Some guests take me up on that offer so I'm happy to make it for them, but I know that if it's a slow day, it will be cold and sour long before breakfast ends. 

Does anyone else experience this? If you're an auditor, what time do you usually make your lobby coffee?

Chapter 1.




‚ÄúMiss Branwen?‚Äù


Yang grumbled in response, still caught somewhere between sleep and lucidity. What could they possibly want now? Could it not wait? Please let it wait. Preferably until after coffee.  


She cracked one eye open, glaring blearily toward the woman opening the curtain by her desk‚Äîor rather, her workbench these days. The sunlight flooded the room, hitting her square in the face like it was personally offended by her habit of sleeping in. Yang groaned loudly and shoved her face back into her pillow, muffling her protest. 

‚ÄúMiss Branwen, it‚Äôs nearly midday!‚Äù The woman‚Äôs voice cut through her half-hearted rebellion, sharp with exasperation. 

Yang groaned again, this time with more resignation. She knew she had no argument‚Äî Vernal always shot down letting her sleep for another few minutes. The rare times she didn‚Äôt, Yang ended up sleeping a few more hours anyway. So with a defeated sigh, Yang sat up in bed, resting against the headboard. She squinted at Vernal, voice thick with sleep. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôve at least got coffee. Or at least brought me breakfast.‚Äù


Vernal huffed in response, shaking her head with disbelief, though there was a small smile on her lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as bad as your mother. How either of you functioned as kids, I‚Äôll never know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have you know, coffee is amazing! Anyone who drinks decaf has the real problem!‚Äù Yang shot back quickly, her lips curling into a cheeky smirk. Vernal simply rolled her eyes, though she was still smiling in amusement. 


Vernal grabbed a tray off the cluttered workbench‚Äî the mystery of how it all fit together, ‚Äúmechanical crap,‚Äù as Vernal called it, never ceased to amaze her‚Äî and brought it over. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs going to have to make a supply run soon,‚Äù Vernal informed Yang, who was practically inhaling her coffee. Vernal raised an eyebrow in exasperation. No matter how many times she saw the Branwens do that, it still amazed her. 

Yang paused for a moment  after her third gulp, then glanced up at Vernal. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll go on the supply run! But we both know I‚Äôm terrible at keeping track of what we need. That‚Äôs more your thing.‚Äù She flashed Vernal a lazy grin, clearly not concerned. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be fine! Just don‚Äôt get distracted by uh‚Ä¶‚Äù Vernal motioned vaguely at the cluttered workbench. Yang raised an eyebrow in mock offence, her smirk widening. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some crow!‚Äù Yang huffed, sticking out her lower lip in an exaggerated pout. ‚ÄúBut you do like shiny things,‚Äù Vernal teased, her voice laced with amusement. 


‚ÄúFine, fine! You‚Äôve got me there.‚Äù She threw up her hand in surrender, but her smile never faltered. ‚ÄúI swear on my name that I won‚Äôt get anything shiny!‚Äù Yang placed her hand on her chest, as if that would help convince Vernal. 


Vernal rolled her eyes, but couldn‚Äôt hide the small smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. ‚ÄúI might just hold you to that,‚Äù She replied dryly, though a flicker of amusement danced in her eyes. Yang chuckled, giving her a playful wink. ‚ÄúTrust me, I‚Äôm practically allergic to the stuff now!‚Äù 


Vernal shook her head in amusement, chuckling lightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you a list,‚Äù She said as she stood up. Yang tried to finish her breakfast quickly, but her attention was already shifting to Vernal as she grabbed something off the workbench.

‚ÄúWorking on it again?‚Äù Vernal asked, her tone losing its earlier amusement, now soft but edged with concern. Yang chewed quickly, then set the remains of her toast down, the lightheartedness leaving her expression as she turned her attention fully to Vernal. ‚ÄúYeah, just tinkering with it a little. It‚Äôs been a little slow recently.‚Äù 


Vernal didn‚Äôt respond immediately. She examined the piece in her hands, as if weighing Yang‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúIs that why you gave it a paint job?‚Äù She tried to sound amused, but she couldn‚Äôt hide the seriousness in her tone. Not that she would want to. Yang could tell there was more to the question, but she didn‚Äôt feel like talking about it just yet. Maybe after a few more coffees, or a few beers. 


Yang shrugged, and picked up the mug of coffee. ‚ÄúYou know how it is. You get bored one day and suddenly you‚Äôre painting your house in a new colour. At least that‚Äôs what normal people do right?‚Äù 


Vernal turned toward Yang, and raised an eyebrow. Her gaze softened as she took in Yang‚Äôs words. She didn‚Äôt push it, though‚Äî she had learned long ago that Yang tinkered when she got stressed, or when she was trying to avoid something‚Ä¶ or someone. Instead, she brought over the contraption and set it down by Yang‚Äôs feet. 


‚ÄúNeed help putting it on?‚Äù She asked, her voice soft, accompanied by a kind smile.


Yang looked down at the metallic arm, now a mix of yellow and black. Her fingers brushed against the cold metal, and for a moment, it felt like getting it for the first time‚Äî heavy, alien, yet filled with a stubborn kind of hope she hadn‚Äôt realised she‚Äôd clung to back then. She raised her actual hand to what remained of her right arm, the familiar pain from years ago surfacing. 

Her mother‚Äôs voice echoed in her mind, ringing with concern, and the memory of blood and sweat lingered in the air. How many years has it been now? Seven? Eight? Long enough that people have come to know her for it, and stop staring when Yang looked their way. 



She remembered the day clearly, her mother had dragged her out of bed, telling her‚Äî demanding Yang to stop moping about for one damned minute. Yang groaned and whined, trying every excuse that she could think of. But when she inevitably followed her mother into the kitchen, there it was‚Äî on the kitchen table, wrapped in some neat packaging that Raven would never have bothered with. 

Yang asked Vernal about it later, but she adamantly denied her role in it. Vernal shrugged it off, claiming she didn‚Äôt even know about it. Yang hadn‚Äôt believed her then, and she didn‚Äôt believe her now. 



It took weeks of training to get used to the arm. The repair instructions left by the creator‚Äîa doctor from Atlas, Yang later found out‚Äîwere written in clinical terms that might as well have been gibberish. But that didn‚Äôt stop Yang from modifying it every so often. Figuring it out gave her something to focus on, something to fight for‚Äî a way to feel like herself again, even if she wasn‚Äôt quite the same.



‚ÄúYang?‚Äù Vernal‚Äôs voice cut through her thoughts, soft but insistent, grounding her in the present. Yang blinked up at her, startled out of the storm of memories. She tried to force a warm smile, but it wavered at the edges, betraying her. 

‚ÄúI should probably take a shower first, I reek of oil and sweat.‚Äù Yang forced a laugh, brushing her fingers through her messy, golden mane. The heaviness of the memories remained, but a quick shower‚Äî and the hour it would take to dry her thick hair‚Äî would help shake it off.


‚ÄúReek is putting it lightly,‚Äù Vernal said with a mock gag, dramatically holding her nose. ‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs a miracle I‚Äôm still standing here!‚Äù

Yang rolled her eyes, the corners of her lips tugging into a small, genuine smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so dramatic, Vernal. You‚Äôve smelled worse.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Vernal shot back, smirking as she stepped back to give Yang space to get up. ‚ÄúBut at least those smells didn‚Äôt come with an attitude.‚Äù 


Yang let out a soft laugh as she swung her legs over the side of the bed. ‚ÄúCareful now, or I‚Äôll put you on butcher-duty for a month. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll smell like daisies in comparison,‚Äù Yang teased, giving Vernal a sly wink.


‚ÄúAt least the meat won‚Äôt give me lip,‚Äù Vernal quickly shot back, rolling her eyes dramatically, clearly not taking the threat seriously. She then left the room, giving Yang a quick goodbye and a reminder of her task. 



Yang stood up and stretched, rolling her shoulders to wake up a few muscles. She stared down at the arm, her breath slow, as if she was reliving that first moment of shock. She blinked rapidly, shaking her head slightly, and pulled herself back into the present. She grabbed her towel tossed across the back of her chair, her arm and headed for the shower. 


One of the benefits of being leader, is that she could, and did, declare that they‚Äôd make a permanent camp in the area. It allowed them to set up running water and move out of shabby tents. No more moving from place to place, constantly on the run from the many enemies Raven had made. Not that they stopped searching‚Äî it‚Äôs just that no one knew they‚Äôd settled in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, by a town that‚Äî thankfully‚Äî gives them odd jobs, despite the Branwen name.


After a quick shower, and a not-so-quick drying of her hair, Yang couldn‚Äôt help but feel like her mind was a little clearer. Even if only for a moment. She pulled on a fresh set of clothes‚Äî nothing fancy, just something comfortable‚Äîand tightened the holster belt around her waist. The familiar weight of her revolver settled comfortably at her side. Even if they weren‚Äôt bandits anymore, carrying around a weapon still felt necessary. Yang double-checked her ammo, her mother‚Äôs voice ringing in her ear, reminding her incessantly to always be prepared.

Satisfied, Yang rolled up the sleeve over her stump, exposing the skin where her arm used to be. The stump was still raw in some places, though time healed the initial damage. Even after all these years, the sensation of being without her arm still hit her like a cold shock every time she had to slip the prosthetic on. 


The suction sealed into place, and the familiar heaviness of the arm settled over her. It wasn‚Äôt quite like her real arm‚Äî it still felt too foreign, too metallic‚Äî but she‚Äôd grown used to the process. The arm clicked to life, the internal mechanics humming softly for a moment before it calibrated, adjusting to her will. It always felt heavier before it powered up, and the first few moments always felt strange as she flexed her fingers, tested the response time. Better than the last time, at least.


But it still didn‚Äôt feel real, even after all this time. The haptic feedback had improved over the years; Yang had practically rebuilt the damn thing three times over with all her repairs and modifications. But the feeling of touch‚Äî of truly feeling what she had gripped‚Äî was still more of a ghost sensation, a distant echo of what it should have been. The difference between holding a glass or a shirt, had taken months to fine-tune. Sometimes it took her off guard‚Äîshe still occasionally crushed a glass or flinched at heat. 


She flexed her fingers again, and rolled her shoulder as if that would somehow help make it feel more natural. It didn‚Äôt, but the familiar weight of it was grounding in its own way. 




With her clothes sorted, and her arm attached, Yang stepped outside, the warm summer sun hitting her skin. She took a moment to breathe it in, letting the warmth settle over her. The air was thick with the scent of dry earth and pine, though there was an acrid undercurrent wafting from the forge‚Äîoil and hot metal. Yang would have to ask if Finn had anything left over once she got back. 



It was peaceful‚Äî at least, as peaceful as the camp ever got. Children ran around with big smiles on their faces, while various tribesmen chatted, only stopping to wave or greet Yang. She could almost forget about the weight of leadership, the constant pressure to keep things together, keep everyone alive. Almost. Someone would always remind her‚Äî ask for a favour, or compare her leadership to her mothers.


Yang savoured the sun a little while more, knowing damn well that she wouldn‚Äôt have a working AC in the truck. Repairing it was getting increasingly frustrating, and buying a new one outright was more than she or any of the tribesmen could afford. Maybe if she sold her soul‚Ä¶Yang quickly shook off her worry. Scrap, tinkering, and kicking‚Äîor punching‚Äî a frustrating repair had gotten them this far. 


Yang flexed her metallic fingers again, making sure they were responsive. She had to leave her arm giving the steering wheel a death grip to retrieve a screwdriver, wrench, or whatever tool she could wedge between the two, on numerous embarrassing occasions. A couple of times, she had to rip off the steering wheel itself, practically tearing it to shreds just so she could take her arm back to her workbench. It was the wheel or the arm. A necessary sacrifice she told herself, though Finn laughing hysterically echoed in her mind ever since. 


With her fingers assuredly responsive, and the sun having warmed her face, Yang moved through the camp, passing familiar faces and giving kids a high five with her ‚Äúcool arm,‚Äù as they so gently put it. 


The truck Yang needed was in its usual place, tucked beneath one of the roofed shelters that lined the mechanics yard. The large, open space served as a storage and repair area for the tribes vehicles, the makeshift roofs offering shade from the sun and protection from the occasional rain.Most folks worked on their own rides, borrowing tools from Vance, the mechanic, or using whatever they had on hand.

Yang weaved around rusted cars, a half-disassembled bike that had been left unattended for weeks now, and someone half-buried under their truck, cursing up a storm. The air was thick with the scent of oil and sun-baked metal‚Äîsharp and acrid, but familiar. At this point, she barely noticed it. 



The truck sat where it always did, its faded paint still so damn recognisable. Someone had even attached the trailer for her. Probably Vernals doing, or she got Vance to handle it‚Äî equally likely. Yang gave the trailer a couple lucky taps‚Äî an old habit that Vance drilled into her.


Yang then hopped into the driver's seat, and pulled out her phone to see if she got the list yet. Just as much as she liked driving around aimlessly, Vernal would probably want her back ASAP. She could quickly pay Pyrrha a visit though‚Äî she wasn‚Äôt surely in that much of a rush, right?


A new message had come in, the list attached along with a reminder in all caps not to grab anything shiny.

‚ÄúI swore on my name, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù Yang texted back, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips as she hit send. She tossed her phone into the cup holder and started up the truck, which sputtered into life with a stubborn cough, before settling into a steady growl.

‚ÄúAttagirl,‚Äù Yang whispered to the machine, as if rewarding it for good behaviour. 


Her phone dinged. Vernal simply responded with an eye-roll emoji. Yang huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head as she shifted the truck into gear. ‚ÄúNo faith in me at all,‚Äù she muttered to herself, though the smirk never left her lips. 


The truck rumbled forward, tires crunching against the dirt as she pulled out of the mechanics yard. And as the camp faded in the rearview mirror, Yang fired up the CD player, one of the few things that rarely needed repairs in this quickly aging machine. 

It wasn‚Äôt a long drive, a good twenty minutes‚Äîthirty at the most‚Äî but it always felt faster with a good stream of songs, where Yang couldn‚Äôt help but start bellowing along, much to the dismay of any that braved coming along with her. Thankfully for them, she was alone today and could sing as loud as she wanted without groans, moans or playful pleas. 


She drummed her fingers against the steering wheel, keeping time with the beat, her prosthetic  thudding against the worn leather. The road stretched out ahead, straight and familiar, and Yang was comfortable enough with it to push the speed a little. Hopefully, she‚Äôd remember to slow down before the speed-trap. 

As she hit the chorus, she threw herself into it with all the enthusiasm of a rockstar at a sold-out show, her voice carrying over the rumble of the truck. The lyrics were half-right at best, but that never stopped her before, and it certainly didn‚Äôt help keep her speed in check. 


By the time she could see the first sign of buildings, her voice was already feeling the strain. ‚ÄúYeah maybe not that loud next time,‚Äù Yang muttered to herself, knowing full well she‚Äôd do it again on the way back. Though, her throat was parched now‚Ä¶ Well she could still stop at the petrol station under the guise of topping off the truck. 



The familiar building quickly came into view, its neon sign still as gaudy as when Yang first saw it. She eased off the gas, letting the vehicle slow as she pulled up to a pump. Thankfully it was just modern enough to take her card there, but she‚Äôd still need water. 


She threw the truck into park, and shut off the engine, the sudden quiet ringing in her ears. Though, there were other cars parked here, one by the other pump was left unattended‚Äî surely the owner was inside. The other car parked haphazardly in the lot‚Ä¶ Nora, no doubt. Yang recognised that car anywhere, she helped Nora repair the damn thing more times than she‚Äôd care to count. 

Yang couldn‚Äôt help but smile as she swung the door open and hopped out of the truck. It‚Äôd be nice to see her, even if she was‚Ä¶ excitable. 


Yang decided to top off her truck first‚Äî it felt like the natural order of things. So with a few button presses, a slow authorization of her card, and a click of the nozzle settling into place, she was good to go. Hopefully twenty was enough; the truck was a guzzling beast.


As she stepped into the building, the refreshing coolness of the AC hit her, making her momentarily forget how much she hated the AC in the truck. If only it was this comfortable. Yang glanced up at the sound of someone excitedly telling a story, and sure enough, it was Nora, gesturing wildly as she went on. Her orange hair was as distinct as her boundless energy. Yang could definitely use whatever coffee she was drinking. 

Ren, her poor target, looked up and offered Yang a friendly smile and a wave. Nora didn‚Äôt take notice‚Äî she just kept rattling on. Yang couldn‚Äôt help but let out a small laugh, giving Ren a shrug in mutual understanding for Nora‚Äôs enthusiasm. 


She moved towards the water cooler, hoping to catch snippets of Nora‚Äôs excited, rapid-fire storytelling. But despite the loud volume, the words were too jumbled to understand. 


Opening the fridge, Yang‚Äôs eyes flickered over to the reflection‚Äî a glimpse of someone else. A  second glance revealed little: just a hooded figure browsing various snacks. It was probably just the owner of the other car, she told herself. 


Though, it was strange how they tried to hide so much of themselves. Were they going to try and steal something? The prices weren‚Äôt so bad. A little higher than the shops in town, sure, but that‚Äôs to be expected. 

Maybe she was just reading too much into things‚Äîprobably just someone passing through town. Shaking it off, Yang grabbed a bottle of water and made her way to the counter. Where Nora was still talking Ren‚Äôs ear off. He gave Yang another friendly smile as she waved at him. 


‚ÄúHey, you two!‚Äù Yang interrupted Nora, lest they be there all day. Nora stopped her story long enough to greet Yang‚Äîmore like screeching some form of her name. Then, in her usual burst of energy, Nora practically tackled Yang into a hug. Yang gasped, struggling to breathe through the squeeze of Nora‚Äôs death hug. ‚ÄúYeah yeah, I missed you too,‚Äù she managed, her words breathless. 


When Yang was finally freed, she leaned against the counter and cracked open her bottle. ‚ÄúDo tell Nora, what‚Äôs got you like this? 5 shots of espresso?‚Äù Yang joked, barely managing to hide her smirk behind the bottle. 

‚ÄúOh please, Ren won‚Äôt let me touch the stuff after last time.‚Äù Nora gave Ren a playful glare, but Yang could tell there was no malice in it. Nora was too sweet for that.

Yang tilted her head, still smirking. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the occasion? Did you finally get something on your Pinterest board?‚Äù She teased, half-expecting Nora to actually say yes. Yang could see Ren trying to hide a smirk out of the corner of her eye. 


‚ÄúOh haha. Very funny, Yang!‚Äù Nora stuck her tongue out at her, clearly not noticing Ren‚Äôs amused smile, or was simply less bothered by it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have you know my Pinterest board is my pride and joy, and one day, I shall get something off it!!‚Äù Nora declared proudly.

Yang raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúLast I checked, your ‚Äòpride and joy‚Äô featured a potato-cannon that you tried to build last year. Finn still hasn‚Äôt forgiven you for nearly taking his head off,‚Äù Yang teased again. 


‚ÄúI could have worked out the kinks if he let me!‚Äù Nora whined, a sense of mourning her beloved potato-cannon etched across her face. 


‚ÄúEven if he did, I wouldn‚Äôt let you,‚Äù Ren stated coldly, though he still wore a smile. Nora quickly shot him another glare, but it lacked any real heat. A beat passed, tension hanging in the air‚Äî then she huffed, crossing her arms with an exaggerated pout and muttering under her breath, ‚Äúyou totally would have!‚Äù 


That was all it took. Yang snorted, Nora cracked a grin, and soon enough, they all burst out laughing. 



Yang wiped a tear from her eye, still chuckling. ‚ÄúBut seriously, what‚Äôs got you so excited today?‚Äù 

Nora practically vibrated the whole damn building with how excited she got. Words tumbled out of her mouth too fast to follow, her hands moving in their trademark wild gestures‚Äî until one of them smacked into a magazine rack, sending it toppling over and scattering its contents across the floor.

That, at least, was enough to pause her for a second. Just long enough for Yang and Ren to share another look of mutual understanding. Nora simply stared at her destruction, blinking a few times as if she could somehow will the rack back into place. Then, with a sheepish shrug, she pulled out her most effective weapon: puppy eyes. ‚ÄúSorry ‚Äòbout that, Ren.‚Äù 


Ren just waved it off, and began picking up the debris. He had seen many a magazine rack fall prey to Nora‚Äôs wild gesturing. Over time, he‚Äôd try all manner of methods to save them‚Äîbut Nora, intentionally or not, always found a way. It was just part of the Nora experience. 

Yang chuckled to herself, shaking her head. ‚ÄúOne day, Nora, you‚Äôll bring this building down with that energy.‚Äù 

Nora waved her hand dismissively. ‚ÄúPfffttt, you‚Äôre just jealous of my vitality! Anyway,‚Äù she began bouncing in place, unable to wait yet again. ‚ÄúI just finished a big contract! Pyrrha and I‚Äî‚Äú


‚ÄúPyrrha?!‚Äù Yang‚Äôs eyes widened in disbelief, her tone shifting to one of mild shock. ‚ÄúI thought she gave up that life,‚Äù Yang retorted, even scoffing at it. 

Nora paused for a moment, her eyes flickering over to Ren. They both shared a worried look, before turning back to Yang. ‚ÄúOh‚Äî Sorry, Yang. I thought she told you before we left,‚Äù Nora explained, her tone apologetic. 

Yang‚Äôs brows furrowed in thought, her mind racing with worried questions. But none escaped her lips, she couldn‚Äôt‚Äî didn‚Äôt know how to ask Nora. Why didn‚Äôt Pyrrha tell her? They were supposed to be on good terms now, right? 




‚ÄúYang?‚Äù Ren‚Äôs voice cut through all those thoughts, his tone laced with concern. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Yang looked up at him, forcing a smile as best as she could. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine, really,‚Äù she reassured him, though her voice betrayed her. Nora and Ren exchanged concerned glances before both their eyes dropped to the water bottle in Yang‚Äôs hand. 



She hadn‚Äôt even realized she‚Äôd crushed it. The plastic bottle was barely recognizable now, its sides warped and crumpled in her grip. Yang stared at it for a moment before sighing and tossing it into the bin by the door.


‚ÄúSorry, it‚Äôs this damned arm. You know how it gets,‚Äù Yang chuckled half-heartedly, though she couldn‚Äôt sound wholly unbothered by it. Nora‚Äôs eyes softened with sympathy and she gently placed a hand on Yang‚Äôs metallic one. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt blame you, no one does.‚Äù 

Her soft smile was comforting, but‚Ä¶


Yang‚Äôs brows furrowed again as she pulled her hand away from Nora‚Äôs. She stared at it for a long moment, lost in thought as she mulled over Nora‚Äôs words. 


‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Yang muttered. She couldn‚Äôt even look up to meet their eyes, all she could do was stare at her arm, reliving that one moment. That‚Äôs why she broke it off with Pyrrha‚Äî she couldn‚Äôt look at her the same way. Yeah they might be talking again, but that‚Äôs not the same as picking up where they left off. Not after what happened. 

It wasn‚Äôt fair to Pyrrha. Yang knew that much. It felt easier to close herself off, end it, and hide behind her walls. But a part of her‚Äîa tiny part‚Äî knew that it was selfish, a mistake she could never fix. 


Nora, being Nora, didn‚Äôt let it slide. With an ease only she could manage, she reached out and gently nudged Yang‚Äôs shoulder, offering another small but genuine smile. 


‚ÄúYou know damn well Pyrrha‚Äôs the kindest person on Remnant! She‚Äôd never blame you, not even a little. And were she here, she‚Äôd give you the biggest, tightest hug that puts mine to shame.‚Äù 

Yang exhaled sharply, clenching her hand as tight as she could. Nora had a point‚ÄîPyrrha was just too damn kind for her own good. Maybe that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt give her a heads-up. She didn‚Äôt want Yang to worry. 



Yang let out a dry chuckle, the tension in her shoulders easing. ‚ÄúIf only I was half as kind,‚Äù Yang admitted, almost bitterly. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have pushed her away, kept her at arm's length after‚Äî‚Äú 

‚ÄúYang, please. Whatever happened, whatever you did, Pyrrha forgave you hundreds of times over. So please, for her, and for your sake‚Äîplease have an honest conversation with her,‚Äù Nora pleaded, her voice soft but earnest. 


Yang let out a self-deprecating laugh. ‚ÄúYeah, ‚Äòcause that will go over well. ‚ÄòHey Pyrrha, sorry I broke up with you. Will you please take me back?‚Äô And she‚Äôll just swoon in my arms?‚Äù 


Nora gently clasped her hands on Yang‚Äôs, trying to meet her avoidant gaze. ‚ÄúYang‚Ä¶ She doesn‚Äôt want you to beg for her back. She just wants to know if you‚Äôre ok. That‚Äôs all. And if you really care about her‚Äîlet her back in. She‚Äôll understand.‚Äù


Yang scoffed, shaking her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple. Not when I got her hurt, left her because of MY mistake.‚Äù She tried to pull her hand away, but Nora refused to let go, her grip remained firm. 


‚ÄúYou think that‚Äôs what she sees? That you got her hurt and abandoned her?‚Äù Nora gently squeezed Yang‚Äôs hand in a comforting manner. ‚ÄúOr do you think she‚Äôll want an honest conversation with the woman she loved?‚Äù


Yang swallowed, her jaw tightening‚Äîbut before she could argue, Nora flashed her mischievous smirk. ‚ÄúAnyone ever tell you that you can be annoyingly stubborn at times?‚Äù 



Yang tried to fight the smirk tugging at the corners of her lips, but it made short work of her defences and broke through. Damnit, she really hated it when Nora had a point. 


‚ÄúFine! You win. I‚Äôll have a chat with Pyrrha, a sober one,‚Äù Yang conceded with a laugh, throwing her hands up in mock defeat. 


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our girl,‚Äù Nora gushed with the sweetest smile Yang ever saw. 


When Yang declared she needed to get going, Ren offered one of his rare hugs  And she took full advantage of this rare opportunity, wrapping her arms tightly around him. Nora, of course, gave one of her signature death hugs before letting Yang leave.

There is a man at the bar. He is sitting alone- stout but not large, in a work shirt and slacks. Orthopedic shoes. Glasses. Extra bushy eyebrows and a tuft or two coming out of his ears.
He's probably drinking beer. Or some well liquor. He lives in a small studio apartment with an old tube TV and a lazy boy chair. His kitchen has a toaster oven and a hot plate. He likes alphabet soup the best. When he doesn't go out for coffee he makes himself a cup of folger's instant coffee crystals. He watches reruns until he falls asleep in the recliner and the late night infomercials come on. But he used to have a wife. And a house with knotty pine walls in the suburbs. He put those walls in himself in the 70's. Went out and cut the lumber, sanded it all down and then polished it until it gleamed and shone. The room with the knotty pine became his study, most the time, instead of getting any work done he would find faces and forest animals in the knots in the wood. He would daydream until the clock crept past midnight and then he would go crawl quietly into bed with his wife. Her name was Lu-Anne, or maybe Brenda. They met at a singles mixer at the Unitarian Universalist Church. He loved her the way a drunk loves convenience store wine at 2:25 in the morning. (You are so glad it's there and so happy to have it, but you've never considered another option). They didn't fall in love as much as they fell into compatability . Complacency. He liked her tuna casserole and the way she used fried onion instead of peas. Twice a month they would get drunk at dinner and make love on the sofa. They tried for a baby, but it wouldn't stick. They never talked about it again after those two years of trying. Just moved on and pretended that they'd never discussed wanting a child in the first place. They got a dog but it chewed up all the furniture and pissed on the rug and they gave it up. They weren't unhappy though. There was a certain pleasant contentedness in their routines. They stayed married for 15 years. Their 15th anniversary was August 27th, 1983. They went out for supper and stopped at the local watering hole for drinks. He gave her a pearl necklace with matching earrings and she cried a little- maybe more because of the gin than any actual gratitude. She was a happy, emotional drunk. On the drive home it started to rain, the first storm in late August when everything is thirsty and the sky opens up and pours an unrelenting rain onto the earth. The roads were glistening and the windshield wipers were moving at warp speed and still hardly making a dent in the little river that had made its home on the windshield. He fumbled with the cigarette lighter to light a cigarette, she took it from him and her face glowed red as she pressed it against the tobacco and inhaled deeply. She leaned back and looked at him sideways. Told him she loved him, and she meant it. She really did. She passed him the cigarette and he dropped it in his lap. He scrambled to get to it to keep it from burning a whole in his best pants. It was still pouring buckets. He stopped the car- you could barely make out the red of the traffic light through all that water on the glass. They both looked for the cigarette, eyes on his lap. He could feel the heat but couldn't see it. And all of a sudden, it happened. A 1979 Suburban barreled through the intersection. The crunching sound of metal on metal and tires on the slick first-rain of the season roads is something you'd never forget. Lu-Anne died instantly. He couldn't stand the knotty pine and the house in the suburbs after the funeral. So now he goes home each night to his alphabet soup, the sound of reruns and infomercials drowning out the memory of his great and mediocre love.",1,1747819060.0,stories,0,1.0,False

# Understanding Your Personal Style

Identifying your personal aesthetic is crucial before diving into an interior design project. Your space should reflect your individuality and make you feel comfortable. By understanding your design preferences, you can create an environment that resonates with your style and personality. The first step in this journey is to explore various design styles such as contemporary, minimalist, bohemian, and industrial, to name a few. Each style has its unique characteristics, color schemes, and materials, which can elicit different feelings and atmospheres within a space.

One effective method to hone in on your personal style is by creating an inspiration board. This board can be digital or physical, filled with images that stand out to you or evoke a desired emotion. Use platforms like Pinterest to gather pictures of rooms, furniture, and decorative elements that you find appealing. As you collect these images, pay attention to recurring themes, colors, and styles that resonate with you. This exercise can provide clarity on which design route to pursue, whether it be employing luxury [Interior designers in Navi Mumbai](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/)¬†or opting for a DIY approach.

Additionally, consider experimenting with color palettes that reflect your taste. Color plays a profound role in setting the mood of a space; therefore, selecting hues that make you feel relaxed or energized is vital. Websites like Adobe Color or Coolors can help you visualize and create harmonious color combinations to incorporate into your interior project.

Ultimately, understanding your personal style will serve as a guiding light throughout your design process. By reflecting on your inspirations and preferences, you can forge a path toward creating a stylish space that aligns with your vision, supported by the expertise of the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai if needed.

# Setting a Budget for Your Design Project 

https://preview.redd.it/5spsu529q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64c3327723b77d1a272ca4dfa88fefddd4336070

Establishing a budget is a critical initial step in the journey towards creating your dream space. A well-planned budget not only aligns with your design goals but also ensures that the chosen interior reflects your personal style without leading to overspending. One of the first considerations should be to determine the total amount you are willing to invest in the project, which is influenced by factors such as the size of the space and the scope of the design needed.

The costs associated with interior design can vary significantly. Major expenses often include furniture, decor items, paint, and materials. It is wise to research and collect quotes to gain a realistic view of these costs. This is particularly important when exploring options from the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, who can provide expert insights and material recommendations. Additionally, prioritizing your spending is essential ‚Äî consider what elements are most important to you and allocate your budget accordingly. For instance, investing in high-quality furniture may result in better long-term satisfaction than spending significantly on decor items.

Moreover, seeking out deals can substantially reduce costs without compromising quality. Many luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai might have access to exclusive discounts, sales events, and bundle offers on furniture and materials. You may also want to consider seasonal sales or clearance items to stretch your budget further. Lastly, setting aside a contingency fund of around 10-15% of your total budget can help manage unforeseen expenses that often arise during design projects.

In conclusion, a well-defined budget serves as the foundation of any successful interior design project. By clearly outlining your financial parameters and making informed decisions, you can effectively maximize your resources while achieving the desired aesthetic for your space. Engaging with top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai might also provide additional strategies for sticking to your budget, ensuring that your design dreams become a reality.

# Choosing the Right Color Scheme 

https://preview.redd.it/mr0j8jq7q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d35fd3135db9fd45bd03ef9cb247781cc89a1b94

The color scheme of a space plays a pivotal role in shaping its overall ambiance and functionality. When selecting the appropriate color palette, it is essential to consider color theory principles, which focus on the relationship between colors and their visual effects. A well-thought-out color scheme can make a room feel more cohesive, inviting, and aesthetically pleasing. Interior designers in Navi Mumbai emphasize the significance of understanding color psychology, as different shades invoke nuanced emotional responses. For instance, blues and greens are known for their calming effects, while yellows and reds can energize a space.

When choosing a color palette, start by selecting a base color that resonates with your personal style and the mood you wish to create. Often, neutral tones serve as an effective foundation, allowing you the flexibility to introduce bolder accent colors without overwhelming the space. It is generally advisable to follow the 60-30-10 rule, where 60% of the room is painted in the dominant color, 30% in a secondary hue, and 10% in an accent shade. This technique is widely recommended by the [best interior designers in Navi Mumbai](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/).

Additionally, considering how colors blend can significantly enhance the overall aesthetics. Combining complementary colors can create visual harmony, while contrasting colors may provide a vibrant dynamic. It is also beneficial to utilize accent walls or decorative elements in different colors to draw attention and add dimension to the design. When selecting luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai, inquire about their approach to color selection and how they tailor palettes to reflect individual tastes and preferences. Ultimately, the right color scheme not only amplifies the visual appeal of a space but can also positively influence the psychological comfort of its inhabitants. In conclusion, mastering color choices is fundamental to creating a stylish and harmonious environment.

# Selecting Furniture and Decor 

https://preview.redd.it/wjf0jyx5q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f6a35a2b903e55db90d15b66d16d296d4d193e

Choosing the right furniture and decor is crucial in creating a stylish and cohesive space. First and foremost, it's essential to understand your design vision and personal style, as these elements will guide you in making selections that reflect your taste and meet functional needs. Among the many interior designers in Navi Mumbai, professionals often emphasize the significance of selecting statement pieces that can serve as focal points within a room.

When selecting furniture, consider scale and proportion in relation to your room size. Oversized furniture can overwhelm a small space, while tiny pieces may feel lost in a large area. It‚Äôs vital to visualize how each piece will fit within the overall layout and functionality of the room. This insight is a common practice among the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, who often recommend measuring dimensions meticulously to ensure that each item harmonizes with the environment.

Moreover, mixing textures and materials can significantly enhance the aesthetic appeal of your space. Combining elements such as wood, metal, and fabric introduces depth and warmth.

# Incorporating Natural Elements 

https://preview.redd.it/ed9q02o4q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8c506246e5b73d634f55475864db6ae63bc2954

Bringing natural elements into interior design has become increasingly significant, particularly among those seeking to create stylish and inviting spaces. An essential practice among interior designers in Navi Mumbai is the incorporation of nature, which enhances the aesthetic appeal of homes while promoting well-being. By making use of plants, natural light, and organic materials, one can effortlessly transform an ordinary space into a serene retreat.

Plants are one of the most accessible ways to introduce nature indoors. They not only add greenery but also improve air quality and contribute to a sense of tranquility. The best interior designers in Navi Mumbai often recommend adding a variety of indoor plants, such as snake plants, peace lilies, or succulents, to create a lively and refreshing environment. Furthermore, the strategic placement of plants in various rooms can make spaces feel more welcoming and vibrant.

Natural light is another important element that should be maximized in a home. Large windows, skylights, or even glass doors can fill rooms with sunlight, enhancing not only the visual appeal but also improving mood and productivity. Incorporating window treatments that allow for flexibility in light control can help balance brightness throughout the day. Many of the [top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/)¬†emphasize the need for an abundance of natural light to create mood-enhancing interiors.

Finally, using organic materials such as wood, stone, and natural fibers in furniture and decor can strengthen the connection to nature. Luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai often recommend choosing sustainable materials that reflect one‚Äôs personal style while also being environmentally friendly. These elements not only add character to a space but also promote a calming atmosphere, making it crucial to incorporate them wisely. By integrating these natural elements, homeowners can achieve a stylish and harmonious living environment.

# Creating a Functional Layout 

https://preview.redd.it/nr8vxae3q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dec29cb8938bbcdc00ce42fe7ac7bcf0a91972

The layout of a space significantly influences its functionality and aesthetic appeal. When designing a stylish area, one must prioritize creating a functional layout that meets the needs of its occupants. Effective space planning is vital, encompassing the arrangement of furniture, circulation paths, and the overall flow of movement within the environment. Interior designers in Navi Mumbai often emphasize the importance of considering how individuals will navigate through the space. Ensuring that pathways are clear and unobstructed provides not only visual harmony but also enhances usability.

To achieve an optimal layout, one should begin by assessing the purpose of the space. This assessment allows for prioritizing essential areas while considering the dimensions of each element involved. Utilizing scaling principles plays a crucial role in ensuring that furniture and d√©cor pieces are proportionate to the overall size of the room. For instance, oversized furniture in small areas can create clutter, making the space feel cramped, whereas well-scaled furnishings can open up the space and promote a stylish, airy atmosphere.

Additionally, accessibility is a crucial aspect to address when crafting a functional layout. A well-designed space accommodates individuals with diverse mobility needs, ensuring that everyone can utilize it comfortably. This consideration often calls for wider pathways and thoughtful placement of essential items within easy reach. Luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai are adept at integrating these functionalities seamlessly into their designs, ensuring that style does not come at the expense of practicality.

Ultimately, the goal is to create an inviting environment that resonates with its intended use. By balancing aesthetics and functionality, the interior design can enhance everyday experiences while reflecting the unique tastes of the occupants. Engaging the services of the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai can further elevate this process, ensuring an effective and stylish outcome.

# Adding Personal Touches and Accessories 

https://preview.redd.it/v0jc8122q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9af39d17556f6fb19bb34cb6d035c82545292209

Incorporating personal touches and accessories into your space is essential for creating a stylish environment that reflects your unique personality. Personalization can greatly enhance the aesthetic appeal of a room, making it feel more inviting and comfortable. To do this effectively, start by selecting accessories that speak to your interests and experiences. Items such as photographs, travel souvenirs, or handmade crafts can be excellent conversation starters and focal points in any room.

Artwork plays a significant role in expressing individuality. Statement art pieces, whether they are paintings, sculptures, or wall hangings, can transform a bland wall into an eye-catching gallery. Consider the colors and themes that resonate with you when choosing these pieces, as they should complement the overall design while also standing out. Moreover, local talent can often provide unique options, so exploring local galleries or exhibitions might lead you to find the perfect work that reflects the vibrancy of Navi Mumbai.

Layering accessories is another effective technique to add depth and dimension to your design. Mixing textures, heights, and materials can create a more dynamic visual effect. For instance, a blend of books, candles, and decorative trays on a coffee table can establish a curated look. Additionally, layering different types of lighting, such as table lamps, floor lamps, and wall sconces, can enhance both the functionality and ambience of your space.

When seeking inspiration, it can be beneficial to look at the work of the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, who often emphasize these elements in their designs. By incorporating personalized accessories and art pieces thoughtfully, you can achieve a stylish space that truly represents who you are. Luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai also highlight the importance of such personalization, ensuring that spaces not only look good but also feel authentic and lived-in.

# Lighting: The Finishing Touch 

https://preview.redd.it/gd9bhuo0q32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bd51a3f15ec82922d3083729c9d85870482b531

Lighting plays a crucial role in interior design, serving as both a functional element and an artistic touch that can transform a space. The right lighting can significantly influence the mood and atmosphere of a room, making it essential to consider various options when designing. Interior designers in Navi Mumbai often emphasize the importance of utilizing both natural and artificial lighting to achieve the best results. Natural light not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of a space but also positively impacts the well-being of its occupants. Therefore, maximizing windows and strategically placing mirrors can help reflect light throughout the room.

Artificial lighting, on the other hand, provides versatility and control. When selecting light fixtures, consider the function of each space. For example, in areas where specific tasks are performed, such as kitchens or reading nooks, task lighting is essential. Accent lighting can highlight artwork or architectural features, adding depth and interest to the design. Layering these different types of lighting‚Äîambient, task, and accent‚Äîcreates a well-balanced illumination that enhances the overall aesthetic, which [luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/)¬†often prioritize in their projects.

When choosing fixtures, the style should complement the room's decor while also considering energy efficiency. LED lights are a popular option due to their longevity and low energy consumption, making them preferable for eco-conscious homeowners. Furthermore, the color temperature of bulbs can drastically change a space; warm light provides coziness, while cool light fosters a more energetic environment. In addition, utilizing dimmers enables flexibility, allowing for adjustments that suit various occasions and moods. By thoughtfully incorporating these elements, one can achieve a harmonious lighting scheme that heightens the impact of the design while reflecting personal style.

# Maintaining Your Stylish Space 

https://preview.redd.it/ewh0eq4zp32f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8043abda032a2183d10f1d64c7d9f3bd705af8ec

Once you have designed a beautiful space, the next challenge is maintaining its stylish appearance over time. It is essential to keep your living environment looking fresh and inviting, which can be achieved through thoughtful upkeep and seasonal updates. Regular maintenance plays a critical role in preserving the aesthetic appeal of your home and can be seamlessly integrated into your routine.

One of the most effective strategies is to establish a cleaning schedule. Regular dusting, vacuuming, and thorough cleaning not only enhance the overall visual appeal but also help in retaining the integrity of your furnishings. This is particularly important in homes designed by¬†interior designers in Navi Mumbai, where specific materials and finishes may require special attention to maintain their beauty.

In addition to routine cleaning, consider updating your decor seasonally. This does not necessitate a complete overhaul, but rather includes subtle changes such as swapping throw pillows, changing curtains, or introducing seasonal foliage. These small modifications can create a vibrant atmosphere while keeping the design aligned with current trends. Engaging with the services of the¬†best interior designers in Navi Mumbai¬†can provide insights into how to seamlessly incorporate seasonal elements without compromising your overall design integrity.

Moreover, as your personal tastes evolve, so too can your space. Make it a priority to allow flexibility in your interior design choices. For instance, consider layering your decor and arranging interchangeable accessories that can be altered or replaced based on trend shifts or personal preference. The¬†top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai¬†suggest investing in key pieces that can pivot with changing styles, ensuring that your space remains contemporary and relatable over time.

Finally, staying informed about design trends and emerging styles will equip you with the necessary knowledge to refresh your space effectively. The input from¬†luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai¬†can be invaluable in these instances, as they often possess keen insights into the latest directions in interior design. By following these strategies, you can successfully maintain a stylish space that reflects your personality and adapts to the changing times.",1,1747818691.0,interiorvibes,0,1.0,False

A while back I've experienced an interesting encounter with Paymon which may have resulted in a conflict with another deity. I also work with Kali and previously I had read that in addition to the more positive qualities  Paymon may inflict psychological torment in certain indivoduals. One afternoon some 2 months ago I was meditating and while in a state of trance I've noticed a ""smell"" yet translated to a feeling, similar to that of rotten flesh emanating from the center of my chest.
Within seconds a presence manifested to my right side in the shape of a sphere. The sphere was attempting to probe me for previous memories of a person whom I've known and is now deceased. This person had previously shown less than positive behaviours towards me.
The presence in question was cycling between various variants of unpleasant behaviour followed by pulsing out every new variant. To me this felt like probing, an attempt to get in my head. A few seconds later I've called on one of Kali's facets which resulted in a violent conflict, with the entity in question disolving.  I'm currently reading Stellas Daemonum and I'm not certain if that was Paymon or if it was her, but coming from a darker side of things. I had not tried to summon her before.

I don't work with her, I do not have any altar dedicated to her. My tendency towards communion with any spirit is to summon directly without any altar.

Anyone who is more experienced with her and can offer advice/insights, is much appreciated.

I have absolutely no idea about dating. I'm 28 and was never really involved in the whole topic. In my youth, I mainly focused on training/sports. That didn‚Äôt leave much time for meeting people, and to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt interested either.

When I was 19, I had a short relationship that wasn‚Äôt really worth mentioning. Shortly after that, I had a brief connection with someone who told me, ‚ÄúSome days I only want you, and on other days I don‚Äôt.‚Äù Well, that was that. After that, I completely lost interest in women ‚Äî whether in a romantic or sexual way. My hobbies, sports, and work were enough for me.

Fast forward to when I was 27. I met a great woman through one of my hobbies. Unfortunately, it turned out she had a boyfriend. I ended up being a kind of affair ‚Äî looking back, I realize my hopes were more a cry for love or affection. We never slept together or kissed; that was a boundary I didn‚Äôt want to cross. After a short while, I ended things. It was a nice time, but in the end, it really drained me emotionally.

Now, I‚Äôve started to feel a genuine interest in getting to know someone.  
But dating apps aren‚Äôt my thing ‚Äî I don‚Äôt like the whole self-glorification aspect.  
Partying is also not really for me.

I prefer hiking, cycling, and having coffee in caf√©s (who would‚Äôve guessed?). I also train BJJ (a martial art) 2‚Äì3 times a week. I also tend to avoid alcohol.

So far, finding a date has been‚Ä¶ semi-successful ‚Äî or honestly, not successful at all.  
The few women I‚Äôve approached turned out to be in relationships.  
I‚Äôd say I approach 1‚Äì2 people if I get a good vibe from them. I don‚Äôt have a specific ‚Äútype.‚Äù

1krt5l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/1krt5l6/celebration/,Celebration?,"Hello folks!

At the moment, I am really struggling. Recovery is such a constant mental battle and it doesn't always feel like I am on the winning side of it. I feel exhausted, sore, bloated, emotionally all over the damn place, I'm scared I'm going to ruin my relationship over this, and the brainfog is real. I fell back into restriction yesterday and I'm trying not to feel discouraged by that.

So, I thought, maybe we can share some progress/wins here? Force some dopamine into our brains? I don't have a lot of people around me that know  what's going on, so it's be nice to celebrate some shit together. I don't know if this is the place for it but I'm hoping it is. üòä

Here are some things I've began tackling:
- Having lattes/cappuccinos! I love black coffee, but I was lying to myself when I pretended I didn't want them with milk as well. 
- I'm eating bread again. The fuck! Why did I ever stop. This shit is great.
- I'm having actual portions of pasta again. It's so tasty! I want to live on pasta now.
- I'm using oil when I'm cooking and buttering my bread. Who the heck was I lying to when I said I didn't like that.
- I baked cake and actually ate it too instead of offering it to everyone else around me and living vicariously through them, lol.
- I am having sweets and biscuits. I once said I didn't have a sweet tooth... Another ED lie.
- Reintroduced peanut butter. And now I want that on everything.
- I'm slowly letting go of needing everything to have the perfect macros (ortho brain, shut it!). 
- I'm eating bananas again. No halves, no cutting them out completely - I even have several a day sometimes. Woah! Hahaha.
- I haven't tracked anything in MFP for five weeks now!!!! There's still a bit of mental math occuring, but I try to stop it whenever I notice myself doing it.

That's a couple of wins. If anyone wants to share theirs, I'd love to cheer y'all on.

I currently work for one of the biggest coffee shop chains in the UK.

I have recently took 3 days of holidays out of the 4 days that I had left.
Upon coming back, I've noticed that I have only been paid for 1 of said days. The other 2 were simply reduced to 0hrs.

I have spoken to my manager as well as the area manager. Both checked everything and had absolutely no clue what is going on; the same happened to 2 of my work colleagues and apparently in other shops as well.

I have contacted the head office/payroll and was told that apparently they changed the holidays policy, so that if you work for 3 days during a given week and take holidays on top of it, you'll automatically won't get paid for it üò≥.

That sounds super illegal! Also, the payroll guy told me that I, and I quote: ""Should be happy that I was paid over my contracted hours"".

He also told me that they introduced such policy quite a few months' ago which was a straight lie, as I was taking holidays last month as well which went over 3 working days and I was paid for them like I should. The same for my colleagues.

Long story short I had enough holiday days left and should be paid for them. I wasn't and I don't have a clue what am I supposed to do.
My manager said that she'll be chasing this, but I feel like this whole situation is very illegal.

Should I chase this up with someone from outside of the company, as in citizens advice etc.?

I hope you're all weathering the storm re employment and USAID cuts. 

I have some advice to beg, but also it is just helping to yell into the void atm.

I‚Äôve spent the last 5 years working full-time in renewable energy access in international markets, but entirely in the private sector. I‚Äôve recently tried to make a full transition into the development sector - specifically into roles aligned with clean energy, climate adaptation, or economic development.

I‚Äôve committed 100% of my time to this shift: applying for 100s (seriously must be about 4-500 by now) of roles, and networking like mad reaching out to people on LinkedIn, having digital coffees etc. I‚Äôve been targeting DFAT-implementing partners like Palladium, Adam Smith International, DT Global, ABT Global, Tetra Tech, and NGOs in the climate/energy space.

Despite that, I‚Äôve found it incredibly hard to get traction. I really thought that I would be able to lever some door open, but I cant seem to get them to budge !  Its been even harder to find mentors in this space (dream would be someone who has jumped the the private-to-development gap).    
  
Most jobs seem to demand with donor-side or previous NGO experience, and I keep getting filtered out before I can explain what I bring. Going top of funnel, NGOs and donors seem equally walled off.

Does anyone have advice for:

* Non-traditional pathways into the development world?
* Programs that support private-sector transitions?

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness.

I want to make chocotorta and I started with the cream last night. I mixed almost equal parts cream cheese and dulce de ledge (600 and 800 grams respectively iirc) and the mixture seems a bit runny to me. I then added 350 mL of cream that I whipped and it kinda thickened the mixture but not enough imo. It's not totally liquidy, per se, but I'm afraid it won't thicken enough during the assembly and the pieces will fall off after cutting. Is there a way to fix it? Maybe add a bit more whipped cream? Gelatin? What if I assemble the dessert without soaking the biscuits in coffee in order for them to absorb the moisture from the cream?

I dont think there should be unhealthy boundaries so my bf and his female friends meet each other one on one and do things like coffee, lunch and so on and i am fine with it.
But actually we had a discussion about a situation happened short ago. 
One of his female friends, which i dont know yet,( but soon will meet) asked him to sleep in his flat for one night(no emergency, rather shorter work way)
He said that this could be something we dont like in our relationship, and told her no. 
Afterwards he told me about the situation. 
Everything fine. 
But she got angry about it, which i find weird.
After  that he confessed to me, that for him it would be no problem if a male friends sleeps in my apartment and that he can understand her. We got a fight about that.

For context: we have a ldr & close before that situation he almost cheated on me, but confessed it directly and regreted everything. We were still trying to build trust up again. So his female friend on his couch, without knowing her made me feel like overstepping my boundaries in this time.

Do you think its normal in general to have this boundary not to want opposite sex friends sleeping in your partners flat, or am i too jealous? I mean is it a healthy or either controlling boundary in your eyes?",3,1747817156.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

Sekhmet[Egypt] looked down to the child, she saw the small girl's hands holding an amulet that shimmered in the light.

‚ÄúHm, what's that?‚Äù

The lion goddess took a closer look, her brow raised. Hathor looked down at it and said, ‚ÄúI don't know, I found it in the sand.‚Äù

Sekhmet grabs the amulet and raises an eyebrow, ‚ÄúIt reminds me of the ring father had before you were born,‚Äù she begins to walk the halls, towards a throne room.

‚ÄúWhere are you going Sekhmet?‚Äù

The war goddess looks back, ‚ÄúGoing to father, it seems something from the primordials, maybe he'll have an answer.‚Äù

Hathor nodded and ran after her with her little legs making a small plapping sound when she ran after her sister. As they walked into a throne room it seemed to glow with the force of the sun, Hathor covering her eyes slightly. Servants surround a golden throne, and the Baboon-masked Thoth[Adviser to Ra] stands beside Ra[King of the Ennead].

‚ÄúSekhmet, Hathor, what is the reason for visiting lord Ra?‚Äù

Sekhmet stepped closer, staring at the two gods, ‚ÄúLittle Hathor found something in the sand.‚Äù

She held out her hand. Opening her fist, it showed a bright amulet glowing, to the entire room it almost radiated a presence similar to Ra himself. Thoth stepped forward, the words of the scrolls on his body glowed, feeding him information on them. He shook his head, a disappointed tone coming from his lips, ‚ÄúSorry but in the millions of years of existence, I don't have anything like that written down.‚Äù

Ra sluggishly raised his hand, ‚ÄúThe primordials weren't written down in history that is why.‚Äù

Ra stood up approaching the Sekhmet. He grabbed the amulet from her hand and held it up, examining it. 

‚ÄúThis is the remnants of Nut the sky, long ago when the primordials began to crumble under their power, in her final moments split her essence into me and then this amulet.‚Äù 

Thoth looked towards Ra, ‚ÄúNut split herself between you and that amulet Great King~?‚Äù

Ra shook his head, ‚ÄúNo it used to be between me and the amulet but it seems the essence has transferred to the one that seemingly has no mother.‚Äù

His broad fingers pointed to the small goddess, ‚ÄúThe one with the second part of Nut's essence is Hathor!‚Äù

Thoth's scrolls began to glow a brilliant blue, ‚ÄúSo Hathor goddess of dance is also the daughter of Ra and Nut? fascinating!‚Äù

Uzeme flew on her wolf overhead, ‚ÄúIt seems our beautiful ladies are still roaring to go!‚Äù

Hathor gripped her fists and began to gather wind around them. Anna could hear the wind howl as Hathor charged towards her, she leaped with grace ready to attack. Hathor's eyes widened yet she smiled, her feet slammed to the ground, a flex of muscles cracking the floor, ‚Äúyou're becoming repetitive in your attacks, Anna!‚Äù

Taking a deep breath she sent her fist upward. The ground in front of her cracked farther from her the crack grew larger. Anna's face became worried as she saw dust pick up, ‚Äúanother wind attack!‚Äù She jumped over believing she avoided it just for a large gash to appear on her left leg, going from her ankle to her thigh. 

She landed blood running down her leg, she gritted her teeth in pain, ‚ÄúHm, that was‚Ä¶beautiful!‚Äù

Anna‚Äôs eyes sparkled, ‚ÄúI have to stop expecting things from you don't I? After all, your attacks are like belly dancing, fluid and easy to change!‚Äù

Anna smiled as she ran in for another attack. Hathor countered by gathering wind around her foot and kicking it up in a sweeping air attack. Anna narrowly dodged it, noticing it was faster than her last attack and seemed to sparkle. Anna shook her head before getting distracted, she leaped out of the way of the attack swiftly

Hathor changed upwind across all her limbs, sending off. Anna tried her best to escape her attacks but not every attack could be dodged. The scent of her sweat and blood filled her nose, she was tired yet the goddess's attacks were becoming faster and harder to dodge each time, Anna wasn‚Äôt surprised by taking powerful hits, the speed and rapid fire of attacks forced her to never stand still. 

Anna dove forward her gaze meeting Hathor's, in that second she saw that Hathor's pupils were in the shapes of stars. ‚ÄúStars?!‚Äù

Hathor's eyes grew a bright blue with her pendant accompanying. She sent one last wind attack towards Anna, hitting her directly in the stomach, the force sending the ballerina back. Hathor stood still slouched over, her hair curtaining her face. Ragged breath, sparkling dust coming from her mouth. 

She slowly stood straight, her hair now flowing like it was unaffected By gravity. Star marks shone like the real things under her eyes, and in the dead center of her eyes, were five-pointed stars for pupils. She pulls up her fists as they begin to swirl with wind and stardust. 

Ra's eyes widened, ‚Äúthe avatar of Nut?‚Äù

‚ÄúA form she hasn't used since her fight with Sekhmet,‚Äù Thoth speaks his voice giving a bored sigh, ‚Äúand here I was hoping for Nut to reincarnate into Hathor's body.‚Äù

A vein nearly bursts on Ra's head, ‚ÄúThat human won't win if she keeps at the speed she is now, not one bit.‚Äù

Arrid winds blow across the dunes as a slightly younger Hathor adorned in a belly dancer outfit is sent crashing into the sand. Sekhmet, dyed head to toe in blood red, stood over the crater Hathor laid in, ‚ÄúOh look, even with a primordial goddess‚Äô power you're struggling!‚Äù

Sekhmet, sent by the gods to punish Egypt, went overboard and began slaughtering more than just Egypt, cities were red stains from above due to her rampage. In light of his mistake and not wanting to go down himself, Ra had sent Hathor to battle Sekhmet and subdue her.

Hathor looked at the lion-faced and balled her fist. Wind gathered beneath her feet as she shot up charging into Sekhmet like a rocket. Flying into the air the two goddesses soar across the sky like a comet. Sekhmet pushed Hathor away causing her to plummet to the ground.

Hathor saw the crater of sand glow red as she saw a glowing hooked Khopesh sword spinning towards her. She barely had time to block it before being struck in the back by two muscular arms, and before even touching the ground she was struck again. Hathor was blinded by the speed of the repeating attacks, she had seen the once blue sky turn red with the setting of the sun, her body treated like a rubber ball being bounced against a wall. 

Her vision was blocked with her own dried blood. She could finally feel the soft and cool sand. The tremors of Sekhmet's feet walking away were unmistakable.

‚ÄúHave I lost?‚Äù She thought to herself and that's all she could think before she felt a cooling sensation on her wounds, a gentle breeze washing over her. She could feel her body slowly recover as a face made itself clear in the sky to Hathor.

She saw a large hand reach down and touch her amulet, a bright glow alerting Sekhmet

She saw a bright glowing blue light, the silhouette of Hathor's flowing hair casting a shadow. Hathor stepped forward. Sekhmet smiled, her sharp predator teeth shining off the blue light. She saw as the light blinded out just to shine behind her. 

She looked down to see her own shadow grow larger as Hathor began to charge an attack. Before turning around Sekhmet was blasted with a star-like energy. The entire night glowed as it was a sunny day.

A man with grey slicked-back hair, wrinkles, and a doctor's coat drinks from a coffee mug. His voice gruff and aged, ‚ÄúAnna even in a perfectly healthy body seems to slip up now and again.‚Äù Professor Valerski[Russia]

He looks over to Yim, ‚ÄúIt's great you could come out for Ms. Pavlova's masterpiece of a dance.‚Äù

Yim just nodded and kept her eyes on Anna. 

Valerski sighed and shook his head, ‚Äúeven when facing the extinction of humanity, Anna seems to only be focused on dancing.‚Äù

Anna gritted her teeth as Hathor started to go even faster. Air slashes began to feel much more like speeding bullets. She couldn't risk stopping even for a second.

Hathor‚Äôs face was painted with an ear-to-ear smile. The once-on-the-ropes goddess had finally gained the upper hand. Hathor narrowed her eyes, seeing Anna leap gave her the idea for an attack.

Anna dodging another attack had jumped to dodge an attack sent off. Hathor smiled manically, slammed one foot into the ground, held back her hand, and with a final battle cry sent a slash charged with stardust. 

Anna's eyes widened as the glow became brighter, she couldn't move away. It was coming too quickly. She felt her life flash before her eyes but as the attack landed, her left leg was cleaved off. The force sent both her and her limb back. The audience could hear the thud of her landing, and the drop of her limb.

Yim, Valerski, and all of humanity stared at the ballerina on the floor, panting breath and blood leaking from her open wound. Ame-no-Uzume was overhead of the arena speaking into her microphone, ‚ÄúWell in any normal fight this would be the grounds for the god's victory, however, Ragnarok is a death match so until either Anna Pavlova or Hathor is deceased, the fight will not end!‚Äù

Hathor stared at the flying goddess and nodded. She began to walk towards the ballerina, standing tall above her. Anna's breath hitched as she felt a stinging because Hathor placing a stardust-charged foot on her chest.

Hathor slowly pressed her foot down in an attempt to crush Anna. The goddess‚Äô eyes widened, ‚ÄúSparks!?‚Äù

At that moment thunder rained down on the both of them. The audience witnessed a kiss of Stardust and lightning as both women were engulfed in the strike.

The lightning subsided and both women were lying on the ground, bodies smoking. Anna's eyes burst open and looked around frantically, she saw her severed leg and with all of her might and will began to crawl towards it. The lightning strike had left electrical scars on his body, and her once white outfit once a white swan was turned dark like a black swan. 

Once she reached her leg she saw how large the wings on the shoes got. Hnoss‚Äô face turned to a look of shock, ‚Äúhow the hell is she still able to move!‚Äù

Hnoss' shocked face still smiled, a confident tone of voice, ‚ÄúShe can still move if she just finds a way to stand,‚Äù Hnoss grits her teeth watching Anna touch her severed leg, ‚ÄúHumanity can win the first round!‚Äù

Anna's ragged breath became worse as with all her frailness she pulled the shoe off of the leg. Tossing the leg aside Anna began to form ice from the remaining bleeding flesh of her left leg. The audience could hear the cracking of the ice growing, and Anna could feel the immense cold caused by the ice. 

Stammering up with the prosthetic made of ice, she looked over to Hathor who began to stand up. She placed the shoe on the newly formed leg. 

Hathor's ears were ringing, her head aching, and her knees shaking. Her eyes focused on Anna's form, the jagged yet smooth ice leg taking her attention. 

‚ÄúIs something the matter, human?‚Äù She snickers, ‚Äúgetting cold feet?‚Äù

Anna's eyes crackled with once sparks now full bolts of electricity. In an instant, the women charged towards each other. Lightning crackled as Anna's feet raced forward, her eyes could see the glowing beauty of Hathor. 

The goddess balled her fist up, a 5-point star appeared over the knuckles,  a shield and a weapon. Anna raised her leg ready to deal a devastating kick. At the point of collision, the wind blew and erupted from the attacks touching.

The star shield shattered sending a burst of energy outwards, in lightning and stardust. Both women slid back from the force yet Both were still standing.

Smoking clouded the floor of the arena as raindrops were making a pittering sound as they landed on the women's bodies.

Anna's face showed a fire in her soul excited for what was to come. Hathor cracked her knuckles and shook her head. Asclepius saw the two from the VIP section for the gods, his hand on his chin, examining the fighters‚Äô conditions.

‚ÄúBased on their injuries and the general form of their bodies, it's only a matter of minutes before one of them dies.‚Äù 

He looked towards Mother Mary sitting in her section, thinking to himself ‚ÄúSeems like I'm not the only one who knows it, it's odd, Mother Mary seems to stay neutral, she couldn't be planning something right?‚Äù

Asclepius shook his head and continued to think, ‚ÄúGreat now I'm thinking like a conspiracy nut,‚Äù Asclepius pointed to Hathor, ‚Äúit seems likely with her damage, she'll die first.‚Äù

Hathor held her hands up forming two large five-pointed stars, wind swirling around them. Her thoughts didn't run towards her fellow Ennead gods, but her opponent.

‚ÄúEven if I die, I'll die gazing upon a beautiful face.‚Äù

Anna's breath was running from her mouth, she didn't show it but using her new ice leg to move was a pain, all she could do was think to herself to take her mind off the pain, ‚ÄúLittle R√≥ta, thank you for carrying me through this fight, and Yim, my number one fan, thank you for cheering me on all this time.‚Äù

She slammed her legs down, and held her hands up entering the Relev√© ballet pose, ‚ÄúLet's take this final dance –ì–æ–ª—É–±—á–∏–∫!‚Äù

This is my home, and I‚Äôve been living here with my family for over five years. We‚Äôve all just been so busy that we never really got around to decorating or designing it properly. But now, we‚Äôre finally thinking of giving it a makeover. We‚Äôre working with a budge and it doesn‚Äôt have to be super cheap, but we want to keep it practical. I really want to bring some colour and life into this space.

Here‚Äôs the thing, the sofa was supposed to be a bright, cheerful piece, but the guy who made it completely messed it up. I don‚Äôt even know what happened, it looks like a sad, dirty potato sack now. This happened during COVID, and we didn‚Äôt have the energy or time to fight about it, so we just settled. It‚Äôs been three years, and now I just want to make it work somehow. I don‚Äôt think I can bleach it or do anything drastic, so I need to design around it and brighten up the space with other elements.

Right now, everything just looks so dull and lifeless.

I‚Äôm leaning toward using jewel tones like deep greens and rich reds, but I also want the living room to feel bright, open, and spacious. Also, I live in a very dusty area, so I need everything to be easy to clean and maintain. Please don‚Äôt suggest any open decor or anything high-maintenance, I just don‚Äôt have the time for it.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning so far:

üëâüèΩ I want to add a rectangular painting above the sofa (the AC is going to be fitted right above that).
üëâüèΩ In the dining area, there‚Äôs a glass cupboard and I want to decorate the space above it with a collage of different paintings, mirrors, maybe some Indian art.
üëâüèΩ I cannot add a rug because my mom hates them. They collect dust, are hard to clean, and it‚Äôs just not practical, especially since we eat in the living room even though we have a dining table.
üëâüèΩ I need to get proper curtains (something that adds to the space), a nice coffee table, wall art, and any other ideas you think would make the place look warmer, brighter, and more ‚Äúdone.‚Äù

My style is mostly mid-century modern with Indian influences. I love Indian art and want to include that in a tasteful way. I hate clutter and high-maintenance stuff. 

I live in India, so if you have any recommendations from Amazon or other Indian sites that are budget-friendly, I‚Äôd really appreciate the links too.

Please help me. I really want to make this space feel happy and alive again.

I (f23) have been with my partner (m27) for more than 3 years now. We have been through a lot together. I won't get into everything, but the main reason I am posting this is because of the biggest strain on our relationship, and my indecision on how to move forward.

Early last year, my partner cheated on me emotionally (I have no proof of physical cheating, but at this point my trust in him is so low that I've considered it.) I only know this because one night last fall, I went through his phone and found texts between him and a coworker (*of course* the one he told me not to worry about!) and I discovered he went on a 5 hour coffee date with her.

A couple months later, I went through his phone again, and found texts I hadn't seen before between him and his sister, talking about how much he liked this coworker, and hyped her up. All the while shit talking me with his sister for an hour. His defense on this is that he was drunk. He said some of the most heinous things I've ever heard about myself. 

His reason for cheating is that I was jobless for 2 years, with him supporting us both (most of which was spent living in my parents' house paying relatively cheap rent and getting help and forgiveness from them when needed.)

I won't justify my lack of work, it was extensive. I was dealing with a lot of chronic pain and severe depression at the time. Not an excuse, but a factor.

It's been months, and a few more phone checks (all of which with his permission following the first event, with him claiming he ""has nothing to hide, so I'm welcome to look"") and there have been a couple more incidents with different girls, all virtual. 

My trust is gone. I am very stuck and unsure of what to do. We live together in my parents house and neither of us are in a good place financially to break up. It would be very complicated and messy. We still have a lot of good times. I love him, and I'm also so hurt by his actions. I have no idea what to do. What do I do? I hate being in this ""I don't know"" place.

And, yes, I know going through phones is unhealthy. The first time I did, I did it because of a gut feeling that wouldn't go away, and I ended up being *so* right. Every time after that was with his consent. All he asked is that I did it while he was asleep, so he wasn't ""anxiously watching"" (like okay why are you anxious if you have ""nothing to hide"" ???)",1,1747816869.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1krslw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1krslw5/difficulty_dialing_in_cafec_abaca/,Difficulty dialing in Cafec Abaca,"Hi all

Using a V60 02. Started with tabbed Hario papers, and enjoyed a recipe with 2-3x coffee weight to bloom with swirl, then one small pour (2-3x coffee weight) at 45-60s with swirl, and finally a fast flow, aggressive pour at 1:15 to target weight. Good cups but sometimes lacked oomph. Felt limited by grind size and agitation as the brews would stall at any finer or any more pours.

Got Cafec Abaca papers 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôm struggling to dial in. To start with, going 10 clicks finer on the K6 - a bit finer and it stalls. But drawdown stays really fast with my Hario tabbed pour structure so doing a 4-5 pour recipe like the 4:6 with limited bypass and no swirling. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck between either too much extraction and muted flavours, or too fast drawdown and hollow cup. Haven‚Äôt really been able to dial this in.

Brew temp, water, dose have all stayed the same. Any thoughts?",2,1747815520.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1krsjsn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krsjsn,USA alternative to Alpro Kokos ohne Zucker (no sugar coconut drink),"Hi guys! 
I'm currently on vacation in Germany and found this mill alternative which has an amazing coconut flavor for only 14 cals per 100ml (brings it to about 35 cals per cup /240ml).

Does anyone know if we have a comparable product in the US (I'm in the Midwest area usually)? 

I'm already dreading leaving this behind as it gives great flavor to coffee/oatmeal/cereal with all the fat coconut usually brings with it... 

Thanks in advance! ",1,1747815256.0,Volumeeating,1,0.67,False
