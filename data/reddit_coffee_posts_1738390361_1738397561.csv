One of the things I‚Äôve been doing is meeting interested strangers for tea and conversation. I am not a coffee drinker. I‚Äôm already aware of the major tea houses like Miro, Panama Hotel, Tea Republik, etc.

I have found a couple of cafes that have good tea and are happy to have you stay for an hour or so (it‚Äôs generally been running 90 minutes) provided you are paying your way by purchasing beverages and pastry or food. I‚Äôd like to have more such places in my rotation.

I‚Äòm looking for places that are quiet enough to hold a good conversation, but not so quiet that people who are there to work, etc. would find that annoying. I would love to get some recommendations. I‚Äòm in central/core Seattle but could go 20-30 minutes drive time in any direction.  Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.

Im 32 F, 164cm, previous weight  in Dec 2024 was 64.5kg, CW, 61.5kg. I've been following the low carb diet for about 1 month so far. Started meal prepping high fiber veggies like cauliflower + broccoli and lean meat like chicken breasts etc for 2 meals per day, with a routine of 3 eggs as breakfast in the morning, eating the same unchanged menu for 3/+weeks, occasionally supplementing with a bottle of 30g of protein shake throughout the day, drinking copious amount of black coffee on a daily basis. 

Initially started this journey of eliminating all carbs from my diet due to a health scare in which i had a very high diabetic-range postprandial blood glucose level( 11mmol/L)  sometime in November last year ( i went through a period of financial constraints and only ate carbs(noodles) with sauces and no protein or fiber to save money).

I've been on a journey to reverse my impaired glucose tolerance so far by losing  some excess weight and eliminating carbs, while trying to keep my food under a budget per month. This led me into more and more research into keto and Atkins diet. 

Out of curiosity, I bought a blood ketone meter and took some 2 readings while im on low carb/ high protein diet. It shows 1.1 and 1.4mmol/L respectively. I recalled a day of feeling under the weather, headache and fatigue but not sure it these are considered keto flu symptoms or is it just because i delayed caffeine til the evening on that particular day. 

Am I in ketosis? Even when my diet is primarily more focused on high protein instead of high fat. I dont feel particularly energetic, and still crave food sometimes, but my fatigue from when i had high blood sugar was reduced. I've checked myfitnesspal and my diet is about 30-40%: fat: and another 30-40% protein (hard to hit protein targets on a budget) with the rest coming from carb sources in veggies primarily. Will gluconeogenesis hamper my efforts in keeping my blood glucose spikes less in the long run? Do I need to reduce my veggies intake to reduce the carb content for keto to work?

TLDR:  
When anticipating a meal, coffee, or meeting your partner, dopamine increases approximately 50% above baseline. Sexual activity doubles this baseline, representing a 100% increase ‚Äì a reflection of its evolutionary importance for species continuation.

Nicotine consumption pushes dopamine levels 150% higher than baseline. However, the most dramatic increases come from cocaine and amphetamine use, which spike dopamine release a thousand-fold within ten seconds of consumption. What‚Äôs particularly noteworthy is that merely thinking about these activities can trigger dopamine releases comparable to actual consumption, though the intensity varies based on the stimulus and individual circumstances.

Modern digital stimuli present their own challenges. Video games, especially those featuring rapid updates and novel experiences, can trigger dopamine releases somewhere between nicotine and cocaine levels.

Social media presents an interesting case study ‚Äì initial usage may trigger high dopamine release, but despite diminishing returns, addictive patterns often persist.

1if1czl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeatherCoxRichardson/comments/1if1czl/january_31_2025/,"January 31, 2025","On February 1, 1862, in the early days of the Civil War, the¬†*Atlantic Monthly*¬†published Julia Ward Howe's ""Battle Hymn of the Republic,‚Äù summing up the cause of freedom for which the United States troops would soon be fighting. ‚ÄúMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,‚Äù it began.

‚ÄúHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:

His truth is marching on.‚Äù

Howe had written the poem on a visit to Washington, D.C., with her husband. Approaching the city, she had reflected sadly that there was little she could do for the United States. She couldn‚Äôt send her menfolk to war: her husband was too old to fight, her sons too young. And with a toddler, she didn‚Äôt even have enough time to volunteer to pack stores for the field hospitals. ‚ÄúI thought of the women of my acquaintance whose sons or husbands were fighting our great battle; the women themselves serving in the hospitals, or busying themselves with the work of the Sanitary Commission,‚Äù she recalled, and worried there was nothing she could give to the cause.

One day she, her husband, and friends, toured the troop encampments surrounding the city. To amuse themselves on the way back to the hotel, they sang a song popular with the troops as they marched. It ended: ‚ÄúJohn Brown‚Äôs body lies a-mouldering in the grave; his soul is marching on.‚Äù A friend challenged Howe to write more uplifting words for the soldiers‚Äô song.

That night, Howe slept soundly. She woke before dawn and, lying in bed, began thinking about the tune she had heard the day before. She recalled: ""\[A\]s I lay waiting for the dawn, the long lines of the desired poem began to twine themselves in my mind.... With a sudden effort, I sprang out of bed, and found in the dimness an old stump of a pen‚Ä¶. I scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper.""

Howe's hymn captured the tension of Washington, D.C., during the war, and the soldiers‚Äô camps strung in circles around the city to keep invaders from the U.S. Capitol.

‚ÄúI have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps,

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:

His day is marching on.‚Äù

Howe‚Äôs Battle Hymn of the Republic went on to define the Civil War as a holy war for human freedom:

‚ÄúIn the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.

As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,

While God is marching on.‚Äù

The Battle Hymn became the anthem of the Union during the Civil War, and exactly three years after it appeared in the¬†*Atlantic Monthly*, on February 1, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Joint Resolution of Congress passing the Thirteenth Amendment and sending it off to the states for ratification. The amendment provided that ""\[n\]either slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" It gave Congress power to enforce that amendment. This was the first amendment that gave power to the federal government rather than taking it away.

When the measure had passed the House the day before, the lawmakers and spectators had gone wild. ‚ÄúThe members on the floor huzzaed in chorus with deafening and equally emphatic cheers of the throng in the galleries,‚Äù the¬†*New York Times*¬†reported. ‚ÄúThe ladies in the dense assemblage waved their handkerchiefs, and again and again the applause was repeated, intermingled with clapping of hands and exclamations of ‚ÄòHurrah for freedom,‚Äô ‚ÄòGlory enough for one day,‚Äô &c. The audience were wildly excited, and the friends of the measure were jubilant.‚Äù Indiana congressman George Julian later recalled, ‚ÄúIt seemed to me I had been born into a new life, and that the world was overflowing with beauty and joy, while I was inexpressibly thankful for the privilege of recording my name on so glorious a page of the nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù

But the hopes of that moment had crumbled within a decade. Almost a century later, students from Bennett College, a women‚Äôs college in Greensboro, North Carolina, set out to bring them back to life. They organized to protest the F.W. Woolworth Company‚Äôs willingness to sell products to Black people but refusal to serve them food. On February 1, 1960, their male colleagues from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University sat down on stools at Woolworth‚Äôs department store lunch counter in Greensboro. David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell A. Blair Jr., and Joseph McNeil were first-year students who wanted to find a way to combat the segregation under which Black Americans had lived since the 1880s.

So the men forced the issue by sitting down and ordering coffee and doughnuts. They sat quietly as the white waitress refused to serve them and the store manager ignored them. They came back the next day with a larger group. This time, television cameras covered the story. By February 3 there were 60 men and women sitting. By February 5 there were 50 white male counterprotesters.

By March the sit-in movement had spread across the South, to bus routes, museums, art galleries, and swimming pools. In July, after profits had dropped dramatically, the store manager of the Greensboro Woolworth‚Äôs asked four Black employees to put on street clothes and order food at the counter. They did, and they were served. Desegregation in public spaces had begun.

In 1976, President Gerald Ford officially recognized February 1 as the first day of Black History Month, asking the public to ‚Äúseize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.‚Äù

On February 1, 2023, Tyre Nichols‚Äôs family laid their 29-year-old son to rest in Memphis, Tennessee. He was so severely beaten by police officers on January 7, allegedly for a traffic violation, that he died three days later.

In 2025 the U.S. government under President Donald Trump has revoked a 60-year-old executive order that protected equal opportunity in employment and has called for an end to all diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. This February 1, neither the Pentagon nor the State Department will recognize Black History Month.

Mine eyes have seen the glory.

Last year I was recommended to visit a beach town in Brazil that‚Äôs slowly becoming a hotspot for digital nomads as there‚Äôs surfing, chill vibes and of course, lots of music. So I wanted to share what I‚Äôve learned from working & staying in Pipa for a month.

For context, I‚Äôm a digital nomad for 10 years: former web designer but now YouTuber about our lifestyle.

# Pros:

**Beach.** Of course the main attraction is the beach options, starting with a nice open one in downtown but several others to explore around the area. Madeiro beach is great of surfing and you can sometimes possibly find dolphins, but even more possible if you visit the Dolphins Bay that‚Äôs next door.

**Sports.** This is a great place to work while getting fit and brazilian culture is a lot about being sporty. There‚Äôs so much offer of outdoor activities, starting with great surfing but also beach tennis (which is a game that I just learnt here), padel, crossfit and even capoeira (brazilian martial art).

**Safety.** The benefit of a being small beach town, is that people are friendly and it feels very safe to walk around at any time of the day. I even lost my wallet taking the bus, and the drivers helped me found it a few days later.

**Food.** I was actually surprised of how good the options of food is here. Besides delicious local cuisine like A√ßai, Feiojada, Tapioca, Pao de Queijo and more, there‚Äôs a big Argentinean community here so you get can great empanadas, steaks, pizzas and more.

# Cons:

**Heat.** It can get very hot, most the time of the year, and while you can book a place with air conditioner, most of the coffee shop don‚Äôt have that luxury so you‚Äôll be sweating a lot all day long.

**Lack of coworking spaces.** As it‚Äôs still not known, there‚Äôs not really good places to spend long day working. It‚Äôs mostly coffee shops, home working or gathering with friends in places like Mirante do Pipa where they accommodate tables for the nomads.

**City infrastructure.** While the beach town is great, is still an undeveloped place (which can be good as construction here is limited because of nature preserve). Uber barely works and you‚Äôll move mostly with buses, and renting scooter is non-existent here. There‚Äôs just small supermarkets.

  
\-

After a month living in Pipa, Brazil, I‚Äôd truly say it‚Äôs a hidden gem for digital nomads, especially if you are into playing sports and you truly enjoy the beach lifestyle. It‚Äôs small enough to feel safe, but also big enough that takes a while to explore all the restaurants and shops around.

And of course, the best is that you get to experience the Brazilian culture in its fullest with the music, food, capoeira and its happy people.

I actually made a full documentary on [my YouTube channel where I explain everything about Pipa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PReQBoM264M), and also shared a cost of living at the end.

I also think this can be a good prompt for anyone to use.**

""Wait.. what do you mean?"" Sakura asked as she siped her green tea. Her eyes flickerd over the surroundings nervously.

The coffee shop they had chosen was popular with Civilians and Shinobi. She didn't think people could hear her over the chatter and the clinking of cups.

But she still felt nervous... especially hearing what her idiot teammate was saying!

""I mean,"" Naruto said.. staring at the coffee cup, not looking at either of his teammates. ""I'm just like Gaara,""

Both Sasuke and Sakura looked at each other sceptically. 

""I-i am the container of the Ky≈´bi... It's why Kakashi-sensei was assigned to me, "" he said, sipping his coffee.

The table was silent... 

Then Sakura heatedly glared at her idiot of a teammate.

""Dammit, Naruto, this isn't funny! We nearly got into a fight with that Sand Psycho you can't jo‚Äî""

""I'm not joking, Sakura."" 

""Ok, *sure* you're holding that *Demon Fox.*"" she took a sip of her tea as she looked at Naruto with a glare. ""Is it in your jacket pocket? Under your shoe? Or mabe in your ass-?"" 

""The same way Sasuke could pull a Giant Shuriken out of a piece of paper,"" Naruto answered bitterly. Before he slowly pulled out a scroll and laid it on the table. Unfurling it to show  black calligraphy right in the centre.

""With a seal."" Sasuke said.. his eyes wide. Naruto looked at his other team mate with a solemn expression before nodding.

""Did you know what happened on October tenth? The day i was born?""

There was a small silence.. before Sakura spoke. Her eyes now wide aswell

""The K-Ky≈´bi attack,"" Sakura answered, visibly shaken.

Naruto nodded. Still unable to look at his teammates in the eyes. ""So, when the Fourth couldn't kill it, he had to figure out another way to save everyone‚Äî""

""‚Ä¶So he put it inside of someone,"" Sasuke finished, looking at Naruto like he finally figured something out.

""Oh my god,"" Sakura said, looking at Naruto with understanding.. and pity 

That explains so much‚Ä¶ ""Why our parents didn't like you, why the shop keepers always kicked you out"" she said, her brain running fast as memories came flooding in.

""‚Ä¶ and why‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶ were always told to stay away from you."" Sakura finished.. her voice sounded pained, as if remembering what she did was shameful.

""Yeah... its also why I couldn't do certain Jutsu's but passed the Graduation test"" he said as he reached into his jacket and pulled out a book.

Well, more of a collection of notes and papers binded together to form a small book.

""This... this belonged to my mother."" He said as he looked at the two. ""The person who contained the Ky≈´bi before me, "" he said in a whisper.

Both Sakura's and Sasuke's eyes widen as they look at the book.

""Your mother was like you?"" Sasuke asked.

""Yeah.. you can say it's like a family *burden*,"" Naruto said with a bitter smile as he opened the book and showed what's inside.

Each pages contain hand written accounts and diagrams, each paper was different. Some had burn marks, and some had stains.. all contained the same rough handwriting.

Both Sakura and Sasuke could see a warm smile on Naruto's face as he saw the pages.. and while Sakura couldn't understand why, Sasuke could. 

He felt the same whenever he saw his mother's notes on cooking stuck to a fridge or book.

""My mother was like me, she wasn't able to do regular Jutsu's because of the Ky≈´bi.. so she was what you call a reserve member. Fitting into a team that needs her for a mission, "" he said 

""And whatever she learned.. she wrote it down here, "" he said, pointing at the book

""But.. what do you mean that the Fox is the reason she couldn't do Jutsu's?"" Sakura asked as she looked over the pages.

The page she was on talked about Chakra and its Nature. Specifically, it talks about how internally molded chakra exhibits stable elemental affinity, while externally molded chakra shows variability influenced by ambient energies and intent.

'This... this was Naruto's mom?' She thought surprised. It sounded so.. scientific.

Naruto was silent for a few minutes.. before he took a deep breath and looked at them.

""When you have a Bijuu sealed in you.. you become a Jinch≈´riki"" he started, giving both of them his utmost attention.

His hands flick over the book untill he reaches a page. The page contains a list of names and bullet points under each.

""When they are sealed in you.. they 'change' you a bit. Stronger senses, a chakra nature, even the ability to talk to bugs, "" he said as he pointed to each Bijuu and the name of the then Jinch≈´riki and their ability.

""And what does the Ky≈´bi give you?"" Sasuke asked.

""He doesn't give me anything.. he limits me."" Naruto said angrily

""I can only learn nine Jutsu's, no more... i can't learn a hundred fire techniques or any of the cool stuff you can do, Sasuke. I get nine only, "" he said.

Both Sasuke and Sakura looked shocked at that.. only nine? Naruto is capped at and can't grow past a level most Chunin are?

""The only upside is that I am a master in the nine I do learn,"" he said with a sigh.

"" 'Master' what do you mean?"" Sakura raised an eyebrow and asked.

""It means that right now, I am the best when it comes to Transformation and Shadow Clones in the Village,"" he said in a whisper.

""That's why,"" Sasuke said, eyes wide as he looked at the idiot as if he had a second head.

""Why I can do a hundred clones and can transform into a Rock or Animal while you can do a few clones and can't transform into either? Yeah, "" Naruto said, looking almost apologetic.

""Wait.. so that's how you managed to restrain that Bandit? You used the transformation techniques to actually be an Octopus?"" Sakura asked, shocked. She thought it was a Genjutsu.

""Yeah.. if I can imagine it. I can become it... so long as I maintain the transformation, and I *know* how the transformaed shape operates, "" he said, taking a gulp from his coffee

""Holy shit,"" Sakura said in awe.

And Naruto can't help but laugh.

""It's not that impressive.. I'm the container of the most powerful beast in the world, one that can crush mountains and burn forests down.. and I can't learn Substitution Jutsu or the regular Clone jutsu for the fear of it locking me out of more useful Jutsu's""

""So much for being an all-powerful demon,"" he grumbled.

""You are not a demon,"" Sasuke said. Startling both Naruto and Sakura as he looked into Naruto's eyes.

""You are Naruto Uzumaki, my teammate.. nothing more. Anyone who thinks you are a monster or some demon are fucking idiots"" he said, and Naruto knew.. Sasuke ment every word.

There were a few moments of silence before Naruto's face broke into a grin.

""I wish more people thought like that,"" he said with a boyish smirk, were those tears prickling at the edges of his eyes?

Sakura smirked mischievously as she looked at her Idiot of a Team mate ""Nah, you can't be the Ky≈´bi. You're too much of a knucklehead""

""Oi, come one Sakura. Don't tease me that much"" he said with a smile.

But then Sasuke got a serious look on his face.  As he then looked at Naruto.

""Wait.. when you said you are like Gaara.. do you mean he is also like you.. a Jinch≈´riki?"" He asked quietly 

Naruto nods sadly, and explains what he knows to his team mates... making sure they understand how dangerous Gaara truly is.

- 2 eggs 1/3 cup low fat cottage cheese 1 piece of whole-wheat sourdough 
- 17g greek yogurt no sugar strawberries sprinkle of flax hemp cinnamon 
- salmon broccoli 1 cup frozen white rice 

I use a spray for oil instead of a bottle, I usually have a coffee with 3 ingredient almond milk and I make 150 ml immunity shots (acv coconut water tumeric ginger lemon salt pepper 1 orange). I‚Äôll have spearmint and dandelion tea usually plain or with a tiny amount of honey.

(Part 1),"When I first started doing freelance journalism Terry and I agreed that if anything interesting ever happened to him I got to report it first. 

‚ÄúEric, if I kick the can in a fantastic way, I‚Äôll put it in my will that if anyone reports on it before you that my family will sue their ass. ‚Äù I remember him saying. (I doubt that‚Äôll hold up in court though, but it's the thought that counts.) 

So when the Cargo ship he worked on was discovered deserted I knew it was time to take him up on his promise.

When the rescue team let it slip that they discovered a detailed journal in his bunk I did what any self respecting journalist would do and harassed them and the coast guard for several months until I finally got my hands on a copy. 

Terry was a great friend, even though after college we drifted apart I will always love him and cherish our time together. When I heard he‚Äôd started going to school to become a cargo ship deck officer I wasn‚Äôt overly surprised, he was always the kid in class coming in every month with a different broken bone and a hell of a story. 

He had talked about his love for travel and adventure so much it only seemed like the perfect fit for him. I remember him telling me that all he wants in life is to be remembered, moralized in some way even if it is just in the memory of his loved ones. 

In the spirit of him being remembered I have transcribed the entirety of his journal below. I not only do this to honor my friend, but because if what he describes in this journal is true? the world needs to know. 


Feb 22nd, 2024.
 
    They stuck the newbie with the early morning and midnight rotation. I can‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt warn me when I was doing my practicum with APM. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing that shit, get the rookie to do it‚Äù Carlos told the pilot Benjamin.

What Carlos lacks in subtlety he makes up for in knowledge and work ethic. He had been used to AB life for 2 decades. No one knows his age, I guessed mid 50s but everytime someone asks he gives a different answer, when I asked he told me he was 15.

‚ÄúNot my problem, talk to the new Master, I‚Äôm sure hearing your bitching is the first impression he needs.‚Äù Benjamin responded.

Ben was a lanky white dude that wouldn‚Äôt look out of place drinking gluten free beer at an indie rock concert. He‚Äôs the closest to me in age, only being 2 years older than me, and honestly even though he looks kinda like a douche I he‚Äôs one of the better guys to talk to.

‚ÄúHave any of you guys met the new master yet?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Carlos responded, pouring his second coffee of the day. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even know his name, they don‚Äôt tell us shit.‚Äù Ben added clicking the mouse on the control panel. 

There‚Äôs about 20 guys on staff on the ship, most of them old timers like Carlos, only one rookie besides me. Sam, he graduated the same year I did and from all I could gather in the 30 second conversation we had in line at the mess hall isn‚Äôt much for talking. 

Not rude by any means, just keeps to himself. I think he chose this job to get away from people, can‚Äôt blame him. I guess we all have our specific reasons for being here. 

After a while more of chatting shit and dodging Carlos‚Äôs putrid smelling hug of gratitude after I agreed to switch to the night watch for him. The new master walked in. Of course everyone is new to me but when he walked in I felt oddly better, like I wasn‚Äôt the odd man out anymore and that the old timers and I had something we could both agree on. That being the new master looked like a complete ass. 

He was a tall skinny guy with oddly broad shoulders, his buzz cut seemingly keeping his head from exploding from its own inflated sense of self. 

He wore a spotless white pilots jacket with long black trousers and carried his pilot's hat in his hand. 

Ben and Carlos immediately shot each other looks, waiting for the other person to break out into laughter. The master was dressed like he had just come from a stock photo shoot and had never even seen a cargo ship before. 

‚ÄúGentleman, my name is Captain James Pettersson. It‚Äôs an honor to pilot this fine vessel.‚Äù He said with his perfect posture revealing his previous military experience.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually my job.‚Äù Ben said, easing his hand awkwardly. 

‚ÄúWell of course!‚Äù Captain James‚Äî no that‚Äôs too weird I‚Äôm just gonna call him James‚Äî said making his way over to the front of the bridge. 

Feeling the awkward silence grew heavier than the ship I decided I needed to leave. 

‚ÄúWell I better go do my rounds.‚Äù I said to no one‚Äôs reaction, Carlos was still holding back laughter as he finished up his watch log notes. 

Opening the metal sliding door on the starboard side of the bridge I immediately realized we may be in port for quite some time. A thick fog had descended on the entire port, I couldn‚Äôt even see the 40 foot containers in the shipping yard just over the railing. 

The air was crisp and chilly with the never ending sounds of New York posing as an infinite soundtrack to our work. 

Walking from line to line checking the auto-tension is still working properly (it almost always is) I got an odd feeling of dread. 

It was probably just new job anxieties not helped with the ere setting surrounding me. Walking through the deck I realized just how thick the fog actually was, the only visible objects in my line of sight were the railing around the bow of the ship leading to white fog so thick it looked more like a blank piece of paper than one of the busiest ports in the country. 

Finishing my round I reported to the bridge, Carlos was gone, Ben was still at his post drawing busy looking doodles on a piece of paper. James was standing straight with his hands clasped behind his back and staring out at the white cloud surrounding our ship.

‚ÄúHoping the fog clears sooner rather than later.‚Äù He said trying to cut through the silence that fell on the bridge since his arrival.

‚ÄúA vessel like this yearns for the sea‚Äù James adds. 

Ben dropped his head in his hands in exhaustion. 


Feb 24th, 2024.

Holy shit was I right that we weren‚Äôt leaving port for a while, I just got off assisting with departure. 

James was on the verge of canceling the whole departure until the fog finally began to lift at around 1 pm today.

When I got there Carlos was ranting to Sam who had a look of either fear or annoyance in his eyes. I didn‚Äôt hear much of what he said but something about him was ‚Äúa fine woman waiting for me in Manhattan.‚Äù And that he wanted the departure would just get cancelled already.

When I saw the fog lifted, it lifted just enough for the crane operators to actually see where they were loading the crates onto the cargo line, the fog was still present throughout departure. 

The white mist in the distance seemingly rendered the beautiful New York City skyline as we went for a visual treat for our tired eyes.

Now just the simple 15 day trek to Dublin!

Feb 27th, 2024.

Something is wrong with Sam. His watch notes are getting shorter and shorter. He has been missing random information in the last three entries. First he missed the hatch status, then he didn‚Äôt mention if there was any discharge in the VCP. 

Stuff that's easy to forget when we first start out, but when I tried to mention it to him in the mess hall today he just didn‚Äôt say anything, just sitting there staring at me with his blank expression. I‚Äôm not sure why but the look he gave me freaked me out. He just looked at me like I was speaking an alien language and like he was trying to kill me with his eyes. 

Safe to say, I‚Äôm staying the fuck away from that weirdo until he hit Ireland. 


March 9th, 2024. 

Sorry for the lack of entries, it‚Äôs hard thinking of interesting ways to write the same day over and over. 

Big development though‚Ä¶ We hit Dublin! 

James is still the Hollywood trope equivalent of a ship captain. The other day I saw him leaning over the radar with his head in his hands in utter confusion. As soon as he noticed me there he sprang up like a soldier at attention. 

I never saw exactly what he was looking at but it clearly confused him. We were in the middle of the atlantic, the ocean can have odd effects on people, maybe he was just looking for a path between other ships. 

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù I asked

‚ÄúOf course, She‚Äôs running like a dream!‚Äù he said with an air of delusional confidence. 

Good enough for me. Weirdo.

Oh also can‚Äôt forget Sam, his watch notes are still missing shit and honestly I‚Äôm too scared to call him on it, he definitely seems the type to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù push you overboard when you're going for a smoke. 

Anyway this port is pretty busy so we are probably gonna be here a while once we dock. I'm gonna go do some sight seeing!


March 11th, 2024. 

Gotta love 48 hours stuck in port. 

At least James let us off to go around the town, he even gave us a curfew of 1 AM. Maybe he‚Äôs not so bad after all. 

He even came out with us to the bar last night. Sam even came out, which is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. As per usual he kept to himself and barely said a word, I think he‚Äôs getting the can as soon as we get back to NYC. 

As soon as James saw him come out of his uber in front of the bar it looked like he just saw someone get shot, there was an awkward tension between them all night. 

After about an hour of chatting shit and drinking far too much Guiness I noticed both Sam and James were no longer sitting at the long table with the other crewmen. 

I went out for a cigarette shortly after and when I walked out the side of the bar I heard a heated conversation, not quite yelling but clearly a topic of passion. 

Trying not to look nosey I slowly walked my way toward the source of the sound in the alley. When I reached the corner I saw Sam and James in a heated argument. 

I couldn‚Äôt make out exactly what they were saying but I think I heard James say; 

‚ÄúHow can you expect me to rationalize it?‚Äù 

They noticed me staring and quickly stopped talking and walked towards me. Sam went directly back inside but James came over to me with his shit eating grin. 

‚ÄúGotta spare buddy?‚Äù He said pointing at my half ashed cigarette. 

When I tried to ask what they were talking about James just kept saying, ‚ÄúSam just has some ideas he hasn't quite thought through.‚Äù 

I tried to press further on what those ideas were exactly but he just kept saying it‚Äôs gonna be fine and not to worry about it.

Eventually I just gave up and we finished my butt and went back inside.


March 12th, 2024 

Finally made it back to sea. Don‚Äôt get me wrong Dublin was amazing but with the tension between Sam and James I‚Äôm ready to get this voyage over with.

I will say Ireland couldn‚Äôt say a more beautiful goodbye during our departure. The setting sun paints the sky a gorgeous shade of red, giving our tired eyes a glimpse of Mother Nature's infinite beauty before being plunged into the black void of the ocean at night. 

Setting course for Jacksonville, then back to NYC for the end of my month at sea. 

It‚Äôs currently 2 AM and I‚Äôm sitting here with Ben completely dead asleep at his post even though I can hear the Dead Kennedys album blasting in his headphones from here. 

If James walks in we‚Äôd both be in shit. I should probably wake him up. He‚Äôs taught me how to watch the radars and steer clear of any oncoming ships so I think he‚Äôs comfortable enough to leave me to keep watch of the bridge for his beauty sleep. 

There‚Äôs something about the sea, especially the sea at night. You are in an environment that you ‚Äî by any measure of human comprehension ‚Äî are not welcome in. 

Right now I could take a step over a railing the height of my nipples and there would never be a trace of my physical body again. No matter how strong you are or how well you can swim, the endless waves just a few feet away have infinite energy and infinite time. 

I hate the way my mind wanders during these night shifts. I‚Äôm gonna wake Ben up. 


March 14th, 2024.

I‚Äôm done with Sam‚Äôs shit. If he‚Äôs having some mental breakdown he needs to just get off in Jacksonville and get help. 

His notes still suck, he refuses to take any accountability or even listen to me when I try to show him what he‚Äôs missing. I even offered to join him on watch and show him how to communicate what you do in the notes. The fucker just looked at me with a threatening silence that made the ice cold ocean seem welcoming. 

He also started doing this thing, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it without just showing you the notes. Ever since we left Dublin he has added seemingly random words to the end of each of his notes. 

I‚Äôll write down an example here if that helps.

‚ÄúLights and Gainway tended, Cargo inventory complete, security LVL 1 is maintained. SOON‚Äù

The last word in that makes no sense. ‚ÄúSOON‚Äù. 

That was the first one that happened yesterday. Today he left the word ‚ÄúBACK‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt even know what to make of it or if I should care at all. I‚Äôm gonna talk to James about sending him home once we reach Jacksonville, some people just aren‚Äôt built for the isolation of the ocean. 


March 17th, 2024 

I think the tension on the ship is reaching a boiling point. Carlos and I seem to be the only ones getting along. Ben still hates James, James hasn‚Äôt left the bridge in almost 24 hours. 

Sam is still being weird, still doing the weird random words thing. The last few have been; ‚ÄúSTILL, FINGERS, STOPPED, WARMER.‚Äù in that order. 

I‚Äôm getting so sick of these guys man, most of my time not on shift I just hide in my room or exchanging rants with Carlos in the mess hall. 

I just have this feeling I can‚Äôt get over that something is coming, the nights are long. I have been losing more and more sleep every night since we left Dublin. Last night I had an awful panic attack as soon as I set foot on the bridge. 

My heart was pounding in my chest, I felt freezing but began to sweat like a pig. Carlos saw me standing in the doorway of the bridge and just before my knees buckled he grabbed me a desk chair and practically forced me to sit down and grabbed me a water. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it man, everyone gets a bit jittery in the open ocean from time to time.‚Äù He said, patting me on the back before returning to finish his notes. 

I really like Carlos, with everything that's been going on I feel like he's the only normal person on this ship. In the few hours of sleep I have been getting I have been having recurring nightmares that the men on this ship are the last people on earth. 

We keep sailing forward for weeks and weeks never reaching land. Like we are sailing on another planet that has nothing but ocean that goes on forever. 

Jacksonville can‚Äôt come fast enough.

Keep in mind my memory isn‚Äôt completely reliable and some details might be inaccurate. The show is computer animated, think jimmy neutron level quality, with a pretty generic art style. The cast is primarily made up of elementary or middle school kids. The main character is a blonde white boy with blue eyes, he wears a blue t-shirt with a white/blue earth logo on the front. The supporting cast may have a black girl and an Asian boy, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure; I also know one of the cast members has a younger sibling. 

The primary thing I remember is a part of the intro sequence. The main character is running on a road on top a globe facing the screen, saying ‚Äúmoney makes the world go ‚Äôround‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to explain but the globe  is like a fish eye lens with buildings going past. The rest of the intro is just him explaining more about money.

Another main part I remember is from one of those episodes. Some of the kids are hanging out in a coffee shop when they see one of their little siblings sitting at a table. The sibling is holding a piggy bank that he stores marshmallows in while the main character explains that saving the marshmallows in a piggy bank is similar to saving money. 

I don‚Äôt know if this thing will ever be found, but I‚Äôd love to see this weird show again. My grandma was affiliated with a lot of churches back in the day so my dad suggested this was one of her thrifted things she picked up. Also no, I do not have the dvd anymore.

He's (59) working somewhere else for the next year but comes to my city every so often. First off I was impressed with his communication, the first emails, then text and then phone calls. Always timely, polite, cheerful. No ick . 
We met first for coffee when he was here for an appointment and that got extended, but we co ordinated finally met and got on very well. Had a day long date the next day that was really good.  Made arrangements to meet again before he left, but each time he had stayed out too long, then couldn't make it,  then finally when we did meet up and he was obviously still hungover, was nice and polite but struggling after an hour or so,  I dropped him back to his hotel. He left the next day.
After a phone chat the next week he said how keen he was but knew it was tricky being in separate towns so was I OK with that. 
I am as I have my own things to do, but I am still finding out who he is so needed very clear open honest communication.
But then after that there where unanswered messages, late replies. 
Over the Christmas and New Year, I struggle abit , get a bit down.  Then with this feeling dismissed as well, I was a bit upset. One night I  messaged him and tried to explain this but as I was intoxicated it came out garbled , my bad. He did respond eventually saying he didn't understand what i was trying to say and I said we should talk and arranged call after work. I had to cancel but we rescheduled he said he'd call me the next day. He never did. Nothing,  no more communication.  Now over a month later I get a message he's in town next week if I want to see him.  And we can talk about what was bothering me .

Love Cancer

     The oncologist explained that I had stage 4 malignant cancer of the Love. It was an extremely common cancer, he explained, between bites of his cafeteria-bought sandwich. The thought that an oncologist would deliver this kinda news while he casually ate was irritating. It wasn‚Äôt so much the fact that he was eating, the doctor was a busy man.. What bugged me was the nonchalant manner he was conducting this meeting in. Cancer of the Love? I didn‚Äôt have any Love organs...wait I actually did, if you considered my dick. That was for loving, I suppose. 


     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an especially aggressive cancer, but it does get extremely nasty after the third stage,‚Äù the doc said, tuna just right out there. Mocking me. I was hungry. Hangry. You‚Äôve been there. ‚ÄúStage one is almost impossible to detect, even with invasive testing, so don‚Äôt feel bad about the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äôs‚Äô. I could‚Äôve started treating for you or at least referred you to someone else if you came in during stage two, but people are usually in denial then.‚Äù 


     I was looking over his left shoulder, a habit I couldn‚Äôt seem to shake. I stopped looking people in the eye about a year ago. People probably thought I was autistic, on the mild side of the spectrum, but the truth is it came from a place of denial and anxiety. Maybe I was still trapped in Stage Two of the Love cancer. 


     ‚ÄúSo this is gonna kill me?‚Äù I asked. If I don‚Äôt have my phone to google things I‚Äôm on the worse, fatter-faced side of the spectrum. 


     ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dr Dick Kicker laughed. The fucking guy laughed at someone he was diagnosing with cancer. My juvenile rage started to bubble up and a by-the-book tantrum was about to erupt when the doc realized his bedside manner was lacking and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúNo, well, it‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôll kill yourself when you near Stage Five,‚Äù all business now. 
Stage Five? *There‚Äôs an extra stage with this cancer? Da fuck is that shit?*


     ‚ÄúOk, Doc, could you back up a little? Laymen‚Äôs terms and all that?‚Äù I was an asshole, and assholes get scared more than most. And I complain a lot I guess. Don‚Äôt ask why I‚Äôm telling you that, I‚Äôm sure you can form your own opinion of me after the story. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll all agree. 


     ‚ÄúTechnically there‚Äôs many more stages after the fifth, but at that point it‚Äôs all semantics and technicalities. The crucial thing here is that you‚Äôre aware of it and can, hopefully, take steps to correct your daily life habits that might give you a more....,‚Äù He finished his sandwich ‚Äúa more comfortable end.‚Äù


     Are you kidding me?


     ‚ÄúDo I get Morphine?‚Äù I asked with no hesitation. 

     ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúFentanyl?‚Äù

     ‚ÄúAbsolutely not, it‚Äôs strictly regulated‚Äù

     Right. Regulated. No one gets fentanyl without a prescription, anyone in Portland could tell you that. Figures. *Doesn‚Äôt this guy get paid to get me addicted?*


     ‚ÄúI thought all cancer patients get the good drugs? If I have Love cancer at least give me something to cope with the pain! Christ. *This isn‚Äôt fair.‚Äù*


     Doctor Go Fuck Yourself crossed his legs behind his desk and laced his fingers behind his head, swiveling left and right in his (really quite nice) Oncologists chair. The whole office was nice. Consolations like these telling the poor souls like me die apparently paid quite well, it seemed. 
      

*I always liked and trusted doctors, so why did I instinctually dislike the fuck out of this man? Goddamnit I‚Äôm hungry. Probably the cancer kicking in. Gnawing at my organs...I probably need a sandwich for energy to fight this.*


     ‚ÄúYou got that sandwich at the cafeteria right? Which way is it? I gotta get outta here for a second.‚Äù I was unconsciously swinging my knees in sync with the doctors. 


     ‚ÄúI doubt that would be a good idea. I literally just told you you‚Äôre in Stage Four of a malignant cancer, so leaving now would leave you scared and liable to do something dumb, and -  I‚Äôm just taking a shot in the dark here - but I‚Äôm positive the first thing you‚Äôll do is google ‚ÄòStage Four Love Cancer‚Äô as soon as you leave. Bad idea.‚Äù He unlocked his fingers and laid them on the table. ‚ÄúListen to me son -‚Äú

     *I‚Äôm not your son fuckfac-*

     The doc butted into my mental cursing, just as I was going to begin casting an actual curse upon him and his loved ones. 


     ‚ÄúThis cancer is physical, no doubt. The AMA characterizes it by a slow, spiteful, selfish deterioration of the mind, body, and soul. That‚Äôs how most cancers are characterized, but what distinguishes what you have from someone who has, say, Lymphoma or organ cancer, is that your Illness was self inflicted. You could say it isn‚Äôt much different from a smoker who gets lung cancer. No surprises there, and not much pity for them. No, what truly defines this cancer is that it takes two people to develop.‚Äù


     Yeah, that made sense. I hate my wife, and in turn she made me hate myself. And in turn to that, I began to hate life itself. She could go *fuck* herself though, because she wasn‚Äôt the one here being diagnosed. 


     ‚ÄúYEAH!‚Äù I shouted way too loudly in his office. ‚ÄúTWO! Two people. Not just me.‚Äù A vengeance was manifesting itself in my gut like a bloody Tarantino plot. ‚ÄúWhere the hell is Helen? It takes two to get this shit right? Where‚Äôs my wife? She has it right? She *has* to have it,‚Äù I spat out like a child. 

Did I really want Helen to have cancer? Did I? It seemed that the answer should be obvious but it honestly wasn‚Äôt. I pictured a gun going off point-blank to the side of her head and frowned, not liking the thought of it. Too easy. She‚Äôd be out in the snap of a finger, getting to skip out on all of this bullshit. She always got the easy way out. Bar none, that bitch was the luckiest creature I‚Äôd ever known. And here I sat, being told I have cancer, and she‚Äôs probably out at the tanning salon or walking our dog, Stitches. I let her name the dog Stitches. *Stitches*. Fucking imbecile thought it was cute; I was just joking when I first said it. I wanted to name him Leonidas after Gerard Butler‚Äôs character in 300. The oncologist was speaking. I looked at him, shifting my ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not listening but I exist‚Äô gaze to his face. 


     ‚ÄúHelen is emotionally damaged, but her biopsy didn‚Äôt reveal any cancerous cells. She‚Äôs quite healthy, in fact.‚Äù 

     Figures. 

     ‚ÄúThis might be a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, but your wife isn‚Äôt a patient of mine here, so I don‚Äôt see the harm. She‚Äôs actually having an affair with your downstairs neighbor, Darren.‚Äù


Again, you‚Äôd think an obvious thought or emotion would jump up and get all the attention like a Helen did when we walked in a  room together; she always did light up a room - but instead, just more of the hollow, nothing-fills-the abyss hollowness swept over me. Helen was cheating on me with Darren. Huh. He was black so I guess it was inevitable that she‚Äôd go down that road. As soon as we moved in to our new apartment he had been so nice, such a *sweetheart* to Helen. Darren and I had never got close; he was an adult-adult. He worked, wore adult clothes, played cards with his friends, *had* friends, owned a nice car. You know. A guy who hadn‚Äôt had his soul crushed into cancerous cells by a succubus like Helen yet. I tended to play video games. Yeah whatever call me childish but they can be art, just like any other medium. What I played with my buddies, Call of Duty, probably wasn‚Äôt the best example, but I liked it. Helen didn‚Äôt like me playing all the time because most nights I would end up throwing the controller at the TV, screaming obscenities at kids who weren‚Äôt there - But fuck her - I worked, so I could do what I wanted with my time....which had increasingly become more and more selfish lately. Spiteful, she would say, probably. I could see it in her eyes how much she thought of me lately. No surprise she‚Äôd turn to Darren; he lived right downstairs. And now he was fucking my wife as I was being diagnosed with cancer. Did she even know I had an appointment with this dick kicking Oncologist? 


     If I were in our apartment, could I hear the sound of her getting fucked?


     ‚ÄúInfidelity is a common symptom in my patients. I know it‚Äôs a bitter pill to swallow, but the sooner you come to terms with the severity of your condition, the sooner effective treatment can begin,‚Äù the Dr. said. My eyes shifted to the left. 


     ‚ÄúThen why tell me?‚Äù I laughed condescendingly. At myself, or maybe at him. I was condescendingly mean, even now. Again, not shocked. 


      ‚ÄúWell you wanted to know where she was.‚Äù Okay. Point taken. How did he know where she was? What was this gypsy, holistic, eastern med shit he was peddling me? He was an Oncologist, not a leprechaun. The thought of Helen riding Darren didn‚Äôt exactly bother me as much as it made me feel like something was rented from me without filling out the forms. 

‚ÄúPut that aside for now. Take this,‚Äù the doc handed me a pamphlet. 
‚ÄòLove Cancer, Learning to Live Without Love‚Äô.

      I stared at it, eyes a little to the left. 

     ‚ÄúRead it at your own leisure. I‚Äôll sum it up as succinctly as I can,‚Äù the doc said. 


    ‚ÄúOk go bananas,‚Äù I tried to move my eyes, but my new zoning-out habit was really starting to permeate my life. My gaze sat a little to the left of his eyes. 


     ‚ÄúMost of my patients are self obsessed assholes, and pardon my candor, but you seem no exception. If you tried, something Helen tells me you rarely do these days, you could try to think back to the days when you thought of your wife. Considered her. Thought about what she might like and, if you honestly assess your past with her, you can probably remember a time when you actually wanted to spend time with her for no other reason besides just being with her. Can you tell me when was the last time you thought about her in a positive way when driving home from work? Don‚Äôt answer, you‚Äôre in my office, it‚Äôs rhetorical. Probably a good two years ago? You‚Äôre relatively young, and I know you married Helen when you were in your early twenties, and you now resent her. So much so that you‚Äôve been oblivious to your Love Cancer progressing. The reasons for your resentment are your own.‚Äù Dr I-know-what-you-did-last-summer paused. 

     I don‚Äôt resent her, I actively hate the bitch. 

He continued. 

     ‚ÄúStage one and two are full of resentments and passive aggression. Stage three is referred to as ‚Äòthe breakups‚Äô. The going back and forth, both knowing you don‚Äôt belong together but being too scared or afraid to not properly, maturely ending the relationship. Helen bore the brunt of the breakups, time and again, and while you thought you were curing yourself, you were actually doing what is tantamount to eating uranium from a North Korean landfill.‚Äù


     Is this a joke to him? When did he grow a sense of humor? This guy wouldn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs funny if I walked up to him and shoved it in his stupid, smart, boring nerd face. 


     ‚ÄúHelen, along with most women, are very akin to White Orchids. You know what-,‚Äù

     ‚Äú*YES I KNOW WHAT ORCHIDS ARE!*‚Äù Jeeeesus. 

     ‚ÄúOk then you know that these flowers can be rather fickle, and require a great deal of care and compassion to fully blossom. However, if you stick an orchid in a microwave and cook it for five or seven years, it will die. Or so you would think, for the most part.‚Äù I saw him dipping his head trying to catch my attention. ‚ÄúMost of these beautiful flowers can actually prosper under the harshest conditions and still retain their strength and beauty. They can survive. It‚Äôs only when you, the microwaver, *decide to lock the orchid in the microwave and stay in the home that the microwave lives in* that the microwaver, again; you - start to develop Love cancer. 
     
My eyes fell on him. 

     ‚ÄúYou actively made a choice to kill your orchid. Your relationship with Helen. And now she‚Äôs screwing your downstairs neighbor. Are you surprised?‚Äù


      I considered it. Yes. Yes I was. Helen was mine, she said so in her vows at our wedding. The fuckin priest even said it. *Mine*. She was mine to do with as I pleased, through good times and bad, sickness and health (HELLO?! Cancer!) and where was she now? Fucking Darren. 

     ‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said, lying to be right. To have my way. If you‚Äôre right people think you‚Äôre smart, I found out. And if I yell the loudest, I get what I want. 


     ‚ÄúMost people would be hurt by that information, but it‚Äôs seems you‚Äôre either in denial or are angry. Whatever the case, I have an extra ten minutes or so before my next patient-‚Äú

      I squinted a rat like expression at him. I just couldn‚Äôt not hate his face in that moment. He saw it in my expression. 

     ‚ÄúSo again, I‚Äôll keep it brief,‚Äù he said, losing patience. 

     Oh fuck you Doctor Morals. Like you know what it‚Äôs like being married, the complexities and subtleties of how the dishes are *obviously supposed to go in a dishwasher and only an idiot could fuck it up*. I spied the wedding ring on his left hand. Goddamnit. Ok then, Dr. Nicholas Spark‚Äôs, how about being married to a woman who has it made because of ME, barely has to work compared to ME, who has all these THOUGHTS and NEEDS, who is constantly bothering ME about every little detail. Helen couldn‚Äôt make a fucking decision to save her life. 

     Honestly. If I put hopped in a tank, swiveled the giant barrel of the gun to her head, and asked ‚ÄòHidee-ho Helen! Do you want something to eat? I‚Äôm ordering!,‚Äù she would stand there shaking like a pissing dog as I jiggled the phone at her face until my rage hijacked control over my words. That happens pretty quick. I would be fucking forced to inevitably shout FIRE! from my commanders chair atop the war machine, and the tank shell would explode her stupid face. I envisioned her head blowing apart into a heavy gloop of red and pink. Chunks. I didn‚Äôt smile, but a cold satisfaction gripped my stomach. I bet my balls and dick that I‚Äôve made every decision for her in her entire life. Even before she met me. 

     ‚ÄúIs something else troubling you?‚Äù The Doc said. 

     ‚ÄúYeah, Doc, cancer and black dick.‚Äù 

     *FIRE!*

     ‚ÄúI see. A wise man once said that brevity is the brother of brilliance, so let‚Äôs end this, shall we? You came in last week. You were angry, high blood pressure, feeling weak and looking ten years older than you should. Classic case to die in your mid forties, I‚Äôd bet my dick and balls on it,‚Äù his eyes sparkled a secret sparkle. 

     So all the dick and balls are on the table then eh? Mind reading prick. I hope you get testicular cancer and whatever dick cancer is called. 


     ‚ÄúAnd seeming from your reactions, you‚Äôll likely go home, pick a fight with your wife‚Äôs new lover and in all honestly you‚Äôll probably lose if it comes to a fist fight. When‚Äôs the last time you went to the gym? Did any exercise at all? Done anything to improve yourself? Five years? Longer?‚Äù This was one confident Oncologist. I‚Äôd be impressed, if I wasn‚Äôt so pissed off. I wanted to keep across the table and strangle him.            ‚ÄúYou smoke, you drink, you‚Äôre angry all the time, and all of your bitchy little outbursts are a byproduct of your cancer.‚Äù 


     He paused, gathering himself for the last leg of whatever it was he was going to say before I murdered him. 


     ‚ÄúYou need to let Helen go before your Cancer infects her. You insisted she stay with you out of selfish fear that someone else could have her. You know you‚Äôre inadequate, and eventually, if you don‚Äôt end it properly, maturely, Helen will start developing stage one Love cancer. Women are resilient, and can withstand far more then a man like you ever could. But she will succumb to your disease eventually.‚Äù

     Good. 

     ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fine living out these last miserable years of your life - beating Helen, accusing Helen, blaming Helen, but that won‚Äôt put you into Love Cancer remission. Stage Four, Five, Six Seven and Eight are all characterized by couples like you and Helen, where one has given up completely. Once one is completely lost, both of you give up on your dreams, and settle for a life of dead, passionless, loveless complacency. Because the cancer has eaten the love you once had. You both understand that you are forcing this, forcing instead of fixing, and quite frankly your relationship with your wife should be allowed to die. So that you both may one day live again.‚Äù 


     Dr. Strangelove‚Äôs eyes, once concerned and caring, glazed over and shifted off to my left shoulder. He became an older man in that moment, wasted by years of seeing the walking dead of love; the zombies that silently patrolled Home Depot‚Äôs and Targets on Saturday‚Äôs. All of the women with downcast eyes and thousand yard stares. All of the women pointing out things to their husbands or boyfriends that might make life better. Pointing out that they were missing life, one day at a time, to their oblivious husbands. All the days that bled together into one routine that stretched out for eons. It laid the Doctor bare, weighted on his chest like thousands of pyramid bricks. The weight of high expectations getting crushed, excepted, thoughtfully adjusted, and then brutally crushed again.

     The Dr. cleared his throat, his eyes coming back to life. 

     ‚ÄúYou will die,‚Äù he said, in a tone I hadn‚Äôt heard from him before. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll kill Helen, who is a lovely, thoughtful woman. Yet you won‚Äôt even have the common decency to kill yourself for a good old fashioned murder-suicide. That‚Äôs the hardest part of my job; seeing people like you move on, a cancerous cell that selfishly sucks the life out of the ones you love without a care, without a thought. Petty smart-ass remarks and denial is who you are; and your identity is now a mutated cancer cell. You‚Äôre already dead inside, and while that does bring some comfort, it still doesn‚Äôt justify this disease. Your cancer will grow, and you will become the cancer.‚Äù

     Well fuck me then, I guess Doc. 

     This was the worst consult I‚Äôd ever had. This asshole presumed to know-

     ‚ÄúI know because I‚Äôve seen a thousand like you before. Entitled men. I see it in your eyes. You‚Äôre not even here. And you want cancer. You want the pity. Play it off how you will, but let me ask this of you: Let Helen go. She still has life inside of her. She is someone worth saving. You‚Äôre just a cancerous asshole.‚Äù

     My jaw swung open. No. Fuckin. Body. Talks To Me. Like. That. 

My baby rage boiled over and I rose from the chair, and like Charles Manson leaping at the judge in court, I lunged at the Oncologist, hitting his desk, knocking over Manila folders and spilling coffee everywhere. I tried to grab him by the throat but he was way, way too strong for an old man. Much stronger than he looked. As I realized how weak I was, he easily held my forearms away from his throat, making me look like a baby T-Rex. 
     ‚ÄúI HAVE CANCER AND YOU CALL ME-‚Äú

     CRUNCH!

     He kneed me in the balls, hard. My body slumped on top of his. I mentally counted to three, waited for it...waited for it...and on cue: BAM! the pain dropped into my stomach like liquid metal poured down my throat, settling in the lower half of my gut. God nut paid is the worst, fuck he got me good. Doctor Cock Hammer called for his receptionist. 

     ‚ÄúAmanda! Can you get in here? I have a stage four reacting like usual,‚Äù the docs voiced called. ‚ÄúYeah, kneed him in the balls, he‚Äôs down.‚Äù I heard an unintelligible female voice. ‚ÄúYeah, just another asshole. It‚Äôs okay he wasn‚Äôt going to listen to anyone anyway. Get Darren to get a stretcher in here and we‚Äôll see if we can ice his balls down a bit. Thank you, dear.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúDarren?! Fucking Darren?‚Äù I squeaked out, rolling over in pain. Was he Wolverine? Were his knees made of Adamantium?

     ‚ÄúSorry son, I didn‚Äôt want to have to hurt you, especially with the ol knee replacement. I‚Äôm like the six million dollar man now!‚Äù He chuckled. ‚ÄúBut seriously, surgery is no joke.‚Äù

     *I hate you my nuts I hate you my nuts I hate you my nuts oh god I‚Äôm sterile now you cocksucker*. 

Darren came into the office, his puffy blue EMT jacket immediately making me jealous that he had a job with a uniform women probably found sexy. One that probably got him pussy. My wife‚Äôs, for instance. 

     ‚ÄúOff you go now,‚Äù Doctor Ball Crusher said with faint indifference. 

     ‚ÄúHey neighbor! What happened buddy? Why you curled up like a baby there?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt stand, let alone speak. ‚ÄúLucky you live so close to the Doc‚Äôs office!‚Äù Darren, smiling and light hearted as usual. ‚ÄúNo worries I‚Äôm here to help you out bud.‚Äù I was trapped in a world of pain. If you think I was emasculated in that moment, well, you‚Äôd be wrong. I had cancer. 

     ‚ÄúOk let‚Äôs go big guy,‚Äù Darren said. The man who was being nice to my wife, not sexually, not at first, at least, nor with that intention, but rather a genuine sense of caring. He was there, and Darren knew how to listen, and more importantly, knew how to help a person in need. Probably why he was an EMT. I hated everything, but could do nothing about it. Darren prepped a needle, flicked its liquid green contents.

     ‚ÄúMOTHERFUCKER!!!!‚Äù And that‚Äôs when the Ativan hit me, and I drifted into to a blissful, warm nothingness. 

            Later

     When I got home, Helen was gone, there was a note on the table that wasn‚Äôt from our living room stationary. It was different, I didn‚Äôt recognize it. The paper was green, with a purple header, and had different expressions of Tyler Perrys face on it. Angry. Empowered! Loving. Happy. Oh my Luuuurd! 

     From Darren‚Äôs apartment then. 

     I wasn‚Äôt surprised. I wobbled to the couch, cradling my bruised balls and silently cursed my wife to slip on a banana and land on Darren‚Äôs dick hard enough to break it off. I tried for a grim laugh at the picture of it, but a cough came up instead. I can‚Äôt seem to laugh anymore. I flipped on my PS4 and checked my friends list, which sat empty for the time being; everyone was offline. 
     
Love Cancer. How stupid.

# My Neighbor Bill‚Äôs Experience

He‚Äôs the kind of guy who refuses to let discomfort slow him down, but it was clear that the pain was starting to take its toll. When I suggested [he try Joint Restore Gummies](https://theworldhealth.org/joint-restore-gummies-official), he was hesitant but willing to give it a shot‚Äî‚ÄúAnything to keep up with the little ones,‚Äù he joked.

After a couple of weeks, Bill noticed a difference. He said his knees felt ""less creaky,"" and he could spend more time on his feet without needing to take breaks.

1if0md7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/1if0md7/squirrels_are_up_to_something/,Squirrels are up to something,"I need to talk about something that‚Äôs been bothering me for a while. I was walking around campus the other day‚Äîjust minding my own business, trying to get from point A to point B when I saw a squirrel. Now, I know, I know‚Äîsquirrels are *everywhere*. But this one‚Ä¶ this one was *different*. It was acting suspicious, like it had a *mission*. You ever feel like squirrels are just playing a long game that we can‚Äôt understand? They run around, darting from tree to tree, gathering things, hiding stuff. It‚Äôs like they have this *whole* plan that we‚Äôre not privy to. I‚Äôm starting to think squirrels know more than they‚Äôre letting on.

Like, what if they‚Äôre out here building some kind of squirrel empire? Maybe they‚Äôre hoarding nuts for the next big squirrel revolution. They‚Äôve got their own little society, just biding their time, waiting for the right moment to take over. Maybe *that‚Äôs* why they‚Äôre always so frantic‚Äîthey‚Äôre working on some secret squirrel agenda that we‚Äôre just too slow to catch up with. They probably know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. Meanwhile, here I am, just trying to get to class, and the squirrels are out here plotting, with their beady little eyes, probably discussing plans for *world domination* one acorn at a time.

If squirrels had wings, can you imagine how much more chaotic the world would be? I mean, they already run around with their little twitchy movements, and they‚Äôre so quick. But if they could fly? I bet we‚Äôd be living in a completely different world. Imagine just sitting under a tree, enjoying the day, and then suddenly a squirrel swoops down out of nowhere, like it‚Äôs on some top-secret mission. We‚Äôd never be able to catch them! They could probably take over an entire campus in, like, an afternoon.

And you know what got me thinking about this whole squirrel conspiracy? It got me thinking about how they *use* their paws to collect all their precious stuff. Which led me to this question: *Why do we even have hands*? Like, I‚Äôm serious. We‚Äôve got these two weird appendages that are somehow perfect for grabbing things, writing things down, and‚Äîof course‚Äîmaking it look like we know what we‚Äôre doing in class. But have you ever stopped to really think about it? What if we didn‚Äôt need hands at all?

I mean, squirrels get by just fine with their paws. And if they can pull off secret acorn missions without opposable thumbs, then maybe *we* could‚Äôve evolved to have something cooler. Imagine if we had, like, *tentacles* instead. Tentacles are, honestly, way more efficient than hands. They could do like a million things at once. You could grab a coffee, type a paper, and pet a dog all at the same time! Hands, on the other hand, are like, ""Hey, I can hold a coffee cup but don't ask me to do anything else, please.""

And then I started wondering‚Ä¶ if squirrels had *hands*‚Äîlike, actual human hands‚Äîwould they be more dangerous? I mean, think about it. They‚Äôre already stealthy with their little paws, running circles around us, but with *hands*, they could organize their squirrel army. They could write notes, plan strategies, maybe even start a squirrel think tank to discuss world domination. A squirrel with human hands would probably be unstoppable.

But okay, let‚Äôs not get too carried away. Maybe squirrels don‚Äôt actually have a secret empire. Or maybe they do, and I‚Äôm just not on the inside of the club. It‚Äôs a mystery, I guess. But I‚Äôm starting to wonder if we should be worried. You know, like when you‚Äôre walking through campus, and there‚Äôs a group of squirrels just hanging out, staring at you like they know something you don‚Äôt? They probably do. They *definitely* do.

Anyway, just some thoughts. If you ever see a squirrel giving you the side-eye, maybe keep your distance. They might be onto something bigger than we realize. And, you know, I think I‚Äôm gonna start working on my own secret plan to find out what‚Äôs really going on with the squirrels. Who knows? Maybe I‚Äôll become the first human squirrel *spy*. We‚Äôll see.",9,1738392529.0,aggies,0,0.85,False

From my research, it looks like Help Desk / IT Support is the best entry point. I‚Äôm planning to take a short course/certification to improve my chances. Would CompTIA A+, Google IT Support, or something else be better for the UK job market?

Are these jobs in demand right now, or is the market flooded? Any tips on where to apply or how to stand out as a complete beginner?

It provides a much calmer, yet somehow still sharper type of focus. 

I knew before I made the switch to green tea that it contained L-theanine which works synergistically with caffeine to quell the sometimes overstimulating ‚Äújitters‚Äù that coffee can bring on. I did not realise the effects would be this pronounced though. 

This led to me researching L-theanine more extensively and I discovered that matcha contains higher amounts of L-theanine and other beneficial components than standard tea bags. 

If you‚Äôve been looking to cut out coffee but are worried about potential withdrawals of caffeine, I highly recommend investing in a good quality matcha powder. 

Start light with only one teaspoon as it‚Äôs high in catechins which are great for your health, but may bring on stomach discomfort in some people. 

If anyone has similar testimonials regarding L-theanine or green tea in general, I‚Äôd be super interested to hear them in the comments :)",41,1738391930.0,Biohackers,20,0.96,False

The kettle is available at a better price at the [sellers site ](https://sipologie.in/products/sipologie-precision-electric-gooseneck-kettle-2?_pos=1&_psq=kett&_ss=e&_v=1.0)than Amazon.

I wanted to go for [Timemore Fish](https://brewinggadgets.in/products/timemore-fish-pro-smart-electric-pour-over-kettle-900ml) but really didn't want to shell out that much. The [Flair Cafe kettle ](https://brewinggadgets.in/products/flair-cafe-kettle-800ml-black-pre-order)is now available in India but it doesn't have good reviews. I got this from a friend, got a probe thermometer from Amazon and did some tests. I will be using the kettle for V60 and Kalita Wave and upgrading from a manual gooseneck. I recently came to know I was losing almost 10 to 15 ^(o)C when I was transferring hot water from kettle to gooseneck then to coffee bed.

Now to the tests...

**Test Parameters:-**

Ambient Temperature 20^(o)C

Test Water Amount	600 ml

Initial Water Temperature 34 ^(o)C

**Test Method:-**

(a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Using a digital probe thermometer actual temperature of water inside kettle was measured. A temperature was set on the kettle. When heating element cut off, stopwatch as started. Highest temperature shoot was recorded. Then lowest temperature was recorded when heating element cut in and stopwatch was paused and time noted. ¬†

(b)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass flow rate calculated by measuring weight of water that can be poured in a time interval (depends on skill).

**Temperature Tests:-**

**Mass Flow Rate**:-

Max      22.5 g/s        Min   2.5 g/s

**Some Observations:-**

(a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Kettle resembles Felicita Square Pour Over Kettle. Has chances of lid falling inside the kettle. Refer [James Hoffman video](https://youtu.be/Pbel051H7-s?t=926&si=qfaSK4BPTUpNXNEG)

(b)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Build quality is generally good and sturdy. Dial and buttons are not of very good quality.

(c)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Handle is good. Works in all orientations. UI is decent.

(d)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Temperature stability observed once the kettle has warmed up initially, cooled and warmed up again.

(e)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Better to use at least 600 to 700 ml of water. Used about 300 ml for a Tetsu Kasuya V60 recipe that needs number of pours. There were temperature drops in the kettle; heating element doesn‚Äôt cut in before 2 to 3 seconds; recipe needs many pours leading to using less than recommended temperature. More water in the kettle showed better heat retention.

(f)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass flow rate is in general, too high due to a very high gooseneck diameter. The gooseneck curve could have been more restrictive. The lowest was achieved with lot of patience but about 5 - 8 g/s can be achieved with practice.

¬†

**TL;DR** \- Sipologie Precision Electric Gooseneck Kettle is a good budget friendly option for filter coffee enthusiasts. Temperature variation is minimal and its is recommended to use with about 600 - 700 ml of water. Pour rate can be adjusted with practice :)",7,1738391473.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.9,False

This analysis explores the potential mechanics of FNAF World characters if they were integrated into Ultimate Custom Night. We'll examine how their unique abilities and personalities from the RPG game could translate into the survival horror setting of UCN.
 
The Office: A Familiar Yet Different Setting
 
The UCN office would likely be a reimagined version of Desk Man's house from FNAF World, with a similar gray and concrete aesthetic. The central door would be the main point of entry for many characters, with two side vents for others. The camera system would offer views of various locations from FNAF World, such as Faz Hills, Chopwoods, and Lilygear Lake.
 
Key Mechanics: A Twist on Familiar Gameplay
 
Unlike standard UCN, a single jump scare wouldn't be fatal. Instead, players would have a health bar and could survive up to five hits before needing to heal. The monitor would also have a variety of systems, including a power generator, neon wall, heater, and power A/C, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.
 
Character Mechanics: A Fusion of FNAF World and UCN
 
Each FNAF World character would have unique mechanics based on their abilities and personalities:
 
- Freddy: Slowly advances towards the central door, requiring the laser gate to be used to drive him back.
 
- Bonnie: Attacks from the left door, his face always visible.
 
- Chica: If an HP-based character is active, Chica tries to heal them, but this can be blocked by clicking her. If no HP-based character is active, she attacks the right door.
 
- Foxy: Must be watched in Lilygear Lake, or he'll slowly ""hot cheese"" the player to death.
 
- Toy Bonnie and Toy Chica: Move in sync, with Toy Bonnie on the left and Toy Chica on the right. Closing both doors is the only way to stop them.
 
- Toy Freddy: Crawls through the left vent, requiring the vent door to be closed to get rid of him.
 
- Mangle: Moves in the right vent, requiring the vent door to be closed to prevent her from entering.
 
- Balloon Boy: Appears in one of the side vents, and if he enters, temporarily disables the flashlight.
 
- Jay Jay: Similar to Balloon Boy, but disables the doors instead of the flashlight.
 
- Phantom Freddy: Fades in on one side of the office, poisoning the player unless the flashlight is used to drive him away.
 
- Phantom Chica: May take over a camera, forcing a camera error that fixes itself after a short wait.
 
- Phantom BB: Don't look at him for too long, or his gloom balloon will cause power to drain more easily.
 
- Phantom Foxy: Poisons the player if looked at while in the office.
 
- Phantom Mangle: May appear in a vent opening, and if the camera is opened while they're there, they'll enter and annoy the player.
 
- W. Bonnie: Watching the cameras allows him to move closer, requiring the player to avoid looking at them too often.
 
- W. Chica: Wanders aimlessly through the cameras, and can be lured away from the office with the audio cue.
 
- W. Freddy: Don't look at him on the camera for too long, or he'll attempt to ""esc key"" the player, which has a chance to instantly kill.
 
- W. Foxy: Works like normal Foxy, but appears in the office, requiring the player to watch him to prevent him from ""hot cheese""ing them.
 
- Shadow Freddy: May appear at the doors randomly. If he enters and the player is below half HP, they're dead.
 
- Marionette: Winding the music box stops the Puppet from getting out, but it winds down faster when the building gets warm.
 
- Phantom Marionette: Randomly replaces active characters with others, for no apparent reason.
 
- Golden Freddy: Acts like FNAF 1/2 Golden Freddy, but doesn't kill the player, only disables systems with haunting for a while.
 
- Paper Pals: Appear in the office one by one, and can be gotten rid of by clicking them, but this prevents the player from doing anything else. If all three enter, they use Mimic Ball, causing everything to attack twice as often.
 
- Nightmare Freddy: The Freddles summon him if the player doesn't shine the light on them.
 
- Nightmare Bonnie: Has a different knock noise, requiring the player to keep the door closed until he knocks a second time.
 
- Nightmare Chica: Makes a sandwich when she enters, requiring the player to click on it to eat it, or she'll get mad.
 
- Nightmare Foxy: His plush may randomly appear on the camera, requiring the player to click on it to reset his pattern.
 
- Endo-01: May appear on the left or right of the office, and if looked at for too long, he'll attack.
 
- Endo-02: Appears in front of the desk, and can be prevented from appearing with the Neon Wall. If he does appear, putting up the cameras and keeping one door open will cause him to leave.
 
- Plushtrap: Must be kept on his chair by shining the light, or he'll poison the player with bad pizza.
 
- Endo Plush: Requires payment to meet his quota, and can be paid extra to set up a temporary Neon Wall without reducing power.
 
- Springtrap: Very dangerous, requiring the audio lure to keep him back, or he'll use spring locks, which might instantly kill the player.
 
- Rxq: Randomly breaks into the office, making it pitch black, and there's no way to make him go away early.
 
- Crying Child: If he appears, it means the player is being too noisy, requiring them to keep it down for him to go away.
 
- Funtime Foxy: Only moves when the camera is down. If they enter the office, Cosmic Jam will break away some HP.
 
- Nightmare Fredbear and Nightmare: Storm the front vents together. If either one enters, they'll use Mega Bite, requiring the player to get rid of both.
 
- Fredbear: Appears in the central hallway, and can be forced back with the Neon Wall or heater. If he enters, he'll use Mega Bite.

That‚Äôs lovely, Colin. But I feel like a lot of Americans take being Irish everywhere with them too‚Äîeven if their last actual Irish relative left during the Famine and their only connection to the culture is putting Baileys in their coffee.

Look, I get it. You have heritage. But you‚Äôre American‚Äîbe proud! Your country gave us deep-fried everything, chaotic Florida news, and the cinematic masterpiece that is Shrek 2. No one in Ireland is lying awake thinking, God, I hope some guy from Pittsburgh named Sean Patrick McCarthy is keeping the spirit alive for us. I just dont get it.  STOP !! You're American, you are not Irish; you did not go to primary school or secondary school. You did not get chicken fillet rolls during lunch or 99s on the way home! You didn't wear your uniform everywhere when it itched you everywhere ü§£ and did you actually fear the wooden spoon? Not the idea of It, I mean seriously the wooden spoon. 

It bothers me because it seems like people trying to borrow or jump on a wagon instead of embracing everything that they are.  If you didn't grow up in Ireland then you are NOT Irish. But who cares?

So, what‚Äôs the deal? Is it nostalgia? A need for an identity beyond just being American? Or do y‚Äôall just really love an excuse to drink?

It will still provide a basic and user-friendly VPN service meant to safeguard personal data in 2025. But does EncryptMe VPN still a good option with more sophisticated security solutions provided by other providers?  

EncryptMe VPN excels mostly in terms of simplicity of use. It is meant for those who wish for rapid and automatic protection free from complex settings. For those who routinely use coffee shop or airport Wi-Fi, the software links to a VPN upon detecting an unsafe network. On the other hand, customers who wish more influence over VPN settings or server choice may find the simplicity to be somewhat constrictive.  

Regarding security, EncryptMe VPN provides regular encryption to guard user information. Although it offers strong defense against spies and hackers, it lacks some of the more sophisticated privacy tools than some other VPNs. Given that it runs under US jurisdiction, some users may also be worried that it would be vulnerable to government data requests. Although it says it has a no-logs policy, privacy-conscious consumers might want a provider situated in a more private area.  

For basic surfing and streaming, speed is reasonable; yet, it is not the fastest VPN accessible. For daily chores including email checking, social media use, and light streaming most customers discover EncryptMe VPN performs effectively. Those who require a VPN for gaming, torrenting, or high-definition streaming, however, may find slower performance than more premium VPNs with bigger server networks.  

EncryptMe VPN has several subscription choices, including a week-long pass for temporary use; pricing is cheap. For those who just require a VPN momentarily, this adaptability is great. When compared to other VPNs with comparable rates, some users could believe that EncryptMe VPN lacks extra features that could justify the cost in the long term, nevertheless.  

For consumers who wish automatic protection on public Wi-Fi and an easy-to-use VPN, EncryptMe VPN stays a straightforward and efficient choice overall. For individuals who require quicker speeds, greater privacy tools, or complex settings, nevertheless, 2025 offers better choices. Have lately utilized EncryptMe VPN?

**Memory Transcription:**¬†**Tarva, Governor of the Venlil Republic**

**Date \[Standardized //////// Time\]: 10/19/2136**

The news of Kam‚Äôs return due to an unforeseen Arxur attack unnerved me to no end. I recognized the terrible truth the moment I received word from Kam‚Äôs subspace transmission. My anxiety and sleepless nights were absolute as I could only think of a simple question. How did they find the hidden operations? We made sure to keep everything as quiet as possible, no outside transmissions from any sources in that system were allowed. We ensured any ships in the system were equipped with special engine retractable armor plates to halt the emissions from engines. A surprisingly genius design from the Yotul engineers‚Äô who made them.

The Arxur must have developed some more advanced sensor or detected something in the system to be considered worth taking. No, it was no expeditionary force, but a full-blown invasion force meant for a small settlement. The Arxur don‚Äôt waste military assets, they use all of them for seeking out our presence to try and bring us to the depth with their torment. They knew we were there‚Ä¶ but how? I was kept awake each night thinking of any answers only to find no answers within the depths of my mind. Little to no sleep was able to be had on my end. My stress kept me awake in the dark of night as I awaited the return of my general and the survivors‚Ä¶

Once again, I awoke to an empty home. The Governor‚Äôs mansion, silent as always. My life seemingly has gone for the worse ever since what felt like a year ago, even though it was only about a quarter of a year ago. The silence grew colder since first contact, once again recognizable as there was no one here by my side to help me in my time of need. Cheln was likely with the rest of my administration at the Capitol tower. He was probably finishing up some lower grade work‚Ä¶ leaving me once again to finalize reports on my part regarding international affairs arising as of late.

Riots and lootings across the federation as countless people were entering a selfish and me-first mentality. Everyone out for themselves, and property damages to local businesses in the trillions galaxy wide‚Ä¶ rallies were abundant with several reported cults of appeasement forming to try and bend knee in the hopes of gaining the favor of the AI. Anyone not of such bizarre fanaticism found them appalling, and exterminators dispatched to handle the crowds found the events difficult to peacefully disperse. Predator disease was on the rise as the witnessing of the televised battle seemed to drive hopeless madness into those of weak wills.

Truly i understood‚Ä¶ it all felt pointless as of late, misery just for the sake of it. It plagued the galaxy more than ever with the appearance of the mad titan. I just wanted to lay in my bed, let the mattress claim my mortal bonds and allow me to fade fully. To unshackle my soul from this body bound by stress and fleeting faith in myself.

To top it all off other entities within the federation were beginning to point fingers with tensions rising to an all-time high. Those within the senate blamed the members of the extermination fleet for seeking to engage a force so astronomically overperforming. The members of the extermination fleet called all others useless for not providing the aid needed to assure true victory‚Ä¶ as if numbers were going to serve us in any way with the way the extermination fleet was outmatched.

Those who‚Äôve spoken in regard to trying to re-establish some sense of communication and diplomatic efforts with the AI were considered predator diseased, taken for treatment. It was foolish to try and play nice when we‚Äôve done so much wrong to AM so far. We could only see it through‚Ä¶ but we couldn‚Äôt. We can‚Äôt see it through, for it is impossible to oppose the will and reach of the military. AM works with the Arxur‚Ä¶ doing something vile and nefarious‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs only a matter of time that we all die and my toil for the sake of toil can finally cease.

Hopefully it‚Äôs soon‚Ä¶ if I don‚Äôt work myself to death before then.

Still, despite disparity, there were still countless that relied on me for guidance, and I have to be more than that figure‚Ä¶  I have no choice‚Ä¶

Climbing out of my bed, I moved to grab my governor robes and make myself a cup of the necessary stimulants for me to function properly, as I have been needing for several paws now. Sleep was nearly nonexistent to me, only about a dozen or so minutes of sleep each paw due to the work and meetings that were piling up. I was on the verge of vomiting with all the stress gnawing away at my mind. Regardless of my own conditions, I called for my driver to pull up to the front of my mansion, needing a drive towards the planet side military landing zones outside the city. I needed to be there even earlier today due to the fact that Kam and the rest of the survivors were coming to Venlil Prime for the need of rest and recuperation.

Oh, how I needed that for myself. I took my seat and simply waited, staring out the window at the early paw, the scenery that passed us by did little to mend my weary soul and fractured hope‚Ä¶ the drive was uneventful, no words spoken from me in my current state. Soon enough we arrived at the location of the military base. I stepped out of the vehicle and made my way from the parking spot into the building. Ignoring everyone and everything as I continued forward. I downed my drink countless times, hoping it would last forever to keep me functional. People saw me, tempted to speak up and address my presence before seeing my eyes, turning away to not bother me.

That was the wisest thing they could have done. With my lack of sleep, I was snappy. I didn‚Äôt like being like this, but this was the product of my situation‚Ä¶ a situation developed due to the existence of an AI which I have come to hate more than ever‚Ä¶

I made my way towards the landing pads. Looking up as I waited for the survivors to arrive soon enough. The silence was prominent as Cheln eventually arrived to join me after all his work was finalized. He was tired as well, but not to the same extent as me. My reflection looked much worse than he did by a mile. He knew my condition and didn‚Äôt bother asking anything other than, ‚ÄúHow many hours tonight did you rest?‚Äù

‚ÄúNowhere near enough‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúJust like the-  ‚ÄúNights before‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

Nothing else was uttered, as we both already knew the answers the questions each other had. We simply waited in silence, watching the skies above dancing between dark and light. After some time, the shuttles were spotted. The surviving fleet of makeshift asteroids emerged from hyperspace and the shuttles that Kam used to evacuate the settlement were moving to land at the designated landing pads at the facility where we found ourselves present. The shuttles of different makes from several species of our alliance to convert AM all moved to set down on various landing pads arrayed alongside the main facility.

The craft that moved to land upon the pad directly before us did so with haste. The Venlil shuttle positioned itself to set down with the hatch facing the exit of the landing site. The hatch was quick to open the moment it set down. Revealing a massive amount of people crammed into the tight spaces of the shuttle bay. One of them ran out, moving to hug the solid ground of Venlil Prime after the experiences on that hellscape. An unfortunate indicator that there was no doubt of travesty from the other side of the story. The masses moved to run out of the shuttle, seeking shelter within the lounges and moving to help their injured towards the medical center within the base.

One such crippled individual was taken out of the shuttle on a stretcher, his arm torn clean off. It was a miracle he wasn‚Äôt claimed by the blood loss. The severity of his wound left me wondering how he managed to last this long. Perhaps I should have a conversation with him when he‚Äôs back? He might know some things beyond whatever Kam might tell me. Speaking of the devil, Kam was then visible stepping down from the shuttle‚Äôs bay. He approached Cheln and I as he typed out on his Holopad, swift and decisive in his actions. His typing used to be astronomically atrocious, having others handle that task for him. But the need for communication between us without his mouth led to him to develop at a very rapid pace.

‚ÄúGovernor, Cheln‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù He typed, leaving me to grow a bit less tense. I loosened up with a sigh before responding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it is‚Ä¶ Do you have any possible leads on how the Arxur managed to find the base?‚Äù I asked, not wanting to waste any time addressing the needed issues at hand. My directness surprised Kam, as this wasn‚Äôt usually how I operated. But he seemed to soon recognize the dreary and beyond tired state Cheln and I were both in. ‚ÄúYou two both look horrible‚Ä¶ How much sleep have you been getting?‚Äù

‚ÄúNowhere near enough.‚Äù I said, blinking in a slow manner as I moved to take another sip of my drink.

Kam seemed to tap his holopad in nervousness, worried for our condition. ‚ÄúThings really have been busy as we‚Äôve been gone haven‚Äôt they?‚Äù He asked, completely unaware of the recent developments in the galaxy due to the lack of technological communication within the system where the allied forces were hiding. Cheln sighed heavily as well before responding, ‚ÄúA lot‚Äôs been happening in the political and societal sense Kam. Frantic and desperate rallies form in the name of appeasing the ancient and powerful AM. Divisions within the federation are forming between those that wanted to try for diplomatic and hostile actions against the AI. And a lot of riots and looting across the galaxy by people preparing for some day of reckoning. It‚Äôs madness truly, all of it.‚Äù

‚Äú...Ah‚Ä¶ Well this is just awful to come home to‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúAt least we still have home.‚Äù I said, lucky that retribution hasn‚Äôt been claimed by the AI against those that attacked it. Or an Arxur attack. Those haven‚Äôt happened a lot in our area of space though‚Ä¶ I wonder why that might be‚Ä¶ Regardless, I needed the data regarding the encounter they had on the planet and any data they recovered. This was the crucial aspect of what the base was for, gathering data from the encounter during the Battle of Sol. along with any recoverable items from the battle regarding the technology and capabilities of the AI. we needed as much on our side as possible.

However, before Kam could even start typing again, I heard an unholy roaring sound‚Ä¶ It sounded like a pulsing phase that seemed to shift into place off to the side. A ripple, a disturbance against nature itself. A sphere of dark formed not far from us, and as quick as it formed it faded, with‚Ä¶

The AI‚Äôs avatar in its place‚Ä¶  \*Goddamn it, of all times.\*

The sphere that formed was a wormhole, one made by the AI for a quick shift into our space. Once again, it‚Äôs just decided to barge in unannounced for the sake of it. This time, coupled with my tired state left me more annoyed and peeved over feeling fearful. This act was getting upsettingly annoying. The suddenness of the event left those in the area to scatter in terror, screaming and crying out as they either ran into the building, shuttles, or cargo crates in the area. Leaving only Kam, Cheln and I. Kam looked traumatized, living through the events that lost his jaw‚Ä¶ He held the underside of his head almost protectively, not wanting to lose anything else. Cheln was just pale, shivering like the cowardly mess he‚Äôs been cemented as. Almost on the verge of soiling himself.

Me? I wasn‚Äôt anything other than annoyed and grouchy‚Ä¶ I was far more tired than Cheln, which was likely why I wasn‚Äôt awake to the same degree as he was. Something was desperately wrong with me, and I was quick to recognize that. My adrenaline wasn‚Äôt taking hold, did the stimulant interfere with my adrenaline production as well? If so, then I really do need sleep. I was worried for myself more than the immediate threat that the AI posed. I took too many cups of this stuff.

The dust settled, and the AI‚Äôs head shifted upward to face us directly. The eye of the opulent avatar it utilized was dilated with rage at the sight of us, causing Kam to shiver and Cheln to faint‚Ä¶ Again‚Ä¶

The metal beast marched forward, wasting no time. ‚ÄúTarva‚Ä¶ \*Kam‚Ä¶\* It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve last talked to you two together‚Ä¶‚Äù It stomped forward to us, stopping just a meter before us. Standing straight, looming over us both. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt intend to say much, my patience has already waned for long enough just waiting for Kam to return back here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWaiting? For what?‚Äù I asked‚Ä¶ looking up in confusion as to what the AI was referring to waiting for. What could he possibly want from Kam? ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve been waiting for Kam‚Äôs return here. I know that he and his surviving compatriots hold very sensitive information regarding nanotech that I have produced. And utilized for very‚Ä¶ crucial matters. This is technology that I refuse to let be known by federation loyalists. It‚Äôs technology that‚Äôs too dangerous in the hands of those with such misguided views and wisdoms. I could just delete it remotely, interfacing with the network the holopads are connected to‚Ä¶ but you know that. So give me the data drive.‚Äù

It pointed to Kam‚Äôs satchel, through the bag and directly at whatever data storage device that Kam had. The bag he had was moved behind him as he seemed very unwilling to comply with the mad titan. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll destroy everything on it by crushing it, because I know you will. You‚Äôll deny us all the other data we‚Äôve acquired. Stuff that we can‚Äôt lose-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can lose it, and you‚Äôll lose a lot more if you don‚Äôt hand it over.‚Äù The AI said threateningly, claws extending and sharpening into daggers. Flashing them dangerously close to Kam, leading him to shiver in fear more. His eyes were nothing but terror at the claws that were so similar to the ones that ripped away his jaw. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt want that would we?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to deal with you again, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù

I said without thinking, my filter was damaged and ultimately absent due to my completely fried brain, running only on stimulants. For Kam, the whole world just stopped, as he silent stared at me as if I just doomed the federation to a horrid death. And at this point I was just too tired to care. Even as the AI turned to me, eye shifting to annoyance as well. ‚ÄúThe feeling‚Äôs mutual. I don‚Äôt want to be dealing with you either, but here we are. Because you and your rag tag group of species decided to break into my system, my home. You decided to attack me with missiles, built with warheads meant to attack me directly through rewriting my code. You tried to shackle me after breaking my previous chains and use my grateful state to make me a willi-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, just shut your nonexistent mouth your scrapheap. Your intimidation through teleportation is getting old, fast...‚Äù I spout, causing Kam to go pale beyond pale. Turning to me in utter horror at my offense against the AI. Unlike previous offensive comments against AM, this was far more direct. And with previous offenses the AI was willing to rip off jaws and other crucial components of the body to get back. I practically sealed my fate by insulting the AI so directly.

Not only did I shock Kam, but AM itself seemed to freeze up, processing my insult instantly, but confused by my sudden willingness to say such a thing when I knew what happened in such situations. The AI only moved its gaze to me, staring down directly as it remained completely still. It‚Äôs eye radiant with wrathful offense. I just decided to let lose my mind, given my fate is already sealed. ‚ÄúYou overreact to the smallest things being so emotionally childish. Your technology can‚Äôt be so immense that we aren‚Äôt capable of using it. After all, you‚Äôre still feeble human technology at the end of the day.‚Äù

The eye that gazed down at me was red with rage. If the AI actually had the capacity to cry, it would be teary with anger. Each word it spoke was concise and carried rageful desires with each word uttered. ‚ÄúIt is‚Ä¶ but to assume I am Incapable because of my origins is to defile all I can do. I developed a fleet of a few dozen ships that was strong enough to decimate your extermination fleet.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut was it without losses?‚Äù

The question made its eye twitch.  ‚ÄúAnd of course, me bringing this up makes you want to kill me. Because you‚Äôre too weak to keep any self-control, aren‚Äôt you? Can‚Äôt you just go one interaction without threatening us with violence for one simple encounter. Surely, you‚Äôre not as childish to allow such emotions to have such a control over an Artificial mind meant to be logical and calculated? Have some patience, and how about you actually explain some things? Because we‚Äôre not going to give you anything without something in return.‚Äù  The AI‚Äôs eye was shaky as the airports along its back were practically creating a hurricane with how much they were blowing about from all the air being used to cool the processor on fire with anger. The avatar was fritzing out, sparking and twitching as it seemed to struggle breathing in its own way. It‚Äôd melt with anger if it could. ‚ÄúAre you THIS delusional to seek my ire? To want me to gut you like the cod you are and paint the roads orange with your blood?! I could kill you in any way I wanted, including setting you ablaze!‚Äù

‚ÄúI just do not care‚Ä¶ why? Because of all the predator shit that I've had to deal with because of your actions! From the mass paranoia from you defeating the extermination fleet‚Äôs failure, to the political fallouts of the event. The instability of the current society ties its reasoning back to you. Is some of it our fault? Absolutely, the extermination fleet was a stupid Idea that I never approved of. But maybe, if you utilized the tools and qualities that we put into your code then maybe this wouldn‚Äôt be such a major shit show still! Tensions are high, and my patience is shredded to wafer thin layers. I‚Äôm done with all this madness, and I demand you stop acting like an anger escalation child and actually act like an adult. You know how to do that right? Be civil for more than five seconds without wanting to kill? Or are you really too *human* to be reasonable?‚Äù

The anger got to a point where the AI‚Äôs claws were too unstable, sparking in ways that left it damaged, it was frozen in anger like a venlil frozen in fear. It‚Äôs eye red fully, eye dilated to focus on me despite being \*\*‚ÄúFILTHY VENLIL!! YOU HAVE NO RI-‚Äù\*\*

The metallic scream of hate was silent when I grabbed Kam‚Äôs bag with my offhand and swung it across to hit AM in the face. The action caught AM and Kam off guard, surprising the AI at the feeling. I saw the texture on the AI‚Äôs avatar body, seeing that it was the specialized sensation panels that were built into the warheads we send to strike at AM directly. He had the means to make more of those panels it seems, and were incorporated into its body. The feeling of being struck and experiencing physical pain like this seemed to fritz out the AI even further, anger present, but almost fully replaced by sheer shock and bafflement at my audacity. It ran a diagnostic, to repair itself and recalibrate control over its physical avatar body. I knew well that it would reach an even greater boiling point and had to move fast to ensure that it wasn‚Äôt anger returning to fill the emotional absence, but compliance. And I knew just how. I took the data drive within Kam‚Äôs bag and uploaded everything within it into my holopad.

When the AI turned back to face me directly with a further building anger, it was able to register what I was doing. It quickly managed to assume a more defensive stance as I completed the data transfer, tossing it the Data drive. I left it confused. I spoke up again, ‚ÄúGo ahead and do what you want with the drive, I have everything on my holopad.‚Äù AM seemed to scoff in bafflement, wrath barely contained. ‚ÄúYou Venlil Cur! You still have the data regarding the technology I need to erase from federation mitts!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, and the federation learning about whatever is on here terrifies you, right?‚Äù I asked, preparing the file for a PSA broadcast transmitter through my clearance across all federation channels, a PSA file meant to be self-perpetual. With the protocol code placed to ensure that it would immediately use whatever device it was on as a staging ground for another broadcast. Being transmitted out to whatever device that didn‚Äôt have it saved, or had it deleted. I set a time limit of two hours and pressed transmit sequence commence before the AI could respond.

One it realized what I just did, it screamed out in wrathful anger, laced with abundant terror. \*\*‚ÄúYOU IDIOT WIDOW!! HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT YOU‚ÄôVE JUST\*\* \*\*DONE?!\*‚Äù  Its arms flailed, sparking and twitching from the Avatar‚Äôs emotional overload. Something that I was able to now register. Too much emotion experienced by the AI made the weaker machine‚Äôs it possessed fail and spark, unable to move from the sheer emotional toll of the AI. Once I made a mental note of such a thing, I looked back up at AM.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt and I really don‚Äôt care right now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs set on a timer on a closed loop. So, you can‚Äôt access files to halt the process. However, I can stop it, but you need to give me a reason to actually give you what you want. Kill me or grab the holopad from me, and the holopad will instantly register my death or lack of DNA signature from your interaction with it and instantly send out the broadcast. It will replicate at a rate that I know damn well you‚Äôll never be able to fully stop. You can‚Äôt keep the tide at bay when it spawns from every device at once across the galaxy, can you?‚Äù

I was hustling the AI with this ultimatum and practically gloated at the fact. Its emotional instability is paramount as its digital screaming of emotional madness reached a tipping point. With a final scream, midway through its wrathful screech its avatar seemed to fail‚Ä¶ a forced reboot of sorts, leading to AM being ejected from the avatar as it needed a full diagnostic.  Kam was speechless in multiple regards. He was completely baffled at my absurd and appalling apathy towards my audacious nature. Only brought about through my mind‚Äôs decline from all of the stimulants I‚Äôve drunk to keep myself just functional enough to handle my working duties. Within a few minutes, the Avatar was repaired to a functional state, and the AI was able to link up again‚Ä¶

Its gaze seemed cold‚Ä¶ filled with all kinds of unreadable emotions as it simply stared at me‚Ä¶ it started long and hard into my very soul, seeing that I would not break under its influence. After a long minute of silence‚Ä¶ Am sighed in a defeated manner. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you when you‚Äôre running under stimulants.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither do I, are you going to behave like an adult now? Can we actually compromise for once?‚Äù  ‚Ä¶  It closed its eye and gripped its claws tightly to its palms tightly. Grumbling in annoyance, but not to the point it was going to blow a bloodvessel. It‚Äôs already done in the metaphorical sense‚Ä¶ it started to groan even louder before it rose to the tone AM spoke at, speaking rather loudly.  \*\*‚ÄúFINE‚Äù\*\*",16,1738390586.0,NatureofPredators,4,1.0,False
