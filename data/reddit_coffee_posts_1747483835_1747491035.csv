My parents worked long hours and were rarely around but still very strict. Couldn‚Äôt afford to go to prom or do things my friends got to do. I went to university and afterwards spent several years paying off my student loans while running multiple jobs supporting my parents. I married into a wealthy family but everything came with strings attached. At first, he tricked me into thinking he‚Äôd treat me like a princess. He bought me nice clothes and took me to nice places. It took me several years to realize I was being abused. My ex would grab my hair, push me, choke me, swear at me, yell at me, in front of our kids and then apologize by buying me expensive things and then blame me for using up all his money. If I refused to go out shopping with him he‚Äôd blow up and blame me for not accepting his apology and then he‚Äôd get angry about something  totally unrelated and blame me for it. I also had to beg for forgiveness and got shingles a few times a year from the stress. I also suffered from a real painful stomach ulcer that took several months to heal. I also found out he was cheating on me during this time. I left after 13 years and have never looked back. I told myself I‚Äôd rather live dirt poor than live in hell. My parents were not happy with my decision and wanted me to suck things up saying that all this was normal in asian culture. That really hurt and till this day stings my heart.

I got $0 from the divorce because our home and his business was in his parents‚Äô name. After the divorce, social services had to get involved because he was abusing the kids. The kids no longer see him and we are much happier. I climbed many mountains to get here but now i‚Äôm exhausted.  I feel robbed and suffer from ptsd. I also grieve the life i wanted SO badly, I work FT + carry the burden of the world on my shoulders. I‚Äôm always so tired and exhausted. After work, I drive my kids to their activities, help with homework, cook, clean, pay all the bills all on a single income. My friends have settled into beautiful homes, eat out, go shopping, go on trips and i feel poor and out of place. I feel like i‚Äôve missed out in life. Never got to enjoy my childhood, didn‚Äôt get to enjoy my adolescence and didn‚Äôt get to enjoy married life either. I‚Äôve been trying to go out with friends for coffee to get a break only to come home feeling worse after hearing about my friends talking about their next trip, plans for the weekend, etc etc...I deleted IG and FB for my mental health.

1kotuef,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kotuef/guys_i_need_help/,Guys I need help..,"I want to start by saying I've read countless threads in here and watched numerous videos about methods. I even went to a local cafe in Toronto where a national cupping/tasting champion works and had him show me some things.


My problem? Everything I make tastes burnt. No notes, no nuance, it's just burnt. 


Here's what I use, all of the equipment was bought new:


- Dripper: V60 switch 03 (immersion brew 2min or 4:6 method)
- Grinder: 1zpresso zp6. Tried between 5.5 - 7 clicks
- Beans: Rogue Wave, various African and south American beans. Always within 2 months of roast. Light, medium roast.
- Filters: hario paper tabbed and Cafec abaca
- Kettle: gooseneck kettle with temperature presets (and I check with a thermometer). Water temperature between 93-96.
- generic scale + carafe 
- Ratio: experimented with 1:15 up to 1:18


I've made 200+ cups easily. I have done all sorts of combinations and changed up the variables to dial in my coffees. I've made 3-4 cups per morning changing up the variables, just to dial it in.


 I have tried various beans, using the different methods until I find the right combination. When I do write it down. But EVERYTHING tastes burnt. I've literally made 2 cups that tastes great and I couldn't replicate the result even tho I wrote it down. I don't understand. Eventually I thought it was my pallete but when I try pourover from local Toronto cafes, they taste great.



I have no idea what's going on and why everything tastes burnt. And I mean burnt. I've used different kettles, different grinders, measure my water temperature. I don't know what's left. 

I know people usually ask for specific recipes but I've done so many various combinations there's no way I haven't tried most combinations possible with the above equipment. And it can't be my water because it doesn't even taste bad.

1kotsir,https://www.dodmagazine.es/critica-the-head-and-the-heart-aperture/,Aperture Review from Spain,"Saw the band posted this on Twitter. Interesting to read the perspective from a different country‚Ä¶ this one sums up perfectly how I feel about this band and this album. I had to have it translated so here‚Äôs that- 

Ever since those guys from Seattle came into my life back in 2009 with their first album, they‚Äôve taken up permanent residence among my essential records‚Äîwithout asking for permission. Sixteen years later, The Head and The Heart are still orbiting in my musical universe like stubborn satellites. They didn‚Äôt invent anything, but they‚Äôre irreplaceable at what they do: pop melodies dressed in classic rock clothing‚Äîtoo AOR for the hipsters, too dark for the pop crowd. Melancholy as a language, sweetness without syrup, an emotional soundtrack that runs parallel to life: light, shadows, the occasional tremor.

Aperture is, without exaggeration, their most accomplished work since that debut that felt like a love letter to everything good about the ‚Äô70s. Here, the melodies don‚Äôt hurt‚Äîthey shine. They radiate with the epic feel of small gestures: making a cup of coffee while the world falls apart. These are songs that lift your spirits even as they tell stories of collapse. True pop‚Äîthe kind that isn‚Äôt afraid to show its scars. Anthems that whisper in your ear rather than shout at you from a glow-stick-lit stage. Take Arrow: a gem of surgical precision, where everyone in the band restrains themselves and connects, as if they‚Äôre playing for and with each other. The vocal melody and harmonies have the natural perfection of a calm sunrise.

From there, the album unfolds like a sonic postcard of their best qualities: pop with real substance, rock without insecurity, arrangements crafted down to the last detail. Everything Coldplay tries to be but can‚Äôt pull off‚Äîbecause they smother it in glitter and Mr. Wonderful quotes. There‚Äôs no trick here. There‚Äôs truth. The echoes are obvious: Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac, Wings without McCartney‚Äôs ego, Electric Light Orchestra when they got sentimental. But there‚Äôs also something much harder to find: honesty. A golden light surrounds everything, even when it‚Äôs talking about the worst kind of pain‚Äîloss. They‚Äôve been through hard years‚Äîas a band, as people, as a planet‚Äîand you can feel it. But what was once gray now has a luminous patina. Floating pianos, acoustic guitars that caress, percussion that serves just the right amount of drama. Songs like West Coast or Time In My Sins are pure emotional alchemy.

And yes, there are moments when the so-called ‚Äúindie folk‚Äù sound (or whatever label people use when they don‚Äôt understand something) pops in to draw a goofy smile from you. Not because it‚Äôs simple, but because these folks know how to make small things shine. They‚Äôre epic with the bare minimum. They don‚Äôt need fireworks or choruses dressed like a protest march to move you. That‚Äôs Arcade Fire‚Äôs department‚Äîexperts at turning every song into an emotional rally with costumes, megaphones, and the entire Etsy catalog hanging from the stage. These guys, on the other hand, hug you without making a scene.

Cop Car is a perfect pastiche: Pavement meets the Beach Boys meets the Beta Band in one gulp. Sarcasm and beauty. And Blue Embers‚Ä¶ what can I say. Elton John and Billy Joel would sell their left kidneys to write something like that in 2025. And the worst part? It sounds easy. It sounds good. All the time. As if they‚Äôve been playing together in the same room for years without saying a word‚Äîbut understanding everything. The vocal harmonies are next level. Only Fleet Foxes or The Jayhawks, when they‚Äôre inspired, could stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Songs like Fire Escape, After The Setting Sun, or Aperture (which gives the album its title and closes it out with brutal elegance) are understated but undeniable gems.

And no, it won‚Äôt show up on any year-end ‚ÄúBest Of‚Äù lists. Because for that, you need a community manager with a beard, thick-rimmed glasses, and a TikTok account.
But you know what? It doesn‚Äôt matter. Some records are made to last, not to burn bright and fade. They may lack marketing or Instagram-ready charisma, but they have songs to spare. Put on Pool Break and then tell me if I‚Äôm exaggerating. Maybe it‚Äôs better this way. That they stay a secret for a few. That the algorithm doesn‚Äôt find them. That they keep writing this secret, modest, glorious discography that‚Äîyears from now‚Äîsomeone will stumble upon like a forgotten treasure.",1,1747490718.0,TheHeadandTheHeart,0,1.0,False

Kendu has a crazy work output and if past memecoin successes have taught us anything‚Ä¶. It is that you should never ever doubt a hardworking community, these communities have always come out on top, for example, Shiba Inu, Pepe and , were all backed by a solid community that drove them to the top and Kendu will be no different. This is entirely my own opinion and NFA, but I do not see Kendu below 10 billion this cycle, a community like Kendu‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm 28 days caffeine-free after being a hardcore user since early childhood‚Äîsodas, sweet tea, black tea, energy drinks, and eventually STRONG coffee. For years, I thought I was just ‚Äúanxious,‚Äù ‚Äúwired,‚Äù or ‚Äúintroverted.‚Äù But now I see that I was simply overstimulated‚Äîfor decades.

Since quitting, my speech is calmer, my breath deeper, and my upper back/neck tension is slowly melting. My nervous system is relearning safety‚Äîand I‚Äôm finally understanding what ‚Äúcalm‚Äù really means. Not the false calm from a crash, but actual inner stillness.

And here‚Äôs the wild part: Now that I‚Äôm out of the caffeine fog, I can see it in others.

The frantic speech patterns

The jittery energy masked as ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù

The irritability and crashes blamed on everything except caffeine

The need for constant stimulation and productivity

The eyes that never fully settle


It‚Äôs like I unplugged from the matrix. I don‚Äôt judge anyone still in it‚ÄîI was in it. But now I get it. I see how normalized this addiction is, and how much it shapes people‚Äôs identities and moods. The ‚Äúhustle‚Äù culture isn‚Äôt just psychological‚Äîit‚Äôs biochemical.

If you're reading this and considering quitting‚ÄîDO IT. You might not even know who you truly are until your nervous system has had time to recalibrate. It‚Äôs hard at first (no doubt), but the clarity, peace, and strength that return are absolutely worth it.

Anyone else feel this way after quitting? When did you start noticing this shift in how you saw others on caffeine?

\~\~Rumi's P.O.V\~\~

""Rumi! It's time to get up!""

What the hell is wrong with this woman? She keeps shouting for no reason. I was not looking forward to today. I'm starting my new school today in the middle of the semester. I got expelled from my other schools for fighting and arguing with the staffs. I have a big mouth and it seems to put me in a lot of trouble. I got expelled from my last school because I beat the hell out of three guys and the reason I got expelled from my other school was for beating the hell out of the security guard and arguing with the principal. A lot of people are afraid of me just because I don't talk too long, I don't argue for too long one wrong word or move from you and you're getting knocked out. I don't care who you are as long as my hands can reach you you're getting hit. My name is Rumi Richards. I am 18 years old and I live with my father and step mother. My father remarried after my mom died and I don't get along most times with him and his new wife. Don't ask why.

Oh and i'm also gay.

\~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~

""Rumi, it's time to go."""".

I sighed. ""I heard you the first time lady.""

""Rumi don't be rude!"" My father said as he walked pass my room.

Why do parents have to be so annoying. I got up and went to the bathroom and took a shower and combed my hair. I got dress and went downstairs I sat at the table while my step mom brought my breakfast but I ignored her and use my laptop to push the plate away. I don't mean to be rude so early but I'm not in the mood to deal with my parents or to acknowledge her burnt pancakes.

""Ready for your first day honey?"" she ask.

""No, I don't want to go.""I replied.

""Well you're going."" My dad said. He was rubbing my step mother's belly and smiling like he's crazy, She's pregnant with my sibling.

After I send my work to the printer I went back upstairs and brush my teeth and grab my keys. I went downstairs and place my laptop in my bag and grab a bunch of granola bars.

""Stay out of trouble kid"". my dad said.

""I'll try."" I grin at him.

""Bye Rumi"".My step mom said.

I just nod and exited the house.

I drove to school with the music blasting in my ears because I like it that way. I pulled in the school and got out. This place is actually nicer than it seems in the pictures online. There are teenagers running around and talking in groups. I walked into school, while doing that all eyes were on me. Whispers could be heard about how I look like a rebel, how hot I was and all different things you would expect from teenagers. I continued walking for a bit then it hit me, I didn't know where the hell I was going. A kid past me and I tap his shoulder he looked around and smile at me.

""Hi, I can tell you're new my name is Chad, do you want me to show you around?""

I could tell he's a polite person, and a nerd too. I've never seen thicker glasses frame in my life and the amount of books he is holding.

""Yea, my name is Rumi by the way"".

""Nice to meet you so what class do you have first?"".

""I don't know I'll have to go to my locker they place my time table in there"".

""Okay let's go"".

We walk down the hall and stop at the locker number that was in my email locker 343. I put in the code that was in my phone and open the locker. I heard gasp from all around me and I turn to see everyone staring at three boys walking into the school. I didn't care so I turn back to my locker took my time table out. someone tap my shoulder and I turn around and there were the three guys smirking at me. I think they are the ones that run this school so I know I wasn't going to act soft with them.

""You're the new kid right?"". The one at the front ask.

""I don't think you're blind but yes I am"". He narrowed his eyes at me.

""Don't talk to us like that"". He hissed,

""Unless you're my mother I'll talk to you anyway I want .""I gave them a evil smirk.

Chad cleared his throat.

""Um... hi Damien, this is Rumi he just got here so can you just leave him alone please?""

He look at Chad with a annoyed expression then back at me.

""Rumi huh? what? your mother ran out of names"". He made a fake pout face and his crew started laugh, even some people close by.

Anger rush through me as I let my fist connect with his jaw and he fell on the ground. How dare he talk about my mother!

He stood back and held his jaw. The people around us stopped what they were doing and was now looking at us. Some were in shock and some faces held amuse expressions.

""Dude, you're f\*cking insane!"" Damien yelled and rub his jaw.

""So what? What are you going to do now?"" I smirk when I saw hatred and anger in his eyes

He move toward me and I grinned ready to take on whatever was coming.

""No Damien, let Isaac deal with him tomorrow"".

The boy on the left said. Holding onto Damien.

""Fine, prepare for a beating on your second day Rumi"". Damien smirk as they walk away.

""Can't wait!"" I called after them.

Whispers began around us.

I turn to Chad who was there frozen. I snap my finger in his face and he blink a few times.

""Dude you have a big mouth, Isaac is going to kill you! why did you hit Damien?""

""Who's this Isaac kid?"" I ask.

""Isaac is the leader of those three, he's scary I grew up with him so I know"".

""Don't care who he is I'm not afraid of nobody.""

He sighed.

""Stay away from him Rumi he's trouble"".

""And because of that, I'm going to mess with him tomorrow"". I smirk.

""Let's just tour the school"". Chad sighed again.

# Chapter 2

I wake up and instantly became upset when I realize I have school today and still not familiar with my new school and the people there. I styed on my phone for a while then got up to take a shower when I remembered I have to finish my homework before school.

I walked into the bathroom and took a shower,I got dress and went downstairs. Dad was sitting at the table with his laptop in front of him on skype with some people.

""Morning"".

""Morning son"".

I look around for my step mom. she wasn't here.

""Where's Alicia?""I ask my father.

""She's at the clinic."" He whispered

""Okay.""

I filled my reusable cup with coffee and grab a granola bar then pick up my stuff and then I was out the door.

once I arrived to school I headed to my locker ignoring the calls from girls as they try to get my attention.

I continued to my locker and got my text book.

""Good morning Rumi.""

I turn when I heard the voice of my new friend chad.

""Were you waiting for me?"".

""Um yes"".

""So we're best friends now?""

""Pssh no, but I am your friend but you refuse to talk to anyone else.""

""And I am fine with both.""

""Weirdo."" Chad laugh

We walk to his locker and He got his books while he was showing me some posters he was going to place around the school in the corner of my eyes I could see some people approaching us.

""Good morning fellas, how are you two doing today?"" The guy at the front ask. I must say he was extremely handsome. He was breathtaking especially his smile. I was about to answer but I took behind him nd recognize idiots from yesterday and it hit me that this must be Isaac.

""I was having a good day but then you guys appear."" I said and roll my eyes.

""Well I heard you were giving my friends here trouble yesterday, do you want to explain that 'Rumi.'""

""Nope I'm good"". I faked a smile. The entire time Chad was looking down at the floor and shifting on his feet.

""He hit me!"". Damien yelled.

""Well it's your fault for getting on my nerves"". I yelled. Damien was about to reply but Issac beat him to it.

""I run this school and I can make you want to leave before the week ends, don't mess with us unless you want to end up in the hospital"". Isaac said and took a step closer to me.

""I'll mess with who ever I want Isaac, you don't scare me neither does your little backups"". I took a step closer to him.

""Don't temp me and shut up before I break your face"".

""Ohh I'm scared, yea we'll talk a next time, you know...when I care"".

This guy is hot, it's obvious but he is getting on my nerves, also he reminds me of someone.....oh yea me. I was staring at him he was tall, broad shoulders, black hair, pale skin, dark green eyes, small pink lips-

""Are you staring at me?"" he growled again.

""Yea I like staring"". I grin

""You are brave Rumi I'll give yo that, stay away from us if you want to make it through this school"".

""Listen kid, I don't have time for you nor your idiot followers behind you. I don't want to get in trouble on my second day so why don't you just run along"".

He balled his fist and aim at me but I shift and he hit the locker instead. I started laughing, a teacher clear his throat from behind us.

""Mr. Malik don't you there hit that boy.""

Isaac began to walk away with the three guys and the teacher.

""I'll see you later Rumi."" Isaac smirk as he walk away

""Nice meeting you too Isaac babe!""

I called after them and he glare at me.

""Don't mess with him Rumi, he doesn't play around."" Chad said.

""Well neither do I"".

I then bottled in several different recipes with some 16 ounce bottles back sweetened (light and medium) and some 4 ounce experimental bottles including agave syrup, coffee, vanilla, different varieties of honey, etc. Its all an experiment and I'm enjoying it so I'm not really after any advice or critiques yet.

I'm going to share with my friends and coworkers, basically looking for honest opinions on my experiment from them. So to my question. What are some good ways to ensure I made something safe to drink? How do I know I didn't make poison? Making a bunch of people sick is last on my list of things I want to do this week.

1kotnrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kotnrm/what_makes_truly_free_enzyme_laundry_stain/,What makes Truly Free Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover review stand out for pet stains?,"The day I first tried the Truly Free B096465RSC Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover felt like embarking on a laundry odyssey. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love the idea of magically erasing an innocent coffee spill or those gnarly grass stains from your kid‚Äôs soccer gear? My laundry routine has witnessed every type of fabric mishap possible, which is why I was particularly intrigued by this enzyme-powered laundry booster. This little powder promised a lot: it‚Äôs unscented, dye-free, and versatile enough to tackle stubborn blood stains, pet accidents, and even mystery couch blotches. Naturally, I put it to the test.

**Design and Packaging**

The first thing that struck me was the compact size of the packaging. Measuring just 5.35 x 4.69 x 0.35 inches and weighing only 2.4 ounces, it‚Äôs easy to store, which is a boon when you don‚Äôt have a sprawling laundry room. Though the sleek, minimalistic design was nice enough, I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was startled to see just how small it was. ‚ÄúFifty scoops of cleaning bliss in this tiny thing?‚Äù I wondered skeptically. Turns out, you don‚Äôt need a lot of powder to make a big impact, and the concentrated nature impressed me right from the start.

**Key Benefits**

- Features a natural formula free of dyes and synthetic fragrances.  
- Developed with powerful, water-activated enzyme technology.  
- Suitable for multi-purpose usage ‚Äì works on clothes, couch fabric, and other washable surfaces.  

My skepticism dwindled the moment I saw how efficiently it dissolved in water. Pre-treating stains was a straightforward process. A few scoops worked wonders on the aftermath of my toddler‚Äôs spaghetti dinner party.

[Check Truly Free B096465RSC price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b096465rsc/)

**Performance and Effectiveness**

From the instant it hit the water, the enzymes got to work. Coffee splashes on my blouse? Gone. The battlefield that was my son‚Äôs soccer uniform? Cleaned with no visible reminders of those muddy slide tackles. Even the stinky gym socks, which usually retain a faint sour smell no matter how much detergent you throw at them, came out odor-free. Since the product doesn't rely on artificial fragrances, there‚Äôs nothing to mask odors artificially‚Äîjust clean, neutral-smelling fabrics.  

I tried it on a fabric couch arm where my cat had decided to leave an artistic paw print of dirt. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that this works better on washable materials; the couch came out blemish-free only after a second treatment. But it delivered, nonetheless.  

**Weaknesses**

- Small package size might seem underwhelming at first glance.  
- Requires patience when used on particularly heavy stains.  
- Slightly more expensive than your standard detergent additives.  

**Merits**

It offers more than cleaning power. Knowing the formula is safe for my family's health was an unexpected relief. With no dyes or synthetic fragrances in its unscented form, it addresses sensitivities and allergies that many products ignore. Its eco-friendly ethos and the way it supports social projects make it feel like you‚Äôre investing in something worthwhile.  

- Works multiple ways as a stain remover and laundry booster.  
- Offers confidence of safety due to its natural ingredient list.  
- Has a positive social and environmental footprint.  

**Product Competitors**

This product had me thinking a lot about similar enzyme-based cleaners on the market. I‚Äôve tried OxiClean in the past, which also harnesses enzyme technology but tends to come scented with strong, almost overpowering fragrances. Another popular option is Biokleen Bac-Out, which performs phenomenally on organic debris yet lacks the same scope for tackling odors as robustly as this stain remover.

Where this powder really earns distinction is its truly boost-like ability to double as a pre-treatment and additive. OxiClean performed better on long-left stains, but it couldn‚Äôt compare when it came to odor removal. Meanwhile, Truly Free shines in handling ‚Äúfresh‚Äù stains while maintaining that evident environmentally conscious angle.  

**Affordable Quality**

Dollar for dollar, the small size makes this product seem like it comes at a premium compared to bigger brands like Tide‚Äôs stain pens or a box of baking soda. However, it‚Äôs all about concentration‚Äîthis is not a filler-heavy product, so a little genuinely goes a long way. For anyone searching for an effective yet eco-conscious option, it‚Äôs well worth the cost compared to the sub-par results from cheaper alternatives touting chemical-heavy formulations.

1kotnqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kotnqe/does_the_summer_infant_3dlite_double_stroller/,Does the Summer Infant 3Dlite Double Stroller Offer the Ideal Lightweight Solution Review?,"Using the Summer Infant 31923 3Dlite Double Stroller has been an essential part of life with two little ones. As someone who tests products daily and runs headlong into everyday parenting chaos, I dove into this stroller with hefty expectations. This isn‚Äôt my first dive into the world of double strollers, but it certainly left a memorable mark.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What struck me first was the lightweight aluminum frame paired with its sleek black finish. It gives the stroller a modern, polished look without feeling flimsy. At just 21 pounds, carrying and stowing it into the trunk felt effortless, even on days where life had left me running on fumes. Dual padded seats with adjustable recline and 5-point safety harnesses gave my toddlers both comfort and security during strolls. Oh, and the pop-out sun visors? Lifesavers on sunny afternoons.

Having pushed a double stroller down narrow store aisles and rugged trails, I‚Äôm picky about wheel designs. The anti-shock front wheels surprised me, keeping my kids from bouncing around like popcorn kernels even on uneven terrain. Lockable rear wheels were another bonus. Stops at coffee shops no longer felt like a game of ‚Äúchase the runaway stroller.‚Äù  

[Grab Summer Infant 31923 at the best price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b095jmdhg1/)

**Storage Options Galore**  
Two extra-large storage baskets? Yes, please. I managed to pack snacks, diapers, wipes, toys, and quite possibly half my kitchen during park outings. The two rear storage pouches carried my on-the-go essentials such as keys and my phone, while the cup holder handled my ever-important caffeine supply. As someone who‚Äôs dealt with strollers that barely offer enough storage for a wallet, this felt like a dream.

**Ease of Folding and Portability**  
Folding this thing up is shockingly simple, and the carry handle made transportation smooth. The folded size, at 38.5""L x 13""W x 15.5""H, fit neatly in my car‚Äôs trunk space without the usual Tetris maneuvers. For parents constantly moving between car seats, daycare drop-offs, and weekend trips, this makes a significant difference.

**Benefits**  
- Lightweight aluminum frame simplifies carrying.  
- Individual recline allows customization for both children.  
- Sun visors protect kids from harsh sunlight.  
- Compact fold design is a space saver.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The cup holder feels undersized for larger bottles.  
- Limited color options: would‚Äôve loved more vibrant choices.  

**Performance on Various Terrains**  
Gliding this through streets, sidewalks, and grassy parks provided me with a clearer picture of its versatility. While the anti-shock front wheels are wonderful for maneuvering over curbs and uneven roads, I noticed it handled gravel driveways less gracefully. It‚Äôs great for urban strolls, not exactly a heavy-duty adventure stroller.

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this to similar strollers I‚Äôve tested before, it certainly shines in key areas. The umbrella-style design offers fantastic portability compared to bulkier jogging strollers like the Baby Jogger Summit X3 Double. While others come loaded with car-seat compatibility or built-in suspension, they often compromise on weight and foldability. This Summer Infant stroller struck a balance between being a parent-friendly travel system and a lightweight option. However, Nuna Demi Grow or UPPAbaby Vista V2 might be worth exploring for families seeking luxury and interchangeable features.

**Value for Money**  
For what it offers, this double stroller scores high in cost-effectiveness. Most lightweight models sacrifice storage or child comfort, but this product didn‚Äôt require compromises in either. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt come with all the bells and whistles of some high-end strollers, but it gives practicality and user-friendliness without breaking the bank. Parents looking for a reliable everyday option will probably find it worth every penny.

1kothwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewilddotty/comments/1kothwn/kennys_secret_comes_to_light/,Kenny‚Äôs Secret Comes To Light,"It‚Äôs been awhile since I began a relationship with my young neighbor, Kenny. At the time he expressed a liking for me besides a neighborly friendship, I thought it was joke. I laughed him thinking he was just being kind to a much older woman than he, but he was serious.

I‚Äôm over twice his age, he being only 19. He flattered me with compliments about my looks and how he‚Äôd love to get with me, sexually. I was stunned at first by this revelation and told him to go on and cut it out. Said he was very much attracted to me. 

Well, me being divorced and not having had any male company since then, 11 months at the time, his persistence on the topic wore down my better judgment and began a sexual relationship with this young neighbor, my only neighbor.

Kenny led me to believe that I was the first woman my age he had ever been with, which I found out months later was a lie.His excitement when with me made me feel special and I really let my hair down, letting go in every way with him. I discovered a brand new excitement by having sex with such a youngster.

Kenny was over one Saturday when a car pulled into his driveway. He lives about 150 feet across the yard from me. Kenny was startled, troubled like I hadn‚Äôt seen before by seeing this car. I asked who it was and what was the problem. He started to quickly get dressed.

He said it was his step-aunt, Kim. I said, ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôll get dressed and invite her over for a drink. We‚Äôre just neighbors, right? She doesn‚Äôt need to know about us. She would never think that anyways once she meets me. I‚Äôd like to meet one of your family members.‚Äù

Kenny was flushed in the face, seemingly flustered as he pulled on his shoes. ‚ÄúWell! Well, I don‚Äôt know. Auntie Kim is different. She‚Äôs my stepdad‚Äôs older sister. I‚Äôll talk to you later, ok Dotty?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt imagine why Kenny was so startled by her arrival as he went out the kitchen door. I stood at the bay window watching across lawn as Kenny trotted over to the car. His Aunt was already out of the car and had the trunk open.

Kenny‚Äôs aunt is an attractive, tall woman from what I could gather from this distance. Long, wavy blonde hair, curvy, and I‚Äôd guess fiftyish in age. She must be staying a bit because she set a suitcase and a smaller case down when seeing Kenny.

I happy response from Kim when seeing her young step nephew. She threw her arms around Kenny giving him a tight bear hug shaking him side to side. 

She kept Kenny against her as she pulled her head back to face his face. Smiling as she spoke and it appeared that she was grinding against him. She laughed then it appeared that there was something more going on besides a normal family visit.

She kissed Kenny, not a little cheek peck, but right on his mouth, and forceful it was. Aunt Kim‚Äôs one hand traveled down Kenny‚Äôs back and she gripped his ass.

Kenny wiggled away from her grip, glancing quickly in my direction and said something to Kim as he picked up her luggage. She just laughed and flipped her hand towards my house, as if to say, ‚ÄòSo what.‚Äù Kenny must have told her that neighbors could be watching, or something. She followed Kenny into the house, still smiling and talking a mile a minute.

I still didn‚Äôt know what to make of the greeting she gave Kenny as I watched her round bubble butt twitch through the back door of Kenny‚Äôs place. 

Kim wore white slacks that looked like they were painted on they were so tight. The pink, low cut tank top was just as tight, revealing a large cleavage that her large tits made. I can see how her presence could get young Kenny‚Äôs attention if there was more going on with this Auntie.

I got dressed and went about some chores as I kept thinking about this Auntie Kim and if there was more going on between her and Kenny. Couldn‚Äôt be, though. Kenny told me I was the first mature woman he had ever been with. I was 43 years old when I started fucking him, and Kim was, I guessed, a few years older than I. Kim is very attractive for an older gal, I must admit. Was Kenny hiding the truth from me, hmm?

I don‚Äôt care at all if Kenny is screwing his step auntie. I don‚Äôt like him lying to me all. I guess I understand why he wouldn‚Äôt share that me, or anyone else. Maybe he thinks I would find that weird or something. It is a step aunt, though. They‚Äôre not related really. Now I‚Äôm curious to find out and if so, I‚Äôd like to hear about it, too. That‚Äôs weird, huh?

A couple of hours passed since auntie Kim arrived and I heard nothing from Kenny. Saturdays are usually spent here having fun and hanging out. Good thing Kenny and I fucked before his surprise visit from his attractive Auntie. Guess I got use to having the youngster after me all day on weekends. 

I finally called over to see what was up, and invite Kenny and Auntie over for a drink, maybe cookout for supper. I was curious, nosy you can say, and would like to meet Auntie Kim.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting Kim to answer the phone. A soft, whispery hello answered. I wasn‚Äôt contemplating Kim answering so I hesitated a bit then gave a perky hello back. I asked if Kenny was there and Kim said he was in the shower.

I introduced myself as Kenny‚Äôs neighbor across the way. We live on a lake and fire lane and my home and the one that Kenny rents are the only ones on this lane.

‚ÄúOh yes. Kenny told me about you. Dotty, right? Says he helps you with chores and things. I‚Äôm his auntie Kim. Step auntie really. I was in town for a seminar and thought I‚Äôd surprise my favorite nephew. Nice to meet you, Dotty. Can I give Kenny a message?‚Äù Kim asked.

‚ÄúNo, I saw that you had arrived earlier when Kenny was here helping me with some things. He told me who you were and I had told him to invite you over for a drink, coffee or something. You‚Äôre more than welcome to come over if you wish. Did Kenny tell you that?‚Äù I explained and asked.

‚ÄúNo he didn‚Äôt. Must have slipped his mind, you know, with the surprise of me showing up unannounced and all. I‚Äôd like that, though. Thanks for the invite. I‚Äôm sure he meant to bring that up eventually. We hadn‚Äôt seen one another in awhile and had some catching up to do. I‚Äôll tell him you called and maybe see you soon. I could use a nice drink.‚Äù Kim said with a giggle.

Good to her word, I saw Kim and Kenny coming across the lawn to my place.

This is my first post in here. I‚Äôm having a blast with my garden. This is my third season ever growing a garden so I am very much a novice and learning as I go. Please don‚Äôt mind the weeds between the stones - they‚Äôll be gone soon enough :)

Garden update:
- All veggies growing nicely
- I have a few peppers forming and one early one that could probably be harvested soon
- I‚Äôm a bit surprised at how quickly my pepper plants have grown tall. I‚Äôm assuming it is because I bought them from the store rather than planting from seed.

I never had problems with my seedling peppers but these store-bought ones are struggling to stay upright in the wind.
- did some weeding and mulching today until I got too hot. Taking a coffee break now
- ordered some Irish moss seeds. Going to plant Irish moss in between the stones. It will need to be started inside and transplanted outside
- the zucchini plants aren‚Äôt growing the way I anticipated. Looks like I will have to do some vigorous pruning and training to get them to go up the trellis. It might not work though.

1kot1sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1kot1sd/real_title_and_link_please/,Real title and link please," The title says: Should‚Äôve Known, This Family Worth No Tears, but it's the second story in the book online need the real title 


 On my eighteenth birthday, the day of my coming‚Äìof‚Äìage ceremony, my parents were kidnapped. My fianc√©, Vincent Milton, went alone to rescue them, only to return with both legs shattered and his body gravely injured. 

Moved to tears by his sacrifice, I willingly donated a kidney to him, enduring the toll of surgery that left me physically weak and dependent on lifelong medication. 

With reddened eyes, he proposed to me, vowing to love me for the rest of his life. 

For three years after our marriage, I remained childless. 

When I secretly sought in‚Äìvitro fertilization, I accidentally overheard a conversation between Dr. Beckham and my husband. 

‚ÄúMr. Milton, back then, you and the Ainsworth family orchestrated the kidnapping to seize your wife‚Äôs kidney and uterus. And now, you want me to replace her eggs with Ms. Louise‚Äôs? Isn‚Äôt this too unfair to your wife? What if she finds out?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never find out. So many years have passed, and she hasn‚Äôt suspected a thing. She even blames herself for being useless, thinking IVF is her only option. Tsk. How laughable.‚Äù Vincent chuckled carelessly. 

Dr. Beckham hesitated for a moment before mustering the courage to advise him, ‚ÄúMr. Milton, secrets don‚Äôt stay buried forever. Your wife has been undergoing IVF treatments for two years now. Her body-‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough. I don‚Äôt want to hear it.‚Äù Vincent cut him off dismissively, his tone indifferent. 

‚ÄúRemember, I‚Äôm the one paying you, not Sierra,‚Äù he added glumly. 

‚ÄúFrom now on, don‚Äôt bring this up again. If Louise hears it, she‚Äôll be upset.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for Louise needing her kidney and uterus back then, do you think I would have married her? She was nothing more than a backup, a tool I kept for Louise‚Äôs sake.‚Äù 

As the conversation in the office gradually faded into silence, my mind reeled in panic. My breath hitched, and before I could think, I turned and fled. 

When Vincent returned home that evening, Louise was by his side. 

The moment he saw me, a flicker of panic flashed across his eyes, but he quickly regained his composure and casually sat down beside me. 

‚ÄúSierra, didn‚Äôt you go for your IVF treatment today?‚Äù 

At the mention of ‚ÄúIVF,‚Äù an inexplicable bitterness welled up in my heart. 

Louise, now seated closely beside Vincent, smiled at me. ‚ÄúSis, if you‚Äôre struggling to conceive, I know some folk remedies that might help.‚Äù 

Before I could respond, Vincent interjected, ‚ÄúLouise, don‚Äôt say such things. Your sister will surely get pregnant. Those so‚Äìcalled remedies are unreliable‚Äìdon‚Äôt believe in them,

Before I could respond, Vincent interjected, ‚ÄúLouise, don‚Äôt say such things. Your sister will surely get pregnant. Those so‚Äìcalled remedies are unreliable‚Äìdon‚Äôt believe in them, 

alright?‚Äù 

His words, full of concern for Louise, felt like a cruel joke to me. 

Just then, Vincent‚Äôs phone rang. He excused himself and went to the study room. 

As soon as he was gone, the gentle facade on Louise‚Äôs face disappeared. 

‚ÄúSister,‚Äù she sneered, her voice dripping with malice, ‚Äúa barren hen like you should just leave already and make room for me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt left Vincent back then, do you think you would‚Äôve had the chance to take my place? You wouldn‚Äôt be Mrs. Milton‚Äìthe woman every socialite in the city envies.‚Äù 

She suddenly grabbed my wrist, her nails digging into my flesh. 

‚ÄúThis position was mine from the start. And it will always be mine.‚Äù 

The moment she finished speaking, she abruptly threw herself backward, crashing into the coffee table. The sound of tea set shattering echoed through the room. 

‚ÄúLouise!‚Äù 

Vincent rushed over, taking quick strides to kneel beside her, his face full of concern. ‚ÄúAre you hurt? Let me see!‚Äù 

Louise weakly leaned into his embrace, her voice trembling as she fought back tears. 

‚ÄúVince, please don‚Äôt blame Sierra. It was my fault. I couldn‚Äôt resist sharing my pregnancy news with her, and then‚Ä¶ then she just‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know if my baby will be okay. What if‚Ä¶ what if I lose my baby because of this fall?‚Äù 

‚ÄúVince, I-‚Äù 

Before I could even utter a word in my defense, Vincent shot me a vicious glare. Without another thought, he scooped Louise into his arms and hurried out the door, leaving me standing there. ",1,1747488611.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

My husband never had a honeymoon, so after 8 years and two kids, we decided to go to one of my dream places, Kauai. I‚Äôm a fan of the history and geographical mapping of this island.

We wanted to stay somewhere with no kids and not at an Airbnb. We liked the idea of breakfast brought to us each morning. We were so flustered by all the airbnbs and giant resorts. My husband found Ko‚Äôa Kea and it said it was kid friendly, but the other resorts had all the amenities for kids. Great. That actually sounds great! The resort offered a really, really great honeymoon package and we reserved it through them! Immediately becoming flustered by all the information online, we just called concierge and got a hold of Becky. Becky, if you read this, you were so great and you are really good at your job!

3.21 - Tidepools, 2 pax at 7:30pm

** Tidepools and Keoki‚Äôs Paradise had such a great atmosphere and staff, we loved it! The food wasn‚Äôt near as good as Eating House and Red Salt, but overall, great time.

Our stay at Ko‚Äôa Kea was perfect for us. We could rent gear there, we were between both beaches, drinks, food and service was top notch. Most of all, it was quiet and not crowded.

We walked to the shopping centers a lot because they were close by. Saw the turtles every night. Beautiful!

Let‚Äôs talk about Jill! She was marvelous. We were scarred having a driver would be pricey, but as the days went on, we were impressed each time we got in! The price was very fair. Our tour with her was fabulous. the van was clean and she always had cold water for us! She showed us the ins and outs of the island, the people, and history. So, so sweet and professional as well!  She communicated ahead of time, was always on time, if not, early, and would make small stops if we needed to grab something. The tour was spectacular and I‚Äôm not fluffing it either! Our trip went to the next level because of her.

We are so glad we avoided to big resorts, stayed at Ko‚Äôa Kea.

We had an amazing day, but my one regret is including one of my sisters in my wedding. I (32f) have three sisters (Alice 31, Eliza 29, Mandy 27), and my husband and I decided our wedding parties would be my three sisters and his three best friends.

Two of my sisters (31 and 27) also got engaged in 2024, so it was a big year for my family. Mandy(27), got engaged around Christmas to her boyfriend of 2+ years and called me on FaceTime to share the news, as well as sending pictures to our family group chat. Alice (31), got engaged in October to a man she had been dating for less than 10 months, and everyone was surprised. The thing is, she didn't tell us, our mom texted us pictures of their proposal and told us to congratulate her. She literally never told us she was engaged.

Flashforward a couple months, and I start having wedding stress dreams, specifically about Alice and her fiance getting married the week after us, because their birthdays are one day apart roughly two weeks after our wedding. I saw Alice in December for our mom's birthday and joked with her about my stress dreams and she told me they in fact were planning to elope the week of their birthdays and they wanted to do it in Ireland -  that's where her fiance is from and we're very Irish. She didn't want any of us to come (which is weird but she's weird) so I didn't think too much of it and just attributed it to educated intuition and continued on with my own wedding planning.

I few weeks before my wedding, I asked Alice if she wanted to do a reading during the ceremony at my wedding. I didn't want any of my sisters to give a toast, mostly because they weren't that keen on it, but my mom insisted that one of them needed to say something at the wedding, so I asked Alice to read a poem. She agreed and said something about having a vision about speaking at my wedding and how honored she'd be. It was odd (again she's weird) but I was glad she agreed and was relieved something was off my list.

The week of my wedding, it all started going to hell.

Five days before my wedding, my mom called me to tell me that Alice and her fiance ""needed"" to elope before my wedding. He isn't an American so she kept insisting they needed to be married before going to Ireland to elope for immigration purposes. She told me that they were leaving for Ireland to right after my wedding, so they wouldn't have time otherwise. I was obviously upset, especially since my sister was not the one to tell me and my mom basically told me I needed to be okay with it and happy for them. I kind of got over it, until my sister Mandy told me about their elopement plans.

Alice and her fiance live in New Mexico, and after some googling, I learned there is no waiting period for a marriage license so I assumed they'd be getting married there. WRONG. Instead they flew out to the east coast early, spent a couple days in NYC, and planned to get married there. And because there is a waiting period in NY, they were set to elope literally the day before my wedding.

I was beyond pissed and spent the days before my wedding in kind of a grief/rage fugue state. But I came to the conclusion that she never wanted me to know about their wedding, that it had been my mom who was in the wrong to tell me, and to give her a chance.

She shows up to the rehearsal dinner with a wedding ring, and I get a little annoyed but still try to give her a chance.

The day of the wedding comes and she is a fucking nightmare. Her phone was on do not disturb THE ENTIRE DAY. She was MIA for hair and make up, and when she finally showed up she was indignant about it. Not only that, but she showed up with wet hair and was pissed that the hair stylist wouldn't blow dry her hair and kept insisting she'd only let her hair air dry. Similar story with make up, she took off some of the make up before pictures. When it was time to literally walk down the aisle, we again couldn't find her. She bartered with the photographer and told her that she needed time to rest so she would not be ready at the time family/bridal party photos were being taken. My best friend knew her room number because of how many times she had to track her down during the day. And to top it all off, she charged a cappuccino to my room - all the while we had coffee, breakfast, lunch, etc. in the bridal suite. I barely saw her throughout the day and when I bitched about it, my mom told me I needed to be understanding because she was stressed about her poem. Which she has started writing that day.

To top it all off, they ended up flying back to NM the day after my wedding before going to Ireland. So they never actually needed to get married the day before our wedding, because they could have eloped the day they got back to NM. Plus, they did end up ""eloping"" again the week after my wedding in Ireland, and she never told me, sent me pictures, or even addressed it in our family group chat.

This all has obviously made me reevaluate my relationship with her and how much/if she cares about me. I've spent a lot of time thinking about if cutting her off is the answer.

Am I overreacting?

1kostj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kostj1/uk_buying_advice_1400/,UK Buying Advice [¬£1400],"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking to upgrade my current machine - I‚Äôve had a De‚ÄôLonghi La Specialista Arte for about 3 years now. Obviously nowhere near a high-end machine, so I never expected it to behave like one. The reason for upgrading is I‚Äôm getting more and more into trying out different beans and roasts, which my current machine seems to struggle with (struggling to get consistent pressure, grind size, and I find it difficult to get an even extraction - again, not unexpected). Some beans work perfectly, while others (still freshly roasted, dark roasts) will either not be ground fine enough on the smallest size to get good pressure (which I‚Äôm having to counteract with an extra 1g of coffee), or need a relatively high grind setting to even get the water to go through. Temperature is quite inconsistent too which adds to the frustration (I always let the machine heat up, flush a blank shot, warm up again, and always do the espressos before moving onto steaming)

I know some of these issues aren‚Äôt necessarily equipment related, but I feel like over the last few years I got a decent handle on prepping the puck. 

I‚Äôve been looking over the last few weeks at different options, and i know for sure I want a separate grinder. I never do filter coffee, always espresso-based drinks (2 a day, cappuccino for me and black for my partner), so I‚Äôm considering the following:

Timemore Sculptor 064S (078S feels unnecessary for me as it seems to mostly be better at filter coffee, but the same for espresso?)

Profitec GO (single boiler seems sufficient for my use case, especially since I‚Äôm already used to doing the steaming last)

Reading through this subreddit, I know these are popular choices, but I‚Äôm essentially looking for:
- a bit of validation that I‚Äôm picking the right equipment for my use case
- are the standard timemore burrs good enough, or should I directly order with SSP burrs?
- retailer choices / wait for price drops? Some recent posts here say the Profitec GO was ¬£799 5/6 months ago, and currently I can only find it for ¬£850. Unsure if I should just wait since I‚Äôm not in desperate need to upgrade. Saw Home Coffee Machines (Ireland) as recommended for ~¬£730 6 months ago, but they seem to also be priced at ¬£850/‚Ç¨999 now. Yes, not a massive difference, but could use the difference for some new accessories.. FOMO

This is very true. There are days where Meech is firing on all cylinders and days where Meech can‚Äôt get it all together. This is why having a consistent sleep schedule is very important, but also having a good diet with fruits and vegetables. Meech loves his blueberries and cottage cheese in the morning, with a few cups of black coffee (no sugar or cream).

One thing that Meech has noticed on this sub is that there seems to be a lot of entitlement when it comes to policy. The reality is: you‚Äôre entitled to nothing.

Hard work starts in early adolescence. Working at a minimum wage job such as McDonalds might not seem much, but this is the phase where we develop our work ethic. Can we show up to work on time? Are we doing our job?

There are arguments that if one is working at a minimum wage job, they‚Äôre working hard for little money. While this is true, we must remember that these are jobs that require very little skills and that anyone off the street can do. This is why we go to college and have goals to be successful in life.

The talking points about taxing the rich through a wealth tax is a great example of such entitlement. Those who become rich put in the hard work and have abilities that most people don‚Äôt have ‚Äî take Elon and Trump as examples.

There are then arguments being made that individuals such as Elon and Trump inherited money. Yes, this is how the process works. If you have children, wouldn‚Äôt you like them to inherit something? After all, making sure your children are successful in life is good parenting.

Meech also believes that anyone can achieve anything if they put their mind to it. There is no such thing as a born genius. Look at Albert Einstein as an example. Was Einstein born with great genetics, or did he hyper focus on his area of curiosity?

Neil deGrasse Tyson made a great point years ago: you can learn anything you want, but it takes a lot of exposure to that subject area to get good. He used an example of learning Chinese. If you‚Äôre exposed to Chinese enough and continue to learn Chinese, you‚Äôll eventually become fluent in Chinese.

But I funded a way how to reset the coffee grinder timer to factory default .
So turn on the coffee machine normally , wait until it will be ready for making coffee.
Then set the strength dial to MAX , then take an already ground coffee and put a two spoons of it to the ground coffee opening.
Then make a large single cup of coffee, it will fail but it will turn the tank and the exclamation mark lights will start flashing , that is the sign that the process is done. Now just clean up your coffee grounds, and the coffee grinder timer is should be set to the factory default ( for models before 2019 should be around 9 seconds for max strength coffee and for coffee machines after 2019 for about 7 seconds).

It ""stabilized"" around 2-3 years ago now, but as you all know flares come and go and come and go forever.

I don't think we all realize how far we have drifted from a 'normal' life that such a thought as ""huh, no big flares in a few days, just the scarred, discolored minefield of all past miseries, how lucky!"" is conscionable.

I hate that many days of the month I have to limp awkwardly because regular walking grinds skin against raw rotting flesh too close to, even if by now heightened, tolerance. I hate that I must perform immense mental labor to mask the limping so as to evade chances of humiliating interrogations. I hate that full use of my arms is only a luxury set aside for a precious few days of the week: if the right one is being friendly and considerate lately, the left is sure to make up for it, have no doubt. I must grab like a T-rex with half my reach.

I hate that nobody notices anyway, I find it below my dignity to *ask* for consideration that after all these years of misery feels like bare minimum from people who ostensibly love me. I hate that I am forever bound to hold everyone close to me to a higher bar than seems fair, I hate the boiling, brimming resentment that has accumulated for all the perceived lack of emotional labor on their part over the years, I hate that I must condemn whoever will love me during my life to settle for my misery and the sheer repulsion of it all.

I find it beneath me to do all the reading and researching, the looking-up and promptly getting disappointed by supplement after supplement, cream after ointment, dietary concessions, life concessions. I hate that I have to eat healthy not of my own volition and enterprise but to chronically try and fail to stave off a slightly higher state of misery.

I hate that I can't chug  black coffee to my heart's content, I hate that with whatever I eat I must perform a mental check of every visible ingredient for inflammants, and in the last moment resign to by now a very well learned fate, that it just doesn't matter how careful I am, and eat it anyway. Why did you expend all that mental energy for then? You're no better off now, but also significantly more miserable.

I hate that there are a thousand types of treatment you will hear about and each has as many attestations as didn't-work-for-mes, so that each one I try is almost guaranteed to do nothing. I hate the small burst of hope when something new seems at the start to work, only for me to be greeted by a biblical flare at the end of week two. It is kind-of bizarre that this has happened as many times as it has. My body has an immune system that makes quick work of *treatments* all within a month. Remarkable maybe from a technical standpoint. An anti-immune system.

Honorable mention, I also hate that the one or two things that are ""known"" to ""work"" all cost an arm and a leg. I'm even willing to take the offer if they'll settle for the flared arm and the flared leg, switching biweekly as the flares do.

I hate that I have to break down only in private because by now I have given up all hopes of conveying the misery. It is not known to be a fatal disease, but my brain might just explode one of these days. Sometimes, in the post-peak-misery-limbo hours, and sure, even in the all-flaredowns-at-their-common-multiple mania when I'm feeling uppity, I say to myself, hey man, Marx put up with it and  got all that work done anyway, and it appears he had it pretty bad, so what have you done with yourself to earn complaining as much as he had?

Right now, I hate that I have to plan my workouts around flares. Have you ever tried to hit back on an underarm flare day? Extending your arm is a workout unto itself. I am right now, without divulging details, in what is an unarguably hopeful and optimistic period in my life, from an objective standpoint. But my lived reality is thus: every waking moment is colored by the pain, the never-dying hope to try something new, something else, something else then if that didn't work, and so on, and the ensuing disillusionment and contempt of all things and everything.

beneath our skin

All Dolly wanted was a fresh start: a new flat, her first job, good friends and late-night study sessions with loads of coffee and gossip. What she got instead? Hangovers, a flat always filled to the brim with uninvited guests and last but not least: Him. Cocky, smug, annoying and ... attractive? The kind of guy who turns every argument into a game and every game into his own twisted little victory.

But then there's also him (2): gentle, warm, charming. Less noise, more heart. He's the one every princess dreams of, someone you have to fall for. Or at least try once.

Between gossip, band gigs, and a dangerously honest game of truth or dare, Dolly has to figure out if common sense has the upper hand when it comes to curiosity.

Kyle is in Basel on a bus, partying like it's 1999, en route to St. Jakobshalle with the Norwegian press invited to join him rolling. He's got his jumpsuit (russedress) on, torso wrapped around the waist (as is the norm), and a Norwegian flag around his forehead. He says he's going to eat a lot of ice cream to celebrate the big day, is locked and loaded with a lot of coffee in his system (he will be drinking more), and hopes it's gonna go well.

Then they're off, someone starts blasting his Lighter, making him wonder ""WHO QUED THIS?!"", and while he's going off, Mads T√∏rklep (delegation leader) gives him strict orders to pipe down and save his voice for the upcoming rehearsals and big show for the rest of the day. He promptly does so.

At their destination, St. Jakobshalle, Kyle puts on a face mask and sunglasses as he and the crew head backstage.

1kosac4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1kosac4/how_i_induced_choline_depression/,How I induced 'choline depression',"Well, this was an unintended experiment that I performed a couple of days ago. It appears to suggest that depression from choline may be from overmethylation or something akin to that.

All of the following, I take often - usually daily - but that morning I took them all about the same time:

* 1000mg TMG
* 6 hard-boiled eggs
* 1000mcg methylfolate
* 1mg adenosylcobalamin
* 5g creatine mono (in coffee)
* 2g taurine (in coffee)
* 3g glycine (in coffee)

After approximately 30-60 minutes I noticed a profound sense of depression set in, which then lasted for \~2 hours. There were no long-term after-affects.

My hypothesis is that it was the simultaneous intake of so many methyl donors at once led to this episode. The fact that I do usually take these supplements and food pretty much daily, but usually not at the same time, without such side effects seems to support this idea. Also, I can take 5mg of methylfolate without even noticing it, so it may be that choline as a methyl donor under these conditions may play a special role in this.

So it suggests to me that overmethylation or something related to overmethylation -may- underlie at least some occurrences of 'choline depression'.

Or myself... 

  
Prior to the these two I worked with any real problems for a company selling tech solutions all across Europe for a period of about 4 years. My main role there (as internal IT support) was Windows, AD, Exchange, some Azure and O365. Some other admin/support of other stuff such as VPN, hardware setup and MDM. Resigned as I was feeling a bit restless and the general 'dead-end' feeling of working among others in a kind of 'level 1' support job.

  
For the first job afterwards, I was going to be only IT guy looking after just about everything. Small company, niche products. I was focused mainly on the job I hoped to get. Hybrid role. On the Teams interview, I was enticed about how much input I would have in the setup of a new domain controller. Job offer made and accepted..

Started working there anyway. Turns out the set that company was still in negotiations with an external IT consultant on the price of the new AD server (and also that they would also be taking care of the main set up - 100 euros an hour or something extreme). I was only going to be taking care of things after the fact. At the end of my time there, the server still hadn't arrived. 

No ticketing system here either. Mostly 'walk-up' support for things simplistic such as password resets or teaching folks the dark art of 'switch it off, switch it on again'! About as complicated it ever was involved some Azure admin. The  IT system was already pretty stable so I would find myself grinding my gears trying to find trivial shit to do, 'busy work' mostly. Had a manager who lived for over-long Teams calls on Friday and then the following Monday. What am I expected to say happened on the day when most vanish home at lunch time (or over the weekend itself)??

Summed up, general tedium and a feeling that the job was 'over-sold' to me. At least the salary was an improvement on the last. About 4 months in I was told I was not passing probation, but I would be allowed to work out the remains weeks anyway. A selfless action of the employer, in retrospect. Reasons given was the usual, vague 'not a good fit' for the company. No real critique of tech ability could be offered up other in that there was some delays in getting hardware ready (I was only there one day a week, his agreement when I signed). Another reason was too many people 'didn't know' me. What can I do about that? So it seems opinion over fact decided things... annoying to sign a contract in good faith to find oneself out of work 6 months later...

  
Got another IT admin job just a few weeks later. Company a  bit larger; onsite 5 days a week. Two pretty likeable guys in the office we shared. Good vibes, even if they were deciding how things went with my probation time. Did well in most of the projects assigned to me. One verifying if there was network problems - all was proven to be not to be the case with some Python scripting. The other, the chore of getting computers onto Windows 11 with seconds to spare. The OS is only about 4 or 5 years old! The final, the sole employee making the company NIS-2 compliant (cybersecurity law). Wow, that sounds cool! Not the case, actually. The thing involves digesting mountains of legalise (in Germany btw). And would need bunch of access to systems most department managers would never give to somebody who had just arrived. Part of the 'risk assessment' that one must make.

To get the ball rolling, I was banging my head against the wall with practical things we change right now. Using MFA - nope, employees don't want to use their own devices to type a 2-digit number into it. CEO, doesn't want to buy old, semi-knackered Android phones to help them carry out this task. OK... maybe we ditch the policy of letting folks using the same simplistic, guessable passwords for years... nope, too much to expect to the mostly middle-age cohort of workers... maybe we buy Office Defender licences for phishing simulations etc? Forget it, out of budget. Make simple changes to GPOs to enable automatic Bitlocker encryption and other do-able stuff... radio silence. 

Also wasted some of my time, and that of external cybersecurity experts in Teams calls (totally essential for penetration testing and a bunch of other stuff)  as  the two guys in the office and upper management had already entered into negotiations with another company. Hours pissed away. I had effectively been 'managed out' of the whole matter, very silently. Perhaps they expected something pretty unachievable by a non-expert (in legal stuff and systems I know nothing about such as supply-chain management), combined with culture opposed to cybersecurity.  

No significant feedback was ever given to me that they may not have been happy with me. Things in Germany  are done in two week blocks for hiring, firings and resignations (for tax purposes). Made a holiday request for July at the start of this month. Approved in a heartbeat. Fairly disgusted by this looking back now, as both would've known I was soon going be be let go. Such poor communication and transparency could easily have put me In a position where I could've booked flights, car hire and accommodation where a refund would've impossible to get back. When the matter later came up with them later, all they could offer as a defence was ""not our problem"". And yes, I do know that holiday approval doesn't mean your probation is over, go off and enjoy life, but to withhold such information willingly screams 'unethical'!! It kind of explains now why one of the guy who looks after holiday approvals seemed to be **very** disengaged when making small talk or talking about projects coming down the line. 

At the very middle of this month, I was marched into a meeting to be told that I was 'not a good fit' for the company. A total shock. When pressed for more information, pretty much vague suggestions were made about my ability to handle 'parallel projects'. I guess the cybersecurity saga... sent plenty of emails to them during the project to lave a 'paper trail' about what was being done. Not enough. Another factor cited was that too few people knew me as I chose to take coffee/lunch breaks on my own - I don't mind being a bit of a loner. If my motivation to distrust others at work ever was valid, it has been doubled now. Let gather up my bits and pieces and was walked out of the building, despite my genuine willingness to work out the remaining 2 weeks. Was I deemed a risk or something??

I get the gut feeling that larger companies tend to be more communicate/objective with employees (on probation or otherwise), in general. And that smaller, family-run companies tend to base things more on personal opinion when such decisions need to be made.

Does anybody else seem to get this feeling? 

The worry now, is that my prospective employers are going to ask why this has happened twice in a row and conclude I lack the tech knowledge and/or I am not a 'team-player'.

Legal of course, but depending on the circumstances (such as zero communication) it can feel a little unethical?

Or should I be an ass when I get things back on track and alert the relevant authorities to their cybersecurity shortcomings? Enormous fines and and all the jazz. Legal, yes. Ethical, no.

I don‚Äôt really know where to start, but I just need to get this out because I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and tired of feeling this way.

For about a month now, my mind hasn‚Äôt stopped racing. I‚Äôm stuck in this endless loop of anxiety and overthinking‚Äîworrying about things that most people probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice or care about. But for me, it feels like my whole world is falling apart. It‚Äôs exhausting, and honestly, I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs never going to get better.

My sleep has been terrible. I wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks and nausea, and no matter what I try‚Äîyoga, breathing exercises, anything to calm my nervous system‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm running on empty, physically and emotionally. I can‚Äôt get back to sleep, and when morning comes, the anxiety is already waiting.

I‚Äôve lost my appetite completely. I‚Äôm hungry, but eating feels impossible. Even simple things like drinking chamomile tea or doing breathing exercises only give me temporary relief. I just want to feel normal again‚Äîlike I used to when I could eat without thinking twice and enjoy my coffee in peace.

On top of all this, my friendships are feeling so fragile. Lia is my best friend‚Äîwe‚Äôve known each other for 10 years‚Äîand then there‚Äôs another friend from our group, someone I‚Äôve been close to for about 3 years. I feel like I‚Äôm the glue holding everything together, especially with Lia. Sometimes I sense she‚Äôs upset or distant, and that fills me with so much anxiety. I worry constantly about what everyone‚Äôs feeling and whether I‚Äôm doing enough. It‚Äôs a heavy weight on my shoulders, and sometimes I just want to cut everyone out of my life so I can find peace. But I‚Äôm terrified of losing them or hurting them because I love them so much.

I also have attachment issues that make all of this feel even more intense and hard to handle. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trapped in this storm, and I don‚Äôt know how to get out.

If anyone has been through something like this, or if you have any advice on how to cope with anxiety, insomnia, and friendship struggles all at once, please‚ÄîI‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from you. Even just some kind words would mean the world right now.

Trick 1 ‚Äì Read > watch, then chat-test:
Videos feel productive, but eat time. I save the auto-generated transcript, speed-read that in minutes, then ask the note itself questions (‚ÄúWhy did X happen?‚Äù ‚ÄúGive me the 3 key points!‚Äù). Instant Q&A forces the info to stick and saves me replaying the whole video.
What my NoteCodex does: grabs the transcript, drops it into the note, and lets me chat with it like a study buddy.

Trick 2 ‚Äì Quiz yourself the same day:
If you don‚Äôt peek at new info within a few hours, most of it evaporates. A quick self-quiz (no fancy tool needed) locks it in better than re-reading.
What my NoteCodex does: Our app can generate five little quiz cards from whatever I wrote or recorded today, so I can run through them while I make coffee.

Trick 3 ‚Äì Link, don‚Äôt file:
Folders hide things. Instead, connect one note to another like a web: ‚ÄúProject X ‚Üí marketing ideas ‚Üí good TikTok hooks.‚Äù Later you can jump around by clicking links instead of digging through sub-folders.

What my NoteCodex does: allow you to create link‚Äôs between notes and show it in connected hiearchial format so when you look at it later, it‚Äôs easy to make sense of rather than piecing it together again amg again

Trick 4 ‚Äì Skim first, read what matters:
Not every article and video deserves thirty minutes of your life. Skim the headline, intro, and a summary; if it feels meh or makes zero sense, skip it. Save your focus for the gems.

What my NoteCodex does: auto-generates a one-paragraph summary for any media files, links or documents, so you can decide in ten seconds whether it‚Äôs worth a deep dive.


Would love your thoughts
	‚Ä¢	Which trick sounds most useful‚Äîor ridiculous?
	‚Ä¢	Biggest headache in your current note routine?
	‚Ä¢	If you try the beta, what‚Äôs one thing it must nail before you‚Äôd actually keep using it?

Roast or cheer‚Äîeither helps me make it better. Thanks for reading!

1korpxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1korpxo/your_daughters_going_to_die/,‚ÄòYour daughter‚Äôs going to die‚Äô,"Anyone who thinks working as a barista isn‚Äôt hard should try dealing with the mountain of people who come in at 5pm on a Monday evening. It seems like the entire population decides that the best post work or school or pilates activity is ordering the most elaborate handicraft drink known to man. Seriously, I think 90% of the customers had to make a minimum of like 14 customisations to their lattes.

Look I wouldn‚Äôt be someone to usually complain about doing the job I get paid for but looking after Ella at the same time as concocting these intricate drinks was really tiring. Yes I know that it isn‚Äôt my proudest moment moment to mix looking after my daughter with doing my job but the babysitter said she‚Äôd pick Ella up a couple of hours late and Jerry wouldn‚Äôt let me reschedule my shift.

Every few minutes, I‚Äôd sneak a glance to make sure Ella was okay or walk up to her to make sure her homework isn‚Äôt too hard or something. She‚Äôs fully engrossed in it of course. That‚Äôs an honors student for you.

The woman a couple seats down from her was probably the opposite of engrossed. When you work at a coffee shop so long you start realising that pretty much all customers fit a certain mold: yoga moms, overworked middle managers, gossiping tweens, some young intern desperately trying to finish a proposal. You don‚Äôt usually see a twitchy dark haired woman sitting alone for hours.

She‚Äôd been there since the morning and she had spent all of that time sipping on the same matcha. Ideally, I should‚Äôve kicked her out for loitering but Jerry isn‚Äôt paying enough to do all that. She had spend all of said time analysing a face for a few minutes before moving on to the next one. Doing all this with a straight face. I was all for people watching but this was a little creepy.

The only time she‚Äôd broke her straight face was when Tommy came in. Tommy‚Äôs a cop and a regular at our shop. A regular at our shop who didn‚Äôt even say hi to the barista who‚Äôs been serving him every morning for the past year. I gave him a little less coffee for that (I am aware of the childishness of the matter). When Tommy came in, she looked like she‚Äôd seen a ghost. Tommy‚Äôs a bit of a player, she could‚Äôve been one of his exes for all I knew.

Or she could‚Äôve been a criminal which it turns out was the case so I let my daughter sit a couple seats over from someone who just got  arrested. Mom of the year everyone!

At around 10pm, after the midday crowd cleared out and after Ella was with the babysitter, Tommy and his partner came in to arrest her. Living in a sketchy area of a big city you kind of get used to people getting taken away but the coffee shop is in a nice area and I‚Äôve never had a person getting arrested telling that my daughter‚Äôs going to die.

When Tommy came in with his partner and moved towards her she yelled like she was in pain. That‚Äôs not all she seemed almost rabid when she was fighting against the handcuffs like an animal cornered. She  started yelling something about how the creatures had gotten  her and how we‚Äôre doomed.

Worst of all she looked me in the dead in the eyes and said:

‚ÄòThat girl you kept talking to with the pigtails, she‚Äôs next, I can see it, she doesn‚Äôt have much time to live. SAVE HER. YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER‚Äô.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking, that lady was clearly unstable and I shouldn‚Äôt let what she said to me get to my head but Jill, our babysitter just gave me a call.

She called an ambulance to take Ella to the hospital. She had a seizure. She‚Äôs in critical condition. The doctors don‚Äôt know what happened to her and how to fix it.

I don‚Äôt care if that woman‚Äôs the craziest mf alive, if there‚Äôs even a chance she knows how to save my daughter, I need to find her.

1korial,https://youtu.be/zKxv6ypMh5w,3 Very Scary TRUE Countryside Crime Horror Stories,"**‚ÄúThe Willow Creek Murders‚Äù:**

I lived a few miles from the Becker family‚Äôs farm, out in the quiet countryside where the nearest neighbor was a good walk away, and fields of wheat and corn stretched as far as you could see. Their place, Willow Creek, was a modest farmstead, just a small house, a barn, and a few sheds, all nestled between dense woods and rolling hills. I‚Äôd known them for years‚ÄîKarl, his wife Anna, their daughter Lena, her two kids, Emma and Max, and their new maid, Clara. We weren‚Äôt the closest, but I‚Äôd stop by every couple of weeks to trade eggs, share a bit of news, or lend a hand with a broken gate. Karl was a gruff man, hardworking, but kind enough. Anna was quiet, always baking or tending to the garden. Lena, though, was the heart of the place, raising her kids alone after her husband passed. Lately, the whole family seemed on edge, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was wrong.About a week ago, I made the trek to Willow Creek to return some tools Karl had lent me for fixing my fence. The path was familiar, a dirt trail cutting through tall grass and past an old, weathered barn that leaned slightly to one side. When I arrived, I found Karl outside, crouched near the machine shed, staring at the ground. His face was drawn, with dark circles under his eyes, like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. His hands were dirty, and he held a hammer like he‚Äôd been working on something.‚ÄúHey, Karl,‚Äù I called, holding up the tools. ‚ÄúGot your things back.‚ÄùHe barely looked up, his eyes fixed on the ground. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said, his voice low and tight. ‚ÄúYou seen anything strange around your place?‚ÄùI set the tools down on a stump and walked over. ‚ÄúStrange? Like what?‚ÄùHe pointed to the dirt. There were footprints, deep and uneven, leading from the edge of the woods straight to the shed. They weren‚Äôt Karl‚Äôs boots‚ÄîI knew his tread from helping him last summer. These were different, wider, with a strange, dragging pattern. ‚ÄúFound these yesterday,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLock on the shed was busted, too. And last week, I found a newspaper from the city just lying in the yard. We don‚Äôt get those out here.‚ÄùI squinted at the footprints, my stomach twisting a little. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs odd,‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúMaybe some kids messing around? Or a hunter passing through?‚ÄùKarl shook his head. ‚ÄúNo kids out here. And hunters don‚Äôt leave city papers.‚Äù He stood up, wiping his hands on his overalls, and glanced toward the woods. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right.‚ÄùBefore I could reply, Lena stepped out of the house, wiping her hands on an apron. She was usually all smiles, her dark hair tied back, but today her face was pale, her eyes darting around like she expected someone to jump out. ‚ÄúHans,‚Äù she said, her voice shaky, ‚Äúyou ever hear noises at night?‚Äù‚ÄúNoises?‚Äù I asked, crossing my arms. ‚ÄúWhat kind?‚Äù‚ÄúIn the attic,‚Äù she said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúFootsteps, like someone‚Äôs pacing up there. Heavy steps. The old maid quit a few months back because of it. Said the place was cursed, packed her bags, and left.‚Äù She hugged herself, glancing at the house. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been worse lately. The footsteps stop when we go up to check, but there‚Äôs nothing there. No dust disturbed, no tracks.‚ÄùI tried to laugh, hoping to ease the tension. ‚ÄúOld houses creak, Lena. Could be rats or the wind.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not rats,‚Äù she snapped, her voice sharp. ‚ÄúRats don‚Äôt walk like a man. And the kids are scared. Emma won‚Äôt sleep in her room anymore.‚ÄùKarl put a hand on her shoulder, his face softening. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not worry him,‚Äù he said, but his eyes flicked back to the woods, like he was searching for something. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out.‚ÄùI stayed a bit longer, helping Karl fix a loose board on the shed. Anna came out with a glass of water for me, her hands trembling slightly as she handed it over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kind to check on us,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ uneasy here.‚Äù‚ÄúAnything I can do?‚Äù I asked, taking a sip.She hesitated, then shook her head. ‚ÄúJust keep an eye out,‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper.I left Willow Creek feeling heavier than when I‚Äôd arrived. The farm had always been peaceful, a place where the only sounds were the cluck of chickens or the lowing of cows. Now, it felt wrong, like the air itself was holding its breath. I kept thinking about those footprints, the newspaper, and Lena‚Äôs scared eyes. I told myself it was probably nothing, just country life wearing them down. But deep down, I wasn‚Äôt so sure.Four days later, I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen any of the Beckers in town. They usually came by every few days for flour or to sell eggs at the market. It was strange for them to stay away so long. I decided to check on them, figuring I‚Äôd ease my mind. When I got to Willow Creek, the place was eerily still. The animals were restless‚Äîcows bellowing in the barn, chickens scratching at empty feed troughs. The dog, tied to a post near the house, was barking furiously, straining at its rope, its fur matted and eyes wild.‚ÄúKarl?‚Äù I called, knocking on the front door. The wood was rough under my knuckles, and the sound echoed. No answer. I tried again, louder. ‚ÄúLena? Anna?‚Äù Nothing. The windows were dark, curtains drawn tight. The air felt thick, like it was pressing down on me.I circled the house, checking the garden and the sheds, but everything was untouched. The tools I‚Äôd returned were still on the stump, exactly where I‚Äôd left them. I headed to the barn, thinking maybe they were tending to the animals. The big double doors were half-open, creaking slightly as I approached. I stepped inside, and the smell hit me like a punch‚Äîsharp, metallic, mixed with the musty scent of hay. My stomach churned, and my heart started pounding.In the dim light filtering through the barn‚Äôs slats, I saw them. Karl, Anna, Lena, and little Emma, all piled in a corner, half-covered with straw. Their heads were smashed, skulls caved in, faces twisted in ways that made my knees weak. Blood had pooled beneath them, soaking into the dirt floor, dark and sticky. I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúNo, no, no.‚ÄùI turned and ran to the house, praying someone was still alive. The back door was unlocked, swinging open with a groan. Inside, the kitchen was dim, the air stale. Clara, the new maid, was slumped against the wall, her head crushed, a broom still clutched in her hand like she‚Äôd tried to fight. In the next room, I found Max in his crib, his tiny body still, his face ruined like the others. The sight of him, so small and helpless, made my vision blur.I stood there, frozen, my mind screaming. Who did this? Why? I thought of the footprints, the newspaper, the noises Lena had described. Someone had been here, watching them, planning this. Then I noticed the kitchen table‚Äîcrumbs scattered across it, a half-eaten loaf of bread, a knife stuck in a wedge of cheese. The hearth was still warm, embers glowing faintly. Whoever did this hadn‚Äôt just killed them. They‚Äôd stayed, eaten their food, lived among the bodies. My skin crawled at the thought.I bolted out of the house, my legs shaky, and ran to my neighbor Lorenz‚Äôs place, nearly a mile away. My chest burned by the time I got there, banging on his door. ‚ÄúLorenz!‚Äù I shouted, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúThe Beckers‚Äîthey‚Äôre dead! All of them!‚ÄùHe opened the door, his face confused. ‚ÄúDead? What are you talking about?‚Äù‚ÄúIn the barn, the house‚Äîsomeone killed them,‚Äù I gasped, leaning against the doorframe. ‚ÄúWe need help.‚ÄùLorenz‚Äôs eyes widened, and he grabbed his coat. ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he said, but I shook my head.‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming with you.‚ÄùWe grabbed another neighbor, Eduard, and the three of us hurried back to Willow Creek. When we reached the barn, Lorenz stopped short, his face going white as he saw the bodies. Eduard gagged, turning away. ‚ÄúThis is evil,‚Äù he whispered, crossing himself. ‚ÄúWho could do this to a family?‚ÄùWe checked the house again, hoping for any sign of life, but there was nothing. Just silence and blood. Lorenz pointed to the kitchen. ‚ÄúLook at this,‚Äù he said, his voice low. ‚ÄúThe killer ate here. Slept here, maybe. The animals were fed, too.‚ÄùI felt sick. ‚ÄúHow could someone do that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely audible.Eduard shook his head. ‚ÄúSome people ain‚Äôt human.‚ÄùWe sent for the police, but it took hours for them to arrive from town. When they did, they combed through the farm, asking questions, taking notes. They found the footprints again, still clear in the dirt. The broken lock on the shed. The city newspaper, now crumpled in a corner of the yard. In the barn loft, they found a mattock, its blade crusted with blood and hair. The police said the killer might have stayed for days, tending the animals, cooking in the kitchen, sleeping in the house with the dead. The thought made my stomach turn.Weeks passed, and the police found no answers. They questioned everyone in town, from farmhands to travelers, but no one knew anything. Some People whispered about robbers, a jealous lover, even a family feud, but nothing fit. The money in the house was untouched, and nothing was stolen. Willow Creek was torn down a year later, the land left empty, marked only by a small stone where the house once stood. I never walked that path again. I still see Lena‚Äôs scared face sometimes, hear her voice asking about noises in the night. I wonder if she sensed what was coming, if they all did. The countryside used to feel like home, but now, every rustle in the woods, every shadow, makes me wonder who‚Äôs out there, waiting, watching.





**‚ÄúThe Inn at Bender‚Äôs Grove‚Äù:**

I was riding through the Kansas countryside, my horse plodding along the dusty trail. My back ached from days in the saddle, and my stomach twisted with hunger. I‚Äôd been traveling west, alone, for nearly a week, sleeping under the stars and eating whatever I could carry. A wooden sign caught my eye, pointing down a narrow path to an inn called Bender‚Äôs Grove. The thought of a soft bed and a warm meal pulled me in, so I turned my horse and followed the trail.The inn came into view‚Äîa small, weathered cabin with a slanted roof and a barn off to the side. It sat alone in the vast, empty prairie, with no other houses or travelers in sight. Smoke drifted from the chimney, and a faint glow flickered in the windows. I tied my horse to a post near the porch, my boots crunching on the dry ground. A woman stepped out, older, with gray hair tied back and a plain dress under a stained apron. Her smile was tight, like it didn‚Äôt quite fit her face.‚ÄúWelcome, traveler,‚Äù she said, her voice warm but sharp, like a knife wrapped in cloth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ma. You look tired. Come in and rest.‚ÄùI nodded, grateful for the kindness, and followed her inside. The main room was small and dim, lit by a single oil lamp on a rough wooden table. A few chairs sat around it, and a heavy curtain hung across therika, splitting the room in two. The air smelled of stew, woodsmoke, and something sour I couldn‚Äôt place. A younger woman, maybe in her twenties, stood by a stove in the corner, stirring a pot. She had sharp features, dark hair, and eyes that seemed to see right through me. Her smile was bright but didn‚Äôt touch her eyes.‚ÄúThis is my daughter, Kate,‚Äù Ma said, gesturing toward her.Kate looked me over, her hands pausing on the spoon. ‚ÄúTraveling alone?‚Äù she asked, her voice soft but probing.‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, setting my bag on the floor. ‚ÄúJust passing through.‚ÄùShe tilted her head, her eyes narrowing slightly. ‚ÄúAlone is dangerous out here,‚Äù she said, almost whispering. ‚ÄúThe prairie‚Äôs full of trouble.‚ÄùHer words hung in the air, and I shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve managed so far,‚Äù I said, trying to sound easygoing. Something about her tone made my skin prickle, but I was too tired to dwell on it. I just wanted food and a place to sleep.Ma pointed to a chair at the table, right next to the curtain. ‚ÄúSit there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBest seat in the house.‚ÄùI sat, my back to the curtain, and Ma brought me a bowl of stew. It was thick, with chunks of meat, potatoes, and carrots, steaming in the cool air of the room. I ate quickly, the warmth spreading through me. Kate watched from the stove, her eyes flicking to the curtain every few seconds. The fabric was heavy, faded red, and it swayed slightly, like a breeze I couldn‚Äôt feel was moving it. I told myself it was nothing, just my mind playing tricks after days on the road.A man came in from a back door, tall and broad, with dirt smudged on his hands and a blank look on his face. Ma called him John. He didn‚Äôt speak, just nodded at me and sat near the front door, pulling out a knife and a whetstone. The sound‚Äîscrape, scrape, scrape‚Äîfilled the room, steady and unsettling. I tried to focus on my stew, but the noise burrowed into my thoughts.‚ÄúYou staying the night?‚Äù Ma asked, pouring me a tin cup of water.‚ÄúThought I might,‚Äù I said, wiping my mouth. ‚ÄúYou got a room?‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a bed,‚Äù she said, pointing to a door off the main room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs small, but cozy. You‚Äôll sleep well.‚ÄùHer words were kind, but her eyes were hard, like she was studying me. John‚Äôs knife kept scraping, and Kate‚Äôs glances at the curtain grew more frequent. My chest tightened, a faint warning I couldn‚Äôt explain. The room felt smaller, the lamplight weaker. I finished my stew and pushed the bowl away.‚ÄúMind if I stretch my legs?‚Äù I said, standing.Ma‚Äôs smile faltered, just for a second. ‚ÄúNo need,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou must be worn out. Why not see the room now?‚ÄùHer tone was firm, like a suggestion that wasn‚Äôt really a suggestion. John stopped sharpening his knife and looked at me, his hand still gripping the blade. My heart beat faster, loud in my ears. I didn‚Äôt know why I felt trapped, but I did.‚ÄúJust a quick walk,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúClear my head.‚ÄùKate stepped toward me, her smile gone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late,‚Äù she said, her voice low. ‚ÄúBetter to stay inside.‚ÄùHer words sent a chill down my spine. She was close now, close enough that I could smell the faint sweetness of her hair. I laughed, trying to keep things light. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back. Promise.‚ÄùBefore she could argue, I moved past her and pushed open the front door. The air outside hit me, sharp and clean, and I breathed deep, trying to shake the knot in my gut. The barn loomed across the yard, its doors half-open, and I walked toward it, needing distance from the cabin‚Äôs heavy air. The prairie stretched endless around me, silent except for the faint rustle of grass.Then I saw him‚Äîan older man with a gray beard, standing in the orchard near the barn. He was digging, his shovel slicing into the dirt with a dull thud. The hole was deep, wide, and long, like something meant to hold more than roots or seeds. My breath caught. Why was he digging at night? My mind raced, piecing together the curtain, Kate‚Äôs eyes, John‚Äôs knife. The hole looked like a grave.I stood frozen, my boots sinking slightly in the soft ground. The man hadn‚Äôt seen me yet. He worked steadily, his shovel hitting the earth‚Äîthud, thud, thud. Each sound tightened the knot in my chest. I took a step back, and a twig snapped under my foot. His head jerked up, his eyes locking onto mine. They were cold, empty, like a predator sizing up prey. He gripped the shovel tighter, his knuckles white.I turned and walked fast toward the cabin, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I didn‚Äôt run‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to show fear‚Äîbut every step felt like a gamble. Inside, Ma and Kate were waiting, standing too close to the door. John leaned against the wall, his knife now tucked into his belt, but his hand rested near it.‚ÄúSee anything interesting?‚Äù Ma asked, her voice smooth but edged with something dark.‚ÄúJust the barn,‚Äù I lied, keeping my tone steady. ‚ÄúThink I‚Äôll head out, though. Long ride tomorrow.‚ÄùKate stepped closer, her eyes searching mine. ‚ÄúYou should stay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe road‚Äôs no place for a man alone.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage,‚Äù I said, grabbing my bag from the floor. John straightened, his hand brushing the knife‚Äôs handle. My mouth went dry. I needed to stall, to think. My eyes darted to the door Ma had pointed out‚Äîthe one to the bedroom.‚ÄúLet me check the room first,‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll decide.‚ÄùMa hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. ‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù she said finally, nodding toward the door.I walked to it, my hand shaking as I turned the handle. The room was tiny, with a narrow cot, a single chair, and a window covered in grime. I stepped inside, and the door clicked shut behind me. I tried the handle‚Äîlocked. My stomach dropped like a stone. I was trapped.Voices came through the wall, low and hurried. ‚ÄúHe saw Pa digging,‚Äù Kate whispered, her words sharp with panic. ‚ÄúHe knows something.‚Äù‚ÄúQuiet,‚Äù Ma snapped. ‚ÄúGet the hammer. We‚Äôll do it quick.‚ÄùMy blood ran cold. A hammer. I pictured it‚Äîheavy, swinging down. My hands trembled as I pushed at the door, but it held firm. The window was my only chance. I ran to it, clawing at the latch. It was rusted, stuck tight. I grabbed the chair and swung it at the glass, the crash echoing in the small room. Shards fell, and cool air rushed in.Hands grabbed me from behind‚ÄîJohn, his arms like iron, yanking me back. His breath was hot on my neck, his grip crushing. I twisted, kicking wildly, and drove my elbow into his face. He grunted and stumbled, his hold loosening just enough. I lunged for the window, hauling myself through. Glass cut my hands and arms, warm blood trickling down, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I hit the ground outside, scrambling to my feet.Shouts erupted behind me‚ÄîMa‚Äôs voice, sharp and furious, calling for John. I sprinted across the yard, my boots slipping in the dirt. The barn flashed by, then the orchard, where the man with the shovel still stood, watching me. I didn‚Äôt look back. I reached my horse, my hands fumbling with the reins. I swung into the saddle and kicked hard, the horse bolting down the trail.The inn‚Äôs lights faded behind me, swallowed by the dark. I rode for hours, my heart still racing, until I reached a small town at dawn. I found the sheriff, my words tumbling out‚Äîthe grave, the locked door, the hammer. He listened, his face growing darker with every detail. He gathered men and rode to Bender‚Äôs Grove that day.Days later, I heard what they found. The Benders were gone, vanished without a trace. But the orchard was a graveyard. Eleven bodies, maybe more, buried in shallow pits. Travelers like me, lured in with smiles and stew, never seen again. Some had been struck with a hammer, their skulls cracked. Others had their throats cut. The town buzzed with horror, but the Benders were long gone, slipped into the prairie‚Äôs endless expanse.I still see that hole in the orchard when I close my eyes. I hear the shovel‚Äôs thud, feel John‚Äôs hands grabbing me. I got out, but the fear stays. Every quiet inn, every kind stranger, makes me wonder if I‚Äôll ever really escape Bender‚Äôs Grove.





**""Lights in the Distance"":**

My son‚Äôs call hit me at 2 a.m., his voice slicing through the stillness of our house. ‚ÄúDad, I crashed my car. It‚Äôs stuck in a ditch. I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm lost.‚Äù He‚Äôd been at a party in Canby, celebrating his college graduation with friends, laughing over music and burgers. I was half-asleep, the clock‚Äôs faint glow the only light in the room, but his words yanked me upright. My heart thudded as I grabbed my glasses from the nightstand, fingers fumbling. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked, already tugging on my jeans, the denim cold against my skin.‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a gravel road, near Marshall, I think,‚Äù he said, his voice steady but with a tremor, like he was holding it together. ‚ÄúI see lights in the distance. Looks like a town.‚Äù Marshall was 30 miles from Canby. Lynd, a tiny speck of a place, was closer to where he‚Äôd likely crashed. My mind raced, picturing the flat farmlands out there‚Äîendless fields of corn and soybeans, gravel roads snaking through, swallowed by dark. ‚ÄúYou sure it‚Äôs Marshall?‚Äù I asked, lacing my boots, the leather creaking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs far.‚Äù‚ÄúI see the lights, Dad,‚Äù he said, insistent. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bright, steady. I‚Äôm not that far off.‚Äù My wife stirred, her eyes wide with fear as she sat up, clutching the quilt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù she whispered, voice tight. I waved her to stay quiet, grabbing my keys from the dresser, the metal jingling in my shaking hand. ‚ÄúStay where you are,‚Äù I told him, my tone sharp. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming to get you. Don‚Äôt move.‚Äù‚ÄúNo, Dad, I can make it,‚Äù he said, stubborn as ever. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking toward the lights. It‚Äôs close, maybe a mile.‚Äù That stubborn streak‚Äîhe‚Äôd had it since he was a kid, always pushing to do things his way. But my stomach knotted. Those roads are black at night, no streetlights, no houses for miles, just fields and silence. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, almost shouting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too dark. You‚Äôll get lost.‚Äù My voice echoed in the bedroom, too loud.He gave a small, tired laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôve got my phone. I‚Äôll keep you on.‚Äù I wanted to argue, but he‚Äôd already made up his mind. I kissed my wife‚Äôs forehead, her skin clammy, and muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call soon.‚Äù The truck‚Äôs engine growled as I started it, headlights carving a narrow path through the dark. I set the phone on speaker, propped on the passenger seat, its screen glowing faintly. ‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù I asked, gripping the wheel, my knuckles white.‚ÄúFields,‚Äù he said, his voice crackling slightly. ‚ÄúCorn, tall as me. Barbed wire fences, rusted. There‚Äôs a creek or something on my left, gurgling.‚Äù His breathing was louder, shoes crunching on gravel, maybe dirt. The countryside out there is desolate‚Äîgravel roads that twist nowhere, dust that chokes the air, fields that seem to watch you. I swallowed, throat dry. ‚ÄúAny signs? A barn, a mailbox?‚Äù I asked, desperate for something to pinpoint him.‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust the lights ahead. They‚Äôre steady, not cars. Like a town.‚Äù His words were calm, but there was an edge, like he was convincing himself. I kept him talking, asking about the party to ground him. ‚ÄúIt was fun,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFriends, music, grilled food. I didn‚Äôt drink much, Dad. Couple beers, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù His voice was clear, no slur, but my mind churned. Why was he so far from Canby? Why Marshall?I passed a crooked mailbox, its red flag bent, the only sign of life. My headlights caught a jackrabbit, eyes glinting before it vanished into the corn. ‚ÄúStill see the lights?‚Äù I asked, my voice tight. ‚ÄúYeah, brighter now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a narrow path, like a tractor trail. It‚Äôs leading right to them.‚Äù His breathing was heavier, steps quicker. The dashboard clock read 2:45 a.m. We‚Äôd been talking for nearly 45 minutes, and I was still miles from Lynd. My foot pressed harder on the gas, the truck rattling.‚ÄúAny cars? People?‚Äù I asked, scanning the dark. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, pausing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quiet. Just the creek and the corn rustling.‚Äù The silence on his end felt heavy, like the fields were listening. ‚ÄúYou near a highway?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs headlights, not a town.‚Äù Another pause, longer this time. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not cars. It‚Äôs steady, like buildings. I‚Äôm close, Dad. Half a mile, maybe.‚Äù His certainty chilled me. Marshall was 25 miles away, across flat land. What was he seeing?My hands shook as I drove, the road stretching endlessly. ‚ÄúStay on the path,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cross any water. The Yellow Medicine River‚Äôs out there, shallow but slippery.‚Äù I pictured its muddy banks, steep drops hidden in the dark. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm careful,‚Äù he said, but his voice was distant, like he was focused elsewhere. The phone crackled, his steps uneven now. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that sound?‚Äù I asked, leaning toward the speaker. ‚ÄúJust the ground,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs soft, like dirt.‚ÄùWe talked, my voice steady to keep him calm, but fear clawed at me. He described the corn swaying, the creek‚Äôs low murmur, the lights flickering slightly, like they were just over a rise. I was about to beg him to stop when he said, ‚ÄúHold on, I‚Äôm crossing a field. It‚Äôs a shortcut to the lights.‚Äù My heart stopped. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúStay on the path! There‚Äôs ditches, rivers‚Äîyou‚Äôll fall!‚Äù My voice cracked, desperate.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said, stubborn again. ‚ÄúThe field‚Äôs flat. I see the lights clear now, so close.‚Äù His voice was eager, almost excited, but it made my skin crawl. I pictured him pushing through tall grass, roots snagging his sneakers, the river lurking nearby. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said, softer, pleading. ‚ÄúWait for me.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt answer right away, just breathed, steps crunching. Then, out of nowhere, he shouted, ‚ÄúOh shit!‚Äù The line went dead silent. Not disconnected‚Äîsilent.‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I screamed, the truck swerving as I grabbed the phone. ‚ÄúYou there? Talk to me!‚Äù Nothing. I shouted his name, over and over, my voice hoarse, the phone‚Äôs screen showing the call still active, seconds ticking. My chest heaved, panic flooding me. I slammed the gas, the truck lurching, gravel spraying. The fields blurred past, dark and endless, like they were closing in.I dialed 911, hands trembling, the phone still on speaker. ‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs missing,‚Äù I choked out. ‚ÄúHe was on the phone, walking near Lynd, and he yelled ‚ÄòOh shit‚Äô and stopped talking.‚Äù I spilled it all‚Äîhis crash, the lights, his path toward Marshall. The operator was calm, too calm, telling me to breathe, that officers were on the way. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúNear Lynd,‚Äù I said, voice breaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finding his car.‚ÄùTwenty minutes later, I spotted it‚Äîa glint of metal in a ditch off a narrow road. Nose-down, headlights off, driver‚Äôs door wide open. I skidded to a stop, grabbed my flashlight, and stumbled out, calling his name. ‚ÄúHey! Where are you?‚Äù My voice vanished into the dark, answered only by crickets and the rustle of corn. The flashlight‚Äôs beam swept the ditch, the road, the field‚Äôs edge. No footprints, no signs. The keys dangled in the ignition, glinting faintly, like they were waiting for him.Police arrived, their lights pulsing red and blue across the fields. An officer, burly with a clipped voice, asked me to recount the call. ‚ÄúHe saw lights,‚Äù I said, my hands shaking. ‚ÄúThought it was Marshall. But that‚Äôs impossible from here.‚Äù The officer‚Äôs brow furrowed, glancing at the flat horizon. ‚ÄúNo way he saw Marshall,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúMaybe a farmhouse, a grain elevator.‚Äù They searched, flashlights darting, boots crunching. One found a candy wrapper near the car, crumpled, but it wasn‚Äôt his. Another checked the creek, its water black and still.Dawn brought volunteers‚Äîfarmers in flannel, townsfolk with coffee, their faces grim. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good kid,‚Äù a woman said, handing me a blanket, her voice soft but heavy. I nodded, unable to speak, my eyes fixed on the fields. They dragged the Yellow Medicine River, divers wading through mud. Dogs sniffed barns, fields, ditches. His phone was dead, last signal from that field where he‚Äôd shouted. Theories swirled‚Äîriver current, a drifter offering a ride. But no tracks, no witnesses, nothing.Those lights haunted me. Marshall was too far, the land too flat. A grain elevator‚Äôs beacon? A distant porch light? None were close enough. I drove those roads daily, eyes burning, searching for answers. The fields stared back, silent, their secrets buried deep. Townsfolk stopped meeting my gaze, their casseroles and pats on the shoulder feeling like apologies. My wife clung to his hoodie, her eyes hollow. I kept his phone charged, willing it to ring.Every time I pass that ditch, I see his car, door open, keys glinting. I hear his voice‚Äîcalm, then that sharp shout. What did he see? What was out there, in the dark, waiting? The countryside stretches on, vast and quiet, holding him somewhere I can‚Äôt reach, and the fear grows colder every day, whispering I‚Äôll never know.",1,1747483921.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1korhva,https://i.redd.it/9tuk06nr2c1f1.png,"Babes, how do I style my mystery bundle? (trade/sell ?)","So I just got my clothes and as always I am so pleased with the quality! Everything is butter soft and well made. But I just don't know what or how to style these pieces.... I didn't receive anything I asked for and honestly a lil upset that I didn't get two accessories (like advertised) and instead got a thong. I never wear thongs because my labia majora is majorly prominent to say the least. Might do a Pamela Anderson thing and wear the thong as a scrunchie lol. 

Anywho! Would love to get some inspiration and/or someone who wants to trade/sell practically anything out of this bundle.......... Except the pants and pin üìå",2,1747483882.0,FashionBrandCompany,2,1.0,False
