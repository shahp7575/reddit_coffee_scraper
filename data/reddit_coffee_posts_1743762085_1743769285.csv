I have a Barista Touch Impress, and I have no issues getting a decent coffee from freshly roasted beans.

However, when it comes to getting a decent one from beans from the supermarket, it tastes horribly.

I do the Intelligent Brew adjustment after changing beans, but the taste is terrible. I have tried beans from Lavazza and Starbucks, dark roast, medium roast, tried mixing dark and roast, dialing the grinding size, playing with the temperature, but I could never even get close to get something drinkable.

I live in Japan, and freshly roasted coffee here is pretty expensive, so I would like to be able to get something drinkable from cheaper beans.

Sometimes, I even get a smell and taste that reminds me of some chemical substance, it's just weird.

Anyone else has the same experience? How did you fix it?",1,1743768895.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

---

Hello Redditors!

In today’s ever-evolving business landscape, sustainability is more than just a buzzword—it's a guiding principle that shapes corporate strategy and reporting. Whether you are a seasoned CSR professional or a newcomer in the sustainability arena, understanding effective sustainability reporting and strategic communication is essential. Let’s dive into a comprehensive guide based on robust frameworks and practical examples, fine-tuned for crafting engaging, insightful content that can captivate audiences both online and offline.

### 📊 **Crafting Comprehensive Sustainability Reports**
To create impactful sustainability reports, one must focus on several key components:

- **Identify Material Issues:** Start by spotlighting the issues most significant to your stakeholders, such as climate impact and resource use[1]. This focus ensures your report’s relevance and resonance with its intended audience.

- **Deploy Global Frameworks:** Rely on globally recognized frameworks such as GRI or CSRD[1] to lend credibility and transparency. These frameworks not only ensure compliance with industry standards but also provide a structured approach to your reporting.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involve stakeholders throughout the reporting process. Solicit their feedback and incorporate their insights to enhance the report's credibility and impact[1]. Engaging stakeholders creates a sense of ownership and collaboration.

- **Prioritize Clarity and Actionable Insights:** Use visuals, straightforward metrics, and actionable insights to maintain readability[2]. Clear communication fosters understanding and encourages action.

*Example post:*  
""🌍 Building a sustainability report? Focus on what truly matters to your stakeholders. Leverage frameworks like CSRD for global alignment and engage your stakeholders for deeper insights. #SustainabilityReporting #ESG""

---

### 🔄 **Implementing a Strategic Sustainability Framework**
To ensure sustainability efforts are both strategic and effective:

- **Leverage HBR's Four Lenses Framework:** Align sustainability efforts across stakeholder influence, scientific evidence, business value, and ethical responsibility[3]. This approach prevents scattergun strategies and focuses resources effectively.

- **Learn from Case Studies:** Take a cue from innovative initiatives like Keurig Dr Pepper’s eco-friendly coffee pods, which tackled material issues like waste reduction and ethical sourcing[3]. Real-world success stories can serve as inspiration and guidance.

*Example post:*  
""🧠 Strategic sustainability ≠ random acts. Look through the **4 lenses**: stakeholders, science, business, ethics. KDP’s eco-friendly coffee pods show how focused efforts lead to real impact. #BusinessStrategy #CircularEconomy""

---

### 📈 **Enhance Social Media Reporting**
Social media strategies can be optimized with thoughtful reporting:

- **Audience-Centric Reports:** Customize your reports for the intended audience. Marketing teams thrive on campaign data, whereas leadership focuses on conversions and ROI[2].

- **Utilize Visuals:** Visual elements like charts and screenshots can vividly highlight key achievements[2]. Accompany visuals with clear narratives for maximum impact.

- **Conclude with Actionable Goals:** End with SMART goals like “Increase branded content by 15% this quarter” to provide direction and focus[2].

*Example post:*  
""⚡ Want action-driven reports? Curate metrics for your specific audience. Use visuals to showcase achievements and set clear goals for future growth. #SocialMediaStrategy #Analytics""

---

### 📰 **Mastering the Art of Press Releases**
Crafting compelling press releases involves:

- **Concise Information Delivery:** Follow the 5W+1H model (who, what, where, when, why, and how) in your opening paragraph to hook your reader immediately[4].

- **Bullet Points and Data Inclusion:** Use bullet points for easy scanning, coupled with quantifiable data for credibility[4].

- **Incorporate Authentic Quotes:** Authentic quotes from company leaders add a layer of trust and reliability to your narrative[4].

*Example post:*  
""🚀 Writing press releases that capture attention is all about clarity. Start with the *why* and back it up with data and authoritative quotes. #PRStrategy #PRProTips""

---

### 🌱 **Achieving Environmental Sustainability Goals**
Room for improvement in environmental sustainability can be navigated through:

- **Adhering to the UN SDGs:** Goals such as clean water, climate action, and sustainable cities provide a roadmap for actionable targets[5]. Translate these into achievable objectives within your company or community.

- **Case Study Emulation:** Model after SNHU’s balanced approach across academics, operations, and community engagement for a comprehensive sustainability plan[5].

*Example post:*  
""📌 How to make an eco-impact: 1️⃣ Cut plastic for #LifeBelowWater 2️⃣ Go green with #ClimateAction 3️⃣ Support community equity. #SustainabilityGoals #EcoImpact""

I run a small influencer marketing agency focused on Linkedin in INDIA.   
  
We’ve onboarded incredible creators (think the best).   
  
But here’s the issue: *I can’t get brands.*

I’ve sent 200+ cold emails over the last month and only received 15 responses & only 1 converted. Clearly, I’m missing something. I need your help to fix two key problems:

Problem 1: How do I find the right brand contacts? Who is the right person to connect? Is it the Brand Manager, or the Marketing Head or the influencer marketing Lead. I’ve done outreach still cant find the solution.   
  
Question: How do you find actual decision-makers (like Influencer Marketing Managers or Partnership Leads)? Are there niche tools, directories, or strategies for this?

Problem 2: What are the ways you have used, if you have, which has worked for you to get in contact with the right people. Is it Cold Outreach, or Referrals, or thought leadership. I mean what is it really? 

BIGGEST QUESTION: What do brands really want to see in a cold pitch?

* Should I lead with metrics, case studies, or a catchy subject line?
* How do I stand out without sounding spammy?

**What I’ve Tried (And Failed At):**

* Sending generic collaboration requests with slight personalization.
* Not including social proof (but I’m new—and I dont want to fake credibility?).

Any templates or frameworks that worked for you?

**Brands/agency folks:** What makes YOU to reply? What instantly turns you off?

And everything I've read narcissism and increasing age is a bad mix so I know this is a factor. 

Ever since Ive known this guy he is so weird in the morning.  Maybe I've been spoiled but morning breakfast is always a group activity.  Enough coffee for everyone, it your cooking something you see if others want some too. 

Not this narc. You are always on your own. It's taken me years to convince him to ask least not drink the last of the coffee without making more. 

Put on top of that, there is no ""good mornings"" no little hugs or greetings. Now I don't expect people to be cheery or even talkative. But some acknowledgment of our presences would be nice. Am I asking for too much?

Now I've noticed the last year or so he's gotten worse in the morning. More grumpy, getting up even earlier, sort of acting like he lives alone. 

Yes, he's 76. And his sleep is weirder than usual. Could he be sundowning? Those with elderly parents may have more insight here. 

The problem is, being a narc, I'm always on the look out for the next silent treatment and often times this feels like a left over silent treatment from Something. 

I think they days morning coldness is bumming me out more than usual. I was away for 3 days and this is my welcome home?

Fuck you.

**May 26**

WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING HERE?!?!  I am on the 50^(th) floor of an office building for a meeting with a lawyer.  How the fuck am I going to afford someone that works in this office?

The administrative assistant, Gretchen, takes me along a hallway that has a sign that has the partner’s names.  Gretchen is very obviously the one in charge of this office. She’s probably in her 50s, immaculate silver hair and her attire is impeccable.  This woman is goals for me.

“Fredericks, Rogers, and Thompson”  is on the wall.  I giggle.  I have no choice.  I mean, F.R.T.?!?!?  She looks over her shoulder.  “I told them to at least change the order and they refused.  Now I get to enjoy all the giggles of those stubborn boys being mocked by people thinking of fart.” 

I manage to whisper a “They couldn’t find a Smith too?”  And now she has to stop to compose herself.  She lifts her hand as if denying the laugh.  Hahaha. I broke her. I love this woman already!

I go into a conference room and swear I can see my apartment building from here.  What a view!  I have my stack of papers and am pacing like a caged tiger while I wait.  I’m too nervous.

A man approaching his 60s walks in.  He’s got a folder tucked under his left arm.  He has his dark grey suit today with his red tie.  We shake hands.  He looks up at me.  He chuckles.  I decided to wear slight heels, and I am above 6 feet tall in them, which makes him look a little short.  We sit down and he asks for my paperwork. 

He scans the paperwork in what feels like inhuman speed.  I start getting nervous.  He fae?  No, can’t be.  He works his way through my stack while making notations on a sheet he has with him.  He stops and starts looking at some papers a few times.  After 10 minutes of light chatting with me while he works, he finally finishes.

“Okay, so I had an associate pull publicly available numbers and walked through some scenarios.  I grabbed the numbers I needed from your paperwork and I think we can make this happen.”  He smiles at me and I am both hopeful and terrified.

“How?”

He pulls out one of the packets he had ready in that folder.  “You know you own an LLC, right?”

I nod as the taxes this last year have been a nightmare. I had to get an accountant.  The old owner had me sign papers saying my new LLC was buying the assets of his. I found out that LLC owed a considerable sum to the state government.  I still don’t know why they didn’t go after me or my LLC for any of that. Though I am starting to suspect it was magic or a lawyer like this.

 “Using that LLC, you are going to make a few purchases and enter a partnership of sorts. First you will…

30 minutes later he has a detailed plan that makes sense to me, but I am also a little shocked by all of it. Buying into another business to use it to get a loan for the building and then paying back the loan with profits from the two businesses. He just made a comment about selling the antique gold coins we keep getting in a business designed to do just that since it is also in that building.

I stare at him.  “Wut?!”

His smile is broad and full of mischief.  “You put in all your tips.  I noticed that you have been getting some old coins and other things.  I believe Maybelle’s other friends are the source. While this would normally be something so strange I wouldn’t even begin to know about it, I happen to have a twenty plus year history of working with her and with such a company.”

I smile. “That tracks with her.”

“It certainly does.  How much do you know about Maybelle?”

My danger sense is screaming. I also believe this man is digging for a reason. “I have known her for approaching 2 years now. Unusual order. Kept coming back. I consider her my good luck charm.”

“Really?  Why?”

I mull over the proper way of saying this. “Since she started showing up, I went from a barista to a shift super, to the manager, to owning the franchise. More people keep coming in and while some do know her or know the people she does, a lot don’t. Our location has boomed in sales and my personal life has gone from survival mode to being able to be content.  She may not be the cause, but damn if her showing up hasn’t been lucky for me.”

He chuckles.  “Remember how I said she started smiling more 2 years ago?  Around the time she did I asked her why she hadn’t aged a day in 20 years. She got very upset and said I was imagining it.  I have been using a roundabout method of interrogation on other people that know her to check.  They think she has aged. But then I look at some records…”

He is committed to this now. I wait.  “Ever watch Highlander?  I feel like I know how they felt when they figured out his secret.  I did some digging and…. I think one of my oldest friends, and the godmother of my daughter, may not be human…”. He is very upset. I realize he brought me here to help me and more importantly, to find out more.

I gotta salvage this. “So what if she isn’t?  I mean, has she ever gone back on her word?  Has she ever taken advantage of you or yours?”  He knows something, yes.  But as long as he doesn’t push it, I can keep him safe.  Mab would have to remove a danger to her subjects.

“No, the opposite.  We always performed our dealings fairly. Hell, I was having issues with a former partner that was trying to take all our clients and she intervened. When he tried to poach her she got really angry and his entire scheme not only failed, he ended up losing his license in the state.   I know she had a hand in that.  After that I asked her to be my daughter’s godmother and she was the happiest I had ever seen her.  My daughter has the kindest and most adoring god mother I can imagine.”

I picture Mab as a fairy godmother. I begin to giggle.

“YOU GET IT!!!  Strangest thing. Alright. So I am not imagining things.  And thank you for refusing to answer me directly or confirm anything. Shows me you care about her and respect her.  And you keep secrets.”

He winks and I know he knows that I know what he doesn’t know. And I just confused myself.

“Now back to business. Maybelle’s first company deals with antiquities.”

I interrupt here. “First?  You mean she has at least another one?”

“She’s got 3 other companies, heads all of them, and works too much.  I am concerned.  Even if she is… something else, she can’t keep up this pace .  If another company was to buy a substantial portion of one of her business and make some changes…”

“I am pretty busy with my coffee shop though.”  I couldn’t run two companies even if I wanted to.  I can barely keep things going in my coffee shop.  I need more people.”

He pushed a piece of paper in front of me.  “I have a list of potential heads of that branch of the company.  I have approached Maybelle about this over a dozen times in the last decade.  She refuses to slow down.  If one of these people were to be part of your company, they can take over.  She trusts your judgment.  You can interview them and see. You get the right person and they will assemble a team to deal with financial issues for your shop as well. Things like taxes, investments, and more.”

  I look at the name of the company. WAIT. THAT’S MY FAVORITE ANTIQUITIES PLACE! They really are the ones moving in next door. Her chuckle was because my joke was actually correct?  That bitch.  She would have worked towards this if I hadn’t been planning it anyway…She’s been helping me all along. I damn near start crying. He sees my eyes get misty. I can’t help it. Without asking she has given me favor after favor. She really is my luck charm. Time to start repaying in kind.

“You were waiting for this opportunity, weren’t you?  A chance to help her and a chance to do so in a way she wouldn’t allow her pride to get in the way of?” He knew about the coins and her shop. He knows she is moving her place to make buying the building more justified?

He smiles and shrugs.  “Maybe.  Do look at the list.  I am sure one of them will do a great job.  Especially with the salary in the budget I have outlined here.”

“This is like more than 7 times what I make…”  WTF

“Really?  You should be making that much and more…”  He seems very surprised.

“I have never really thought of it.  I just gave myself a small raise after I bought the franchise.  I used all the profits to invest back in the shop.  Isn’t that what you are supposed to do?  I’ve given everyone raises and I am planning on hiring some more people to lighten the load on everyone.”

He smiles and nods.  “I get it.  She was right about you being too kind. Also, if you hadn’t been doing that, you wouldn’t be able to do this.  So that is a good thing.  Going forward, you should be looking at pay closer to **this** as it is about the average as far as we can tell in the city.”  He puts a figure in front of me.  I almost faint. 

That reminds me of something.  “Oh, if we go with this entire thing, what sort of fee are you charging?  Actually, considering you handed me almost everything… why did you do that?”

He laughs again and I am reminded of my dad before he died.  “The rate we are charging you is $500 an hour.  That plan took over 20 hours to make.  I am comping most of that.  I’ve had it around for a decade…. You were here for the work I had to do just for you. So, 2 hours, as I had to use an associate to pull figures as well.  Changing numbers and such was a simple matter.  After that you are looking at a good 10-20 hours for setting everything up.  You will likely want us on retainer for a little bit as things go and until you are set.  I am more than willing to set this up in monthly installments as your LLC gets going.”

I feel like I got hit.  I understand this stuff is expensive, but, DAMN.  “Can I think on this for the weekend?” 

He nods.  “Of course.  Here, let’s get your parking ticket validated and you can go home.”

I look a bit chagrined.  “I took the bus.”

He stares at my business suit.  He shakes his head and chuckles.  “You are braver than I.  In that case, are you going back to your shop?”  He’s had an idea.

I nod.  He continues talking, “I was thinking of picking something up.  I haven’t been inside the place, so this will be the perfect opportunity.”

“I think I might go out and have a drink to figure this out.’  I may need one.  I planned on celebrating if good news, drowning sorrow if not, and letting loose if a mixed bag.

He goes to get his overcoat while I talk to Gretchen about when to contact them.  After that we get in his very nice black car with expensive leather seats.

As we are driving, I am doing some calculations on my phone and obviously trying not to freak out.  He looks over and chuckles.

“She told me you were far too young for your old soul.  You have a good head on your shoulders. You pick up things and you definitely have a dedicated way about how you do things. Where did you get your degree?”

I smile. “I have a GED. Never went further.”

He whistles. As he talks, I can hear some admiration in his voice. At least it sounds like it. “Managing to own a successful franchise at 25 without a degree.  You are doing something right. You know, you remind me of my daughter.  She’s about your age.  Lives in the Chicago area.  She is expecting soon.  I can’t wait to meet my granddaughter.”  He really is a nice guy.  I get why Mab likes him.  We park and HE OPENS MY DOOR!  What a gentleman.  *I am adopting him as my dad.* 

When we walk in Jackie looks up from making a drink as the chimes announce us. I get a new tune, he gets the chime for a regular but it hints at enlightened at the end. Nice. Jackie smiles at us.  *How is she always so cute when she smiles at me?*  She goes back to making the drink and I walk up to Paul at the counter.  “Please give the gentleman whatever he wants on my tab.”

Several employees look up.  “He drove me here, I am paying him back.  Also, he’s a regular in the drive thru.”  Come on people, his chime was regular, mostly.

They laugh while I shake his hand and excuse myself.  Oberon and I wave to one another as I walk by him.  I make it to the back room when I hear Jackie pipe up.  “Going on break!”

She nearly bursts into the room.  “How did it go?”

“I can do it, but it will be convoluted, and the man is banking on Maybelle cooperating.  Oh, they charge $500 an hour.”

She stares at me.  “No, no they don’t.  I checked their rates yesterday.  They start at $650 an hour.  For an associate.  Like their 1^(st) years…  He looks like he might be a partner.  That suit is top end.”

I nod.  “His name is the first one on the wall.”

She whistles and plops down next to me.  “So, he is giving you a discount.  Like a massive one, making your dream come true, and also making you bet all this on a lady named Maybelle?!”

“You know her as Mab.”

“OOOOOOOOHHHH!  Damn.  That’s a lot.  He aiming to be your sugar daddy?”

The look I give her could turn Medusa to stone.  She laughs at me.

“Sorry, my humor goes dark when I am in shock.”  She is smiling at me.

I pat her hand.  “Why are you in shock?”

“It is happening for you.  You are pushing forward.  Do you have any idea how utterly amazing you are?  I mean, I don’t deserve a friend even half as awesome as you.”  She means it. I can tell.

“Say three nice things about yourself.”  She looks puzzled.

Her face gets confused as I double down. “You just insulted yourself. Say 3 nice things about yourself, now. I am not talking to you until you do.”

She looks a little confused but goes along. “I am smart?”  I stop her with a hand.

“That is a question and not a statement. Fix it.”

“I am smart. I have amazing taste in people.  I don’t quit.”  She looks at me with a determined face.

I smile and hug her. “Felt good saying something nice about yourself didn’t it?  We love it when we get compliments, yet we are our own harshest critics that never compliment ourselves.”

“There has to be a backstory to this.”

I laugh. “My dad made a family rule. Insulting yourself requires 3 good things. Also, they can’t repeat. So, you can’t use those anymore.”

“Your dad sounds great. I’d like to meet him.”  She sits cross-legged up against the other arm of the couch and looks at me.

“If we are ever in Augusta, I’ll take you to Magnolia Cemetery and introduce you.”  Thinking of him is bittersweet.  I am trying not to cry.  I am staring at the monitor on my desk. Anywhere but at her. *She is going to hate herself if she sees me crying.* I am not prepared for the hug.

“I didn’t know.”  I can hear the pain in her voice.  She is up against me.  She smells nice.

I nod at her and explain, “I don’t talk about them much. My dad was the doting father you see in shows that is not just a great dad but a great husband. My mom was loving.  Then we lost him. She, and I am quoting her here, ‘lost everything that mattered to her.’  Thanks, mother.”  I can’t really see anything in the room anymore. It’s fine.

“I have my dad’s height. I have his eyes, and apparently his smile. It was too much for her. She didn’t want to deal with me. Kept seeing him whenever she looked at me.  Called me some choice words.”  I laugh, bitter at the memory.  I REALLY need a drink now.

“Sweetie, you are gonna need to be in the right head space to process everything going on.  Want to go clubbing in 45 minutes when my shift ends?”  She winks at me.

“Fuck yea.  I have some clothes for it here, unless you wanna go home first.”  I think my response surprises her.

“Really?!  I mean, we could go straight there, I brought a change of clothes here because I had planned on going with Pat.  You going to be okay associating with our drunk asses?”  She gets up and starts walking for the door, shaking that ass on purpose. I laugh.

“I will.  If I didn’t know better I would say you had this planned, just in case.”

She smiles innocently. She winks.  *I knew it.*

*“*You going to be okay associating with some amazon in 4-inch heels scaring all the men away from you?”

“Only, if you help me bring a girl or guy home.  We can share!”   She laughs and ducks out as I throw a wadded-up paper at her.

I have a lot to think about*.  I can wait till tomorrow.  Tonight, I am going to get drunk and see about a one-night stand.  I wanna get some!*

Waking up at 5am, cold showers, no distractions, perfect routines. But what I’ve learned through work, study and just real life over a long period of time is that discipline is way more subtle than that.

Here are a few things I learned (that I even keep as my background screen or as screenshots to remind myself)

It’s more about managing your energy than your time -> You can schedule your whole day, but if you’re running on 4 hours of sleep and 2 coffees, nothing’s gonna land. Real discipline is knowing when to rest, not just when to push

There’s no finish line -> I always thought as soon as I got this whole thing figured it out I can call my myself disciplined. But I realised that you don’t ‚win‘ at discipline. You just build habits, mess up, reset and keep going. It’s not linear, and that’s normal and okay

Your environment matters more than your willpower -> You can be the most motivated person, but if your phone’s next to you buzzing, you haven’t eaten and your workspace is chaos it’s going to be very rough. Discipline often starts with setting the stage right first 

At the end I realised that discipline isn’t cold but it’s actually a form of self-respect. So it’s not about punishing yourself but about caring enough about your future self to do the right thing today and that of course takes effort and saying ‚no‘ sometimes, not just to others but to yourself.

So if you’re here reading this, just a quick reminder that you’re already on the right path. Keep showing up! Growth doesn’t always feel loud, but it’s happening",4,1743768138.0,getdisciplined,2,1.0,False
1jra4uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1jra4uq/3_years_brain_fog_gone_instantly_after_taking/,3+ years brain fog gone instantly after taking Lexapro,"After a car accident, I had 24/7 brain fog for over three years. I tried everything—fasting, dozens of different vitamins, consistent workouts, quitting coffee, better sleep, moving to a new house, using medical-grade air filters, allergy shots, microdosing LSD, lion’s mane—you name it. Nothing worked. The brain fog never let up, and I was getting more and more frustrated.

I kept seeing my doctor and trying to get in with a neurologist, but no one would see me. Most didn’t take brain fog seriously, and those who did only offered therapy. I’d never done therapy, and I didn’t feel like I needed it—I’ve always loved my life and felt at peace.

Eventually, my doctor prescribed Adderall to help me concentrate. Surprisingly, it made me feel incredibly relaxed, and for the first time in years, my brain fog went away. But after a month, the fog came back, and the Adderall no longer had the same effect. That’s when it hit me—maybe I do have anxiety, even if I don’t feel anxious in the way I thought anxiety was supposed to feel.

Funny enough, when I first saw my doctor, his first suggestion was anxiety meds. I shrugged it off—I was convinced I didn’t have anxiety. But after stopping Adderall and starting Lexapro, my brain fog disappeared on day one. Two weeks later, I checked in with my doctor and told him how grateful I was.

He explained something that stuck with me: for some people, anxiety doesn’t feel like anxiety because it’s all they’ve ever known—it’s just how their mind has always worked. Looking back, I think it all started after my concussion. The brain fog triggered a constant cycle of worry—was something seriously wrong? Why wasn’t I getting better? That cycle just made it worse.

Lexapro broke that cycle almost immediately. It was shocking, especially since my doctor said it could take up to 30 days to work. I hope this helps someone else dealing with persistent brain fog, especially after a concussion. You're not alone—and sometimes, the answer isn’t what you expect...

 TL;DR:
3+ years of constant brain fog after a concussion. Tried everything with no success. Lexapro cleared it up instantly—turns out it was anxiety the whole time.",7,1743768055.0,BrainFog,1,1.0,False

1jra4oz,https://i.redd.it/16drze9n5tse1.jpeg,I think I’m doing it wrong in a vermihut.,"I recently found out on a post about airflow that the trays in the vermihut are supposed to rest on the ledges inside. I thought they were there to keep the trays from sinking too deep and getting stuck. 

I watched some of the learn by doing guys videos on YouTube. Originally I had one bin 3:4 full that was bedding and feeding. After watching the videos I added a dry inoculation bin to the bottom. I had some problems and it went something like …

So the trays aren’t supposed to sit on top of the material below them? Shit, I been doing it wrong. 

I had two trays. One of slightly compressed dry bedding at the base, then one  with worms and bedding, that I feed in above that. It got too moist so I added bedding and divided the worms between two trays of moist bedding. The top bin got filled to capacity to dry down the material and the worms migrated down into the second worm tray when I was mixing. When I added dry bedding to the second worm tray they migrated down into to the dry inoculation tray, which wasn’t so dry anymore, so I added a fourth tray of dry shredded cardboard to the bottom. 

So for simplicity sake, 

Tray 1: full 40% moisture worms, bedding and food 
Tray 2: 1/2 full 20% moisture worms and bedding, top try resting slight compressing bedding. 
Tray 3: Shredded paper inoculation tray. Some worms, slightly moist. Second tray compressing. 
Tray 4: shredded cardboard. Totally dry. No worms afaik. 

Am I good to go or should I do a reset? I just bought two 18 gallon totes with intentions of dumping my top 3 bins into one if necessary to reset the tower. Also currently fighting mites with neem cake and diatomaceous earth. My bin looks like a coffee cake

Now, before you roll your eyes or close this tab, I promise this isn’t just some lazy attempt at getting a free game. I have very good reasons for asking, and who knows—you might even walk away from this feeling like you did your good deed for the day.

The Situation

I’d love to buy Project Zomboid myself, but unfortunately, my bank account has other plans. You ever check your balance and immediately regret it? That’s me right now. It’s not that Project Zomboid is crazy expensive or anything—it’s just that, for me, even a $20 purchase feels like a luxury at the moment.

Trust me, if I had the money, I wouldn’t even be making this post. I’d already be playing, building my base, fighting off zombies, and experiencing all the chaos I keep hearing about from my friends. But instead, I’m stuck on the sidelines, watching them have fun while I just scroll through game clips and reviews like a kid staring through a toy store window.

So, in a moment of sheer optimism (or desperation, depending on how you look at it), I decided to put this out there. Because hey, sometimes, people are just cool like that.

Why You Should Consider Gifting It

I know what you might be thinking: Why should I buy a game for some random person?

Fair question. And the answer is: Because it would actually mean something.

Let me break it down for you. 1.	I will 100% play it. Some people get gifted games and never touch them. That’s not me. If I had Project Zomboid right now, I’d be launching it before you even finished reading this. I’ve wanted this game for a while, and I know I’d put in hours the moment I get my hands on it. 2.	I already have friends who play it. This isn’t a situation where I get the game and then realize I have no one to play with. My friends are deep into Project Zomboid, and they’ve been bugging me to get it so we can all play together. The only thing stopping me? The fact that I can’t afford it. If you gift me this, I’ll be able to jump right in with them and finally experience all the fun instead of just hearing about it. 3.	You’ve probably spent $20 on way dumber things. Let’s be honest—how many times have we all blown $20 on something completely pointless? A fast food meal that wasn’t even that great? A drink from some fancy coffee shop that you didn’t even finish? A random microtransaction for a game you don’t even play anymore? Compared to that, this would actually make a difference in someone’s day. 4.	It’s just a really cool thing to do. Look, I’m not trying to guilt-trip anyone. But sometimes, doing something nice for a stranger just feels good. You ever randomly pay for someone’s coffee or hold the door open for someone and they give you that genuinely appreciative look? This is like that—but digital. And who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll be in a position where I can do the same for someone else. 5.	Good karma. If you believe in karma, this is an easy way to stack some points. If you don’t believe in karma, well… at the very least, you’ll walk away knowing you made someone’s day a little better.

No Pressure, But…

Obviously, I’m not expecting anything. I know money doesn’t grow on trees, and people have their own expenses to worry about. But on the off chance that you’re feeling generous—or just like making someone’s day—you’d definitely have my appreciation.

At the end of the day, it’s just a shot in the dark. Worst case? You ignore this, and life goes on. Best case? You decide to be awesome, and I finally get to join my friends in surviving the zombie apocalypse.

Either way, thanks for reading. Hope you have a good one!

[Bambino Plus, DF54]","After reading the recent article about how unfiltered coffee can increase bad cholesterol levels, as someone who has slightly higher than normal cholesterol (genetics) I decided to try using some paper filters since that is supposed to cut out nearly all the compounds that are problematic.  I use a Breville Bambino Plus with an IMS precision basket in a Breville bottomless portafilter, and grind with a Turin DF54.  I have lately been using the Stumptown Hair Bender because its priced well, pretty decent quality, and my grocery store regularly gets fresh beans.  I have things pretty dialed in with my setup, 18 grams in, 40ish grams out in 30 seconds.  The espresso I get tastes good by itself, but I usually make a couple cappuccinos in the morning for the wife and I.    
  
Yesterday I received the Normcore precut paper filters I orders (they come in a nice little tin that looks good next to my other stuff on the counter FWIW), and went to do my first pull.  I wet the filter with my atomizer before grinding into the basket (grind level 5.5 on the DF54, the same that has been giving very consistent results), did WDT, then tamped with a Normcore spring loaded tamper.  I put on the Normcore (ultra thin) puck screen, and started the pull.  It was absurdly fast!  I got 46g in 16 seconds as I raced to turn it off.  WTF?  I figured maybe I have to go a little finer with the filter, so I bumped the DF54 down to 4.  44g in 16 seconds.  It was like a faucet.  Leaving it on the same grinder setting (4) I set prepped for another pull WITHOUT the filter - it choked and would barely flow through.  Went back to 5.5 with no filter, got a very nice, normal pull: 39g in 30 seconds.  Tried the filter again, at level 4 on the grinder, 42g in about 15 seconds.  I assumed an added layer in there would slow things down but it seems to be speeding it WAY up--like twice as fast.  

Can anyone give me some advice here?  I don't think I can grind fine enough to make it work with these filters.

TL:DR - Paper filter causes flow rate to double with all other setup the same.  40+ grams in 15 seconds--terrrible espresso (sour and nasty).  Help please!",1,1743767950.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

No matter how much effort you put in, one mistake is all it takes for people to turn against you. 

And no matter how deeply you love, some will always doubt your sincerity—or worse, never appreciate it in the first place.

We live in a time where individuality is fading, replaced by a culture of imitation. 

People chase brands, designer labels, and status symbols, not because they need them, but because they want to prove something to others. 

It’s no longer about personal style or self-expression—it’s about wearing a Balenciaga hoodie just to flex a price tag. 

It’s about visiting Starbucks, not for the coffee, but to show the world, ‘Look, I’m high status. I drink my coffee here.’

And relationships? Keeping one feels like holding a venomous snake close to your chest, hoping it won’t bite. 

But the real tragedy? It’s not the snake’s nature that’s the problem—it’s the fool who loves it despite knowing the risk.

And many women are quick to say ‘I love you,’ or ‘I could never live without you,’ feeding you promises that feel eternal—until the moment they get a better option. 

The second they see someone with more status, more money, more clout—they’re gone. 

It’s not love, it’s opportunism dressed up as romance. 

They don’t fall for men’s hearts, they fall for aesthetics and lifestyle. 

The flashier your watch, the deeper their affection suddenly becomes. 

And when they’re caught slipping? It’s never their fault. 

They cry, they play the victim, they twist the narrative until you’re the villain—accusing you of not knowing how to love, of being insecure, of being ‘too much.’ 

Meanwhile, they were already emotionally out the door, scouting for their next upgrade. 

It’s a brutal game, and for some reason, we keep stepping onto the field, hoping this time it’ll be different.

Then there are those who preach morality, who give grand motivational speeches, who appear virtuous in public but are short-tempered, selfish, and empty inside. 

Some pray five times a day in the mosque, yet their words are laced with arrogance and cruelty. 

So what’s the point? If prayer doesn’t humble you, if wisdom doesn’t change you, then what is it all for?

The world has become a place where appearances matter more than substance, where virtue is performative, and where sincerity is often met with suspicion. 

And maybe that’s the saddest truth of all.",7,1743767509.0,Life,4,1.0,False

# Beyond the bio

**Disclaimer (and a bit of ramble)**  
My qualm with bios in AM is they're blander than Gordon Ramsey's murgh makhani - which I personally consider a war crime against India. Most people throw in a sea of generic phrases into their bio, and often miss details about who they are and what they're after. I recall one of my first experiences of matrimony sites was a girl asking if I'm ""traditional but modern"" and how she (surprisingly) wanted ""someone who is kind-hearted"" - to which I replied back that I churn my own butter however unfortunately throw baby ducks off tall buildings in my spare time. And while I felt my humour was lost as she proceeded to ask if I were ok with pets, I was thinking how painfully inefficient the process is.

Generic bios make it hard to differentiate upfront, not stating what you're after and why someone should consider you wastes everyone's time, and unless you're naming a Spotify playlist - writing ""good vibes"" isn't too helpful. I'd like to do better. So apologies in advance if I come off as a tad arrogant/conceited in this post - I feel with bios it's simplest to pause humility for a moment in favour of accuracy, coupled with the intention of being authentic. And I'm hoping this gives you better clarity on who I am, what I'm after, and whether we'd be a good match.

**Few things to get out of the way**  
You'd get to tell your parents that you've found a guy who is well spoken, well educated, successful, good family background, and all the other usual boxes ticked. And while I think that's all important, for the type of wife I want to find I'd like to impress you beyond that. Read on.

**Where's my head at?**  
I place a lot of value on accountability and competence. I'm big believer that we choose our actions so we choose our consequences. And I'd say I'm someone who's deeply rooted in old school values of respect, manners, and integrity. I'm selective about the company I keep, and I've been very lucky to have good influences throughout my life - from parents, to mentors, to friends. Which is likely a large reason why I don't have any trauma, emotional baggage, mental health issues, attachment/commitment issues, and everything else new that's trending nowadays. And that's not to say I've never experienced adversity - I feel doing anything worthwhile in life has adversity as a side dish. But moreso I'd like to think over the years I've worked on cultivating the self-awareness and emotional maturity needed to navigate whatever life throws, and on the rare occasion I lean on my inner circle, they're all the type to tell me to get my act together - and I love them for it.

**Where's my heart at?**  
It's a blend of ambitions, valuing relationships, and a consideration of legacy. I'll save my broader life ambitions for when we connect. However with relationships, when I'm 107 and on my deathbed, I feel I'd measure a life well lived by how good of a husband/father/son/brother/friend I was. And husband is purposely first on that list. While on legacy - one part is I want to make sure to put in the effort to raise kids who are happy/healthy/competent/good people, and the other part is figuring out a way to leave this world a slightly better place than entering it. Which I'm not entirely sure on the how yet, but it's something I'm reflecting on.

**My view on gender dynamics**  
I felt this would be a good section to include, as everyone has a different view of what they want in a partnership. I'm less fussed about gender roles, and moreso appreciative about men being masculine and women being feminine. I don't think men and women are the same, but that doesn't mean we're not equal partners in marriage - and I feel that's especially true when men value femininity in a wife and women value masculinity in a husband. There's something subconsciously clear about that notion (at least to me). And it's not so much about household chores (which I find this topic often segues into) - IMO in 2025 everyone should have the personal responsibility to be a competent individual that can look after themselves and the environment they live in.

Instead I'll explain with a few examples - say we're all dressed up, heading to a black-tie event, and it's bucketing down rain. There is absolutely no way I'm letting you drive. I know a lot of couples prefer the whole 50/50 across all tasks, but personally that's not a relationship dynamic I want. I rather you sit down, relax, and pick out some music. One part of that is the motif tied to old school romance, which I'd like to say I still believe in. There's something unexplainably rewarding for you and I if I were to pull up at the venue, hop out of the car, open your door, offer you a hand, keys to the valet, and we walk in together. The other part with the notion of men/women being different is I feel men should take the accountability of keeping their family safe, so in this scenario I don't want you stressing out behind the wheel in the rain with a bunch of lunatics on the road. Instead - taking the wheel (pun intended) is something I'd find satisfying and hope you'd appreciate. And in return as an example, if you're the type of person that takes the accountability of making our home feel warmer by perhaps picking out percale cotton sheets, scented candles, and soft incandescent lighting - that's something I'm hoping you find satisfying, and I would appreciate.

**What do I do for fun?**  
My personal view is hobbies/interests don't really matter in finding a partner, I prefer to connect on values, and if you find yourself enjoying someone's company then I feel hobbies/interests tend to fall into place. However I've seen a fair number of posts on here appreciating minimalism, and wanting a partner that shares the same view - so I thought it's important to be transparent and say I'm far from minimalistic. My passions outside the office are travel, food, fashion, and sport. I'm conscious this means different things to different people - so I'm happy to share what it means for me over DMs.

**What am I hoping to find?**  
To be transparent and not waste anyone's time - ultimately for me it comes down to character and looks, both of which have a high bar. Looks of course are subjective. However on character, I'd like to find someone our future kids can be proud of and look up to.

Over the years I've asked out a number of conventionally attractive women for coffees/dinners with the intention to court, and the large majority have fortunately said yes, however I haven't found someone that has the character to back up the looks. And I'd like to think there's at least one girl out there that has both.

Going beyond that, if I were to find someone that can pair this with having high standards for themselves and the people around them, as well as caring about growth - I feel that would be my realistic ideal in a life partner. This is what you can expect from me too, where I'd want to support and be a positive influence in your growth.

**Why AM?**  
I don't really see LM vs AM as black and white. And I'm not looking at marriage because it's something I feel I'm obligated to, instead it's something I want - I view marriage with the right person as a key component in what makes for a fulfilling life. Whether I happen to meet a girl by coincidence at a bookstore tomorrow, or introduced to someone by my parents, or by chance I stumble upon someone here on reddit - I feel the process to know ""this is the person I'd like to marry"" is the same.

# Tl;dr - why me?

The ""sir, this is a Wendy's"" summary would be:

* Looks - I keep active, care a lot about grooming, and got lucky with genetics when it comes to things like a full head of hair and good ageing. Overall enough to get likes and matches on dating apps, however not enough to be a Calvin Klein underwear model. Though I'm hopeful my wardrobe gets me onto GQ someday.
* Earnings - My income sits in the top 1% for my country, and I'm glad to say that's a result of hard work and dedication, however I have a lot more career and financial aspirations ahead which I'd like to achieve as well.
* Personality - Clearly delightfully charming. But personality is always one of those things it's simplest to chat and find out whether we enjoy each other's company.
* Character - Maybe a bit of self-bias here, maybe not. I take a lot of pride in character - it’s something I’ve been conscious to cultivate and uphold throughout my life, and over the years I’ve prioritised it higher than any of my peers. If we end up courting, I’d be glad to show you what that looks like.

He ensured that every member of the organization understood their importance to the mission.

I am currently using de Delonghi Magnifca S, as a espresso enjoyer, I want to upgrade my setup. My budget is around 500 600 euros. 

I have 2 choices : 
- Bambino Plus with the Baratza Encore ESP for 600 euros.
Or 
- Sage Espress with the Baratza Encore ESP for 590 euros. 

Weird choice I know, but at the moment, the Sage barista Espress is currently at the same price as the Bambino plus … 

Of course, the plus is the intern grinder which can be useful for my GF who just want to pour some coffee quickly. But for the long run, should I buy the bambino plus or the barista espress?

[gentleworld.org/is-your-maple-syrup-vegan](http://gentleworld.org/is-your-maple-syrup-vegan)

""When maple sap is boiled in order to thicken it into a syrup, a liquid called a “defoamer” is added to reduce frothing. The ingredients in defoamers vary; they can be made from vegetable oil, but they are sometimes made from animal fat.

What makes things complicated is the fact that maple syrup producers are not legally required to list the defoamer on their ingredient labels. This is because regulatory agencies consider the amount of defoamer to be insignificant—according to one producer, the ratio of defoamer to maple syrup is about 1:5000.

Essentially, then, even if the label on a bottle reads, “Pure Maple Syrup”, it might still contain a product from slaughtered animals.""

""“Very few producers use animal-based products,” said Scott Dunn, president of the Maine Maple Syrup Producers Association and owner of Dunn Family Maple in Buxton. “However, there are a few old-timers that still do, but they are generally smaller in size.”

When I asked Dunn about potential defoamers, he said, some producers “used to take a hook and put a piece of bacon fat in (the evaporator). Lard. Vegetable oils. I’ve heard of people using coffee creamer. You basically need some kind of fat.”""",1,1743766121.0,advancedveganism,0,1.0,False

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.                                                                                                  Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Final Thoughts**

Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins accelerated to face melting ATHs. Kendu has IRL products(which these coins did not have) and a social media dominance that rivals those 2, in a market with far, far more money in it. This is so bullish to me, if those coins can do it in worse conditions, Kendu can easily overcome Shib's ATH market cap in the largest bull run in history. Doge was a bit different due to very influential people pumping it.  
Furthermore, these coins have proven all you need is a strong community...... That's exactly what Kendu has and in my opinion Kendu has the best community in crypto currently. Whilst the rest of the coins are struggling and are very negative, Kendu is so optimistic and we have people pushing in all directions.

Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe. I am sure you will love it : ) We are a very welcoming and hard working community and any questions are always welcome!

Guys, all the signs are there..... Do not fade Kendu

* Sitting at a bonfire after slaughtering a blood-thirsty demon
* A safe room after getting chased by a ghost in a haunted house

No meat, no alcohol, no sugar, meditate for hours, wear linen, live like a monk. No masturbating perverts! 

The truth I’ve come to know:

Just open it.

How long does it take for someone to open their eyes in the morning and shut their heart because something didn’t go their way? How long does it take you? 

Didn’t get the text.
Spilled the coffee.
Boss said something off.
Boom heart closed.

Weather outside not what you wanted. 
Bank account balance low. 
World affairs spreading fear.
Heart gets closed. 

Meanwhile, people out here acting like God is going:
“Oh no… is this guy drinking a margarita on the beach watching the sunset? No love for you!”

Or:
“OMG did you just eat a cheeseburger after working a 12-hour ER shift taking care of people in need? While experiencing actual bliss in your car during that first bite? HOW DARE YOU. No love for you!”

C’mon. Isn’t that ridiculous?

You think the source of all being is that petty?
Love doesn’t vanish because you didn’t pass the kale test.

Opening your heart isn’t about achieving some perfect lifestyle. It’s about not slamming the door shut the moment life stops behaving how you want.
It’s not about being pure. It’s being present.

And like anything else in life it takes practice. The first mile you run won’t be your fastest. The first song you play on the piano won’t be Mozart.

“So you both worked on this one?” Elyse inquired of the ladies as they [left the table](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1jqf7cw/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_10_ep_30/) and settled in front of the television.

“We did” Bailey nodded. “It was a real family affair. Gretchen’s dad gave it the greenlight of course, she was a show runner, and I had a small part as a barista at the coffee shop. My scene comes up about halfway through “large double shot vanilla latte for… Mr. Fabulous”” she giggled “it was fun”.

After the final credits rolled Skye snapped some cute maternity photos of the happy couple. “I’ll take a few more towards the end too” xe promised, before finally managing to lure Gretchen away from the others under the pretext of getting a look at the nursery. *Oh dear, here we go…* xe thought.

“Its beautiful” Skye looked around the small space and felt a lump rise in xir throat. Xe wanted to have all the things that perfect little room represented more than anything. Taking a deep breath xe steeled xir resolve and turned back towards xir friend.

“Gretchen, I’m so sorry to be the one to tell you this… but the other night…” Skye had barely gotten to the point of discovering Gretchen's father flirting with xir boss when she buried her face in her hands, clearly distraught.

“You know about that?” she whispered “Daddy told me what he’d done right after he confessed to dad. They… they’re trying to work through it, but they’re having a really hard time. Some days I think me and the baby are the only things keeping them from coming undone.”

“You know dad’s “unflappable studio executive” persona is all an act,” she went on “at heart he’s just a big softie, and his heart is broken.”

Skye nodded. The liking Theo had taken to xem on [Career Day ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1h5lzhh/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_9_ep_217/)and the special connection he seemed to feel towards xem as Peachy’s grandson had led to the two sims becoming close during the time that Skye and Gretchen had worked together on the paper “I was afraid he’d be devastated.”

“He is.” she agreed “Honestly, I miss writing, but dad got me my job at the studio, and he really looks forward to seeing me every day at work. Ever since “it” happened he’s even started taking lunch breaks and taking me out to eat. He needs me to be there for him now more than ever.”

“Anyway” she smiled sadly “enough about me and my family drama. Let’s get back, I’m sure the others are wondering where we’re at. Besides, I want a piece of pie!”

Skye nodded, accepting a big hug before following her back downstairs to where the others were waiting, cake plates at the ready.

1jr8zdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1jr8zdy/s37e5_karma/,S37E5 ... Karma,"Last week, I said I was looking forward to Jonathan and Ana (the douches, as I dubbed them) realising the consequences for using their precious express pass so quickly and so non-strategically. Well, the consequences couldn’t have come swifter or harder than in this second Bali-based episode which actually had me feeling just a little sorry for them, even if Jonathan is a massive douche.

Action began in Penglipuran village, where the couples were lucky enough to stay overnight in local houses. What a treat! Alyssa blew coffee grounds into her face. LOL.

At the crack of dawn, teams had to RACE AS FAST AS THEY COULD to the equaliser. Seriously, the douches must have realised what a waste their pass was as all the teams caught up to them outside the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. It’s also pretty wild that the race had teams start at their start times based on their previous leg just for them all to meet up together at the monkey park. 

Magical sights of monkeys with their babies treated the contestants before the most magical sight of all, Phil Keoghan greeting the teams and letting them know it was time for a DOUBLE U-TURN. I genuinely had no idea what a U-turn was before this episode, but I had seen fans talk about it all week. Well, now I know it’s where a team has to do both parts of a detour. How exactly is that a U-turn? Whatever, drama time!

After the justifiable ire that the other teams had at J+A, it seemed as if all the votes would go to them. However, the fact that a second team would also be getting U-turned meant that some cast members got strategic with their voting. I was positively shocked when I saw Scott and Lori get just as many votes as J+A. The people who voted for S+L noted that they had done fantastically well on the last few legs and seemed to be a really strong and competitive team. Ingenuous self-deprecation seemed to be the fatal flaw of S+L, who must have had a habit of commenting that they were slower or older than the other teams, even though they were doing very well.

I did feel bad for them, from their talking heads they do just seem like very positive people that cheer others on, but they got criticised for this and Nick and Mike called it “gameplay” which was so harsh and unfair that it made Lori rather upset. “They’re not my friends anymore!” It’s hard to know what to say about this really. They were voted so highly because they were nice and good at the game. It’s kinda like a blue shell in mario kart.

Ana commented “We were U-turned, that was a shocker.” Was it, Ana? Was it a shocker? If she’d just threshed her rice the previous day, they might have been fine.

I was hoping the detours would be long and arduous so that the U-turned teams would be spending a long time doing them, and I certainly got my wish. The detour was Coconuts or Coral (4/10, not especially creative, but the first two letters are the same). I really appreciated the fact that the Coral detour was specifically designed to help the ocean and highlighted regrowing coral to help other endangered reefs.

The coconuts detour looked like hard f-ing work. I was extremely impressed with the teams that managed to bring all the coconuts in just two trips, including Scott and Lori. I knew it would be a cinch for Jeff and Pops, though. We laughed at how lackadaisically the coconut checker seemed to check the coconuts before giving her thumbs up.

On the coral side, teams worked under a nice tent to keep them out of the sun. Both Carson and Jack and Brett and Mark (who I tend to mix up) both had an eye for detail and got their corals right first try. In more juicy viewing, the douches kept making mistakes because they tried to rush it and couldn’t appreciate the pattern. As soon as they did get victory however, we had a revelation: Ana was terrified of swimming in the ocean. WHAT? You’re this super competitive team who needs to win and you CAN’T SWIM!? They even dropped the metal frame at one point in fear. Finally they did it, but holy cow, this is a real drawback on the race. Might have been a nice time for an express pass, eh?

They then switched over to Coconuts as Scott and Lori switched to Coral. Even though they had been given a hint by helpful Carson and Jack about the colour of the coral, the Mormon parents were absolutely hopeless at this challenge and got so many attempts wrong. On the douches’ side, Jonathan seemed to be experiencing the ‘Fatigue’ and going through a Flo (S3) moment as he refused to move after stacking the coconuts. He left his empty water bottle on the side, littering. What douche behaviour.

My guess is that he had hit some sort of mental and physical barrier of not wanting to do any more work, and that the motivation of the million dollars was no longer working. There seemed to be something against being told what to do as well. Sometimes, when you’re instructed to do something, even though it’s for your own good, you just want to take a minute and do it of your own volition. Later, he also admitted that his hopes were to stay in first place all the time, which is such an unrealistic expectation that it’s laughable. Perhaps being close to last was also demoralising to him.

Teams then had to go to another beach for the roadblock, which was about finding a surfboard with the identical decal (a new word for me) amongst a throng of surfers. Pretty boring to go through the action here, some players got lucky, others didn’t. Han got to surf back to the beach, good for her, although it looked as if she left her fellow surfer behind for a second. I wasn’t worried about Pops’s strength to get himself out there, but I did worry if he had good enough eyesight for the task. I needn’t have worried, he did great.

I will say, the traditional costumes and dancing to greet the contestants at the end were fantastic, and I love that each of them got a show.

In the end, it came down to the douches vs the Mormons, and I realised this was going to be the most exciting elimination yet. Clearly, Ana wasn’t suited for the task, so it was an exhausted Jonathan’s turn. I watched in shock as he laid his head on the board to rest several times, all motivation to continue simply vanishing. What I would give to know what he was thinking in those moments. 

It was at this moment that the show inserted a shot of Phil asking the audience if they wanted to participate and prompting them to go to CBS casting. Like last episode, they chose to insert this just when a team were at their absolute nadir. The implication both times seemed to be “Think you can do better than these clowns? Then come on down!” I was hooting with laughter.

Scott dashed out and I was hopeful that he would get lucky before Jonathan did, but it was not to be. As Jonathan eventually returned to the shore, he snatched away the envelope from Ana, who wanted to read it. There seemed to be a quiet, irrational anger within Jonathan, it was actually quite scary. Lori looked on and nervously commented that it was good for them. I believe that team really wanted to see all the other teams do their best.

Jon was really in some state of upset, because as Ana encouraged, “Come on, baby”, he replied, “Can you not say that again, that’s gonna really irritate me hearing that.” Which fed into the theory I had about him not liking to be told what to do at any time. At what stage of mental fragility do you have to be to be irritated by “Come on, baby?” If Teri could put up with Ian’s “COME ON TERI!” for a whole season, you can do it too, mate.

“I don’t know what else to say.” “Just don’t say that again.” Fricken, yike! At least he was fairly cordial, unlike the Jonathan (Blue Hitler) I’m watching on S6. What is it with people called Jonathan?

He was absolutely silent on the mat, and Ana did all the talking. I could tell he was in an altered state of mind, and probably aware that not saying anything was probably the best approach, cos he couldn’t trust his words. Astonishing though that he couldn’t celebrate still being in the race after being dealt such a crushing blow.

It was extremely telling in his talking head later that he learned that “reality is never gonna meet expectations. I know, individually, I can outperform anybody here. That was my expectation. But this season of the race is so unpredictable … I don’t think it would have been possible to win every leg this season.” Was that also his expectation? The fact that THAT is what he seemed to be coming to terms with is mind-blowing for me. Why hold such high, preposterous, almost impossible expectations of yourself? It’s only letting you down. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a team as obsessed with staying in first place all the time, except perhaps for Cloin and Christie (S5), who were simply a competitive team. The few times they weren’t in first place, they didn’t seem as crestfallen as Jonathan does about it.

For Jonathan to have gone from being first to now being last in the race must have been extremely humbling and a huge blow to his massive ego. I really wonder where else we’re going to see his state of mind flare up on this leg. He’s a fascinating one for sure. I don’t think he is intentionally hurtful or harmful, and last leg, I don’t think they were trying to get one over on the other teams, just playing as competitively as they could. The taking away of the 15kg option seemed to be taken too personally by the other teams, but I do think J+A deserved to be U-turned, especially for Jonathan to learn some hard truths. I guess I felt a little sorry that it hit him so hard, but he’s turned out to be quite genuinely douchey in some areas so I don’t feel all that bad.

I had been annoyed that Scott and Lori seemed so happy and lucky this season so far, and perhaps that annoyed the other teams, too. So it was quite conflicting to watch all the wind get taken from their sails and watch them plummet into last place - “DJ Khaled: Suffering from Success” meme. Phil’s speech to them as they were eliminated was a bit misjudged “This is a lesson to your boys in how you move on from here. How you accept this.” JFC Phil, they’ve just been eliminated, give ‘em a minute! Fortunately, they were a lot more classy than Jonathan. The episode did end with a weird shot of Scott fully cupping one of Lori’s ass cheeks as they looked out at the sea.

Dubai next! Would love if they went down the Jumeirah Sceirah again in Wild Wadi (like they did in [S5E9](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1iu8k4z/s5e9_the_race_goes_to_wild_wadi_i_can_die_happy/)), but somehow I doubt it.

Also, can we get a flair for S37 now?

I was just trying to get through my day, minding my own business, when losing my phone completely threw me for a loop. It’s one of those things you don’t think will happen to you—until it does, and then you’re left questioning every life choice that led up to that moment. Buckle up, because this is a wild one.

It all started on a random Tuesday morning. I’d woken up late, as usual, because my alarm didn’t go off—or maybe I just swiped it off in my half-asleep haze, who knows. I was already running on fumes, chugging coffee like it was my job, and I had this big meeting at work I couldn’t miss. So, I threw on some semi-clean clothes, grabbed my bag, and bolted out the door. First stop: the coffee shop down the street. I’m a creature of habit, so I ordered my usual—large latte, extra shot, because I’m not a functioning human without it. The place was packed, people shuffling around, baristas yelling names over the hiss of the espresso machine. I got my drink, shoved my phone into my jacket pocket—or so I thought—and hustled out the door to catch the bus.

At first, everything was fine. I was sipping my coffee, weaving through the morning crowd, feeling like I might actually make it to work on time for once. But then, about halfway to the bus stop, I went to check the time. You know that moment when you pat your pocket and it’s just… flat? My heart dropped. I stopped dead in my tracks, right there on the sidewalk, and started patting myself down like I was doing some weird interpretive dance. Jacket pockets? Empty. Pants? Just lint and a crumpled receipt. Bag? I yanked it open and started digging, tossing out random junk—old gum wrappers, a pen with no cap, a half-eaten granola bar I didn’t even remember packing. Nothing. No phone. I was just standing there like, 'Is this actually happening right now?'

People were walking around me, giving me those awkward side-glances you get when you’re clearly losing it in public. One guy even muttered something under his breath—probably calling me a weirdo, but I didn’t care. I was in full-on crisis mode. My phone wasn’t just a phone, you know? It was my lifeline—my calendar, my music, my bus pass app, my everything. And now it was gone. I tried to retrace my steps, power-walking back to the coffee shop while my brain ran through every possible scenario. Did I leave it on the counter? Did it fall out of my pocket? Did some sneaky pickpocket swipe it while I was distracted by my latte? The possibilities were endless, and none of them were good.

Back at the coffee shop, I burst through the door like I was starring in some dramatic movie scene. The line was even longer now, and the barista looked at me like I was about to rob the place. 'Hey, uh, did anyone turn in a phone?' I asked, trying to sound calm but probably sounding like I was about to cry. She shook her head, barely looking up from steaming milk. 'Check the lost and found,' she said, pointing to a sad little box by the register. I rummaged through it—sticky keys, a single mitten, a cracked pair of sunglasses—but no phone. My stomach was doing flips at this point. I asked a couple of people in line if they’d seen anything, but they just shrugged or ignored me entirely. Great. Super helpful.

Then it hit me: 'Find My Phone!' I’m a genius, right? Except—here’s the kicker—my laptop was at home, and I didn’t have any other way to log in. I briefly considered begging someone in the coffee shop to let me use their phone, but I didn’t want to be \*that\* guy. Plus, I was already late for work, and my boss isn’t exactly the forgiving type. I could already hear her passive-aggressive 'Oh, nice of you to join us' in my head. So, I made a split-second decision: I’d deal with it later. I sprinted to the bus stop, barely made it on, and spent the whole ride staring out the window, imagining my phone lying in a gutter somewhere, or worse, in the hands of some creep who was already scrolling through my embarrassing selfies.

Work was a blur. I couldn’t focus. Every five minutes, I’d catch myself reaching for my nonexistent phone to check Slack or doomscroll Twitter—force of habit. My coworkers noticed I was off, too. 'You okay?' one of them asked, and I just mumbled something about a rough morning. I didn’t want to admit I’d lost my phone because then I’d have to hear all their 'You should’ve backed it up' lectures. By lunchtime, I couldn’t take it anymore. I borrowed a coworker’s laptop, logged into iCloud, and hit the 'Find My Phone' button. The little map loaded, and there it was—a blinking dot… right back at the coffee shop. Relief washed over me, followed immediately by dread. Had it been there this whole time? Was it still there? Or had someone picked it up and was just chilling with it?

I begged my boss for an early lunch break, promising I’d make up the time, and hauled ass back to the coffee shop. When I got there, I went straight to the counter, out of breath, and asked the barista again. This time, she sighed, reached under the counter, and pulled out—hallelujah—my phone. 'Someone turned it in like an hour ago,' she said, like it was no big deal. I could’ve hugged her, but I settled for a shaky 'Thank you' instead. I checked it—still locked, battery at 12%, but alive. I have never felt so victorious in my life.

Anyway, by the end of it, I was sweaty, exhausted, and swearing I’d never take my phone for granted again. I even bought one of those dorky phone lanyards the next day—judge me all you want, I’m not going through that again. Now I’m wondering if I’m the only one who’s dealt with losing a phone like this. I mean, it’s such a small thing, but it turned my whole day into chaos. Anyone else have a story like that? I need to know I’m not alone in this.",0,1743763655.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

(#Anywhere),"I love the colour black, a good horror movie, have strong opinions about music, *and* can make you a good coffee? I may just be the girl of your dreams. Or maybe you’re only wanting to get close to me for my orange creatures, which is fair game. I’m not surprised even in the dating world they’d steal my spotlight. 

But this post is about you and I. No, stop looking at the cats. You and I, okay? So let’s get to know one another. 

I’m Mona. Goth, blasian, and a self proclaimed adventurer who is currently spending her last year of travel exploring the depths of German towns and cities, swimming in France, and traversing through the countrysides of the Baltics. I have a big heart for learning and creating, and to prove it I have two entire bookshelves (impressive, I know) full of textbooks that are thoroughly inked through.

And now to be completely transparent with you: I have trouble emotionally connecting to people in a romantic sense. Sometimes my soul makes no attachment. I’ve always sort of been this way; letting my soul guide me generally in life, and it’s no exception when it comes to love. But once I choose you, I choose you indefinitely. And you’d have to do numerous woodland rituals to get rid of me. 

So, my person, maybe you’re out there, you’re reading this, and you believe we’d make a good fit, and you believe it’s worth trying. And I believe so too. And maybe someday, we'll be walking along the seaside together thinking back to how lucky we are to have found each other. 

Though I have difficulty emotionally connecting, there are still a few traits in a man I find attractive: compassion, patience, wit, and being knowledgeable.

I want your voice to soothe me and my touch to warm you. I want, despite it all, for you to be my forever. 

I only need this to work once. Maybe your soul was looking for me too…

P.S.
I’m a package deal, the brain cells for the orange cats *aren't* included.

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends from Europe or even Lithuania who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature, but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I’m really into the series Cunk on Earth.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is Tūla.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamanių Šilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I’m always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks, whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

Oh, and I’m a huge coffee fan, it’s basically my hobby!

I also adore cats! I have one myself, so expect lots of cat pictures from me. :D

1jr8qbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1jr8qbw/my_current_phone_setupprocess/,my current phone setup/process,"my first interaction with my phone is when i turn airplane mode off in the morning (my phone is in airplane mode most of the time to reduce EMF) to check my lock/home screens while my work computer is booting up.

my lock screen contains notifications for texts and gmail only. text notifications generate a sound but gmails don't and yahoo mail (which is my throwaway email) doesn't not generate notifications other than the badge count on my home screen.

the only apps on my home screen that are (quasi-) push in nature are Phone, Mail, Messages and Gmail. badges are turned on for all of these so i can see if there's anything new.

after checking my lock/home screens while my computer boots up, i'll place my phone in a cradle in the far corner of my living room, plug it into power, and leave it on the lock screen (not locked; just with the lock screen being displayed) so i'll be able to see any new lock screen notifications that are received during transition times. otherwise, my phone gets zero of my attention and exists mainly as a one-way communication mechanism for my kids or creditors to reach me; nothing more.

the only other use there is for my phone is that i take it with me (in airplane mode whenever it is on my for EMF reduction purposes) whenever i drive because these days you have to in case you're in an accident or require assistance of any kind.

i almost forgot. i also use my phone for alarms:

i have only a single repeating *finish coffee > drink / rinse with water > floss teeth* alarm for 7am each morning.

*side note: off topic, but i want to mention here that alarms can be dual-purpose, e.g. the above alarm goes off at 7am, but i continually snooze it as it reminds me to sip my water at least every nine minutes bc otherwise i'll forget, esp if i'm working/concentrating on something else.*

the only other thing i use an alarm for regularly are things like *move laundry to dryer* (because my washer and dryer don't have buzzers) or *open dishwasher* to let dishes dry.

i do occasionally use alarms in other circumstance where other cues won't work but that is fairly rare. i've found that creative physical cues are much more natural feeling and practical than using the phone by default.

*sidenote: i can't emphasize enough how much more productive i've been since relegating the phone to the corner of the room. instead of checking my phone (or playing guitar) being my go to when i don't know what to do with myself or have a free minute, i check the whiteboard on my fridge which contains my actionable todos. it's utterly transformed my life more than any other single strategy.*",1,1743762853.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Let’s start with the fact that I worked for a digital agency for over 5 years and never really thought about the fact that sooner or later, I would outgrow it. At some point, giving away 50% of my income started to feel painful, especially since there was no real sense of community—no team meetups, no brainstorming over coffee, nothing. Everyone was just scattered across the world.

I started thinking about breaking away and launching my own thing—*""my own hustle, with blackjack and Bender.""* But I ran into a major problem: I couldn't get clients.  
Freelance platforms like **Fiverr, Upwork, and Freelancehunt**? **Completely useless.**  
For an experienced specialist, entering these platforms is like throwing away years of expertise. I say this because I spent the last three months testing everything—banners, headlines, descriptions, pricing strategies, SEO tweaks—and in return, I got nothing but worthless traffic.

I even made the mistake of bringing a few of my clients onto one of these platforms, only to **lose around $375** in commission fees. To make matters worse, I later found out that my clients were **also** paying additional platform fees—meaning that **50% of the total project budget was just disappearing into thin air.**

So now, my plan is to **build my own website and run Google Ads** to target high-intent search queries, increasing my chances of landing solid projects.

Again, I never really planned for this. I’ve managed projects with monthly budgets equivalent to an average annual salary, making cold, rational decisions without hesitation. But when it comes to promoting myself, for some reason, I freeze up. I get that it's all in my head, but I’m working on it.

If you've made it this far—thank you, seriously! 🙌

1.Focus on Weak Spots, Not Everything
Don’t waste time reviewing what you already know. Take a quick practice test like 10-20 questions and see where you mess up pharm, prioritization, or labs? Hit those hard to improve the scores.

2.Master the SATA Hack
Select All That Apply questions scare everyone. Treat each option like a true/false question. Break it down: Is this right? Is that right? Don’t overthink NCLEX wants clear answers, not tricks.

3.Use the ABC Rule and maslow

5. Memorize 5 Must Know Labs.
Forget the giant list.memorize  these: Potassium (3.5-5), Sodium (135-145), Creatinine (0.6-1.2), BUN (10-20), and Hgb (12-16). Pop them on a flashcard, snap a pic.

6. Practice 50 Questions, Then Stop
Don’t burn out doing 200 questions the night before. Do 50, review why you got stuff wrong, and chill. Confidence   exhaustion. work smarter, not harder.”

7. Cheat the Stress with a Brain Dump

I was quite impressed by his confidence so I gave him the time of day. Initially, I thought he was attractive, softly spoken, somewhat interesting and confident. I had a wonderful Birthday so it was just a bonus that a hot guy approached me! I was in a particularly giddy mood as I can’t believe I made it to 33 (I have health issues so it’s just a bonus I get to live a year longer and am in relatively good health this decade so far). We made plans to meet up the next day as he was flying back to the States.

On our date, he seemed kind, funny, interesting. We just went for a coffee in a park and chatted for hours. I thought we had a great connection - so much so, he even moved his flight to next week so he could spend more with me which I was touched by. 

When he was trying to amend his flight, a conversation with a friend of his popped up and I could see a photo of me that he must have found online. I asked him what he’d said to his friend but he suddenly got really shy and didn’t want to share it, citing that it was embarrassing. I thought he said something complimentary. How wrong I was. After drinks at a hotel bar, he asked me to go for dinner. I declined initially but I thought “OK since he’s not going to be in the country for longer”. At dinner, I pressed him on what he told his friend the night we met.

Cue my shock when I read that he’d said to his friend that apparently I seemed “slightly lower class but intellectual”.

I was obviously so shocked and winded. He said that on my BIRTHDAY! The night we met. He also said I “had a huge ass”. His friends arrived that same minute. I confronted him in front of his friend and his friend’s girlfriend as they arrived at our table who looked as shocked as I felt. I left immediately. 

Now should I give him a chance to speak? I think I stood up / showed up for myself and have enforced boundaries going forward that I’d prefer if I could cut communication. We had plans to meet today but tbh I don’t think I want someone like that in my life. I don’t want an unkind, classist partner not now and not ever. I also got diagnosed with a life-limiting disability so I do want someone who is empathetic, kind, patient and won’t mock me for being “low class”.  It also doesn’t help that my contract ended last month so he thinks even less of me that I don’t have a job right now.

Just to confirm, I wasn’t insulting to waiters / wait staff, I didn’t spit, I didn’t get violently drunk (I didn’t even drink!). I just had a matcha latte in a park with him, non-alc drinks at a hotel bar and was heading to dinner to meet his friends. Not sure what’s so low class about that? Not that I need to defend myself but I went to two excellent universities, I read books, am interested in other cultures/cuisines, go to art galleries and exhibitions and treat people as kindly as I can (if they’re a cleaner or a CEO). 

He then spent the entire evening trying to rationalise what he said over WhatsApp, citing that the meaning “low class” differs in the UK to the USA. But does it? Being unkind and lacking respect is the same the world over. He did apologise but IMO I would have had more respect for him if he’d actually said “I said something hurtful and judged you without getting to know you and I don’t stand by that”.

I should mention I’m a woman of colour and he’s white but not sure how much that plays a role in this.
