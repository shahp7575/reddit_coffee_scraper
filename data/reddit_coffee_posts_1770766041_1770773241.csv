I already had some great recommendations from this subreddit for a hostel to stay at  (choosing casa pepe) for the firt 4 days of my trip. 

now im looking for a spot to stay in roma norte / condesca for the final 10 days of my trip. 

Does anyone have good recommendations for a spot that is:

1) close to nice coffee shops / bars / restaurants 

2) is good for remote working (I'll be working 5 of those 10 days

3) bonus points for decent social atmosphere (hotel bar, pool, etc), spot that plans events

Price is not really an issue.

1r1jjl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/comments/1r1jjl7/looking_after_two_dogs_somehow_re_confirmed_im/,Looking after two dogs somehow re confirmed I’m not cut out to be a parent,"**(31, F—married for 6 years to my husband who’s also 31.)**



We have a 2-year old dog whose breed is high-energy and always needs constant stimulation. That said, we take him out to walk 3x a day, minimum of 30 minutes each. These next two weeks, I’m pet sitting a friend’s dog by myself, since my husband is on a work trip.

I have a job that is thankfully flexible enough so now I’m off from work for these whole two weeks. I love my dog to bits and taking care of a pet is noble and rewarding in so many ways. My friend’s dog is also no stranger to us as she’s been here many times in the past, but I’ve always had my husband help out before.

My routine the last few days is literally wake up and walk and feed the two dogs for the first hour. This is before I even get to make my coffee, otherwise, the other dog is more prone to accidents if she’s not taken out earlier. I play with them for a bit afterwards and then, wouldn’t you know it— it’s time to make myself lunch. Then of course, there‘s the kitchen that needs to get tidied up, yadda yadda.. the list goes on and next thing I know, it’s time to take them out again.

This experience is just showing me a preview of how my life would be as a mom. Realistically, my husband makes more between the two of us and I would be the one to stay home with the kid. My job is actual physical labor that requires me to be on-site, so taking an extended leave of absence is the move for me. 

I just feel so depleted at the end of the day, that I try to “put them to bed” early so we can all just chill in bed while I watch movies. Now I get moms who say their only quiet time is either early in the morning or late evening.

  
Kudos to mothers who find parenthood rewarding but I just don’t like the way that I’m feeling towards it. As much as I enjoy the rewarding part of “taking care of someone (in this case, pets)“ I don’t think it outweighs the feeling of depletion and that I’m just operating on auto-mode. I also find myself dreading the mundane tasks because I genuinely hate repetition. I sometimes even hate that I need to feed myself, what more being solely responsible for another being? What more if I have a child?

I’m currently typing this in a sour mood because it’s day 5 of this. The sun has set yet again and I feel like I haven’t really had much time left to do other things. If there’s any assurance if I’m leaning towards more being childfree, I think this is the confirmation for me.

I hope this post doesn’t come across as a wrong way. There are so many facets into why parenthood isn’t very appealing to me. I think I genuinely just don’t have a very nurturing personality and I think that’s a valid reason alone not to have a child.",1,1770772870.0,Fencesitter,0,1.0,False

My husbands birthday recently passed and he was drinking and so was some of his family. His brothers and him were mixing up random drinks just for fun, he had me try a sip. It was the smallest sip. I saw my MIL eyeing me before coming up to me asking me if I drank that, I said only a sip he wanted me to see what it taste like. She said you know you really shouldn’t consume any alcohol at all. This is my 3rd pregnancy, so I’m not an idiot so this annoyed me. I said I know, and she asked then why did you? We got into a small argument before my husband told her to back off. I noticed her staring at me multiple times and her and my SIL whispering and then looking at me.

My husband and I felt like being petty so I went into the kitchen filled a shot glass with water, everyone was about to take shots and I got in line and took mine with them. My MIL jaw dropppped and she started arguing with me, basically told me she wouldn’t allow this in her home and that I needed to leave. I said excuse me it’s my husbands birthday and she said excuse me this is my house. My husband and I told her it was fake and she told us we were childish, and we all got into a huge argument. SIL even joined in arguing with us. She then said party was over and we left, and she sent my husband and I (in a group message) how if worrying for her grandchild’s well-being is a crime then arrest her, and how we needed to grow up. AITA

Add; I figured I should add this, this isn’t a random occurrence. With all my pregnancy’s she tried to helicopter me. Tried convincing me I needed to stop working out, and no coffee at all(even when I had already spoke to my doctor.)

**Location:** Airspace over Sector 4 (Pacific Northwest Defense Zone) / Monitoring Outpost ""Berk""

**Date:** First Contact Day + 12 Hours

The sky was a canvas of chaotic data, and Operative 2045 was the ink.

He sat within the synaptic-harness of the *Night-Wind*, a single-pilot stealth interceptor that was less a machine and more an extension of his own nervous system. The hull was composed of photo-adaptive scales, grown in the high-gravity vats of the Noktus homeworld, that mimicked the exact color, temperature, and barometric pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.

To the human radar arrays sweeping the coast below, he was a cloud. To their thermal optics, he was a pocket of cold air. To the naked eye, he was nothing.

He was a Noktus. Being nothing was what they did best.

""Command, this is Spectre-One,"" he vocalized, his throat clicking against the internal pickups. ""Sector 4 grid complete. Human defensive capabilities are… redundant.""

""Elaborate, Spectre,"" came the voice of High Command, light-years away on the flagship. The voice was calm, detached, stripped of the emotional resonance common in the lower species.

""They rely on stationary kinetic batteries,"" 2045 replied, banking the craft with a mere thought. The neural interface read the twitch of his dorsal muscles and translated it into a seamless aileron roll. ""They have placed railguns on the ridge lines. Primitive. A single orbital strike would vaporize them before their targeting computers could even calculate a firing solution.""

""We are not cataloging targets for orbital strikes, Spectre. We are assessing threat levels for the Diplomatic Corps. Do they pose a risk to the Ambassador?""

2045 looked down at the human outpost below. It was a cluster of radar dishes, radio towers, and concrete bunkers nestled in a cove of pine trees and jagged sea rocks. The humans called it ""Berk Station."" It was a forward operating base for their Earth Defense Coalition (EDC).

""Negative,"" 2045 concluded, watching the human radio waves wash harmlessly over his hull. ""Their detection technology is blind to us. They are shouting into the dark, Command. They do not know we are standing right next to them.""

""Maintain orbit. Continue passive monitoring. Command out.""

The link cut. 2045 allowed himself a small, arrogant snort—a sound that vibrated through the fluid-filled cockpit.

The High Court was worried about these mammals. They feared the humans' unpredictability. But from forty thousand feet, 2045 saw only ants building hills. Impressive hills, certainly, but ants nonetheless. They were soft. They were loud. They broadcast their position with every radio wave, cell phone signal, and television transmission.

He adjusted his flight path, diving lower, skimming the cloud tops at Mach 3. The silence of the Noktus engines was absolute; they used gravimetric displacement rather than combustion. No boom. No roar. Just pure velocity.

He was untouchable. He was the ghost in the machine.

Or so he thought.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""You're wasting government power, Hiccup.""

Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III didn't look up from his soldering iron. A wisp of acrid smoke curled up from the circuit board he was modifying. ""I'm optimizing the sensor array, Snotlout. Go polish a tank or something.""

Snotlout—Lieutenant S. Jorgenson—leaned against the doorframe of the server room, looking every inch the military golden boy. Crew cut, crisp uniform, muscles that actually filled out the standard-issue camo. He was the nephew of the General, and he made sure everyone knew it.

Hiccup was… well, Hiccup.

He was twenty years old, possessed a dual masters degree in electrical engineering and astrophysics from MIT, and currently looked like he hadn't slept in three days. He was wearing a grease-stained hoodie over his Level-4 Clearance badge, and his workstation was a disaster zone of copper wire, cannibalized circuit boards, and empty coffee cups.

""The General is going to be here in an hour for inspection,"" Snotlout warned, tapping his watch. ""If he sees you’ve dismantled the Long-Range Receiver again to build one of your… toys… he’s going to reassign you to sanitation in Antarctica.""

""It's not a toy,"" Hiccup muttered, finally looking up. He adjusted his glasses, which were held together by a piece of electrical tape. ""And the Long-Range Receiver is garbage. It scans for radio and thermal. The Alliance ships? They don't emit either. They're basically holes in the sky.""

Snotlout rolled his eyes. ""Here we go. The 'Ghost Ship' theory again.""

""It’s not a theory!"" Hiccup stood up, gesturing frantically at his wall of monitors. ""Look at the atmospheric displacement data! Every night at 0200 hours, there’s a micro-pressure drop over Sector 4. Air is being moved out of the way of something mass-heavy, but radar shows empty sky. It’s a cloak, Snotlout. A gravimetric cloak.""

""Aliens are in D.C. talking to the President, Hiccup,"" Snotlout said, checking his reflection in a switched-off monitor. ""They landed on the Mall. Why would they be flying invisible ships over a jagged rock like Berk?""

""Because they don't trust us!"" Hiccup snapped. ""Look, Dad thinks we’re at peace. But if I’m right, they have a spy network right over our heads. And I’m going to prove it.""

He turned back to his creation.

It sat on the central table, an abomination of technology. It looked like a satellite dish that had been mated with a heavy-duty subwoofer and a car battery. It was ugly, wired together with duct tape and prayer, but the math was solid.

""This,"" Hiccup said, patting the metal casing, ""is the Night-Buster. If my calculations are right, it sends out a pulse of localized gravitational distortion. It’s like… throwing a rock into a calm pond. If there’s an invisible reflection, the ripples will hit it.""

""You're gonna blow up the power grid,"" Snotlout sighed, pushing off the doorframe. ""Whatever. When the General yells at you, don't say I didn't warn you. 'Oh, look at me, I'm the General's son, I can break expensive equipment because I'm a *genius*.'""

Snotlout left, mocking Hiccup under his breath.

Hiccup slumped into his chair. He looked at the photo on his desk—him and his dad, General Stoick Haddock. Stoick looked proud, wearing his dress blues, chest heavy with medals. Hiccup looked uncomfortable, holding a robotics trophy he’d won in high school.

*“I just want you to be part of the team, son,”* Stoick had said when he assigned Hiccup to Berk Station. *“Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Just man the radar. Do your duty.”*

""I am doing my duty,"" Hiccup whispered to the empty room. ""I'm the only one actually looking.""

He turned to his computer. The pressure sensor on the roof spiked.

*0200 Hours.*

""Right on time,"" Hiccup breathed. His heart hammered against his ribs.

He typed in a command sequence. The ""Night-Buster"" on the roof hummed to life. The capacitors whined, charging up for a single, massive pulse of interferometry.

""Come on,"" Hiccup gritted out. ""Show yourself.""

He hit **ENTER**.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The warning came from nowhere.

One moment, 2045 was gliding through the stratification layer, analyzing the nitrogen content of the clouds. The neural link was calm, a soothing hum of data in the base of his skull.

The next, his dashboard screamed red.

**ALERT. GRAVIMETRIC SURGE DETECTED.**

""What—""

He didn't even have time to engage the dampeners.

The pulse hit him. It wasn't a weapon—at least, not a kinetic one. It was a wave of pure distortion. It slammed into the *Night-Wind’s* delicate anti-gravity drive like a sledgehammer hitting a gyroscope.

The artificial gravity field collapsed instantly.

The silence of the cockpit was shattered by the shriek of tearing metal. The ship lurched violently to the left. 2045’s head slammed against the canopy, cracking the bio-glass.

**STABILIZER LOST. TAIL ROTOR FAILURE. STEALTH COMPROMISED.**

""Mayday! Mayday!"" 2045 roared, his hands flying across the haptic controls. ""Command, I am hit! Systems failing!""

""Spectre-One, report! We register no missile launch!""

""It wasn't a missile!"" 2045 snarled, fighting the neural stick as the horizon began to spin. The sky outside turned into a blur of grey clouds and green earth. ""It was a pulse! My tail-fin is gone! I have no yaw control!""

The ship entered a flat spin. The G-forces pressed him into his seat, crushing the air from his lungs. The sleek, invisible predator became a falling brick.

Below him, the dark canopy of the Raven Point forest rushed up to meet him.

""Ejecting!"" he shouted, reaching for the manual release.

**EJECTION FAILURE. CANOPY JAMMED.**

""Oh, you must be jesting,"" 2045 hissed.

He braced himself. He diverted all remaining power to the inertial dampeners and the structural integrity field. He curled his body into a ball, wrapping the bio-wings of the ship around itself like a cocoon.

*I am a Noktus,* he thought, a desperate mantra as the trees shattered his viewport. *I am the Void. I do not break.*

The impact was deafening.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*BOOM.*

The entire monitoring station shook. Dust fell from the ceiling tiles. The lights in the server room flickered and died, replaced instantly by the pulsing red glow of emergency backups.

Hiccup was thrown out of his chair, landing hard on his elbow. He scrambled up, coughing in the sudden darkness.

""What did you do?!"" Snotlout’s voice screamed from down the hall. ""Hiccup! The main grid is fried!""

Hiccup ignored him. He scrambled to the reinforced window.

Outside, in the dark woods of Raven Point, about three miles north of the station, a plume of smoke was rising. It wasn't the black, oily smoke of a burning diesel engine. It was purple. Glowing, plasma-infused smoke that illuminated the bottoms of the clouds.

""I hit it,"" Hiccup whispered. A cold knot formed in his stomach. The euphoria of being right clashed instantly with the horror of reality. ""Oh god. I actually hit it.""

He didn't think. Instinct took over.

He grabbed his heavy weather coat. He grabbed his portable med-kit (standard issue). He grabbed a telescoping stun-baton from the security rack near the door.

He ran out the back exit, sprinting toward his rusted jeep.

""Hiccup! Halt!"" Snotlout yelled, running into the parking lot, his flashlight dancing wildly. ""The General is five minutes out! Where the hell are you going?""

""Raven Point!"" Hiccup yelled back, throwing his gear into the passenger seat and gunning the engine. ""I downed a bogey! I have to verify!""

""You're crazy! It was probably a weather balloon!""

""Weather balloons don't leave plasma trails, Snotlout!""

Hiccup floored the accelerator. The jeep skidded on the gravel, tearing off into the treeline.

The drive was a blur of adrenaline and terror. Hiccup drove like a madman, the jeep bouncing violently over roots and ravines. Branches whipped against the windshield.

His mind was racing. *I shot down an alien ship. I actually did it. Dad is going to be… proud? No. He's going to be furious. I started an interstellar incident. I might have just started a war.*

He reached the edge of the impact zone. The heat hit him even through the glass—a wave of dry, electric warmth.

He slammed on the brakes and killed the engine.

Silence returned to the forest, broken only by the crackle of burning wood and the hiss of cooling metal.

Hiccup grabbed his flashlight and the stun-baton. He stepped out of the jeep, his boots crunching on the pine needles. He crept forward, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears.

The crash site was a trench carved into the earth, nearly three hundred yards long. Trees had been snapped like matchsticks. At the end of the trench, embedded in a granite outcropping, lay the machine.

It was jet black, sleek, and organic. It looked like an obsidian shard fallen from heaven. It didn't have rivets. It didn't have seams. It looked… grown.

""The Noktus.""

He slid down the embankment, dirt sliding under his heels. The ship was intact, mostly. But the tail section was mangled. One of the rear stabilizers—the left tail fin—was completely sheared off, sparking with violet energy.

Hiccup approached the cockpit. The bio-glass was cracked, spiderwebbed with fractures.

He shone his light inside.

And froze.

It wasn't a robot. It wasn't a drone. There was a pilot.

A humanoid figure, clad in sleek, black armor that seemed to ripple like liquid. It was slumped over the controls, tangled in a web of wires and flashing holographic displays.

Hiccup raised the baton, his hand shaking. ""Freeze! Earth Defense Coalition!""

The figure didn't move.

Hiccup crept closer. He saw the helmet—smooth, eyeless, aerodynamic. He saw the chest plate rising and falling shallowly.

*It's hurt,* Hiccup realized. *I hurt it.*

Curiosity overrode fear. He reached out, his fingers brushing the side of the cockpit. The hull felt warm and pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat. He found a recessed latch under a panel and pulled.

With a hiss of escaping gas and the smell of ozone, the canopy blew open.

The pilot groaned—a low, guttural growl that sounded like rocks grinding together. The helmet retracted, dissolving into the suit like nanotechnology, revealing the face beneath.

Hiccup gasped, stumbling back.

The face was alien, yet strangely, hauntingly expressive. It had dark, iridescent scales along its face. Pointed ear-flaps twitched against the side of its head. But the eyes…

The eyes fluttered open. They were a piercing, acidic green. Reptilian. Vertical slit pupils dilated instantly as they focused on the flashlight beam, then narrowed dangerously as they landed on Hiccup.

The alien looked at Hiccup. Hiccup looked at the alien.

The alien snarled, a sound of pure predatory aggression. He reached for a sidearm holstered on his hip, his clawed gauntlet scraping against the metal.

""Whoa!"" Hiccup yelped, stumbling back and dropping his flashlight. He scrambled to point the stun-baton. ""Don't move!""

The alien tried to pull the weapon, but his arm gave out. He slumped back against the seat, his green eyes narrowing in pain and fury. He hissed, baring teeth that were retracted, then suddenly snapped into place—sharp, serrated white daggers.

""You..."" the alien rasped. The voice came from a speaker on his collar, synthesized and glitching, translating the growls into English. ""You... shot... me.""

Hiccup stood there, a stun-baton in one hand and a flashlight in the other, staring at a pissed-off space dragon in a tuxedo of high-tech armor.

""I..."" Hiccup stammered, his voice squeaking. ""I... I was just trying to calibrate the sensor? I didn't think it would actually... work?""

The alien’s eyes rolled back. His head lolled to the side, hitting the headrest.

Hiccup lowered the baton. He stepped closer, cautiously. He looked at the pilot's leg, which was pinned under the crushed console. Purple fluid—blood—was leaking onto the floor of the cockpit.

Hiccup stood in the smoking crater for a long moment. He looked at the unconscious alien. He looked back towards the ridge, where he could see the headlights of a convoy approaching the monitoring station.

*Dad is here.*

If he called it in, the military would swarm this place. They would drag this pilot to a black site. They would dissect the ship. They would start a war. And the pilot... this living, breathing, thinking creature... would never see the sky again.

Hiccup looked at the pilot's face again. He looked young. Or the alien equivalent of young. He looked scared.

""Oh, gods,"" Hiccup groaned, rubbing his face with his free hand. ""I am in so much trouble.""

He clipped the baton to his belt and opened the med-kit.

""Okay,"" he whispered to the unconscious alien, his hands trembling as he pulled out a bandage. ""Don't eat me, and I won't let the government dissect you. Deal? Great. Good talk.""

He knelt down in the wreckage, turning his back on the convoy lights, and began to work.",4,1770772477.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

I'm looking for one or two more players for a 10-20 session campaign of a highly creative PBTA hack called Absurdia by Quinn Majeski.

**What is Absurdia?**

The author's words sum it up the best.

""Inspired by works of absurd humor, surreal horror, and literary nonsense like Welcome to Night Vale, Alice in Wonderland, Gravity Falls, and the Twilight Zone, Absurdia is an opportunity to indulge in the surreal and outlandish while subverting the absurdity of modern society.""

In addition the basic game, I have created the town of Mauvesson, the City of Purple Flowers, for this campaign. That being said, the game is very heavy on collaborative roleplay and worldbuilding so there are plenty of chances for you as players to contribute to the world as well.

**Hook**  
From the churning chaos there comes A Stranger, the cafe goers whisper between sips of coffee. Heralded by a flicker of the light the Metal Man who lives in the city park says dashing into the bushes. In his wake The Green Veil will wither and die, the fairies sing with their tiny voices. The secrets of Mauvesson will be pried from the pursed lips of The Township Council as the dreaded Thespians dance through the chaos that will reign in the streets. Long dead Entropic beings will once again live only to bear immortal witness to the arrival of A Stranger in Mauvesson. That is what they say.

The game will be played over discord using a server bot for rolling dice and will be entirely, or almost entirely, theater of the mind. All I ask is you have a mic and a respectfully quiet environment. We will be playing next friday (20th) with a start time of 7pm EST and planning to run for 2-3 hours, with an absolute maximum playtime of 3.5 hours per session.

What are your favorite places for this?

	•	Cafés that won’t hate us for opening laptops 😄

	•	Coworking spaces with a nice atmosphere

	•	Quiet spots with reliable Wi-Fi (even hotel lobbies if that’s a thing)

Bonus points if it’s not insanely loud and has decent coffee/food.

1r1j9ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r1j9ad/update_aitah_for_always_going_to_the_movies_by/,UPDATE: AITAH for always going to the movies by myself despite having a girlfriend,"Hello Reddit. Not really sure if I'm doing updates right but I decided to post an update about my situation and what happened.

To give a short recap about my previous post, I (31 M) have a personal preference of going to the movies by myself. My gf(29) saw me walking out of a movie theatre with an female colleague from a previous job, who I met there by coincidence, and got upset at me and hasn't talked to me for about four days now.

It's been about a day since my post and my girlfriend finally responded to text. She apologized profusely about not responding to me right away and explained that she had to deal with some problems with her family that came up  and she only had the mental and emotional strength to deal with one issue at a time. I am aware that she does have some family drama right now(wont go into it here just for privacy and unrelated anyway) and I said I understood and that I wasn't really upset about that. We decided to meet up in person and talk things out.

I picked her up and we go to a coffee place near her home. After we sat down with our orders she immediately started to apologize for all the things she said that night and that after she had woke up the next day she had realized how ridiculous she had sounded.

Now a few of the comments on my post mentioned her insecurities and stuff like that so I wanted to touch up on that. I said that I accepted her apology but I also needed to know where her line of reasoning came from and what caused her to have an outburst like that.

She then confessed that about a year before she met me she had caught her now ex boyfriend cheating on her. She said that she went to surprise him with lunch one time and had caught him walking out their workplace with his arm around one of his female co-workers. So when she, once again, was waiting to surprise me at the movie theater and saw me walking out with another woman, she had severe flashbacks to that moment when she caught her ex and her anxiety flared up. 

It also didn't help that her best friend, who she usually asks advice from, apparently really doesn't like me. A few months after we had met, her friend apparently warned her that I was ""too quiet for a guy"" and that I gave a shady vibe. I apparently looked like the type of person who kept secrets and that she should be suspicious of me. Although she initially just brushed her off, this basically implanted a seed of doubt in her.

I guess she felt really guilty about the whole thing because she was in a real confessing kind of mood. I kind of just sat there in silence for a bit just because I really needed to process everything she was saying.

After a bit of thinking I finally brought up the topic of how we were gonna move forward. 

She said that she realized that what she did was really unreasonable but she didn't want to break up. I also said that, while I was hurt with what happened, I also didn't want to break up over what was essentially a really big misunderstanding. But I also told her, as politely as I can, that she really needs to maybe work on any other unresolved issues she might still feel about her ex, maybe even therapy if needed.

She said that while she would definitely do better and work on her insecurities, she didn't think it warranted therapy yet. I told her to think about it some more if possible and that I would support her in any way I can. After chatting a bit more (mostly about her nosy friend and how she should really mind her own business lol) we went home feeling much better.

Anyway Reddit that's about it. I know some commenters mentioned about how I should break up with her but I really think this is about as good an outcome as it gets. I also went ahead and invited her to watch a movie on Valentine's day. Although I'll still mostly continue to watch movies by myself, I'll maybe try to work on including Z from now on. Thanks for the people that gave advice. You guys gave me a lot to think about while I was waiting on her reply and I really appreciated it. Have good one!",5,1770772122.0,AITAH,3,0.86,False

Sorry readers. I tried to make it as short as I could. I did change a detail for anonymity ig?? from pizza to coffee because I thought that was such a stupid detail to change, might as well stick with the real story lolz.

My (21M) brother (23M) asked that I get him coffee and texted me his order. I read it verbatim to the cashier. I come back home to texts of cussing and insults etc. Absolutely dragging me. “You fucking bitch” and just straight insults to my intelligence. He hadn’t come home yet so this was all over texts. I texted how I read his text verbatim (pumps of vanilla and etc- no number(  and how the cashier put 3 — I thought it was premade type thing like that’s what this kinda drink comes with that number of pumps. Anyway. I defended myself but eventually stopped.

I might be the bad guy here - I did screenshot and send those texts to our siblings group chat. He texted me that he blocked me and that he can out me as an atheist (to my extremely religious family—-im a college student btw so im financially dependent, I do have a year left so this was terrifying for me naturally because I would without a shadow of a doubt be kicked out disowned and homeless). I didn’t reply. Surely he wouldn’t….the fact the he would use that knowledge over my head as a form of blackmail was appalling istg.

I screen shotted those texts (atheist part included) and sent them to the siblings group chat too. Cant threaten me if I already out myself first right. I can’t stand being made to buck to him just because of his ego. Stupid and reckless I know. Anyway. We r here now. He then texted me that I sent to the siblings chat but why not mom?? He texted me I’ll go ahead and let her know too. I genuinely went to my closet and had a panic attack. Cried for an hour straight I think.

Married 13 years and together 23 with two young boys. Early in our relationship my wife’s high school boyfriend asked her for coffee and it made me seriously uncomfortable. I told her at the time that if she wanted to maintain a relationship with this former intimate partner that I didn’t want to have a relationship with her.  Years passed. We got married and I thought this dude was in the past and staying there. 

In 2023 she took a new job in his office building. I wasn’t thrilled but didn’t say anything so as to be supportive.  2024 I noticed him walking in our neighborhood almost daily and even past our house one time when it looked like I was not at home(which is fucked up in and of itsel to be circling your high school ex’s home but I didn’t make a commitment with this dude). But then I started noticing my wife was following him around. Driving or biking in circles in an attempt to cross paths with him on his walks. Then I started noticing (by location shared) that she would drive circles, sometimes up to 4 times, circling their mutual workplace at times he would start or finish work. I also noticed her driving circles waaaaay out of the way around a school that they both volunteered at after driving past their mutual workplace and presumably not seeing his car there.   The most painful time was after a surgery, she was supposed to get lunch and pain meds for me but she had to drive circles in our neighborhood to try and see him on the way to helping me in my pain. It was just too bizarre and felt like a stalky obsession kind of thing.  This behavior went on for many months. I was struggling with reality and that this was somehow coincidental or not what I was seeing but eventually I had to come to terms that she was intentionally following or seeking him out in the weirdest of ways. This went on for 8 months. 

I confronted her for these actions and she was very contrite in the moment (after initially lying and gaslighting and saying it didn’t happen…until I showed enough evidence that it did happen). A couple days later she brought up the terms limerence and person addiction…two concepts I was not familiar with.  She said that before confronting her that she was looking into getting therapy for this (mind you she never did, just said she was looking into it. Maybe she was. Who knows?) A month after confronting her she wrote me a 6 page love letter extolling me for being a wonderful husband.  But she never truly apologized for her actions and what she had done.   I gave her time and space to get some therapy but over time she shifted the narrative and rewrote the entire history of our life.  She said our entire marriage was horrible and I was controlling and abusive. And by now she is saying that it was not limerence or person addiction but that she just wanted to see him. Currently she says the things she apologized for and sought therapy for never even happened. In October she filed for divorce and has continued this story that I was a horrible and abusive husband. 

I guess I just needed to share this with you. In some ways this probably seems much less bad than traditional cheating but in some ways it feels worse. It was ongoing and rooted in something that didn’t honor me or our marriage and did honor her past love. Now I’m gutted thinking about divorce…not to lose the spouse who would pull this but to lose 50% of my time with my sons. 

If anyone can commiserate or offer any support, I’m really feeling down and fucked up today and would be thankful for any input. ",8,1770771778.0,survivinginfidelity,11,1.0,False

I’m making this post in search of a cafe/restaurant I visited in Pittsburgh in the Fall of 2022. At that time, I was a DoorDasher and picked up a few orders there, and have wanted to go back since. I’ve tried googling, maps, yelp, etc., to no avail. 

Here’s what (I think) I remember:

\-It seemed to be mainly a coffee shop but also had breakfast food (not sure about lunch or dinner, but it didn’t seem like it)

\-The place was a house (a standalone, pretty sizable house, not one that is tightly sandwiched between other houses) that had been turned into a restaurant/cafe

\-I think there was a porch that you had to walk up on to enter

\-I think this house was on a corner of two streets, in a relatively residential area, not a main strip like Murray Avenue, for example

\-As I mentioned, it was available on DoorDash in the Fall of 2022

\-I am pretty sure this restaurant/cafe is in the general eastern reaches of the city, not across either river (I attended Chatham University at the time, so I mainly dashed in Shadyside, Oakland, Bloomfield, Penn Hills, Lawrenceville, Highland Park, Swissvale, Greenfield, and a little even further east like Forest Hills)

\-At one point I was pretty sure it was in Bloomfield, Shadyside, or Swissvale, but it is probably just my faulty memory making things up

\-For some reason, I associate the color red with this place, but that’s both not helpful and probably just my memory making more things up.

I know this is still pretty vague, but I have also compiled a list of places that it is NOT:

\-First, it’s not any place that isn’t a house, that part of my memory I am sure of

\-The Woods House

\-Biddle’s

\-Spigolo

\-Parisi

\-The Nook

\-Happenstance Cafe

I know this is pretty vague, especially for such a long-winded post, but any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.",3,1770771669.0,pittsburgh,15,1.0,False

But most of them fizzle out after a week or two because they’re either too rigid or lack that personal nudge. That’s why I wanted to share HabitBuilder.pro, an AI-powered habit coaching app that’s genuinely changed how I approach self-improvement.

What is HabitBuilder.pro?

At its core, it’s like having a smart, adaptive coach in your pocket. Powered by AI, it creates custom action plans tailored to your goals, lifestyle, and even your current motivation levels. No more generic “drink more water” advice; it digs into why you want the habit and builds a step-by-step path that evolves with you.

Key Features That Make It Stand Out:

•  Custom Action Plans: Tell the AI your habit (e.g., “I want to meditate daily”), and it generates a personalized roadmap. For me, it suggested starting with 5-minute sessions tied to my morning coffee routine, which made it stick way better than jumping straight to 20 minutes.

•  Guided Sessions: Interactive chats with the AI coach that feel like a conversation with a friend who’s also a productivity expert. It checks in, offers tips, and adjusts based on your progress or setbacks.

•  Streak Tracking and XP Leveling: Gamification done right! Earn XP for consistency, build streaks, and level up—it’s motivating without being gimmicky. I’ve got a 14-day streak on my fitness habit now, and seeing that progress bar fill up is oddly satisfying.

I know habits aren’t one-size-fits-all—life throws curveballs like busy workweeks or unexpected travel—so the app’s flexibility is a game-changer. It’s not just about tracking; it’s about understanding the psychology behind why habits fail (like decision fatigue or lack of rewards) and addressing them head-on. For instance, if you’re someone who struggles with procrastination, it might incorporate habit-stacking techniques or gentle reminders rooted in behavioral science.

If you’re skeptical about AI in self-help (I was too at first), think of it as a tool that learns from you, not a robot dictating your life. It’s web-based for now, accessible on any device, and privacy-focused—no creepy data selling. Can save it as an app.

1r1iykr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1iykr,Demo Update Coming Soon (22/05/2025),"Hi, everyone! It's Ryan, creator of Wicked Seed.  
  
In addition to working on new content for the game I have also been working on making a new update to the demo. I'll go over what all will be included, but the main new feature is the Despair difficulty mode.  
  
The current Normal and Hard difficulties are pretty similar. Hard will bump up the health and damage of enemies and make them a bit more aggressive. However Despair difficulty adds on top of that and is inspired by the Madhouse difficulty in RE7. Here's what you can expect from Despair difficulty:  
  


# Enemy and Item placement is different

From the very beginning it will become evident that things are different! Enemies are where they weren't before, you'll fight different enemies in different areas, and all item and key item placement has been changed.  
  


# New items

In addition to the placement of items being different, you will also come across items not found in Normal or Hard. An example is the Box of Scrap. When recycled it gives a modest amount of scrap, or it can be combined with a Chemical to make High Powered Ammo.  
  
Second is the Jar of Coffee. Rest areas on Despair difficulty do not have any servings of coffee, but a jar of coffee allows you to add a serving to a rest area of your choice.  
  


# High Powered Ammo adjustment

Enemies on Despair difficulty have much higher health, but to counter act this, high powered ammo gives a significantly larger damage and stagger damage boost than compared to Normal and Hard.  
Because of this increased emphasis on using high powered ammo, you'll need to make each shot count and strike enemies when it's most advantageous.  
  


# Exclusive rewards

There will be Despair difficulty exclusive challenges and rewards. In addition, costumes can be found throughout the game that can only be acquired when playing on Despair. The hidden knight statues are also in different places on Despair and will give a different costume if you manage to find them all.  
  
My goal with the Despair difficulty was to not only increase the challenge of the game, but to make subtle adjustments to the game's mechanics to give it a slightly different feel.  
  
Finally, Despair difficulty will be unlocked upon completing the demo on Normal or Hard after installing the upcoming update.  
  
\-------------  
  
I've also adjusted the enemy respawn system based on player feedback.  
  


# Before

* Enemy encounters would have a decreasing chance to spawn based on the number of times the encounter has been cleared. This check would trigger when loading into the area or loading a saved game
* Enemy encounters could be forcefully reset when picking up certain key items, viewing certain events, or entering certain areas
* Taking a break at a rest area would respawn enemies for that area **only**



# After

* After clearing an encounter it will never respawn until taking a break at a rest area
* Sometimes new encounters will appear based on progression Example: Previously Seaside Six encounters would respawn when obtaining the Cabin #4 Key and the Wyatt Park Key. This has been changed to only activate one encounter in each case and these encounters are now new with different enemy configurations. This also allows you to obtain the ""first time clear"" bonus of these new encounters instead of the reduced rewards from being forced to clear encounters you already beat.
* Some encounters will not respawn when taking a break. These are most notably mini boss encounters (such as the Kraken's Arm or Great White Pterashark)
* When taking a break at any rest area, enemies in **all** areas will respawn

\-------------

# New combat mechanic: Flanking

The combat system now detects whether you are hitting an enemy in the front, on the sides, or from behind. Each enemy has a damage multiplier on each flank, but typically most enemies take increased damage from the sides and even more so from behind.  
  
In addition, some enemies have destructible flanks which, when destroyed, triggers a variety of different effects. This could be inflicting a large amount of additional damage or preventing the enemy from performing certain attacks.  
  
When you hit an enemy on a flank that provides a damage bonus, an icon will appear behind the damage number letting you know you are striking a vulnerable spot.  
  
Proper introduction and more information on the mechanic will be shown in a tutorial pop-up in game.  
  
\-------------

# New costumes

With the addition of Despair difficulty, I felt it only right to add in some more costumes to reward those who complete it! Two costumes can be found through exploration and the other when completing the demo on Despair difficulty.  
  
(Observant readers may recognize the pose of the hidden costume. I wonder what it was inspired by?)

\-------------

# Other upcoming adjustments

I've made other adjustments as well. Here they are in no particular order:  


* Flashlight now aligns with where you're looking and not where Ella is facing
* Added more discoverable named locations when exploring giving a bit more context on where you are and also additional exp for those who like to explore
* Critical damage bonus has been reduced from 50% to 30%, but now ignores the enemy's defense. This should make crits feel about the same on ""normal"" enemies, but feel a lot better on higher defense enemies like the Clinger.
* Fixed some shader issues on Ella's skin related to certain lighting conditions, and when in different damage states
* Fixed a variety of bugs.

  
\-------------  
  
Wow! That ended up being longer than I planned for, but I guess I had more to cover than I thought.  
  
Last note: The new demo build is currently being tested and I am hopeful to have it released within the next few days.  
  
To anyone who made it this far, thanks for reading! And thanks to all who have provided feedback and reviews to help me make the game better.  
  
I'll post again early June with some other, not demo related, things I've been working on and what's coming next.

Here is my problem: they have the only French roast I can find that’s truly dark (almost black) and oily the way French roasts are supposed to be. I’ve ordered like 3 different brands online, including Intelligentsia products (which I desperately wanted to like) like their French roast and two different espresso roasts.  But every “dark” roast I order is russet colored (not dark at all) and very sour and acidic tasting to me. My husband thinks I need to open my mind, but what tastes good tastes good and what tastes bad tastes bad. How do I even control that? 

Before the connoisseurs out there try to tell me the 2000 reasons medium roast coffee is better, please know I understand that my tastes are, perhaps, unrefined. But dark French roast tastes rich to me and medium and light roasts taste sour (for lack of a better word) and smell objectionable.

I had just had a pretty acute spiritual experience. I needed to process it, but I needed to talk through it with some folks. Fortunately, those who responded favorably to my post did not take advantage of me, nor I them. While the experience may not have been all that everyone involved had hoped, I have learned from it.

There was a minor misunderstanding with someone, but together, we proved something that I held to be an important tenet: That any two good, open, honest hearts, communicating for long enough, will understand each other, no matter the barriers of experience, temperament, trauma, doubt. We now hold each other blameless for this misunderstanding, though I think he feels guilty. I tell him that he didn't do anything wrong. He never lashed out. He chose. He applied self-knowledge, and acted with intentionality. I hold him blameless. I love that guy.

The acute spiritual experience that I had was one that was about faith, but it was far beyond just some vague notion about faith in general. To provide understanding of what I mean by this, I will have to tell my story, my journey in faith, and hope that you understand it.

I will do that here. I think that, last time, because I needed to tell my story interactively (and still haven't quite had the chance!), and was therefore trying to draw people to Discord or somewhere, that looked a lot like an attempt to isolate people from a larger community. That was probably the cultiest part of it.

Mea culpa. When I want to know people, I like to sit with them, here on the step, with coffee and weed. I have trouble dealing with large groups of people, especially because, being a bizarre kind of autistic and ADHD, my communication is sometimes ambiguous. People have fucking \*crucified\* me (rimshot?) for their misunderstandings, throughout my life, so I sought out something intimate, where I could be free to open my heart as much as possible. I was a little inspired by ""The OA,"" not gonna lie! I miss that show.

Anyway.

This whole process is part of something that is critically important, particularly in these times. I don't think anyone who has understanding and awareness can deny that, to crib from Deftones, \[I think\] God is moving its tongue.

I have to split this up, for the sake of the medium. Please bear with me, my faults, my ambiguous communication, my past, my follies, and so on.",2,1770770610.0,christianwitch,0,1.0,False

Wondering opinions on these two, especially since now the CT4-V Blackwing will be gone after 2026 I'm starting to get FOMO lol.  I was thinking maybe I'd look into one late 2027, but now may have to go for it sooner.  There aren't any local ones to look at, so I won't know what it's like to drive or the interior impressions until I can see one in person.

I currently have a 2023 G70 3.3 AWD with Eibach springs and sway bars, whiteline end links, EBC Yellow brake pads, AFE Takeda cold air intakes, and PS4S tires.  It sounds like a lot, but that really only comes out to about $60k with everything included.  I absolutely love this car though, I've taken it to Tail of the Dragon multiple times, rip it around mountain roads, and it definitely holds it's own and is an underrated car in my opinion.  The interior is nicer than people expect when they get in the car, sound system is really good, every electronic feature is included and works great, super comfortable on long rides, the adjustable suspension is effective (I doubt as effective as magnaride of course), etc.  I also have it in Tuscan Blue which is actually a really dark green and I just don't see that color anywhere else.

The main issue is that I really don't drive very much.  I basically work at a coffee place 2 miles from my house, where I live in central FL it's full of boring roads, etc., and the reason I bring that up is that the two car solution really doesn't work for me.  I've been fixing up a Fiat Abarth for a family member that has a manual and at first I was loving driving a manual again and thought I'd be in that car all the time, and then it ended up sitting for almost 8 months barely being used when I got busy with work.  So really the one car solution is what works for me, and also when I go to North Carolina a few times a year I don't want to be driving a 'second fun car' for 9 hours there and 9 hours back, I'd rather have a car that's comfortable for the drive and then I can switch it into performance mode and go crazy.

The CT4-V Blackwing checks a lot of those boxes, but outside of the manual and extra horsepower, I'm not sure how much 'better' it really would be over my modified G70.  I'm definitely curious how the green looks on the blackwing, because I feel like it would be a really nice combo with the bronze wheels.  I've been considering getting an aftermarket set of bronze wheels for the G70 already too.  I'm wondering how the interiors compare too.  The center screen on the Blackwing is basically the last gen G70 screen, the new one is a lot nicer.  I'm hoping the AKG sound system will be comparable to the Lexicon sound system in the G70, and so on.  

I'll definitely be getting the performance seats, climate package, electronics package on the Blackwing, so if I got it new it would be around 75k.  Not sure about the sunroof yet, but I don't need the carbon packages especially for $12k.",1,1770770513.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,3,1.0,False

I came here to seek advice from other people who might have had a similar experience as to what I'm going through, I'm not sure if this will get anywhere but, here's to hoping!

My whole life I've always felt like I was out of place with other girls, especially when it came to boys. I thought if I just attached myself to any one I came across I would be like other girls. So I did exactly that, I would 'crush' on boys for a while but when they were mean or just not interested, I would move on and have no remorse really.

I didn't have a real boyfriend until I was 15 and I thought I was in love and head over heels when in reality he was extremely toxic and manipulative. And I had a girlfriend prior but we had some complications that came up and I was much younger so I didn't really understand the ins and outs of relationships yet.

Everytime I had been with a guy I had always felt that something was missing, I was never fully satisfied and I always ended up in the same position seemingly. I thought maybe it just had to do with me being with the wrong person because I've always been openly pansexual, but I did go through a phase where I did originally think I was a lesbian but everyone kinda talked me out of it because I was young and naive.

I also have a very frayed relationship with my father and I fear I might just like men because I like the attention I never got before, if that makes any sense.

I've been thinking a lot recently about this stuff and I just get so emotional when I think of a life with a woman, how soft and gentle it would be, how full of life and wonder and the conversations of stupid things we could have everyday. Having pets together and sharing coffees on cold mornings.

I know I could have that life with a man as well but when I think about it with one, it just seems different, less colorful..

As I’ve reached out to my clinic and was expecting a call and lo and behold no call. So I fired off a message just to be left on read. So I guess my question here is what are some at home ways to help relieve pain of gastritis. I’m a little new to this and the Dr gave me no instructions on what needs to be done. And I don’t always trust the websites nor Google. If anyone can be of help I would be forever grateful as I’ve also dropped 7 Ilbs in 4 days. ",1,1770770098.0,Gastritis,4,0.67,False
1r1ih7s,https://i.redd.it/crsjad62arig1.jpeg,Help Save the Mobility Transport Program,"Have you seen those white golf carts around campus and wondered who they belong to? Those are the Mobility Transport Program golf carts! Our fleet consists of 4 golf carts, 1 wheelchair cart, and 1 wheelchair accessible van to transport students with temporary and permanent mobility limitations around campus and the surrounding Isla Vista area. 

Many students would have to withdraw from classes or quarters altogether without access to this transportation service. The program was originally funded as a pilot program with a grant but with the money set to run out by the summer, we are seeking permanent funding through student fees. The fee would only be $3.50 a quarter (less than a Starbucks coffee) and would allow us to keep providing these rides at no additional cost to students. 

I have been a driver for about 2.5 years and have seen the program's demand significantly increase in the past year alone. Getting to hear all of the riders' stories shines a light on the impact this service has on students. Having a secure ride to class takes a lot of stress off of students who are in classes with mandatory attendance and in-person exams.

Wondering if there is a coffee machine where you can just store the preground coffee into it and it will auto disperse it when you need it to; no coffee filter paper required. and you only have to refill the water and dispose the old coffee ground. 

  
I dont want to spend a thousand dollars on some of those fancier machines. Just wondering if there is one out there that can do the above to skip a few steps in my morning routine. I dont want to have to always use coffee filter paper, so something that doesn't require that. would like it if i can just put the coffee pregrounded into the machine and it auto disperses it with a push of a button rather than me having to manually place it in the filter.

I’m looking for some advice from folks who’ve been in the industry or have navigated this before.

How do you find and connect with like-minded filmmakers—locally or abroad—who care deeply about storytelling and not just budgets?

A bit of context: I run a brand rooted in the coffee industry and its community. Over time it’s grown into something with a more global reach, and I’ve come to believe that a brand can be more than a vehicle for sales—it can be a platform for influence and meaningful storytelling.

There are so many powerful, human stories behind the scenes in the coffee world—farmers, roasters, baristas, communities—that often go unseen or underappreciated. I want to help tell those stories. I’ve always loved projects like Great Big Story and short-form mini documentaries that spotlight real people and cultures with care.

I’ve reached out to a few production companies, but the conversations tend to start and end with big budgets (“$300k and then we’ll talk”). I get that filmmaking costs money—but I’m not looking for a purely transactional relationship. I’m hoping to collaborate with filmmakers who value the craft and purpose of storytelling first, and want to build something meaningful together.

If you’ve been in a similar position—or know where passionate, documentary-minded filmmakers tend to gather—I’d really appreciate any insight. Platforms, communities, collectives, personal approaches… all advice welcome.

1r1i797,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEx/comments/1r1i797/i_almost_died_she_didnt_care/,I almost died & she didn’t care.,"I (35M) am visually impaired. I met my ex (37F, who we will call V) at a program for the blind in late April. V is fully blind—can’t see at all—and she has other health issues and is on dialysis.

After the program, our bond grew very quickly and very strong. Soon after, she invited me over to teach me how to cook spaghetti. On that day, I was really amazed by her—the way she carried herself despite being blind. Shortly after, we decided to give being together a try.

Month 1 went by great. We’d work out together, she’d bring me water, boiled eggs, bring me lunch. She motivated me to workout. Almost a month after we got together, I had issues in my family. I left and went to spend a few days with her. I realized I felt more at home, more comfortable, more at peace with her than with my family, so I took a leap of faith and moved in with her after she told me it would be ok and after checking if it would be ok with her daughter (14) as well.

The first month living together went well. We continued to work out, we practiced Braille together.

The trouble started in July. I had been home checking over my finances and realized that I was overspending. That day, when she came home from dialysis, I helped her in and mentioned to her, “Hey, I noticed I’ve been overspending. We need to cut back on things a bit.” My concern was dismissed. She responded, “That’s why I have my food stamps.”

In August, I realized I was still spending too much and I brought it up again, only to have my concern ignored again. This made me upset because the woman I’m supposed to share my concerns with isn’t caring. So 2-3 days go by. We are in a restaurant waiting for her Vision Resource Teacher (a teacher who helps us learn skills to be independent and more). We get there about half an hour early, so V’s caretaker, her, and I—we go in and get a table. After some time of her complaining that her VRT is not there yet, the VRT shows up and they do their lesson.

Eventually, V’s caretaker and I get bored and we go out to her car. After a short period, V comes out and we start heading home. Then V wants Chipotle. I tell her no—let’s not spend money, we have food at home. V says no. So I ask, “Ok, who is paying for it? Cause I’m not!” V says she is. So we go, they place their order, we get a table. I go use the bathroom, come back, and sit there in silence while they eat.

After they eat, she starts hugging me and asks if I’m upset with her. I didn’t say anything. After that, we are back home laying in bed and she starts crying and says, “Just say you don’t want to be my friend anymore.” So I ask, “Why you say that?” She responds, “Because you’re always mad at me!” So I told her no, I’m not always mad at her—I just have a concern about overspending and you’re not taking it seriously! So she responds with, “You’re in the real world. Things in the real world cost money. You’re not going to be able to save right away—that takes time.” So I say, “Ya, but you also have to know how to budget too.”

After that talk, I get up and I go use the bathroom, and I hear her texting her sister asking for money. So I ask, “Why are you doing that? You’re making me look bad…” cause her sister knows what I’ve done for her up to that point. I refurbished her bedroom, I bought her a $400 mattress, etc.

After that, we go out and then I take a short nap because I had work that evening.

The next morning we’re getting ready to eat breakfast and I hear her sister’s voice: “So how is my favorite brother-in-law? Is he feeling better or still being crabby?” The same time this was going on, my grandmother passed away. That next weekend (holiday weekend), I missed my grandmother’s funeral—I didn’t afford the flight. I missed a day of work due to grieving.

That Sunday, I confronted her. I asked, “Why did you call me crabby?” She responded with, “Because you were being crabby! Like, I don’t get the problem—you’re supporting your family! You should be happy you’re supporting your family.” The next day, I had a customer with a bad attitude and they reported me, resulting in me getting a written warning.

The next incident happened maybe 2-3 weeks after. I had sent her sister a video of how bad of a state the apartment we lived in was, and I told her what was bothering me, hoping she’d give me some advice on how to approach it with V. Her sister said, “I’m sorry, I know this is how she is—she won’t listen to me.” We agreed to keep the conversation private, but then her sister ended up telling her to talk to me, which resulted in V yelling at me to tell her what the problem is.

I was working at the time (I work customer service remotely), so I told her calmly, “I need to focus on work—let’s talk after.” She says no, “Let’s talk now,” and continues to yell at me to tell her the problem. I don’t engage because 1) I have work, and 2) her daughter is home and I don’t want to argue in front of her. So V is yelling about how I went behind her back. Then at one point she spins my chair around, pins my arms to the chair, and gets in my face continuing to yell at me to tell her the problem, and I FROZE!

Eventually she lets go and then she asks, “Do you have a mental problem you didn’t tell me about?” Then she’s sitting at the table, she calls her sister, they talk about what was said, and then she tells me, “You can leave. It won’t bother me if you do.”

Later that evening, her daughter goes in the bathroom. I’m in the living room working and she is in the bedroom, and she starts crying. Later that evening, I finish work and I’m just staring at my desk thinking about how I feel bad cause I know she cried because of me. At that moment, she comes out of the room and she says, “Papa (she liked calling me that—idk why but whatever made her happy), are you finished working?” I respond yes, and she comes and hugs and kisses me like normal, and everything I was feeling melted away and I just let it go.

The next day, I took her out for breakfast and we went to Goodwill and bought a crockpot. The next month went by—no issues other than her constantly mocking my family’s accent, mocking the way I talk and where I’m from and such.

November comes, and this is where things get really crazy. There was an issue with my family and my dad stopped talking to me even though I wasn’t involved. But that same day, I took over the lease for her apartment. The next day, I had planned on taking her and her daughter out shopping. That morning, she gets a call that her friend (we will call F) got drunk and needed a place to stay, and V told him, “Ya, you can come.” Then she tells me F got drunk and needs a place to stay—he’ll be staying with us.

So the day goes on. We are out shopping and the whole day she’s blowing up his phone, so I hear: “Siri, call F. Siri, text F.” We are in Five Below and she tried calling him again, and I get irritated and I tell her to stop that. Then I walk away to calm my head. While walking around Five Below, I saw a foot massager and, knowing her feet hurt, I picked it up for her. I return to her and her daughter looking at shirts.

The next day, she has me call F an Uber. I even buy an air mattress for him to use. The next day, she tells me, “I don’t trust F around my daughter,” and “A woman shouldn’t be alone with a man she’s not having sex with.” So I tell her, “Listen, if you don’t trust him around your daughter, he should not be here!” She also told me how in the past he stole from her, he hit her. I tried talking to her about how he should be with his family, not with us—that she has her health and her daughter to worry about.

The next weekend, before I started work, V asks, “Can you go get your bed from your dad’s house so F can use it?” I said no.

Later on, I was drinking and they were smoking weed (I smoked with them a bit too—not proud of it), and I confronted them asking what’s going on. So she says, “F wants to stay longer,” and I say, “I don’t know about this!” She then says, “F, if we both have to sign off on this, would you have anywhere else to go?” F says, “Ya, my mom will let me stay.” So we go back and forth and she says, “Let him stay until the end of the month.” I reluctantly agree.

That same weekend, we order groceries. Due to the government shutdown and delayed food stamps, her family sent me $400 for groceries. So I tell V, “Hey, we need to budget this because we have the whole month and a big food holiday coming up.” So Monday comes—she’s taking chicken for a soup, she asks me to help her find the rest, and she says, “That’s not enough! When I tell you to buy chicken, you buy it! I don’t even know why you care—it’s not your money, it’s my family’s.”

I walk away. Then after, I help her get ready for dialysis. After she leaves, I’m in the room upset, thinking, “That’s it, I need to leave.” I text her saying, “You keep doing all these hurtful things to me, meanwhile I’m stressing myself out trying to find a better job so that I can better provide for you and your daughter. I’m going to reverse the lease transfer and get my own unit in the apartment complex.”

She responds with, “Ya, you can reverse the transfer, but you’ll have to pay the deposit.”

I call up my previous gf in New York, tell her the situation. She lends me money to get my own place. I grab the lease, run to the main office, and the manager was not there. I was told to go the next day. So I go back to the apartment and I start work. She gets home from dialysis 2 hours later, grabs Leo (black cat, 7-month-old male kitten), drops him in my lap saying, “Don’t forget this when you leave.”

Next morning, I wake up. She hands me coffee and asks if I’m still leaving. I respond yes, because you keep doing things that hurt my feelings. So she says, “Ok, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings!” So I let it go. The next day, we are eating dinner and she goes, “I want F to stay and be my bodyguard.” In my mind, I was like, “Then wtf are you doing with me then?!” But I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to argue in front of her child.

2 days later, her daughter wants a snack. V and F go to CVS up the street. 1 hour later, V calls and says, “Hey, the line is really long.” They come back another hour later and she says, “I was showing F where I raised my daughter.”

The next day was a Saturday. I worked, I had a couple beers, and then F drives us to a weed dispenser. I got gummies. I thought V would’ve told me how much to take. She told me, “Take half,” and then after an hour, nothing happened, so she told me, “Take the other half.” I went to bed that night—blacked out before my head hit the pillow—and woke up in the hospital 4 days later.

V was not there. My dad, stepmother, and stepsister were there. Because I missed 2 days of work, my job was calling my phone. She or F told my job I was unconscious. They called my dad, who is my emergency contact. They had to go to the apartment, call 911 because she didn’t, and that’s how I got to the hospital.

The day I got released I cashed her she told me what happened when I was unconscious “I was waking you up for work and you never woke up. Caretaker came by saw you and told me to take you to the hospital” “F got drunk again I kicked him out” I went and got my stuff the next day and I’ve been back at my dads for more than 2 months now.

I did so much:

	∙	Helped her get ready for dialysis

	∙	Helped her when she came home

	∙	Got her a new bedroom set with a $400 mattress

	∙	Went to all her doctors’ appointments when I didn’t have to work

	∙	Took care of her daughter

	∙	Protected her daughter—as a matter of fact, she wanted me to hit her daughter and I said no! Her daughter overheard that, started crying because V hit her in the past, and I gave her a hug and promised her I would protect her.

I gave that woman my all, and when I needed her most, she wasn’t there for me.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Magitech, orbnet communication,  and wands and staves make casting easier for the average spellcaster with lower and lower risk of calamity or personal harm.  However, Thaumaturgy has its humble origins traced back to multiple ancient cultures across the globe. Records of these civilizations describe the binding of spirits via sacrifice, pacts, and sacred names. Archeological records indicate that human population numbers were exploding after the discovery of thaumaturgy.  Many wrote down how to contact these spirits in the very first  Grimoirs ever recorded.  The Book of Enoch actually provides a great insight into how these ancient spirits perceived humans.  
  
“1 And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. 2 And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ""Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.""  
  
\- the Book of Enoch  
  
The sun shewn high the divine light of the heavens, which illuminated the wickedness in the hearts of all creation. Live sacrifices from Greedy men hungry for power fed the fallen children of the heavens.  These sacrifices were not always willing.. And this pleased some wicked spirits even more than others. However, those who made these sacrifices were often greatly rewarded while the sacrificed rarely had any say in their fate afterward... The goodness of men seemed to have died out as the lust for power and wealth outgrew the love of their neighbor. Frivolous wars raged on, only to be interrupted by erratic weather. One could call this the inspiration for modern day evocation.    
  
The weather here was erratic. There were no seas and oceans. The world was akin to a misty garden under constant dew and mud. A swamp of sorts. Colossal  Mountains and plateaus mark this era in particular.   
  
 (Genesis 6:14): ""Make thee an ark of gopherwood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch"" (KJV).

  
All this was but an excerpt of Yarla’s masters thesis. The stack of papers reeked of Monster stamina potions.  Professor Wimbledor, held it in his hands with disgust, and utter skepticism having read it in its entirety.  
  


“Every Culture has a Great flood story, every culture has demons and fallen angels one could deduce demons were everywhere until a great global flood event wiped them out.” Yarla explained for the 15th time to her Professor…  
  
Professor Wimbledor furrowed his elderly brow. Never in all of his tenure had any student written a thesis that seemed ike such bullshit.  He adjusted his red ceremonial hat uncomfortably. The empty lecture hall was a relief. Even still, trying to tell a student they’re gonna fail this class felt embarrassing. This thesis read like a conspiracy theory, the kind  that posits the earth is flat and the Gods tell us its round to mess with us.    
  
“Surely there's more proof,  you know I can't accept this in its current state.” The professor sighed in sheer disappointment.   
  


  
Yarla was right where she began the conversation again.  Professor Wimbledor hadn't even \*looked\* at the bibliography. This would be the 16th repetition of her explanation of her sources and her theory.  This theory was grounded in geological record,  cross-referenced with at least 30 religions and their telling of the great flood event.  To the university’s knowledge, there were at least 405 separate religions that mention the great flood and life before it.  Perhaps her thesis was missing something.  If it was artifacts,  Yarla already analyzed 24 in this thesis already from various arcane corners of academia. Mayhaps its the fact that there's no archeological record of this civilization that many other civilizations point to in their stories. Except… Yarla remembered the latest issue of popular demonics.  Her frustration briefly gave way to a smile.   
  
“I think I know where I could get more proof. I just need a boat.”  The student suggested.   
  
This made her professor burst into laughter. The hell would a masters student with a thesis due in a month do with a boat?  Furthermore, it wasn't like she was the best student, Yarla was in fact just barely passing so far.  Handing in a thesis with no proof of such a missing civilization would destroy any chance of her passing this class.  What proof she did have only existed in extreme coincidence.     
  
“I mean, you could try, but I don't think that the university council will approve.” Wimbledor wheezed.  
  
""What do you mean the council won't approve? I can't complete my thesis without this trip!"" The student sighed in frustration. ""the incident on Pyramid island is all over Popular Demonics! I dare say, it's possible that Pyramid island could be the perfect location to investigate based on geological record and existing religious accounts.""  
  
Yarla pulled up images from the article to show The professor and explain the similarities in linguistic design to one of  the oldest known languages to all of our arcane world written on the wall. The wizard with a PHD, wearing red, furrowed his brow.  The thought of a possible lost civilization that served as a cradle for all civilization being there seemed preposterous. Archeological records certainly did not display a timeline where civilization started on a chain of islands populated by Goblins.  If anything, the latest archeological record placed it much farther south.  Alas, here was his masters student, seeking to prove that there was an older civilization with its remnants sitting intact, right under our noses. 



""Miss Yarla,  I'm afraid you would get laughed out of ANY scholarly institution foe requesting funding based on some... conspiracy theory."" The wizard in red began.



""The IRIN, the NEKOTEPH, the MAYANS , the Ithis, THE ACIREMANS, THE DEELUT, THE FENRI, EVEN THE THRELL...almost every ancient human civilization has a variant of the great flood story.  Each account speaks of boats being built to survive that apocalyptic flood."" Yarla argued, producing a packet of evidence listing each culture with a flood story, their similarities in EACH story. ""not to mention, the geological record telling us there weren't seas as we knew them at some point during sapient civilization.  It would be academically irresponsible to refuse to at least send SOMEONE for a cursory dig Professor Wimbledor.""



""You're making a fool of yourself. If you're wrong, this could end any chance of graduation you have, given how far in the course we are as a class."" Professor Wimbledor warned with an expression that screamed the need for more coffee. 

""as it stands, your thesis will likely fail without more proof.""



""if the council approves my dig and a boat to get me to the dig, then i can get more proof!"" The agitated student groaned as she placed her orb on the professor's orb stand. ""ALL the books Ive cited, ALL the orb-sites and articles,  all listed and they point to something older than the Irraluns of the continent of the former cat-folk empire. Yet there's no study out there, no other artifacts, and no other reports that mention it directly.  It's only a few Thousand EON notes. I already have dig tools. Just LET THE COUNCIL SEE MY FUNDS APPROPRIATION PROPOSAL!""  
  
The professor's hands were on his hips at this point. He had done all he could to try and talk his least promising student out of this ridiculous idea that would likely get her killed.  Wimbledor read the popular demonic article she cited this morning.  The contents weren't pretty.   The determined expression on Yarla's face did nothing to sway his opinion of just how stupid this idea was.  However, his obligation as professor was to relay this funds appropriation request to the university council. 

""Are you sure the hieroglyphs in the images there are part of a story that mentions this global flood? Popular Demonics is just a tabloid publication after all. "" The wizard in red confirmed one last time.

""Of course, I just need to go to that island and translate it, and see if I can bring back artifacts for mana-dating!"" the student explained with the exasperation that comes with your teacher asking the same questions over and over again.  
  
 ""Very well...but the council is still not paying for the trip."" Professor Wimbledor sighed in the same exasperation that comes with one of your stubborn students not catching the hints you are dropping all morning.  
  
With that done, Yarla left the lecture hall in fury. Now was the time to pack. And hire a fishing boat or something. she had a thesis to prove.",7,1770769297.0,wizardposting,3,0.9,False

1r1i4xy,https://i.redd.it/vrr87jjudrig1.png,Insulation,"“They say the guy who owned this place before me was insane,” Rich said, smirking as he set a box down.

“Who says that,” Tony asked. He did not bother hiding his skepticism.

“The realtor.”

Tony grunted. He was not in the mood for stories. He had agreed to help Rich move in, but after hours of hauling dusty boxes and wrestling couches around corners too tight, his patience was gone.

“Nice place though,” Rich continued, unfazed. “I got a really good deal on it.” There was an edge of excitement in his voice.

“Shame about the view,” Tony said flatly.

Birch Street had once been one of the most desirable areas in Glen Haven, prized for the privacy offered by the surrounding woods. That had changed two years earlier, when a wildfire tore through the forest east of the neighborhood, reducing nearly two hundred acres of trees to ash.

The loss cut deep. The woods were more than scenery to the town. They were history. That stretch of land in particular had been fiercely protected. Residents had fought developers for years, through lawsuits and appeals, through planning boards and city council meetings. Ownership of the development company changed hands so often no one could keep track. Each new proposal was rejected. Each objection upheld.

Until there was nothing left to protect.

With the trees gone, resistance lost its teeth.

Tony and Rich stood at the large side window, looking out over what had once been a quiet natural vista. Now it was a sprawling expanse of concrete and exposed earth. Foundations scarred the ground. Chain link fences and warning signs in every site line. Trucks and heavy equipment sat idle in no particular order. Utility lines lay open and waiting.

Only one house stood complete.

It sat alone in the center of the construction zone, pristine and finished, surrounded by the gray ugliness of progress.  

“Why build just one house,” Tony asked.

“They call that one the Dollhouse,” Rich said. “It’s been there since the eighties, I think. It burned down in the fire, but they rebuilt it. Supposedly it’s so people can see what the developers plan to put here.”

Tony shook his head. “No wonder the last guy sold this place.”

“He didn’t sell it,” Rich said.

Tony looked at him.

“He died.”

Tony left around six that evening, he worked at a hardware store and had to be at work early Monday morning to restock. Rich had every intention of organizing and unpacking, but after dragging his mattress into place and fitting the sheets with aching arms, his resolve faded. He balanced his television on an unopened moving box at the foot of the bed, the cardboard bowing slightly under the weight, and let a movie play more for background than interest. Somewhere around the halfway point he became aware of how still the house was. Not quiet in the way an empty room is quiet, but padded, softened. The warmth held steady, gentle and even, and the silence pressed in just enough to feel intentional. His eyes grew heavy. He did not fight it.

Rich woke the next morning disoriented. His first night in the house may have been the best rest he had ever had. No traffic. No pipes knocking. No distant hums or night sounds creeping in at the edges. The room was perfectly cozy and perfectly silent, the kind of silence that felt protective. Then he noticed the time. His stomach dropped. Moving in on a Sunday had been a mistake after all. He threw on clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed out the front door.

The moment it shut behind him, his phone came alive in his hand. Buzz after buzz after buzz. Missed calls. Text messages stacked one on top of another. He stopped on the porch, staring down at the screen, confused. Service could be spotty in Glen Haven, sure, but it had never vanished completely. He scrolled through the notifications, all time stamped hours earlier. He glanced back at the house, its windows dark and unreadable.

Strange, he thought.

That night Rich returned home from work under a sky already heavy with early winter. The day had been the first truly bitter one of the season, the kind that burned the lungs and stiffened fingers. Somewhere between hauling boxes, signing paperwork, and the long drive home the night before, it occurred to him that he had never checked the furnace. The thought followed him up the front steps like a bad feeling he could not shake.

He turned the key and opened the door.

Warm air rushed out to meet him, thick and suffocating, as if he had opened an oven instead of his house. It wrapped around his face and chest, stealing his breath for a moment.

“Jesus Christ,” Rich muttered.

His first thought was the gas bill. The kind of heat he was feeling was expensive, reckless even. He dropped his bag and hurried to the thermostat. The display read seventy five degrees. The set temperature below it read sixty eight.

Rich frowned.

“Doesn’t that mean it shuts off once it hits sixty eight,” he said to no one.

*Yes.*

He leaned closer, listening. There was no hum. No click. No familiar churn of a furnace cycling on and off. In fact there was nothing at all. No background noise. No distant rattle of pipes or air moving through vents. Just heat. Heavy, unmoving heat.

He walked into the mudroom that connected the living room to the garage, the small space doubling as a utility room. Washer. Dryer. Furnace. He opened the furnace panel and stared.

The switch was set to off.

There was no heat pumping into the house.

It was just hot.

This was strange, but not really a problem. He told himself, already tallying the money he would save without a gas bill.

Rich glanced down at his phone. Zero bars.

With nothing else to distract him, he spent the rest of Monday unpacking. Furniture shifted, then shifted back again. Cupboards filled with plates and food. The hollow shell of the house slowly softened into something that felt livable.

He set a glass fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. When he turned away, his elbow caught it. The bowl hit the floor and shattered.

The sound died too quickly.

Not faded. Not echoed. It was cut short, like a gunshot fired underwater.

Rich straightened and stared at the shards scattered across the tile. He wasn’t annoyed. He was intrigued.

He lifted a box onto the counter and reached inside, pulling out a coffee mug at random. A gift from his mother.

“Definitely not that one,” he muttered, setting it aside.

He grabbed another cup, old and stained, the kind he would shove to the back of the cupboard and forget about. Closing his eyes, he turned his head away and dropped it.

The crash was loud, violent. And then silence flooded the room before the pieces had finished falling.

It wasn’t quiet. It was smothered.

“Hello,” Rich called out.

His voice vanished the moment it left him.

He laughed, uncertain.

“Helloooooooo,” he tried, stretching the word, pushing it outward. But again the sound was swallowed whole, as if a pillow had been pressed over his mouth before the last syllable could form.

Rich chuckled.

“Weird,” he said to himself.

*Yes.*

Rich grabbed a dustpan and broom and swept the glass into a plastic bag. He carried it outside and tossed it into the trash. As he turned back toward the house, his eyes caught on the shed at the edge of the property. It looked solid. Well kept. And he realized he had not looked inside it once since moving in.

“Might as well,” he said.

As he crossed the yard, his phone buzzed to life again. Two missed calls from Tony and a single text.

‘What was the name of the previous owner again?’

Rich slipped the phone back into his pocket. It was too cold to stand around texting.

He reached the shed with a small surge of excitement.

“Please God, a snowblower,” he said out loud.

Michigan winters were unforgiving. The snow had not started yet, but it never waited long.

He pulled the door open.

The shed was packed solid.

From floor to ceiling, wall to wall, every inch was filled with insulation. Fiberglass batts still wrapped in plastic. Stacked rolls of mineral wool, dense and gray. Rigid foam boards cut to precise sizes, some labeled, some not. Buckets of blown cellulose. Cans of expanding spray foam, dozens of them, arranged neatly like ammunition. Sheets of reflective barrier folded and stacked, their metallic surfaces dull with dust.

There was no room to step inside. Not even a foot.

It was not messy. It was deliberate.

Rich stood there, confused at first, then thoughtful. Maybe the realtor had been wrong. Maybe the previous owner was not insane at all. Maybe he had simply been thorough. Brilliant, even. The house was sealed tighter than anything Rich had ever stepped foot in. Winter felt like summer already.

The thought made him pause.

The house did not have air conditioning. If winter felt like summer, how would summer feel.

Rich closed the shed door and headed back inside. He made himself a sandwich and sat at the small dining table, enjoying the warmth, the stillness.

*Lou.*

Rich looked up.

He thought he heard something but he couldn’t have. If noise was a living being it feared this place, sounds were a thing of the past, he thought to himself jokingly. He shook his head and remembered Tony’s text. Stepping back outside, he pulled out his phone. It buzzed immediately.

‘???’

Why was Tony so urgent about the previous owner’s name.

Rich typed back quickly.

‘His name was Lou something. Don’t remember his last name. Sorry, no service here.’

The cold was already biting through his jacket. He did not wait for a response. He slipped the phone away and returned to his warm, quiet house.

The door closed behind him, and the silence settled back into place.

Rich settled into his newly established living room, sinking into the sofa, eager to finally relax. He pulled out his phone. Still no bars. He scrolled through his previous texts from Tony, the missed calls, wondering why the name of the previous owner had suddenly been so urgent. A landline would fix this, he thought, but until then he might try leaving the phone somewhere in the house that could pick up a signal in case of emergencies.

He wandered from room to room, holding the phone down in front of him, scanning walls, countertops, and windowsills. When he passed the large bay window facing the single solitary Dollhouse in the distance, he froze. The sight was surreal. a lone structure standing like a beacon in the middle of the desolation. No lights were on.

Rich continued his search, placing the phone in strategic corners, opening cupboards, balancing it on desks and ledges, his last stop was the fireplace but even that was a dud. Defeated, he sank down against the hearth.

That’s when he noticed it. Something was off. The glass panels of the fireplace looked wrong. He leaned closer. The inside didn’t reflect light, it swallowed it. With a frown, he opened the small doors. Inside, foam board had been painted black and crudely duct-taped into place.

“Afraid of Santa Claus, huh Lou?” he muttered with a weak laugh, shaking his head at his own joke.

*Not exactly.*

Rich’s head jerked up. Then down again, eyes flicking to the phone, agitated. He froze, holding his breath. He thought he heard something, a faint breath, a whisper, maybe just the house settling, but his heart began to race. He stood perfectly still, listening. Silence.

After a long minute, he forced himself to relax. Being in the house without sound for so long must be playing tricks on him, he told himself. His mind had grown so used to absolute quiet that it was starting to create noises where there were none. That’s what he told himself anyway.

Rich pulled the foam board free from the fireplace. A thin, cool breeze slipped into the room, brushing his face. It felt good. Almost relieving.

His phone buzzed in his hand. Three missed calls from Tony.

“Great,” Rich muttered. He stood and walked toward the kitchen but the signal vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Zero bars again. He frowned and turned back toward the living room. With each step closer to the fireplace, the bars climbed back into place, one by one, as if responding to him.

Rich stopped just short of the hearth and watched the screen steady itself.

“I guess this is where you live for now,” he said, half joking, half resigned.

He sealed the fireplace doors to shut out the cold and threw the painted foam into the middle of his garage to deal with later. He swept up the bits of debris he had kicked loose when removing the foam and then plugged his phone in on the hearth.

The room fell perfectly silent again, warm and silent.

His phone began to charge, and Rich decided it was time for bed. Lately he’d been going to sleep earlier and earlier. Maybe it was the warmth. Maybe it was the silence. The house seemed built for sleep.

That night began like the others. Sleep came quickly, gently, without resistance.

He dreamed.

He was floating in a dark sea, the water calm and warm, thick as bathwater. It carried him without effort. He didn’t need to swim. He was content. Safe. The surface above him was smooth and black, unbroken by stars.

Something pale drifted in the distance.

At first he thought it was foam. A scrap of white caught in the swell. But it rose and fell with intention, bobbing in a slow, patient rhythm. Rich focused on it, and it began to grow larger, closer.

It was a head.

The water around him stirred as the shape lifted higher, revealing a face. Pale. Too pale. The kind of white that belonged underwater. The face was smiling, wide and eager, eyes stretched open as if they had never learned how to blink.

Rich felt his heartbeat quicken. The water responded.

The sea began to roll, slow waves at first, then stronger, heavier. The figure’s bobbing grew faster, almost playful. With every rise and fall it came closer. Fifty feet away now. Then forty. The distance didn’t seem to matter. He could see her perfectly.

She was a woman. Her hair trailed behind her like black ink in water. Her smile never wavered. Her eyes were locked on his, unblinking, thrilled.

Hungry.

Rich turned and tried to swim away, but the water thickened, resisted him. The waves rose black and heavy, shoving him back no matter how hard he kicked. He was moving, but going nowhere.

She laughed.

The sound carried through the water, muffled but sharp, and she surged forward, arms churning, splashing wildly. She wasn’t conserving energy. She didn’t need to. She knew she would reach him.

Rich cried out, choking on seawater. The world beneath him began to shake, not constantly, but in steady pulses. The sea vibrated in a familiar rhythm. One beat. Then another. Over and over.

Twenty feet away.

Her mouth opened wider, the smile splitting, teeth bared like an animal’s. The shaking intensified. The pulses grew stronger, faster, syncing perfectly with the pounding in his chest.

Rich screamed.

The water convulsed.

And then he was upright in bed, more awake than he had ever felt in his life.

“What the fuck was that,” he shouted.

*Me.*

The dream vanished instantly, leaving no soft edges behind. But the rhythm remained.

A faint buzzing filled the room. A vibration, steady and familiar, echoing the pulse from the dream. Sound didn’t linger in this house, but it was never obstructed either.

His phone, he realized.

Still buzzing.

Still calling.

Rich bolted out of bed with sudden, desperate purpose and headed for the phone. He flipped on every light he passed, flooding the hallway and kitchen with harsh yellow pools that did nothing to chase the image of the dark sea still sloshing through his mind. The dream clung to him like wet clothes. His phone continued to buzz, steady and insistent, guiding him forward.

The buzzing stopped the moment he stepped into the living room.

Rich froze.

The fireplace door was wide open.

His phone lay on the mantel directly above it, screen dark now, perfectly still, as if it had never made a sound at all. The black opening of the fireplace yawned beneath it, deep and lightless, swallowing the glow from the room.

Rich felt his stomach drop.

He told himself he was being stupid. Nightmares did that. They blurred things. Air pressure could open doors. Maybe that was why the foam board had been there in the first place. A draft.

He moved slowly, every step careful, listening for anything. Anything at all. The house offered nothing back. No creaks. No settling. No hum of heat or air. Just that dense, padded silence pressing in around him.

When he reached the fireplace he lifted his foot and kicked both glass doors shut without using his hands. They closed with a dull, muffled clack that died instantly. Only then did he grab his phone and step back quickly.

The charging cord ripped free from the phone, the plug snapping back against the wall, but Rich did not look away from the fireplace. He backed up until his calves hit the couch and stopped there, breathing shallowly, waiting.

Nothing happened.

The silence thickened. His heart slowed just enough for him to notice how hard it was to breathe. He forced in a few deep breaths and finally looked down at his phone.

No notifications. No missed calls. No voicemails.

Full bars.

“Ok then,” Rich said out loud, the words brittle and hollow in the air.

The sound vanished immediately. The room swallowed it whole.

He wasn’t sure who he was pretending for. There was no one else here. Just him and the house.

His chest tightened. His hands tingled. He felt like he was breathing too fast and not enough at the same time. Maybe it was a panic attack. He had never had one before, but this felt wrong enough to qualify. He needed to hear another human voice.

Rich called Tony.

Tony picked up on the fifth ring.

“Rich?” Tony said, already annoyed.

“Hey Tony, what’s going on,” Rich said, forcing his voice into something casual.

“Dude, it’s two thirty in the morning. Why are you calling me,” Tony snapped.

The reality of it hit Rich all at once. He suddenly worried how insane he must sound.

“Oh, right, sorry,” Rich said quickly. “I saw I missed a few calls from you and thought I’d check in.”

“At two thirty,” Tony said sarcastically.

Rich scrambled. “Service is bad out here. I thought it might be an emergency.”

“No,” Tony said. He paused. “I called you hours ago. Yesterday, actually. I called you yesterday.”

“Sorry,” Rich said.

His breathing had steadied. The house had not.

There was a long silence on the line.

“So why’d you call me,” Rich asked, needing to fill it.

Tony sighed heavily. “The guy you bought the house from. Yeah. He was insane for sure.”

Rich felt his throat tighten.

“I ran into him a few times,” Tony continued. “Made deliveries to your place back when he owned it. Didn’t recognize the house without all the trees.”

Rich was surprised “Why did you think he was insane,” he asked.

“The guy was convinced someone was talking to him,” Tony said. “Some monster or something, maybe it was the devil, I don’t remember. I think he was schizophrenic. One time he told me his brother wouldn’t talk to him anymore, so to fix it he bought out the store’s entire supply of salt.”

Rich swallowed. “What.”

“Yeah. Every bag we had. Spent thousands. It was December too. We hauled pallet after pallet to your house. Screwed the town over pretty bad. Winter was brutal that year. Guess he thought it would fix things with his brother somehow. My guess is that he doesn’t even have a brother.”

Rich said nothing.

“Anyway, I’m going back to sleep,” Tony muttered.

“Ok” said Rich flatly.

The line went dead.

Rich stood alone in his living room, phone pressed to his ear, surrounded by light that felt thin and useless. The fireplace sat quietly across from him, its doors closed now, reflecting his own face back at him.

The silence pressed in.

Rich could not shake the certainty that somewhere, someone was listening.

His eyes kept drifting back to the fireplace. It no longer looked like part of the room. It felt like a weak point, an exposed seam in a suit of armor that had otherwise held. He did not understand what was happening, or even if anything truly was happening at all, but instinct overruled reason. The foam board had been there for something. If it had kept the dreams away, if it had kept the voice distant, then losing his phone signal felt like a small price to pay.

Rich headed for the garage.

He stopped with his hand on the door handle and listened.

Nothing.

He unlocked the door and opened it just enough to reach inside and flip the light switch. The garage flickered to life, revealing an empty concrete space. No car. No clutter. Just bare walls and oil stained floor. He stepped inside, eyes already searching the center of the room where he was sure he had left the foam board.

It was gone.

His head snapped left and right. His breath quickened. His stomach twisted as panic began to bloom again.

The garage door slammed shut behind him.

The sound exploded through the space, echoing wildly. This room had not been insulated. The noise lingered, bounced, multiplied.

“Fuck,” Rich shouted, the word cracking with fear.

The lights went out.

“What the fuck,” he yelled again, louder now.

“Who’s there.”

He backed away blindly from where he thought the door was, hands outstretched, but the darkness swallowed everything. No edges. No depth. No orientation. He kept stepping back until he hit something solid.

Then nothing.

His hands met only air.

Tears welled in his eyes.

Rich stopped moving.

He listened.

There was nothing.

No footsteps. No breathing. No movement at all.

Moonlight seeped weakly through a small window in the rear garage door, barely enough to suggest shapes. The rest of the room was a void. A blackness so complete it made him think of the sea from his dream. Endless and depthless.

He could hear his heart pounding. He could hear his own sobbing. The sounds died quickly, swallowed the same way everything else did in this house.

It was so dark.

*Rich.*

The word landed softly but perfectly formed.

“Holy fuck,” he screamed, collapsing inward as tears spilled down his face.

“Who are you,” he begged.

*Do you want to see.*

The voice was clear now. The voice was close now.

“No,” Rich shouted. “Please let me go.”

*Come and see me.*

He broke.

His breathing turned frantic, shallow gasps ripping from his chest as he sank to the floor. The black sea surged back into his mind. The pale face. The hunger in her eyes. He could see it more clearly now, forming in the darkness, emerging from the corners of the garage. He rocked back and forth without realizing it, as if caught in a current. The black waves overtaking him again.

Then the noise began.

A violent, grinding roar tore through the air above him. Constant. Mechanical. Unforgiving.

Light flooded the space in jagged pieces.

Rich looked up through blurred vision as the garage door slowly lifted. The ancient motor screamed in protest, the rusted chain rattling as it hauled the heavy door upward inch by inch. Moonlight spilled in, carving the darkness apart.

Then the noise stopped.

Silence returned.

Rich stared out of the open garage.

In the distance, the dollhouse stood alone.

A single light was on in the window. The structure stood in a vast black and grey ocean, glowing like a lighthouse meant to guide something home.

The ringing in Rich’s ears would not stop. His stomach churned. His heart pounded harder than it ever had before.

And the silence pressed in again.

Background: I started running during COVID as a way to lose weight. I became a fan of the sport and before long found myself racing 5ks, 10ks, and half marathons. 

Training: I followed Hal Higdon’s Intermediate 1 plan, with a higher mileage for the first few weeks until the plan caught up to my base mileage (which only took a few weeks). I completed the plan, including one 20 mile and extended the second longest run to 21 miles (plan called for 20). 

Race week: I tapered as called for in the plan and started carb loading three days out (Thursday). Diet consisted mostly of low fat, high carb foods and plenty of water/gatorade. I probably averaged \~450 carbs/day for three days. Dinner the night before consisted of spaghetti, grilled chicken, and a light marinara sauce. Booked a hotel for the night before to avoid travel and got a good night of rest after laying out all of my gear.

Race morning: Woke up at 3:15am and began my normal routine as I’d rehearsed for long runs. That consisted of drinking two cups of coffee, eating a bagel and banana, stretching, and gearing up to head to the start line. Temps were in the high 40s that morning, and my hotel was about a mile away from the start. I included gloves, a sweater, some hand warmers to keep warm during the walk and prior to the start. I arrived with \~30min to spare - just enough time to stretch a second time and use the bathroom once more. Entered the corral, stood somewhere between the 3:40 and 3:50 pacer, and settled in.

Fuel: Trained and raced identically. Water and Gatorade, alternating every \~2 miles. This was planned, as the race organizers included both options at every water station throughout the course. Gels consisted of Maurten 100’s taken every 30min. I’ve since learned that that may not be enough, but by the time I found that out I was too concerned with modifying late in the plan so I kept with it. 

Miles 0 - 6: The first 10k flew by. It was still dark, but the route brought us down a waterfront street and through some upscale neighborhoods. I kept my gloves on until mile 5, a decision I’d later regret when my fingers went numb (damn Reynaud’s). Pace held steady between 8:30 - 8:45, heart rate felt great although my Garmin started off with a cadence lock for about a mile. 

Miles 7 - 13: This stretch included turning in towards the city and running through the main urban areas. Mile 7 had a porta-potty, and I took the opportunity for a quick bathroom break. Should’ve held off on the extra Gatorade. The 3:50 pacer passed me but I caught back up and passed around mile 9. I tried to gain some ground in hopes of sub-3:50 and in case another bathroom break was needed. Around mile 10, the marathoners split from the HMers to pick up the extra miles via the Pinellas Trail. This is a pedestrian bike/running path that extends north throughout the county. The path is entirely flat, other than two pedestrian bridges that offer some elevation over main streets. Each bridge would be crossed twice (out and back). 

Miles 14 - 18: The race turned from “lively” to isolated along the path. Other than the volunteers handing out water, cops directing traffic, and other runners, the atmosphere was noticeably less energetic. At this point, I still felt good and miles were getting ticked off at the same pace. I held a lead over that 3:50 pacer, but my bladder was once again screaming at mile 17 so I took another stop. The pacer once again passed me, and I saw at the turn that the gap was going to be tough to overcome. At this point I conceded to my stretch goal of 3:45 and prioritized sub-4. 

Mile 19 - 22: The struggle bus arrived. It was now that my calves and hamstrings started giving me trouble at 8:45, so my pace began to slow to 9:00-9:30. The second trip over the pedestrian bridges didn’t help, but I knew at this point I could meet my primary time goal with the pace I could sustain. That motivated me to keep stay consistent, albeit slower than my usual pace. 

Miles 23 - 26: “A 5k to go. Even your mom could run a 5k!” Easier said than done, but those words kept me going in the last stretch. It was at this point where I could feel the energy of the city and finish line approaching, and I knew the sub-4 time was still within reach. 

Finish: My family was waiting at the finish, and with \~100 yards to go, my son ran onto the course, grabbed my hand, and crossed the finish line with me. Couldn’t have asked for a better memory. 

Post race: I stretched, grabbed a banana and some pasta, a beer and a burger, and then remembered I had a mile walk back to the hotel. I’m two days out from the race and my legs are still sore. It’s true what they say about the first 20 miles being a warmup for the last 6. Despite my pace slowing in the last stretch, I’m fully satisfied with my time and very happy to claim a sub-4 finish. The race was well put together, and organizers/volunteers all did a fantastic job putting the race together. 

Now wondering if I should submit that lottery registration for NYC…. 😅",4,1770768981.0,firstmarathon,6,1.0,False

i'm confused by this method because how do people who have gas stoves or a flame otherwise handle it? we have a glass electric stove top and the towels keep getting burned and singed nonetheless, and he burns himself sometimes, and scooping grounds into the basket during the hectic moment of water boiling and the basket dancing around causes grounds to sometimes spill on the red hot burner and .. it's just chaos. i feel like it cannot be right. i lovingly jab him about it from time to time because it seems dangerous or possibly some steps misunderstood by him but he insists this is the superior way, even though for years he used to just pour water in, put the grounds in the basket and screw the top on and wait for it to do its thing. sanely, safely. seems like both methods the exact same amount of time. appreciate any thoughts!",2,1770768703.0,mokapot,15,0.75,False

To feed three kids and myself just until CCTB (10 days) I was allowed:

1 bag of pasta

1 can of sauce

1 tube of ground beef

2 cans of beans

2 loaves of bread

1 box of cookies (which I just tried and tossed because they tasted like they were moldy)

1 can of instant coffee

1 bag of kale mix

They also let us take two chocolate bars and a box of Kleenex.

There was no vegetables or fruit left that was useable. There was a half rotten cucumber and a couple soft apples and wilted oranges. Like maybe 6 left?

I know there is an increased need right now. I am a single parent rebuilding my life after fleeing domestic violence and have exhausted other community and family resources this month and just need a hand getting to the 20th when I get paid. So trust me, I get it, it’s February. Times are tough. BUT — where are the investments and money going into the food bank actually going? Isn’t it operated mostly by volunteers? It does not appear that the city or province are funding anything there but I don’t know how funding to food banks works.

There was a LOT of canned soup but I had to choose between either pasta sauce or soup and I can stretch sauce further than soup.

The limits on how many items you can take for bigger families isn’t logical. For 4 or more people the items are capped at 1-2 items per shelf and there is about 7 shelves there. I did get a tray of pork chops, which I will use. But for families that don’t or can’t eat pork the options were SEVERELY limited.

It’s just so discouraging. I am back in school to better my life, limited income and I’m carrying my family through for the most part. Haven’t had to utilize the food bank since last summer thankfully! We’ve just hit a tough spot and I needed help.

1r1hvs5,https://i.redd.it/zu3hmfkqbrig1.png,Insulation,"“They say the guy who owned this place before me was insane,” Rich said, smirking as he set a box down.

“Who says that,” Tony asked. He did not bother hiding his skepticism.

“The realtor.”

Tony grunted. He was not in the mood for stories. He had agreed to help Rich move in, but after hours of hauling dusty boxes and wrestling couches around corners too tight, his patience was gone.

“Nice place though,” Rich continued, unfazed. “I got a really good deal on it.” There was an edge of excitement in his voice.

“Shame about the view,” Tony said flatly.

Birch Street had once been one of the most desirable areas in Glen Haven, prized for the privacy offered by the surrounding woods. That had changed two years earlier, when a wildfire tore through the forest east of the neighborhood, reducing nearly two hundred acres of trees to ash.

The loss cut deep. The woods were more than scenery to the town. They were history. That stretch of land in particular had been fiercely protected. Residents had fought developers for years, through lawsuits and appeals, through planning boards and city council meetings. Ownership of the development company changed hands so often no one could keep track. Each new proposal was rejected. Each objection upheld.

Until there was nothing left to protect.

With the trees gone, resistance lost its teeth.

Tony and Rich stood at the large side window, looking out over what had once been a quiet natural vista. Now it was a sprawling expanse of concrete and exposed earth. Foundations scarred the ground. Chain link fences and warning signs in every site line. Trucks and heavy equipment sat idle in no particular order. Utility lines lay open and waiting.

Only one house stood complete.

It sat alone in the center of the construction zone, pristine and finished, surrounded by the gray ugliness of progress.  

“Why build just one house,” Tony asked.

“They call that one the Dollhouse,” Rich said. “It’s been there since the eighties, I think. It burned down in the fire, but they rebuilt it. Supposedly it’s so people can see what the developers plan to put here.”

Tony shook his head. “No wonder the last guy sold this place.”

“He didn’t sell it,” Rich said.

Tony looked at him.

“He died.”

Tony left around six that evening, he worked at a hardware store and had to be at work early Monday morning to restock. Rich had every intention of organizing and unpacking, but after dragging his mattress into place and fitting the sheets with aching arms, his resolve faded. He balanced his television on an unopened moving box at the foot of the bed, the cardboard bowing slightly under the weight, and let a movie play more for background than interest. Somewhere around the halfway point he became aware of how still the house was. Not quiet in the way an empty room is quiet, but padded, softened. The warmth held steady, gentle and even, and the silence pressed in just enough to feel intentional. His eyes grew heavy. He did not fight it.

Rich woke the next morning disoriented. His first night in the house may have been the best rest he had ever had. No traffic. No pipes knocking. No distant hums or night sounds creeping in at the edges. The room was perfectly cozy and perfectly silent, the kind of silence that felt protective. Then he noticed the time. His stomach dropped. Moving in on a Sunday had been a mistake after all. He threw on clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed out the front door.

The moment it shut behind him, his phone came alive in his hand. Buzz after buzz after buzz. Missed calls. Text messages stacked one on top of another. He stopped on the porch, staring down at the screen, confused. Service could be spotty in Glen Haven, sure, but it had never vanished completely. He scrolled through the notifications, all time stamped hours earlier. He glanced back at the house, its windows dark and unreadable.

Strange, he thought.

That night Rich returned home from work under a sky already heavy with early winter. The day had been the first truly bitter one of the season, the kind that burned the lungs and stiffened fingers. Somewhere between hauling boxes, signing paperwork, and the long drive home the night before, it occurred to him that he had never checked the furnace. The thought followed him up the front steps like a bad feeling he could not shake.

He turned the key and opened the door.

Warm air rushed out to meet him, thick and suffocating, as if he had opened an oven instead of his house. It wrapped around his face and chest, stealing his breath for a moment.

“Jesus Christ,” Rich muttered.

His first thought was the gas bill. The kind of heat he was feeling was expensive, reckless even. He dropped his bag and hurried to the thermostat. The display read seventy five degrees. The set temperature below it read sixty eight.

Rich frowned.

“Doesn’t that mean it shuts off once it hits sixty eight,” he said to no one.

*Yes.*

He leaned closer, listening. There was no hum. No click. No familiar churn of a furnace cycling on and off. In fact there was nothing at all. No background noise. No distant rattle of pipes or air moving through vents. Just heat. Heavy, unmoving heat.

He walked into the mudroom that connected the living room to the garage, the small space doubling as a utility room. Washer. Dryer. Furnace. He opened the furnace panel and stared.

The switch was set to off.

There was no heat pumping into the house.

It was just hot.

This was strange, but not really a problem. He told himself, already tallying the money he would save without a gas bill.

Rich glanced down at his phone. Zero bars.

With nothing else to distract him, he spent the rest of Monday unpacking. Furniture shifted, then shifted back again. Cupboards filled with plates and food. The hollow shell of the house slowly softened into something that felt livable.

He set a glass fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. When he turned away, his elbow caught it. The bowl hit the floor and shattered.

The sound died too quickly.

Not faded. Not echoed. It was cut short, like a gunshot fired underwater.

Rich straightened and stared at the shards scattered across the tile. He wasn’t annoyed. He was intrigued.

He lifted a box onto the counter and reached inside, pulling out a coffee mug at random. A gift from his mother.

“Definitely not that one,” he muttered, setting it aside.

He grabbed another cup, old and stained, the kind he would shove to the back of the cupboard and forget about. Closing his eyes, he turned his head away and dropped it.

The crash was loud, violent. And then silence flooded the room before the pieces had finished falling.

It wasn’t quiet. It was smothered.

“Hello,” Rich called out.

His voice vanished the moment it left him.

He laughed, uncertain.

“Helloooooooo,” he tried, stretching the word, pushing it outward. But again the sound was swallowed whole, as if a pillow had been pressed over his mouth before the last syllable could form.

Rich chuckled.

“Weird,” he said to himself.

*Yes.*

Rich grabbed a dustpan and broom and swept the glass into a plastic bag. He carried it outside and tossed it into the trash. As he turned back toward the house, his eyes caught on the shed at the edge of the property. It looked solid. Well kept. And he realized he had not looked inside it once since moving in.

“Might as well,” he said.

As he crossed the yard, his phone buzzed to life again. Two missed calls from Tony and a single text.

‘What was the name of the previous owner again?’

Rich slipped the phone back into his pocket. It was too cold to stand around texting.

He reached the shed with a small surge of excitement.

“Please God, a snowblower,” he said out loud.

Michigan winters were unforgiving. The snow had not started yet, but it never waited long.

He pulled the door open.

The shed was packed solid.

From floor to ceiling, wall to wall, every inch was filled with insulation. Fiberglass batts still wrapped in plastic. Stacked rolls of mineral wool, dense and gray. Rigid foam boards cut to precise sizes, some labeled, some not. Buckets of blown cellulose. Cans of expanding spray foam, dozens of them, arranged neatly like ammunition. Sheets of reflective barrier folded and stacked, their metallic surfaces dull with dust.

There was no room to step inside. Not even a foot.

It was not messy. It was deliberate.

Rich stood there, confused at first, then thoughtful. Maybe the realtor had been wrong. Maybe the previous owner was not insane at all. Maybe he had simply been thorough. Brilliant, even. The house was sealed tighter than anything Rich had ever stepped foot in. Winter felt like summer already.

The thought made him pause.

The house did not have air conditioning. If winter felt like summer, how would summer feel.

Rich closed the shed door and headed back inside. He made himself a sandwich and sat at the small dining table, enjoying the warmth, the stillness.

*Lou.*

Rich looked up.

He thought he heard something but he couldn’t have. If noise was a living being it feared this place, sounds were a thing of the past, he thought to himself jokingly. He shook his head and remembered Tony’s text. Stepping back outside, he pulled out his phone. It buzzed immediately.

‘???’

Why was Tony so urgent about the previous owner’s name.

Rich typed back quickly.

‘His name was Lou something. Don’t remember his last name. Sorry, no service here.’

The cold was already biting through his jacket. He did not wait for a response. He slipped the phone away and returned to his warm, quiet house.

The door closed behind him, and the silence settled back into place.

Rich settled into his newly established living room, sinking into the sofa, eager to finally relax. He pulled out his phone. Still no bars. He scrolled through his previous texts from Tony, the missed calls, wondering why the name of the previous owner had suddenly been so urgent. A landline would fix this, he thought, but until then he might try leaving the phone somewhere in the house that could pick up a signal in case of emergencies.

He wandered from room to room, holding the phone down in front of him, scanning walls, countertops, and windowsills. When he passed the large bay window facing the single solitary Dollhouse in the distance, he froze. The sight was surreal. a lone structure standing like a beacon in the middle of the desolation. No lights were on.

Rich continued his search, placing the phone in strategic corners, opening cupboards, balancing it on desks and ledges, his last stop was the fireplace but even that was a dud. Defeated, he sank down against the hearth.

That’s when he noticed it. Something was off. The glass panels of the fireplace looked wrong. He leaned closer. The inside didn’t reflect light, it swallowed it. With a frown, he opened the small doors. Inside, foam board had been painted black and crudely duct-taped into place.

“Afraid of Santa Claus, huh Lou?” he muttered with a weak laugh, shaking his head at his own joke.

*Not exactly.*

Rich’s head jerked up. Then down again, eyes flicking to the phone, agitated. He froze, holding his breath. He thought he heard something, a faint breath, a whisper, maybe just the house settling, but his heart began to race. He stood perfectly still, listening. Silence.

After a long minute, he forced himself to relax. Being in the house without sound for so long must be playing tricks on him, he told himself. His mind had grown so used to absolute quiet that it was starting to create noises where there were none. That’s what he told himself anyway.

Rich pulled the foam board free from the fireplace. A thin, cool breeze slipped into the room, brushing his face. It felt good. Almost relieving.

His phone buzzed in his hand. Three missed calls from Tony.

“Great,” Rich muttered. He stood and walked toward the kitchen but the signal vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Zero bars again. He frowned and turned back toward the living room. With each step closer to the fireplace, the bars climbed back into place, one by one, as if responding to him.

Rich stopped just short of the hearth and watched the screen steady itself.

“I guess this is where you live for now,” he said, half joking, half resigned.

He sealed the fireplace doors to shut out the cold and threw the painted foam into the middle of his garage to deal with later. He swept up the bits of debris he had kicked loose when removing the foam and then plugged his phone in on the hearth.

The room fell perfectly silent again, warm and silent.

His phone began to charge, and Rich decided it was time for bed. Lately he’d been going to sleep earlier and earlier. Maybe it was the warmth. Maybe it was the silence. The house seemed built for sleep.

That night began like the others. Sleep came quickly, gently, without resistance.

He dreamed.

He was floating in a dark sea, the water calm and warm, thick as bathwater. It carried him without effort. He didn’t need to swim. He was content. Safe. The surface above him was smooth and black, unbroken by stars.

Something pale drifted in the distance.

At first he thought it was foam. A scrap of white caught in the swell. But it rose and fell with intention, bobbing in a slow, patient rhythm. Rich focused on it, and it began to grow larger, closer.

It was a head.

The water around him stirred as the shape lifted higher, revealing a face. Pale. Too pale. The kind of white that belonged underwater. The face was smiling, wide and eager, eyes stretched open as if they had never learned how to blink.

Rich felt his heartbeat quicken. The water responded.

The sea began to roll, slow waves at first, then stronger, heavier. The figure’s bobbing grew faster, almost playful. With every rise and fall it came closer. Fifty feet away now. Then forty. The distance didn’t seem to matter. He could see her perfectly.

She was a woman. Her hair trailed behind her like black ink in water. Her smile never wavered. Her eyes were locked on his, unblinking, thrilled.

Hungry.

Rich turned and tried to swim away, but the water thickened, resisted him. The waves rose black and heavy, shoving him back no matter how hard he kicked. He was moving, but going nowhere.

She laughed.

The sound carried through the water, muffled but sharp, and she surged forward, arms churning, splashing wildly. She wasn’t conserving energy. She didn’t need to. She knew she would reach him.

Rich cried out, choking on seawater. The world beneath him began to shake, not constantly, but in steady pulses. The sea vibrated in a familiar rhythm. One beat. Then another. Over and over.

Twenty feet away.

Her mouth opened wider, the smile splitting, teeth bared like an animal’s. The shaking intensified. The pulses grew stronger, faster, syncing perfectly with the pounding in his chest.

Rich screamed.

The water convulsed.

And then he was upright in bed, more awake than he had ever felt in his life.

“What the fuck was that,” he shouted.

*Me.*

The dream vanished instantly, leaving no soft edges behind. But the rhythm remained.

A faint buzzing filled the room. A vibration, steady and familiar, echoing the pulse from the dream. Sound didn’t linger in this house, but it was never obstructed either.

His phone, he realized.

Still buzzing.

Still calling.

Rich bolted out of bed with sudden, desperate purpose and headed for the phone. He flipped on every light he passed, flooding the hallway and kitchen with harsh yellow pools that did nothing to chase the image of the dark sea still sloshing through his mind. The dream clung to him like wet clothes. His phone continued to buzz, steady and insistent, guiding him forward.

The buzzing stopped the moment he stepped into the living room.

Rich froze.

The fireplace door was wide open.

His phone lay on the mantel directly above it, screen dark now, perfectly still, as if it had never made a sound at all. The black opening of the fireplace yawned beneath it, deep and lightless, swallowing the glow from the room.

Rich felt his stomach drop.

He told himself he was being stupid. Nightmares did that. They blurred things. Air pressure could open doors. Maybe that was why the foam board had been there in the first place. A draft.

He moved slowly, every step careful, listening for anything. Anything at all. The house offered nothing back. No creaks. No settling. No hum of heat or air. Just that dense, padded silence pressing in around him.

When he reached the fireplace he lifted his foot and kicked both glass doors shut without using his hands. They closed with a dull, muffled clack that died instantly. Only then did he grab his phone and step back quickly.

The charging cord ripped free from the phone, the plug snapping back against the wall, but Rich did not look away from the fireplace. He backed up until his calves hit the couch and stopped there, breathing shallowly, waiting.

Nothing happened.

The silence thickened. His heart slowed just enough for him to notice how hard it was to breathe. He forced in a few deep breaths and finally looked down at his phone.

No notifications. No missed calls. No voicemails.

Full bars.

“Ok then,” Rich said out loud, the words brittle and hollow in the air.

The sound vanished immediately. The room swallowed it whole.

He wasn’t sure who he was pretending for. There was no one else here. Just him and the house.

His chest tightened. His hands tingled. He felt like he was breathing too fast and not enough at the same time. Maybe it was a panic attack. He had never had one before, but this felt wrong enough to qualify. He needed to hear another human voice.

Rich called Tony.

Tony picked up on the fifth ring.

“Rich?” Tony said, already annoyed.

“Hey Tony, what’s going on,” Rich said, forcing his voice into something casual.

“Dude, it’s two thirty in the morning. Why are you calling me,” Tony snapped.

The reality of it hit Rich all at once. He suddenly worried how insane he must sound.

“Oh, right, sorry,” Rich said quickly. “I saw I missed a few calls from you and thought I’d check in.”

“At two thirty,” Tony said sarcastically.

Rich scrambled. “Service is bad out here. I thought it might be an emergency.”

“No,” Tony said. He paused. “I called you hours ago. Yesterday, actually. I called you yesterday.”

“Sorry,” Rich said.

His breathing had steadied. The house had not.

There was a long silence on the line.

“So why’d you call me,” Rich asked, needing to fill it.

Tony sighed heavily. “The guy you bought the house from. Yeah. He was insane for sure.”

Rich felt his throat tighten.

“I ran into him a few times,” Tony continued. “Made deliveries to your place back when he owned it. Didn’t recognize the house without all the trees.”

Rich was surprised “Why did you think he was insane,” he asked.

“The guy was convinced someone was talking to him,” Tony said. “Some monster or something, maybe it was the devil, I don’t remember. I think he was schizophrenic. One time he told me his brother wouldn’t talk to him anymore, so to fix it he bought out the store’s entire supply of salt.”

Rich swallowed. “What.”

“Yeah. Every bag we had. Spent thousands. It was December too. We hauled pallet after pallet to your house. Screwed the town over pretty bad. Winter was brutal that year. Guess he thought it would fix things with his brother somehow. My guess is that he doesn’t even have a brother.”

Rich said nothing.

“Anyway, I’m going back to sleep,” Tony muttered.

“Ok” said Rich flatly.

The line went dead.

Rich stood alone in his living room, phone pressed to his ear, surrounded by light that felt thin and useless. The fireplace sat quietly across from him, its doors closed now, reflecting his own face back at him.

The silence pressed in.

Rich could not shake the certainty that somewhere, someone was listening.

His eyes kept drifting back to the fireplace. It no longer looked like part of the room. It felt like a weak point, an exposed seam in a suit of armor that had otherwise held. He did not understand what was happening, or even if anything truly was happening at all, but instinct overruled reason. The foam board had been there for something. If it had kept the dreams away, if it had kept the voice distant, then losing his phone signal felt like a small price to pay.

Rich headed for the garage.

He stopped with his hand on the door handle and listened.

Nothing.

He unlocked the door and opened it just enough to reach inside and flip the light switch. The garage flickered to life, revealing an empty concrete space. No car. No clutter. Just bare walls and oil stained floor. He stepped inside, eyes already searching the center of the room where he was sure he had left the foam board.

It was gone.

His head snapped left and right. His breath quickened. His stomach twisted as panic began to bloom again.

The garage door slammed shut behind him.

The sound exploded through the space, echoing wildly. This room had not been insulated. The noise lingered, bounced, multiplied.

“Fuck,” Rich shouted, the word cracking with fear.

The lights went out.

“What the fuck,” he yelled again, louder now.

“Who’s there.”

He backed away blindly from where he thought the door was, hands outstretched, but the darkness swallowed everything. No edges. No depth. No orientation. He kept stepping back until he hit something solid.

Then nothing.

His hands met only air.

Tears welled in his eyes.

Rich stopped moving.

He listened.

There was nothing.

No footsteps. No breathing. No movement at all.

Moonlight seeped weakly through a small window in the rear garage door, barely enough to suggest shapes. The rest of the room was a void. A blackness so complete it made him think of the sea from his dream. Endless and depthless.

He could hear his heart pounding. He could hear his own sobbing. The sounds died quickly, swallowed the same way everything else did in this house.

It was so dark.

*Rich.*

The word landed softly but perfectly formed.

“Holy fuck,” he screamed, collapsing inward as tears spilled down his face.

“Who are you,” he begged.

*Do you want to see.*

The voice was clear now. The voice was close now.

“No,” Rich shouted. “Please let me go.”

*Come and see me.*

He broke.

His breathing turned frantic, shallow gasps ripping from his chest as he sank to the floor. The black sea surged back into his mind. The pale face. The hunger in her eyes. He could see it more clearly now, forming in the darkness, emerging from the corners of the garage. He rocked back and forth without realizing it, as if caught in a current. The black waves overtaking him again.

Then the noise began.

A violent, grinding roar tore through the air above him. Constant. Mechanical. Unforgiving.

Light flooded the space in jagged pieces.

Rich looked up through blurred vision as the garage door slowly lifted. The ancient motor screamed in protest, the rusted chain rattling as it hauled the heavy door upward inch by inch. Moonlight spilled in, carving the darkness apart.

Then the noise stopped.

Silence returned.

Rich stared out of the open garage.

In the distance, the dollhouse stood alone.

A single light was on in the window. The structure stood in a vast black and grey ocean, glowing like a lighthouse meant to guide something home.

The ringing in Rich’s ears would not stop. His stomach churned. His heart pounded harder than it ever had before.

And the silence pressed in again.

3/26

Last night I woke up from a nightmare I can’t remember. I shot up, hacking as I choked on my spit. I gripped my chest, as my lungs heaved for air - each breath a painful wheeze. My mind raced, scrambling to comprehend where I was as my adrenaline faded away. My eyes whipped around my room, the setting vaguely illuminated in the moonlight: furniture and ornaments faded in and out of clarity through my tears. I sat on my sweat soaked sheets and sobbed for far too long, until peeks of orange started to sneak their way through my blinds. I’m still embarrassed at having felt such an intense terror at just a dream. Much more so with it being a dream that I have no recollection of.

I’m sure my sleep deprivation was written on my face when I made it to the office today. Risa definitely took notice. She made her way over to me with coffee in hand while I settled at my desk.

“Trouble waking up this morning?” She chided.

“Yeah, just had some tough sleep,” I responded, powering on my PC. I hoped she was just making reference to bags under my eyes and not to it being twelve minutes past eight.

“Tell me about it,” she chuckled. “Must be that weekend brain struggling to come to terms with Monday coming around.”

“Yeah, probably,” I nodded as politely as I could, clicking my mouse absentmindedly at nothing in particular.

“Well don’t want to get too much in your hair if you’re having a bad morning. But just wanted to check in with you since you were getting in a little late this morning.” I winced.

“Sorry, sorry. Just had a bad night. I’ll definitely try to be in on time tomorrow.”

“Oh of course, honey! And I don’t mean to nag or anything, just thought I should check in on you this morning.” 

I gave a brief smile, rolling my tongue across my teeth. That was the fourth time she had used morning in this conversation. And she was really just doing her job, but I really just wanted out of the conversation.

I glanced over, making sure that she had finished going back into her office before I turned over to work, mindlessly scrolling through emails. The rest of the day was uneventful. I made small talk with my coworkers, declined an offer to head out for lunch, scrolled through Reddit and Twitter in moments where nobody was looking over my shoulder.

Then, checking the weather for the third time that day, I remember seeing a full moon expected in nine days. And I felt my gut fill with an unknown dread.

3/27

Last night I had another nightmare. I still can’t remember exactly what happened. But I woke up screaming and choking again. Gagging on saliva and crying, I pushed myself to the corner of  my bed, huddling in the crevice between the wall and bed frame. I don’t remember what happened, but I know how it felt. Warm and dark and terrifying, until a cool light washed over me and then just an overwhelming pain. Nothing real, only dreamt. An ethereal agony that ceased to exist when I gained consciousness but left behind a vestigial affliction in the mind. I couldn’t feel anything, but I know it was excruciating. Breaking a leg tripping down stairs, stepping on a rusty nail running outside, fractured ribs from a head-on collision—this was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. And I never felt it.

I was late to work again. I sat in the car for half an hour deciding whether or not to call in sick. Risa rushed over to me when I walked in. Her legs shuffling awkwardly in her dress and heels as she intercepted me, slightly out of breath from the short stroll.

“Good morning Cameron! Are you feeling okay this morning?”

I weighed the question in my head, deciding whether it was more polite to be honest or not. 

“I’m doing alright.Just another rough night of sleep.”

Risa tilted her head lightly. I’m sure it was genuine, but annoyance started a thorny bloom in my stomach. “Oh, you poor thing. Make sure to get to bed on time. You need your eight hours, you know.”

I chuckled dryly. “I know, I know. Trying my best and all. Just been feeling really restless.”

Risa nodded with an assumed knowingness. “Well you let me know if there’s anything I can do for you. Don’t want you feeling too drained here at work.”

“Will do. Thank you.” I flashed a quick smile and sat down to work. The hours seemed to slur, as if the clock was stumbling forward and backward. An hour of spreadsheets and calls seemed to only be a couple of ticks on the minute hand. And despite the drag of the work day, I just couldn’t convince myself that I wanted to go home either. As the unsteady hours passed, this dread slithered and squirmed in my stomach at the thought of the day ending. When sleep became less of a threat and more of a promise.

3/28

A teal eye swallows the night sky. Stars and city lights snuffed under its gaze. My skin is burning. My skin is melting, peeling, splatting as it drips to the pavement. I curl into a ball as my body freezes and crumbles underneath the icy stare.

I was two hours late for work. A couple unread emails from Risa took up space in my inbox. When I finally showed up, the real Risa motioned me over to her office once she caught wind of my presence. I plopped myself into the chair opposite her desk.

A silence permeated the air between us for a while.

“Cameron? Are you okay?” Risa asked. 

My name didn’t sound right when she said it. It didn’t really feel like it was my name. Like living in a stranger’s home. The address was familiar, but it sure as hell didn’t feel like mine. I bit my cheek for a sec and blinked rapidly before mustering a response. “Yeah, sorry, I’m okay. Just slept through my alarm last night. I know it’s a bit of a bad track record these past couple of days.”

“Oh, okay.”

The silence returned. 

“Are you sure you’re okay though? It’s okay if you don’t want to talk to me about it. I understand. I’m human too. We all have problems at home sometimes and I—”

“Really Risa, I’m fine, thank you for asking. Sorry to worry you.”

Risa gave me a look, but didn’t let the silence hang around. “I understand. I’m just worried. So if you need some time off, or if there’s anything I can do please just ask.”

I thanked Risa again for her offer and trotted back to my desk. I was glad to finally get some space, but at this point, what for? I didn’t want to work. But I wanted to go home far less. Even entertaining grueling small talk felt favorable to another night laying in that bed. Hours sank by.

3/29

I did not sleep last night and I can barely make out the letters on the page as I write this. My arm feels like an alien extension, running on an autopilot I must have preprogrammed. I need to sleep. But I am so scared of going to bed. I feel like I’m going insane and forcing myself to stay awake will not help but I just can’t go back to bed. I scheduled an appointment with the doctor but it seems like they’re busy for a couple weeks out. I don’t know what to do, I can’t go back to bed. I can’t go back to bed. I can’t go back to bed. I will not go to work. I will not sleep. I will stay awake until the doctor can fix me.

3/30

This time I am running through an alley before finding myself out on the street. I am screaming at others to run. But I should be looking for cover. The clouds begin to part and I know that it sees me. A wave of turquoise washes over me. At first the glow feels soft and comforting. My fear strips for a second and I feel silly for overreacting. Then the moonbeams sear into my skin, bubbling and boiling from within. I try to hide my face in my hands, but the slight tug of my fingertips pulls my skin away from my face. I am reminded of melted cheese sliding off a hot meal. And then I feel myself retching up a puddle of intestine and bile onto the sidewalk. I try to run, but each step leaves a bit of me behind and soon there is nothing left.

I realized that I miss forgetting my dreams. I was late to work again. Risa came by my desk, but the conversation was light. She asked me if I was okay, to which I gave my usual response and then she headed back to her office defeated. Her smile dragged without reaching her eyes, as sunken and weighed as they were.

I thought to ask her if she was okay, but somehow I couldn’t find the energy to offer sympathy. I can’t remember if I even got any work done. I just sat at my desk with my head in my hands, feeling as if I were rude for not checking in on Risa. I wish she would have just come back and asked again. Maybe with a second effort we could have spoken a little more and this coiling guilt wouldn’t feel so heavy.

3/31

Tonight I don’t linger on the streets of my dreamscape. I know the gaze is returning. People mill about on the road. I should warn them but I am overcome with a feverish need to get inside. I cannot waste time trying to save the rest. I push through crowds that seem to get denser the further I advance. Moonlight seeps through the cloudline. I can feel myself melting into a passerby. I am screaming. They are screaming. My eardrums burst, but I can feel their fear as we mix into a grotesque salad of bodies struggling to crawl out of a mass we churn ourselves further into. In this tangle of limbs I try to pull myself free, but clamoring voices and thoughts wrestle their way into my mind. Our physical conjoinment twinned by a mental blend, and the lines dividing myself blur until I can’t remember who we were.

I headed to the doctor to see if I could push my appointment up ahead. The line was full. And was still full at the hospital. And still at the ER, where I was told by rushing nurses and stressed receptionists that they are already over capacity. And that there is nothing that can be done for me.

4/1

I’ve been trying my best to stay awake through the night. At first it felt plausible, I’ve watched movies and scrolled through socials to give myself something to do. But with the night wearing on, I can feel fatigue grasping and pulling me down. I’ll have to brew myself another pot of coffee in a second. I’ve pulled all the blinds closed and turned on every light in the house. Earlier tonight I was flipping through channels, relegating myself to empty thought rather than considering my exhaustion. I briefly stopped flipping channels when I reached the news. A handsome but disheveled host was saying something about the hospitals being over capacity. I considered listening, but then I began to worry and continued to flip through. But I can’t get the thought out of my head. Is it better if my nightmare is an isolated experience? Would it be worse to be completely alone in this or to know that I’m not?

4/2

I dream of being on the street in the warm darkness. I elbow past people to get to a door. Any door. Any balcony or overhang or shade I can find. This time I will not allow the crowd to overtake me. I scream and bite and kick to get to a building. The doors are locked and the clouds are parting and I am running out of time. So I press myself into the brick wall, hoping that the window overhead has enough of an outcrop to keep me safe. Although my nose protrudes just shy of the overhang and I scream as it curdles and drips onto my chest and stomach. I try to steady my breathing, the panic expanding into my lungs and I can barely manage to keep my eyes open as the crowds burst on the streets. The storm drains overflow with red. All I can do is watch as the flayed remains of people raise themselves. Tendon and arteries reconstituting and stitching themselves into something new. A cry of fear overtakes the one of agony as I dig my fingers into my eyes. More merciful than partaking as a witness. I fall forward and paint the ground.

Most people didn’t show up to work. I heard Risa crying from her office. I rapped my knuckles on her door and let myself in. I couldn’t find my words, but this time it didn’t feel like there was a silence obstructing us.

“Cameron, I’m so scared,” Risa managed to get out between hiccuping sobs. I wasn’t sure how to respond, but was keenly aware of something warm streaming past my cheeks and dripping off my chin. So I just shuffled past her desk and patted her back as Risa buried her face in her arms. 

“I know, I am too.” 

“What do we do? Where is everybody?”

I didn’t have a reply. I considered that maybe everybody is trying to find shelter in their homes. Or spending their time with loved ones. It’s certainly more fitting than wasting time at the office. I also considered that there might not be an “everybody” anymore. For all I knew, it was just me and Risa alone in this world. And then I got scared, and the words got choked up in my throat and I left Risa alone in her office.

I can’t remember what time I got home. I don’t think I got any work done. I think I meandered through the streets, but I cannot tell if that is just a dream I had.

4/3

This time I am in a field. A purple sea of grass seems to be dancing around me. The longest stems sport spiraling flowers that smell sweet. I stare at the horizon where fractal mountains encompass the landscape. They are dwarfed by ecclesiastical obelisks that pierce the heavens. And as my eyes follow them I realize the sea of clouds is beginning to part. I have spent far too long in awe of this unfamiliar nostalgia. The curtain is opening, and I know that this time there is nowhere to run. So I drop to my knees tearing root and stem to toss them aside. I dig my fingers into the dirt, throwing scoops of earth behind me. I don’t have enough time and my heart feels ready to explode. Fingernails tear as I dig through pebbles and soil. I plant my face into the ground swallowing up whatever I can in a frantic attempt to save myself.

Then the clouds part and I watch as my back cascades and pools into the hole I dug. I can feel the breeze drift past my spine and skull as the moonlight continues to worm its way through. Something is trying to push through. My eyes pop but I know I am enveloped in light. Long limbs tear through the back of my rib cage, tearing my husk to free itself. A cicada shedding its skin. 

I was the only one at work. I walked over to Risa’s office. Knocked a few times before turning the knob and entering. The room was dark, but light from the office illuminated two shoes. One laid on the ground. The other hung limply, inches above her chair. Swaying slightly. I bit my tongue and closed the door.

Work is finished, but I can’t bring myself to head home. I will curl up under my desk and try not to sleep, yet I know it will still come.

4/4

My eyes open to a large teal sphere staring at me. A pulse emanates steadily and malevolently as it overtakes the sky. I have no time to run. No time to hide. Fingers extend from my mouth. My jaw splits as something forces its way out. The moonlight dances vivaciously across the eyes dotting its head. The scintillating display reflected off dozens of newborn irises, opening to capture the bewitching light of the celestial mother.

I wake up in the dead of the night. The office is still empty. My jaw hurts like hell. I leave my bag at my desk and walk out and down to the stairwell. 

I can see light beaming through the frosted glass on the door. Even filtered, my skin feels frigid as I reach for the handle. I throw open the door and step into the light. 

Skin peels and drifts upward like petals caught in the wind’s sway. I dig my hand into a pectoral. The juxtaposition of the chilled night and warm flesh feels wrong. Poetic. Muscle tissue plucks, the moon softening the tendons. I push my chest skyward, with my hand exploring the bubbling surface as I excavate new layers of viscera. I am in love. I have never experienced a night so beautiful, I am almost afraid that I am dreaming and that I will wake up. 

The weight of my torso gives way. There’s a rush as my head falls backwards, while my lower half marches forward further into the light. Something rises from our cavity, pulling ourself out from our shell.  It falls to the ground wetly, and then I rise off the pavement embracing the wonderful moonlight. We take our first step forward. Brothers are visible in the distance, clamoring together in excitement. As my husk collapses to the ground I trade gazes with the moon. Our wet skin glistens in its radiance: blinding and beautiful with their accouchement iridescence. We march to join our brethren, dancing in the horizon, and celebrate this birthright festival. I’ve finally woken from this nightmare.",1,1770768485.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

“Who says that,” Tony asked. He did not bother hiding his skepticism.

“The realtor.”

Tony grunted. He was not in the mood for stories. He had agreed to help Rich move in, but after hours of hauling dusty boxes and wrestling couches around corners too tight, his patience was gone.

“Nice place though,” Rich continued, unfazed. “I got a really good deal on it.” There was an edge of excitement in his voice.

“Shame about the view,” Tony said flatly.

Birch Street had once been one of the most desirable areas in Glen Haven, prized for the privacy offered by the surrounding woods. That had changed two years earlier, when a wildfire tore through the forest east of the neighborhood, reducing nearly two hundred acres of trees to ash.

The loss cut deep. The woods were more than scenery to the town. They were history. That stretch of land in particular had been fiercely protected. Residents had fought developers for years, through lawsuits and appeals, through planning boards and city council meetings. Ownership of the development company changed hands so often no one could keep track. Each new proposal was rejected. Each objection upheld.

Until there was nothing left to protect.

With the trees gone, resistance lost its teeth.

Tony and Rich stood at the large side window, looking out over what had once been a quiet natural vista. Now it was a sprawling expanse of concrete and exposed earth. Foundations scarred the ground. Chain link fences and warning signs in every site line. Trucks and heavy equipment sat idle in no particular order. Utility lines lay open and waiting.

Only one house stood complete.

It sat alone in the center of the construction zone, pristine and finished, surrounded by the gray ugliness of progress.  

“Why build just one house,” Tony asked.

“They call that one the Dollhouse,” Rich said. “It’s been there since the eighties, I think. It burned down in the fire, but they rebuilt it. Supposedly it’s so people can see what the developers plan to put here.”

Tony shook his head. “No wonder the last guy sold this place.”

“He didn’t sell it,” Rich said.

Tony looked at him.

“He died.”

Tony left around six that evening, he worked at a hardware store and had to be at work early Monday morning to restock. Rich had every intention of organizing and unpacking, but after dragging his mattress into place and fitting the sheets with aching arms, his resolve faded. He balanced his television on an unopened moving box at the foot of the bed, the cardboard bowing slightly under the weight, and let a movie play more for background than interest. Somewhere around the halfway point he became aware of how still the house was. Not quiet in the way an empty room is quiet, but padded, softened. The warmth held steady, gentle and even, and the silence pressed in just enough to feel intentional. His eyes grew heavy. He did not fight it.

Rich woke the next morning disoriented. His first night in the house may have been the best rest he had ever had. No traffic. No pipes knocking. No distant hums or night sounds creeping in at the edges. The room was perfectly cozy and perfectly silent, the kind of silence that felt protective. Then he noticed the time. His stomach dropped. Moving in on a Sunday had been a mistake after all. He threw on clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed out the front door.

The moment it shut behind him, his phone came alive in his hand. Buzz after buzz after buzz. Missed calls. Text messages stacked one on top of another. He stopped on the porch, staring down at the screen, confused. Service could be spotty in Glen Haven, sure, but it had never vanished completely. He scrolled through the notifications, all time stamped hours earlier. He glanced back at the house, its windows dark and unreadable.

Strange, he thought.

That night Rich returned home from work under a sky already heavy with early winter. The day had been the first truly bitter one of the season, the kind that burned the lungs and stiffened fingers. Somewhere between hauling boxes, signing paperwork, and the long drive home the night before, it occurred to him that he had never checked the furnace. The thought followed him up the front steps like a bad feeling he could not shake.

He turned the key and opened the door.

Warm air rushed out to meet him, thick and suffocating, as if he had opened an oven instead of his house. It wrapped around his face and chest, stealing his breath for a moment.

“Jesus Christ,” Rich muttered.

His first thought was the gas bill. The kind of heat he was feeling was expensive, reckless even. He dropped his bag and hurried to the thermostat. The display read seventy five degrees. The set temperature below it read sixty eight.

Rich frowned.

“Doesn’t that mean it shuts off once it hits sixty eight,” he said to no one.

*Yes.*

He leaned closer, listening. There was no hum. No click. No familiar churn of a furnace cycling on and off. In fact there was nothing at all. No background noise. No distant rattle of pipes or air moving through vents. Just heat. Heavy, unmoving heat.

He walked into the mudroom that connected the living room to the garage, the small space doubling as a utility room. Washer. Dryer. Furnace. He opened the furnace panel and stared.

The switch was set to off.

There was no heat pumping into the house.

It was just hot.

This was strange, but not really a problem. He told himself, already tallying the money he would save without a gas bill.

Rich glanced down at his phone. Zero bars.

With nothing else to distract him, he spent the rest of Monday unpacking. Furniture shifted, then shifted back again. Cupboards filled with plates and food. The hollow shell of the house slowly softened into something that felt livable.

He set a glass fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. When he turned away, his elbow caught it. The bowl hit the floor and shattered.

The sound died too quickly.

Not faded. Not echoed. It was cut short, like a gunshot fired underwater.

Rich straightened and stared at the shards scattered across the tile. He wasn’t annoyed. He was intrigued.

He lifted a box onto the counter and reached inside, pulling out a coffee mug at random. A gift from his mother.

“Definitely not that one,” he muttered, setting it aside.

He grabbed another cup, old and stained, the kind he would shove to the back of the cupboard and forget about. Closing his eyes, he turned his head away and dropped it.

The crash was loud, violent. And then silence flooded the room before the pieces had finished falling.

It wasn’t quiet. It was smothered.

“Hello,” Rich called out.

His voice vanished the moment it left him.

He laughed, uncertain.

“Helloooooooo,” he tried, stretching the word, pushing it outward. But again the sound was swallowed whole, as if a pillow had been pressed over his mouth before the last syllable could form.

Rich chuckled.

“Weird,” he said to himself.

*Yes.*

Rich grabbed a dustpan and broom and swept the glass into a plastic bag. He carried it outside and tossed it into the trash. As he turned back toward the house, his eyes caught on the shed at the edge of the property. It looked solid. Well kept. And he realized he had not looked inside it once since moving in.

“Might as well,” he said.

As he crossed the yard, his phone buzzed to life again. Two missed calls from Tony and a single text.

‘What was the name of the previous owner again?’

Rich slipped the phone back into his pocket. It was too cold to stand around texting.

He reached the shed with a small surge of excitement.

“Please God, a snowblower,” he said out loud.

Michigan winters were unforgiving. The snow had not started yet, but it never waited long.

He pulled the door open.

The shed was packed solid.

From floor to ceiling, wall to wall, every inch was filled with insulation. Fiberglass batts still wrapped in plastic. Stacked rolls of mineral wool, dense and gray. Rigid foam boards cut to precise sizes, some labeled, some not. Buckets of blown cellulose. Cans of expanding spray foam, dozens of them, arranged neatly like ammunition. Sheets of reflective barrier folded and stacked, their metallic surfaces dull with dust.

There was no room to step inside. Not even a foot.

It was not messy. It was deliberate.

Rich stood there, confused at first, then thoughtful. Maybe the realtor had been wrong. Maybe the previous owner was not insane at all. Maybe he had simply been thorough. Brilliant, even. The house was sealed tighter than anything Rich had ever stepped foot in. Winter felt like summer already.

The thought made him pause.

The house did not have air conditioning. If winter felt like summer, how would summer feel.

Rich closed the shed door and headed back inside. He made himself a sandwich and sat at the small dining table, enjoying the warmth, the stillness.

*Lou.*

Rich looked up.

He thought he heard something but he couldn’t have. If noise was a living being it feared this place, sounds were a thing of the past, he thought to himself jokingly. He shook his head and remembered Tony’s text. Stepping back outside, he pulled out his phone. It buzzed immediately.

‘???’

Why was Tony so urgent about the previous owner’s name.

Rich typed back quickly.

‘His name was Lou something. Don’t remember his last name. Sorry, no service here.’

The cold was already biting through his jacket. He did not wait for a response. He slipped the phone away and returned to his warm, quiet house.

The door closed behind him, and the silence settled back into place.

Rich settled into his newly established living room, sinking into the sofa, eager to finally relax. He pulled out his phone. Still no bars. He scrolled through his previous texts from Tony, the missed calls, wondering why the name of the previous owner had suddenly been so urgent. A landline would fix this, he thought, but until then he might try leaving the phone somewhere in the house that could pick up a signal in case of emergencies.

He wandered from room to room, holding the phone down in front of him, scanning walls, countertops, and windowsills. When he passed the large bay window facing the single solitary Dollhouse in the distance, he froze. The sight was surreal. a lone structure standing like a beacon in the middle of the desolation. No lights were on.

Rich continued his search, placing the phone in strategic corners, opening cupboards, balancing it on desks and ledges, his last stop was the fireplace but even that was a dud. Defeated, he sank down against the hearth.

That’s when he noticed it. Something was off. The glass panels of the fireplace looked wrong. He leaned closer. The inside didn’t reflect light, it swallowed it. With a frown, he opened the small doors. Inside, foam board had been painted black and crudely duct-taped into place.

“Afraid of Santa Claus, huh Lou?” he muttered with a weak laugh, shaking his head at his own joke.

*Not exactly.*

Rich’s head jerked up. Then down again, eyes flicking to the phone, agitated. He froze, holding his breath. He thought he heard something, a faint breath, a whisper, maybe just the house settling, but his heart began to race. He stood perfectly still, listening. Silence.

After a long minute, he forced himself to relax. Being in the house without sound for so long must be playing tricks on him, he told himself. His mind had grown so used to absolute quiet that it was starting to create noises where there were none. That’s what he told himself anyway.

Rich pulled the foam board free from the fireplace. A thin, cool breeze slipped into the room, brushing his face. It felt good. Almost relieving.

His phone buzzed in his hand. Three missed calls from Tony.

“Great,” Rich muttered. He stood and walked toward the kitchen but the signal vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Zero bars again. He frowned and turned back toward the living room. With each step closer to the fireplace, the bars climbed back into place, one by one, as if responding to him.

Rich stopped just short of the hearth and watched the screen steady itself.

“I guess this is where you live for now,” he said, half joking, half resigned.

He sealed the fireplace doors to shut out the cold and threw the painted foam into the middle of his garage to deal with later. He swept up the bits of debris he had kicked loose when removing the foam and then plugged his phone in on the hearth.

The room fell perfectly silent again, warm and silent.

His phone began to charge, and Rich decided it was time for bed. Lately he’d been going to sleep earlier and earlier. Maybe it was the warmth. Maybe it was the silence. The house seemed built for sleep.

That night began like the others. Sleep came quickly, gently, without resistance.

He dreamed.

He was floating in a dark sea, the water calm and warm, thick as bathwater. It carried him without effort. He didn’t need to swim. He was content. Safe. The surface above him was smooth and black, unbroken by stars.

Something pale drifted in the distance.

At first he thought it was foam. A scrap of white caught in the swell. But it rose and fell with intention, bobbing in a slow, patient rhythm. Rich focused on it, and it began to grow larger, closer.

It was a head.

The water around him stirred as the shape lifted higher, revealing a face. Pale. Too pale. The kind of white that belonged underwater. The face was smiling, wide and eager, eyes stretched open as if they had never learned how to blink.

Rich felt his heartbeat quicken. The water responded.

The sea began to roll, slow waves at first, then stronger, heavier. The figure’s bobbing grew faster, almost playful. With every rise and fall it came closer. Fifty feet away now. Then forty. The distance didn’t seem to matter. He could see her perfectly.

She was a woman. Her hair trailed behind her like black ink in water. Her smile never wavered. Her eyes were locked on his, unblinking, thrilled.

Hungry.

Rich turned and tried to swim away, but the water thickened, resisted him. The waves rose black and heavy, shoving him back no matter how hard he kicked. He was moving, but going nowhere.

She laughed.

The sound carried through the water, muffled but sharp, and she surged forward, arms churning, splashing wildly. She wasn’t conserving energy. She didn’t need to. She knew she would reach him.

Rich cried out, choking on seawater. The world beneath him began to shake, not constantly, but in steady pulses. The sea vibrated in a familiar rhythm. One beat. Then another. Over and over.

Twenty feet away.

Her mouth opened wider, the smile splitting, teeth bared like an animal’s. The shaking intensified. The pulses grew stronger, faster, syncing perfectly with the pounding in his chest.

Rich screamed.

The water convulsed.

And then he was upright in bed, more awake than he had ever felt in his life.

“What the fuck was that,” he shouted.

*Me.*

The dream vanished instantly, leaving no soft edges behind. But the rhythm remained.

A faint buzzing filled the room. A vibration, steady and familiar, echoing the pulse from the dream. Sound didn’t linger in this house, but it was never obstructed either.

His phone, he realized.

Still buzzing.

Still calling.

Rich bolted out of bed with sudden, desperate purpose and headed for the phone. He flipped on every light he passed, flooding the hallway and kitchen with harsh yellow pools that did nothing to chase the image of the dark sea still sloshing through his mind. The dream clung to him like wet clothes. His phone continued to buzz, steady and insistent, guiding him forward.

The buzzing stopped the moment he stepped into the living room.

Rich froze.

The fireplace door was wide open.

His phone lay on the mantel directly above it, screen dark now, perfectly still, as if it had never made a sound at all. The black opening of the fireplace yawned beneath it, deep and lightless, swallowing the glow from the room.

Rich felt his stomach drop.

He told himself he was being stupid. Nightmares did that. They blurred things. Air pressure could open doors. Maybe that was why the foam board had been there in the first place. A draft.

He moved slowly, every step careful, listening for anything. Anything at all. The house offered nothing back. No creaks. No settling. No hum of heat or air. Just that dense, padded silence pressing in around him.

When he reached the fireplace he lifted his foot and kicked both glass doors shut without using his hands. They closed with a dull, muffled clack that died instantly. Only then did he grab his phone and step back quickly.

The charging cord ripped free from the phone, the plug snapping back against the wall, but Rich did not look away from the fireplace. He backed up until his calves hit the couch and stopped there, breathing shallowly, waiting.

Nothing happened.

The silence thickened. His heart slowed just enough for him to notice how hard it was to breathe. He forced in a few deep breaths and finally looked down at his phone.

No notifications. No missed calls. No voicemails.

Full bars.

“Ok then,” Rich said out loud, the words brittle and hollow in the air.

The sound vanished immediately. The room swallowed it whole.

He wasn’t sure who he was pretending for. There was no one else here. Just him and the house.

His chest tightened. His hands tingled. He felt like he was breathing too fast and not enough at the same time. Maybe it was a panic attack. He had never had one before, but this felt wrong enough to qualify. He needed to hear another human voice.

Rich called Tony.

Tony picked up on the fifth ring.

“Rich?” Tony said, already annoyed.

“Hey Tony, what’s going on,” Rich said, forcing his voice into something casual.

“Dude, it’s two thirty in the morning. Why are you calling me,” Tony snapped.

The reality of it hit Rich all at once. He suddenly worried how insane he must sound.

“Oh, right, sorry,” Rich said quickly. “I saw I missed a few calls from you and thought I’d check in.”

“At two thirty,” Tony said sarcastically.

Rich scrambled. “Service is bad out here. I thought it might be an emergency.”

“No,” Tony said. He paused. “I called you hours ago. Yesterday, actually. I called you yesterday.”

“Sorry,” Rich said.

His breathing had steadied. The house had not.

There was a long silence on the line.

“So why’d you call me,” Rich asked, needing to fill it.

Tony sighed heavily. “The guy you bought the house from. Yeah. He was insane for sure.”

Rich felt his throat tighten.

“I ran into him a few times,” Tony continued. “Made deliveries to your place back when he owned it. Didn’t recognize the house without all the trees.”

Rich was surprised “Why did you think he was insane,” he asked.

“The guy was convinced someone was talking to him,” Tony said. “Some monster or something, maybe it was the devil, I don’t remember. I think he was schizophrenic. One time he told me his brother wouldn’t talk to him anymore, so to fix it he bought out the store’s entire supply of salt.”

Rich swallowed. “What.”

“Yeah. Every bag we had. Spent thousands. It was December too. We hauled pallet after pallet to your house. Screwed the town over pretty bad. Winter was brutal that year. Guess he thought it would fix things with his brother somehow. My guess is that he doesn’t even have a brother.”

Rich said nothing.

“Anyway, I’m going back to sleep,” Tony muttered.

“Ok” said Rich flatly.

The line went dead.

Rich stood alone in his living room, phone pressed to his ear, surrounded by light that felt thin and useless. The fireplace sat quietly across from him, its doors closed now, reflecting his own face back at him.

The silence pressed in.

Rich could not shake the certainty that somewhere, someone was listening.

His eyes kept drifting back to the fireplace. It no longer looked like part of the room. It felt like a weak point, an exposed seam in a suit of armor that had otherwise held. He did not understand what was happening, or even if anything truly was happening at all, but instinct overruled reason. The foam board had been there for something. If it had kept the dreams away, if it had kept the voice distant, then losing his phone signal felt like a small price to pay.

Rich headed for the garage.

He stopped with his hand on the door handle and listened.

Nothing.

He unlocked the door and opened it just enough to reach inside and flip the light switch. The garage flickered to life, revealing an empty concrete space. No car. No clutter. Just bare walls and oil stained floor. He stepped inside, eyes already searching the center of the room where he was sure he had left the foam board.

It was gone.

His head snapped left and right. His breath quickened. His stomach twisted as panic began to bloom again.

The garage door slammed shut behind him.

The sound exploded through the space, echoing wildly. This room had not been insulated. The noise lingered, bounced, multiplied.

“Fuck,” Rich shouted, the word cracking with fear.

The lights went out.

“What the fuck,” he yelled again, louder now.

“Who’s there.”

He backed away blindly from where he thought the door was, hands outstretched, but the darkness swallowed everything. No edges. No depth. No orientation. He kept stepping back until he hit something solid.

Then nothing.

His hands met only air.

Tears welled in his eyes.

Rich stopped moving.

He listened.

There was nothing.

No footsteps. No breathing. No movement at all.

Moonlight seeped weakly through a small window in the rear garage door, barely enough to suggest shapes. The rest of the room was a void. A blackness so complete it made him think of the sea from his dream. Endless and depthless.

He could hear his heart pounding. He could hear his own sobbing. The sounds died quickly, swallowed the same way everything else did in this house.

It was so dark.

*Rich.*

The word landed softly but perfectly formed.

“Holy fuck,” he screamed, collapsing inward as tears spilled down his face.

“Who are you,” he begged.

*Do you want to see.*

The voice was clear now. The voice was close now.

“No,” Rich shouted. “Please let me go.”

*Come and see me.*

He broke.

His breathing turned frantic, shallow gasps ripping from his chest as he sank to the floor. The black sea surged back into his mind. The pale face. The hunger in her eyes. He could see it more clearly now, forming in the darkness, emerging from the corners of the garage. He rocked back and forth without realizing it, as if caught in a current. The black waves overtaking him again.

Then the noise began.

A violent, grinding roar tore through the air above him. Constant. Mechanical. Unforgiving.

Light flooded the space in jagged pieces.

Rich looked up through blurred vision as the garage door slowly lifted. The ancient motor screamed in protest, the rusted chain rattling as it hauled the heavy door upward inch by inch. Moonlight spilled in, carving the darkness apart.

Then the noise stopped.

Silence returned.

Rich stared out of the open garage.

In the distance, the dollhouse stood alone.

A single light was on in the window. The structure stood in a vast black and grey ocean, glowing like a lighthouse meant to guide something home.

The ringing in Rich’s ears would not stop. His stomach churned. His heart pounded harder than it ever had before.

And the silence pressed in again.

“That’s what they say,” Sarah replied. She flipped open her notebook and clicked her pen. “Let’s lay out a timeline again.”

Sarah and May had lived in this town their entire lives. They went to the same schools, sat through the same church services, made the same friends, and grew up hearing the same stories whispered at sleepovers and repeated at bonfires. One story had always been there, constant and unchanging in spirit if not in detail. The silk leather witch. They had heard it so many times they could almost recite it from memory.

The story shifted depending on who told it. When they were little she lived in a well. When they were in their early teens the well had turned into a house in the woods. Sometimes there was a barn. Sometimes a workshop. Sometimes you were cursed just for looking at it. But everyone agreed on one thing. For the last three hundred years the witch had been kept at bay by salt. People said the town even employed workers whose only job was to make sure the barrier was never broken. But some say that the salt circle is no more.  

“So,” Sarah said, already writing, “early seventeen hundreds. The silk leather witch is caught selling clothes and goods made from the skin of townspeople.”

May smiled faintly. “Super cheap though.”

Sarah wanted to smile but didn’t.  
“Then she was hanged, burned, and thrown into a well,” she said, her pen scratching across the page. “And the town secretly kept watch to make sure she never got out.”

May took a slow sip of her coffee. “Uh huh,” she said, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Right.”

Sarah pressed on. “And then, what, fifteen years ago after everyone had more or less agreed it was just an old urban legend, the town starts hearing about a company that’s routinely pouring salt around a house in the middle of the woods.”

“More like ten years ago I think” May said. “I remember hearing about it for the first time. It scared the hell out of me.”

Sarah opened her mouth to ask another question, but May cut in first.

“Did you ever go out there and kick the salt circle?” May asked, smiling.

“No. Definitely not,” Sarah replied immediately. “Did you?”

“No,” May said, then hesitated. “But I always wanted to see it. I just never worked up the nerve to actually go.”

Sarah nodded, then flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. “Okay. So then the house and a large chunk of the surrounding woods catch fire. No clear cause. Something like a hundred acres burned.”

“My dad is convinced it was the development company,” May said. “He says after twenty years of stalled plans they finally got tired of fighting and decided to clear the land themselves. Figured people would stop defending the woods if there weren’t any left.”

“That feels like a stretch,” Sarah said.

“You’re right,” May replied dryly. “It’s much more reasonable that a witch escaped and burned everything to the ground.”

Sarah rolled her eyes but kept writing. “The house burned down last year, right?”

“Yeah,” May said, her voice quieter this time. “And that’s when Hutch died” She added

“Well,” Sarah said, continuing to write, her pen slowing slightly. “He was never found, but he is presumed dead I think.”

May leaned back and stared into her coffee for a moment. “Who do you think posted his journal online?” she asked. “Do you actually believe it was his?”

Sarah hesitated. The café was quiet enough that the scrape of her pen against the paper sounded louder than it should have. “I honestly have no idea,” she said. “It reads like something someone would fake, but there are parts that feel too specific. Too personal.”

“Like he wasn’t writing for anyone else,” May said softly.

“Exactly,” Sarah replied. “And if someone else found it, why post it at all? Why not turn it over to the police, or the family, or anyone?”

May frowned. “What if it was Murph”.

Sarah stopped writing. “The supervisor guy”

“Yeah” May said. “Think about it. Hutch writes about him a lot. Not in a bad way either. He says Murph respected the town. Respected how hard people fought to keep the woods from getting bulldozed.”

“That doesn’t mean he posted the journal” Sarah said, though she did not sound convinced.

“No but it gives him a motive” May replied. “The company stalls for years. Everyone fights them. Then suddenly the woods burn. The house burns. Hutch disappears. And somehow his journal ends up online.”

Sarah frowned. “You think Murph took it”

“I think Murph might have been the only one who could” May said. “He had access. He knew Hutch was writing everything down. And if the company really did burn the land to force development through…” She trailed off.

“…then posting the journal would be a way to make sure people never forgot” Sarah finished.

“Or a way to make sure no one ever touched that land again” May added. “You read the comments when the journal first went up. People were terrified. Urban explorers started showing up. Forums blew up. The place became a hive of activity.”

Sarah slowly nodded. “Hutch did say Murph respected the townspeople. He understood why people wanted to protect the woods.”

“Exactly” May said. “Burn the land and take Hutch with it, and Murph makes sure the story survives. Not just the fire. Not just the disappearance. The witch. The salt. The house. All of it.”

Sarah looked back down at her notes. “So either Murph exposed everything out of spite” she said, “or he was trying to warn people.”

Sarah wrote down their discussion, but something didn’t sit right with her. The company’s desire to finally clear the land for development was one thing, but including Hutch in the story seemed unnecessary. Maybe he was just an unfortunate byproduct, she thought, but she wasn’t fully convinced.

“Were you able to actually find out who Murph or John were?” Sarah asked.

“Not even close,” May replied.

“Yeah, we might have some luck tracking down Murph, but there’s no way we can figure out who John really was. Hutch never even met him,” Sarah explained.

“Well, he went to meet him at the house at the end of his journal,” May said confidently.

“That wasn’t John, May,” Sarah said firmly.

“What?” May exclaimed. “Then who was it?”

“The witch,” Sarah whispered, leaning in slightly, as if she feared someone might overhear.

“Do you actually believe the witch is real, Sarah?” May asked, her tone skeptical but curious.

“Do you not?” Sarah shot back, her eyes narrowing.

May was taken aback. She had always enjoyed the creepy lore and the folktale atmosphere of the journal, but she believed that Hutch’s story was ultimately about a conspiracy and a company willing to do anything to move forward with their development plans. Meanwhile, Sarah was certain that the witch was real. In her mind, Hutch had been lured to the house by the witch herself, who had taken on the guise of John. She believed he had unknowingly broken the very barrier that had kept the witch dormant for centuries, and that the dark consequences he faced were the result of crossing a force far older and far more malevolent than any human adversary.

“Shall we read through the journal again and highlight any inconsistencies?” Sarah asked, breaking the short, tense silence that had settled between them.

“Why don’t we just go there,” May said sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument.

“Go to the house?” Sarah exclaimed, her eyes wide. “Surely there would be tons of security.”

“Yeah, maybe at the front gate, but I’m not suggesting we go in through the front,” May replied, a spark of determination in her voice.

“Is it still a crime scene?” Sarah asked, hoping the thought of legal trouble might slow May down a little.

“I think this is our logical next step,” May said bluntly. “We’ve gotten nowhere trying to track down the coffee shop he went to, it’s definitely not the one we’re in now” She said in reference to an awkward conversation they had with the barista when the entered the Café “ We have no idea who Murph is, no idea who John is, and we’ve gotten nowhere with the company.”

Sarah hesitated, then added, “We did find that obituary online that listed one of the guys’ professions as a salt tender.”

“That could just mean he laid down salt in the winter, Sarah” May said, shrugging slightly, though her eyes gleamed with purpose. “We should go check it out. No more waiting. It’s time to see it for ourselves.”

They agreed to go to Salt House in person the following day, though the decision settled very differently on Sarah than it did on May. The more Sarah researched the place, the more it felt less like an investigation and more like an invitation she had already accepted without realizing it. Every detail she uncovered seemed to pull her a little closer, as if learning about Salt House was not a passive act but something that noticed her in return. There was an uncomfortable sense that by digging into the story she was not uncovering history, but instead falling for some supernatural bait that was luring her towards a terrible end.

Sarah woke at 2:30 a.m. without warning. There had been no dream, no noise to jolt her awake, just a sudden and complete awareness of the dark. The house was silent in that way only sleeping homes can be, heavy and unmoving. Sleep refused to return. Her thoughts kept circling back to the journal, to Simon Hutchinson’s final entries, to what his last moments might have been like inside that house. The thought lodged itself in her chest and would not let go.

Sarah was twenty, the same age as May, and like May she still lived with her parents. Their house was typical for the area, modest in size but surrounded by land. Nearly forty acres stretched out behind it, dissolving into thick woods that no one really used anymore. She sat up in bed and stared out the rear window, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness.

That was when she saw the light.

It was faint at first, almost easy to dismiss, a pale glow tucked deep among the trees. Her first instinct was to ignore it. There was nothing back there. No roads, no structures, nothing but forest. But the longer she stared, the more the shape resolved itself. The light was not round or scattered like a reflection. It was sharp. Square. A window.

Sarah’s breath caught as the realization settled in. The trees beyond her window did not shift or sway. There was no wind, no rustling leaves, no movement at all. The light did not flicker or pulse. It simply existed, steady and deliberate, as if it had always been there and she was only just now being permitted to notice it. The longer she stared, the more it felt like the light was not illuminating the darkness so much as pressing against it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, the sudden vibration making her flinch.

Hey are you awake.  
The text was from May.

Sarah’s eyes snapped back to the window. The light was gone. The trees were dark again, a solid wall of black. She blinked hard and rubbed her eyes, her heart still pounding. Maybe she had been half asleep. Maybe her mind was filling in shapes that were not really there. She typed back a single word.

Yes.

Her phone rang almost immediately. She answered it without thinking and whispered, “May, everything ok?”

“I’m fine,” May replied, her voice low and tense, matching Sarah’s tone. “I just had the craziest dream.”

Sarah sat very still as May spoke. She described walking through the woods toward a house with only one window lit. Every other window was completely black, like empty sockets, but that one square of light glowed unnaturally bright. In the dream she kept walking closer, step by step, until she was maybe twenty feet away. That was when the light began to flicker. Just faintly at first. Then it went out completely.

May paused for a moment before continuing. She said she stood there staring at the dark window, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Slowly, a shape began to form inside. A silhouette that felt wrong somehow. As if it had been there the entire time, watching her, waiting for her to be close enough to see it.

“And then I woke up,” May said quietly. “It freaked me out so bad I had to call you.”

Sarah swallowed hard. She considered telling May about the light she had seen outside her own window, about how real it had looked, how impossible it was. But the words caught in her throat. Saying it out loud felt like making it real. Instead she forced a small laugh that did not sound convincing even to her.

“Do you think,” Sarah said carefully, “that maybe we should hold off on visiting the house tomorrow?”

There was a brief pause on the line. Then May scoffed.

“Hell no,” she said. “Eight am on the dot. I’ll be there. You’re not going to bail on me, right?”

“No,” Sarah replied, though the word felt heavy. “I’ll be there.”

“You better be,” May said, trying to sound playful. “If you’re not there, I’m going in alone.”

“I’ll be there,” Sarah said again, managing a small smile that May could not see.

They hung up a moment later. Sarah sat in the dark for a long time before finally glancing at her alarm clock. The red numbers glowed softly.

2:42 am.

She lay back down, fully expecting sleep to be impossible, but it came quickly and without warning, like being pulled under water.

When Sarah woke again, sunlight filled her room. She sat up abruptly, a sharp feeling of panic blooming in her chest. Her eyes went straight to the clock.

9:18 am.

For a moment she did not move at all. Then the dread set in, slow and absolute. She was already too late.

Sarah called May again and again while driving toward the site, each unanswered call made her chest feel slightly tighter. She told herself that May had probably been stopped by security or turned around at the gate but that thought died the moment she reached the pull off.

The gates were wide open.

The heavy chain that once sealed them lay coiled in the dirt like something discarded in a hurry. Signs promising future development still hung crookedly from the fencing, their bright colors faded and blistered by heat. Sarah and May had driven past this place more times than either of them could count, always slowing, always staring, never once daring to touch the gate. Now it stood open as if inviting her in.

Sarah drove through.

Trees closed in on her almost immediately, their blackened trunks leaning inward, crowding the road. The air grew thick and gritty, and then just as suddenly the forest fell away. The land opened into a vast hollow, a dead canvas carved out of the woods. Trees stood at the perimeter like a burned audience, while the interior was nothing but ash and ruin. The ground was scorched and uneven, littered with collapsed trunks and charcoal debris. It looked like something had been scooped out of the earth and never put back.

She slowed when she saw the concrete slab.

This had to be it HQ she thought. What remained of it was surrounded by warped piping, cracked ceramic, and half melted fixtures that had resisted the fire longer than everything else. The house came into view beyond it, and Sarah felt her stomach drop.

It was still standing.

The structure looked like it had been dipped in soot. Jet black and skeletal, its walls bowed and uneven, its windows empty. It no longer looked like a house so much as the idea of one, a crooked outline refusing to collapse. Fine particulates hung in the air, and a heavy fog pressed low against the ground, dark and unmoving. It was not even ten in the morning, but the light here felt like ten at night. Even the sun did not wish to visit this place.

May’s car was nowhere to be seen.

Sarah stepped out of her vehicle and immediately began to cough. The air burned her lungs. It was thin and suffocating, like she was breathing at the top of a mountain. Her hand stayed on the open car door as she shouted May’s name. Then screamed it. The sound was swallowed almost instantly, smothered by the fog and the dead space around her.

“May it’s me,” she called, her voice breaking. “It’s Sarah. Are you in there?”

Her mind betrayed her. Images rose of a burned figure twisting in agony. Skin split and blackened. A body that refused to die. Hung. Burned. Thrown screaming into a dry well. Sarah found herself hoping she would hear nothing, more than that she prayed that May had never made it this far.

Then a voice answered.

“Sarah.”

It was faint. Strained. Barely carried on the wind.

Sarah froze.

“May?” she shouted. “Is that you?”

“Yes,” the voice came back. “It’s me, Sarah. It’s May.”

The wind picked up suddenly, whistling through the empty windows of the house, tearing at the fog. The voice grew harder to hear, stretched thin like it was being pulled through something narrow. Tears blurred Sarah’s vision as she shouted again.

“Where are you?”

There was a pause. Just long enough to feel intentional.

“I need help,” the voice said. “I’m stuck.”

Sarah’s blood turned cold.

Stuck.

The word echoed in her head, colliding with the pages of the journal she had read and reread. John had said the same thing. Hutch had written it down. The pattern was far too familiar.

The voice came again, calmer now. Flat. It didn’t sound robotic as much as it sounded rehearsed.

“I fell down the stairs.”

Sarah felt bile rise in her throat.

She could not do this. She could not become the next line in the timeline they had been building. The next name spoken in past tense. Without thinking she slammed the car door shut, hands shaking as she fumbled with the ignition. The engine roared to life and she sped back down the road, gravel spraying behind her.

The wind battered the car as she drove, rocking it hard enough to make her swerve. And over it all, she swore she could hear screaming. Not carried by the wind, but woven into it, stretched and distorted, as if the land itself were crying out.

She did not stop until she reached the main road.

With trembling hands Sarah called May again. No answer. She called again. Still nothing.

Finally Sarah gave up and called the police.

It took days of questioning, though in Sarah’s memory it stretched and felt almost endless, as if time itself had been burned. She sat beneath buzzing fluorescent lights, repeating the same sentences to different faces, trying to explain why she had fled from the sound of her best friend crying out for help. Saying the words out loud made them sound absurd even to her. A witch. An imitation. A voice that was perfect and wrong at the same time. She watched the officers exchange glances, their pens slowing, their questions softening in a way that felt worse than accusation.

They told her they searched the property. Sarah nodded, but she did not believe them. She had been pulled away as soon as they arrived, guided gently but firmly away. never allowed to see what they saw. When she asked if anyone went inside the house, they said a hazmat team entered the following day and found nothing but the burned shell everyone already knew about. No stairs. No body. No sign that anyone had ever called out her name. The answer felt polished.

She spoke to May’s family more times than she could count, sitting at their kitchen table, answering the same questions she asked herself every night. She explained the journal, the research, the house, the theory that now sounded like madness in daylight. A missing persons case was opened, one of many that year, another name added to a growing list. Sarah searched anyway. She organized. She spoke. She drove back roads and hiked tree lines all to no avail. Years passed, but the memory of the last conversation she had with May never dulled. What if it really had been her. What if fear of a story had cost her best friend her own life.

The world continued in the way it always does, indifferent and relentless. Sarah grew older. She had children, May, James and Danny. For a while the past stayed where it belonged. Then, every so often, she would wake at 2:30 in the morning for no reason at all, her heart already racing before her eyes opened. She would sit up in bed and look out into the dark, and somewhere far beyond her yard, beyond the trees, a single square of light would be waiting.

At first she told herself it was exhaustion or stress. But the light never flickered. It never waivered. It simply was and as the years wore on the light took something from Sarah every time she saw it. She felt something inside her thinning, drying out, turning brittle. Memory and guilt and fear hollowed her slowly, patiently, until one morning she realized her mind felt exactly like that house in the woods. Burned hollow. Twisted. Standing only because it had not yet learned how to fall.",1,1770768192.0,u_VnhedoniV,0,1.0,False

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged. 

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements. 

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1770768123.0,u_VnhedoniV,0,1.0,False

Chapter 6

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn’t want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a Saturday afternoon.

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I’d rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I’d take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything. The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn’t quite real.

""You’ve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn’t confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I’ve been in there a million times. It’s just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn’t the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too.

Yes, I had been in the garage, but only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn’t be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn’t who he said he was.

And I don’t know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there’s a witch in the garage. Or there’s a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn’t want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I’d lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad’s head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We’re heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read “3rd Place - Karate.”

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don’t mess with me, man. I’ll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might’ve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father’s footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We’ll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn’t look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper.

I started to speak slowly “Kid, Dad, Mom”

“Witch” Alex cut me off.



Chapter 7

Alex doesn’t sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it’s because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There’s something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything’s fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he’s checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don’t know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag, but I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat.

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn’t sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It’s what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it’s a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed. 

I figured Dad must’ve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles.

“What are you doing up?”

My father’s voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He’d been there the whole time. Watching me walk by. Watching me open the fridge. Watching me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

“Jesus Christ, Dad,” I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

“Sorry, son,” he said gently. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

“I was just... hungry,” I said. “Wanted some pizza.”

“That’s gone,” he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

“Did you eat it?” I asked.

“I just told you, “He said, smile unwavering. “It’s gone. Who else would’ve eaten it?”

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

“The witch in the garage,” I said flatly.

He didn’t move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe.”

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

“Sam,” he began, voice low. “There’s a lot of darkness in this world.”

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

“There are things out there,” he continued, “that are hard to explain. Things that don’t make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.”

He paused.

“But maybe one day you will have to.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

“What are you trying to say?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn’t catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

“Everything I do,” he said, “I do for you and your mother.”

I didn’t know how to respond.

“Okay,” I murmured. What else was there to say?

“I love you, Sam,” he said.

“I love you too, Dad,” I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose.

“Dad,” I said slowly, cautiously, “if I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?”

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

“Yes, Sam,” he said, and this time his voice was grave. “You can ask me a question.”

He emphasized the word ‘A’ as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn’t know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

“Is the witch real?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Yes, Sam,” he said. “The witch is real.”

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

 

Chapter 8

There were so many questions I could have asked him.  
 Do we have a basement?  
 Was there ever someone else in our family?  
 Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

“He said it was real?” Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

“Yeah,” I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Your dad said that? Just like that?”

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. “Anything else happen?”

“Not really,” I said. “Just more nightmares.”

I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn’t even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn’t understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn’t. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him.

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn’t up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

“A kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.” I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. “Hey sweetheart. Everything okay?”

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. “I found this in that old box Dad gave me.”

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. “Aw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.”

I stared at her. “Mom. Why are there two women in the drawing?”

She blinked. “Two?”

I pointed. “There. That one’s you. That one’s Dad. That’s me. who’s she?”

Her face didn’t change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

“Oh, I don’t know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?”

I didn’t respond.

“She looks exactly like you,” I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. “Well, they’re stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?”

She had a point. But it didn’t feel right.

“Is everything okay?” she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

“Have you ever gone through the red door, Mom?” I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. “The red door? In the garage?”

“Yes.”

“Of course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.” She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

“That’s not what I asked.”

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

“I asked,” I said again, “if you’ve ever gone through the red door.”

“Sam, the red door leads to the garage,” she said, her voice suddenly firm.

“Does it?” I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. “So we don’t have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere else?”

“Of course not,” she said quickly. Too quickly.

“Then why are there locks on both sides of it?” I snapped. “Why does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?”

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

“Sam...” she whispered. “Please, stop. You’re scaring me.”

“No,” I said. “Dad is the one who’s scaring me. I know he’s hiding something. I know you are too.”

She stepped forward and reached out. “Sweetheart, you’re not well. Maybe it’s just the nightmares, or stress, or”

“I’m not crazy,” I hissed. “You’re just good at pretending.”

“Sam, please,” she said, her voice trembling. “You need help. You’re saying things that aren’t real.”

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn’t name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling.  
 And I didn’t know who she was.  
 But she looked a lot like my mother.

 

Chapter 9

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up.

“Wait, what? No, no, no, what happened?” she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might’ve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

“Mom?” I asked, my voice thin. “What’s going on?”

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

“There’s been an accident,” she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn’t know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung together thoughts between panicked breaths.

“Your father was in a car crash,” she said. “They said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He’s at the hospital.”

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I’d been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently.

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He’d been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad… Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma “for his own safety,” the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise, soft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I’d slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn’t want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn’t move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I’d had with Dad. The only honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn’t understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again.

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red.

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still Dad. Not broken. Just… still.

“John” my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by.

 felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn’t supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad’s bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn’t watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn’t see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

“Hey, Mom,” I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

“Yes, Hun?” she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn’t touch her eyes.

“Could I, could I get some water or something?” I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. “Maybe step outside for a minute. Just… some air.”

She nodded without hesitation. “Of course. That’s probably a good idea,” she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. “Go ahead. I’ll be right here.”

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital branded coffee cup.

“Hi,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Is Mrs. Pierce working tonight?”

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex’s mom.

“Oh, Sam,” she said, walking up with open arms, “I heard what happened. I’m so, so sorry, sweetheart.”

Her hug was warm, but I didn’t feel it.

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

“Your dad’s strong and Glen Haven hospital’s one of the best in the State. The doctors here…” she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, “they’re basically wizards, you know?”

“Or witches,” I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

“Could you give me a ride home” I asked.

 

Chapter 10

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn’t try to talk much, and I couldn’t have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn’t lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie.

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father’s key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I’d open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father’s dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room… was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That’s when I heard it.

“Hello…” came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

“Hello?” I answered, my voice shaking.

“Who's there?” the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

“S-Sam,” I said, barely able to get the word out.

“Will you help me, Sam?”

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

“So you're real,” I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. “There really is a witch...”

The voice whimpered. “I'm not a witch, Sam.” She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. “I'm a prisoner.”

I couldn’t speak. My hands were shaking violently.

“Your father… he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.”

“Who are you?” I finally managed to ask.

“My name is Anne” the voice said. “I’m Danny’s mother.”

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny’s mother. The one who’d disappeared. The one they said ran away. The one Danny never talked about.

“Wait here,” I said, voice cracking. “I’m going to call the police. I’m going to call Danny.”

“No, wait,” she pleaded. “Sometimes… sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he’s feeling merciful. It’s already tied. Please, just drop it down. I’ve been down here far too long.”

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

“I’ll be right back,” I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

“Hello?” Danny answered.

“Danny, it’s Sam,” I gasped, tears flooding my face.

“Oh hey, man, what’s up?”

“I found her,” I cried. “Your mom. She didn’t leave. She didn’t run away. She’s here, Danny. She told me, her name is Anne right. She’s been under my house this whole time.”

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny spoke.

“Sam… my mom’s name is Sarah” he paused “and she’s in rehab.”

“No. No, she’s not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared”

“She did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She’s getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.”

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs… in the dark… a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone…  something was climbing up.",1,1770767681.0,u_VnhedoniV,0,1.0,False
1r1hj4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1r1hj4h/this_is_how_i_unmasked_this_crazy_colleague/,This is how I unmasked this crazy colleague,"I'm a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a 50-year-old woman colleague who was four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We were talking, going to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me home-cooked food, because she knew I liked to eat well. Sometimes she would offer me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister I found. Sometimes she had childish behaviors with me, for example one day she ran up to me to talk to me, like a child, and then she teased me during a discussion. Whenever a meal was organized at work for a party, she insisted that I attend, because I don't like meetings between colleagues. Then it became colder and more distant. Sometimes she would come and ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to do some shopping. She often offered outings with the children, but I systematically refused, because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I experienced very badly. For several months, I didn't talk to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult time. The colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and simply said, ""I have a lot of work to do,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her on the subway, and she came to see me, offering to travel together. She had a behavior that I would describe as flirting (she would get very close to me, stick her chest against my arm, lean very close to talk to me). One day, she even walked into my office to look at something on my screen and stuck very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.

I then found another job in another office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me on my last day and told me that she was inviting him to lunch that day. On D-Day, she invited me and asked me if she had done something wrong, why I didn't talk to her anymore. I explained to him that I had been harassed and that I had been looking for another job, which I had found. She warmly congratulated me, praising the fact that I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""drole"" etc. She was relieved that my distant attitude did not come from her. She then continued to engage in flirting gestures, such as touching my hand furtially with her index finger while she ate.

I then told him that, since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with children and spouses (perhaps this was a mistake on my part!). Ravie seemed very excited when I contacted her offering her an outing with the children, but I noticed that she did not warn her husband when we met. That's why I then proposed family outings with the spouses. She accepted and organized several outings during the summer, and we met regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my kids and didn't warn her, she would point out to me, ""You didn't call me, it's not nice."" Yet she did it on her side, but frankly, I didn't care. She offered small dishes and snacks, prepared pic-nics. He always seemed very motivated. She also began to criticize her husband, saying that he doesn't invest himself, that he just stays drinking coffee at home, that he is old. When I asked her about the context of their meeting, she told me that he was the one who flirted with her and that she was not interested at first, because he was unemployed at the time. Anyway, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series from her and put them on a USB stick, something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, his behavior changed. She became silent, distant, not talking as usual. We felt that she was away from him. On the contrary, he seemed very much in love.

She promised to show me a recipe. I had proposed that she come home with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal in groups. But one day after an outing with her son and my son, without the spouses exceptionally, she said, ""We'll meet at your house for the recipe. Okay, when I got home, I thought we were going to talk over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking by herself, washing dishes, without saying anything. Very weird. Then she says ""the meal is ready, I have to go now"" and then she left without even talking. It was really, in my opinion, a strange scene.

She had planned to travel to Spain with her family and I told her that I knew this country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family.

She started by organizing outings with both families herself, booked hotels, offered hikes. Barbecues and home meals. She even wanted our two families to go out with the children, like at the pool, etc. She even wanted to go together to a foreign country, and to a cottage in the mountains. She also offered to organize a women's outing between her and my mother at a spa. Then, after a dozen intense outings and several invitations to dinner at each other's house, she stopped giving news. All of a sudden. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot, etc. One day her husband was supposed to help me set up a piece of furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on D-Day, he made me look bad. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up by car, he told me in the car during the ride ""if she wants us to part, no problem."" I didn't understand this intervention.

Then, no more news... I wrote to her several times to find out if everything was okay, and she answered me briefly. I then sent my New Year's greetings to her husband, unanswered. She promised to give me contacts from renovation companies, which she never did.

I then confronted her by text message several months later, without news... I asked her why we disappeared and why she didn't give me the promised information about the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote to him: ""You two disappeared without giving us the promised contacts, you are profiteers."" Then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then said something like, ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and then concluded, ""This is where our relationship ends.""",1,1770767668.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

I’ve only been in one good serious relationship two years ago but I want to be in love and feel close to someone I’m attracted to again. I’ve been dating on hinge and meeting guys in public and I’ve recently had a few dates with a few different guys that I like, but there was something I wasn’t into about each of the guys I was seeing so I broke it off or it fizzled out. (One guy was sort of racist and conservative and another guy just wasn’t that sexually attractive to me). The other day I met this guy, M27, in a cafe. We made really intense eye contact and then I went up to him and we started chatting. He seemed to be really into me so I gave him my number, and he immediately texted me saying it was good to meet me and added a heart. We ended up hanging out at a bar few days later and we talked for hours and we both seemed to be having so much fun getting to know each other, we liked the same weird directors and talked about our crazy dreams and stuff that felt so intimate and interesting. I wasn’t planning on sleeping with him because I wanted to make sure I trusted him first (and of course I didn’t want him to ditch me after we fucked), but I liked him so much that I decided we should just go for it anyway. He came over and we had sex and it was amazing. Afterwards he held me and told me thought I was so lovely. I mentioned a party I was having and he seemed interested so I invited him and he said he would come. He said he wanted to hang out again very soon. I suggested we hang out Tuesday but he said he would be busy, then he was going away for the weekend but we should hang after he got back. Then he went home and I felt so happy.

Then on Tuesday, I went to do some work in a cafe, and he came in. I waved at him, and he awkwardly said hi to me and another girl in the cafe. I tried to chat but he took his coffee and drank it outside even though it’s winter and freezing. Then he left. I started chatting with the other girl and she told me she was sorry he was rude to me, and that he had been flirting with her a few weeks ago. I was upset cause I didn’t think he was playing me after the way he talked to me. Is this an instance of him ditching me after sex cause he got what he wanted from me? If so, why would he make all those promises to me, and is there anything I could have done different to avoid this situation?",2,1770767464.0,relationship_advice,12,0.57,False

I would like to take a moment to introduce my new daily driver: a late-’80s Bialetti Kitty Oro, lightly gold-plated stainless with a brass handle and knob — probably made between 1986 (first year of the kitty) and 1989 (last year of the Oro). It’s classy, sturdy, and built to last.

Coffee has always been a big deal in my life. My stepfather, who was born and raised in Roma taught me the art of brewing. He’s got a collection that includes Bialetti, Pezzeti, Alessi, De'Longhi, even electric pots, but I’m a Bialetti purist through and through.

My first personal moka pot was a Bialetti Venus (induction stoves don't judge me) which was unfortunately taken by an ex. Since then, I’ve mastered my brewing techniques over a Bialetti Mini Express — on ANOTHER induction stove which is stuck broken on the highest setting— so I know how to get a great cup even under tricky circumstances.

Now, this Kitty Oro is my go-to. It’s my daily driver, my little slice of Italian tradition, and a reminder that even a simple moka pot can be part of a ritual worth savoring. I finally feel worthy of a piece of equipment like this and hope to one day pass it on to my children... After 10,000 espresso!

So I've had a Barista Express for a while (was still living at my parents), I recently got married and bought the Barista Pro and after joining this group, I started becoming obsessed with making coffee and realised how horrible the grinder design is on the Barista Pro (kinda regret buying it now). 

Today, the Starseeker E55 Pro has arrived and I'm yet to dial it in. But I did do a test grind and the retention is spot on.

The Mrs has always wanted the La Marzocco Mini but it's way out of our budget. But that's the next upgrade for sure.

Happy brewing guys! ",2,1770767208.0,espresso,6,0.67,False

I’ve been a woman in tech for over 8 years. I know this industry, and I know the men in it. Watching software engineering jobs collapse and big tech lay off engineers just confirms what I’ve always thought tech bros are gigantic, submissive cuckolds. Day in and day out at work, I saw them for what they were cuckolds pretending to be alphas. Now, seeing what’s happening to their job market? That’s just a taste of their own medicine.

I was bullied and harassed at work. Men subjected me to sexist jokes and told me I was just a less intelligent woman who had no place working with computers and code. I burned out and changed my career path because of that toxic environment. Thanks for that.

Watching this ship sink seeing these supposedly high iq engineers with 10 or 15 years of experience who can’t find a job, who have to grind leet vode and go through 5 round interviews competing with thousands of others is the best possible humbling. 

Haha, I love how fast things are changing. I love that these cuckolds created the very tools that are killing their own jobs and profession all because they’re so self centered and money oriented that it never crossed their minds AI would turn around and lay off them and their colleagues.
I’ve always thought of these startup tech bros as nasty, toxic, selfcentered people whose ultimate goal is money to spend on hookers and luxury cars just to compensate for their small personalities.

I truly believe men in tech are unbelievably submissive cucks. I’ve watched them cheer for the competition and the rat race. They cheered when Musk laid off Twitter engineers. I saw videos of women who used to do nothing but drink coffee and make content and all those toxic, entitled tech bros clapping for his decision to gut the company.

I’ll always see tech bros as unmanly men cuckold beta males who pretend to be smart. You’ve got these engineers with IQs through the roof who can break down complex algorithms, math, and AI, but they have zero social intelligence or EQ. It’s proof of a stunning stupidity. How does someone with a 200 iq end up jobless because they were too self centered, arrogant, and naive to realize capitalism isn’t their friend?

Even now, when the layoffs hit, these tech cuckolds do nothing. They’re submissive males. Fake males. Mostly young, conservative guys who think a big paycheck makes them manly and valuable.

If you dig deeper and look at cause and effect, you’ll see it clearly. The standard of living in the 80s meant one working person could support a family, buy a house, and provide. Then tech progressed  tech jobs boomed, and everything started to rot. Young men stopped creating real value building houses, doing physical work and instead took virtual, invisible jobs that added nothing to society. They got paid fortunes but produced nothing of real value for ordinary people, just driving up inflation and making life more expensive for everyone else.

I’m optimistic. I want to see tech jobs collapse and people run from this industry because people shouldn’t serve evil tech companies, men in their prime should stop wasting their lives in front of screens creating useless virtual crap and go do normal work that actually adds value.

Birth rates will go up. More relationships will form. Women will finally have access to real, manly, valuable men who work jobs that care for society and the greater good instead of men who produce nothing but useless digital garbage.

1r1h57w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r1h57w/i_went_exploring_a_fire_lookout_tower_the_woods/,I Went Exploring a Fire Lookout Tower. The Woods Didn’t Let Me Leave Cleanly.,"I went out there because I needed one day where nothing could reach me.

No emails. No neighbors. No family group chat lighting up my phone with one more “Did you see this?” link. Just a stretch of winter-bare hardwoods and the kind of quiet you only get when the nearest road is a couple miles away and even the birds don’t feel like talking.

That’s what I told myself, anyway.

The truth is I’d been sleeping like garbage. When I did sleep, it wasn’t restful. It was the kind where you wake up with your jaw clenched and you can’t remember the dream, only the feeling of something pushing on your chest. I wasn’t looking for adventure. I wasn’t looking for a story.

I was looking for the opposite—something ordinary enough to scrub my head clean.

I parked at a pull-off that looked like it existed more for logging trucks than hikers. No sign, no kiosk, no laminated “Trail Rules” poster stapled to a post. Just a narrow path starting between two pines and a strip of packed earth where other boots had gone before mine.

I had water, a small first aid kit, a cheap headlamp even though it was mid-afternoon, and a can of bear spray I’d bought the year before and never opened. I’d meant to take it on a trip out west. It ended up living in my glove compartment like a talisman.

I checked the wind out of habit—cold and light—and started in.

The woods were the kind that felt normal at first. Damp leaves underfoot. Bark peeling on dead trunks. A thin crust of snow tucked into shaded pockets like it didn’t want to let go yet. I could hear my own breathing, the quiet creak of my backpack straps, and the occasional distant crack of a branch from something moving far off.

Thirty minutes in, I began to relax. I fell into the rhythm of walking and not thinking too hard.

Then I saw the tower.

It didn’t belong to a marked trail system. It sat on a ridge line, barely visible through the trees at first—just a vertical line that made my brain pause, trying to categorize it. Once I stepped into a break in the canopy, it was obvious.

An old fire lookout tower, the steel kind with a square cab at the top. It rose above the surrounding trees like a skeleton. The legs were rusted. The cross-bracing had patches where metal had been eaten down to flaky orange scabs. The stairs ran up the side in a tight switchback, and a few steps were missing entirely, like teeth knocked out.

My first thought was that I’d wandered onto private land. My second thought was that it was too far back and too neglected for that.

I stopped at the base, craned my neck.

The cab windows were grimy. One was cracked. The door up top looked like it hung slightly open, the edge not sitting flush.

There was no posted sign. No “DANGER” placard. No padlock on the lower gate because there was no lower gate. Just the first set of stairs, inviting in the worst way.

I should’ve turned around right there.

I knew that.

I told myself I’d just take a quick look from the bottom. Just satisfy the curiosity and go. My phone didn’t have service, so I couldn’t even call anyone if I wanted to. That should’ve been a bigger red flag.

But the tower had that pull old places have. The sense of a story trapped inside them.

I started up.

Every step made a sound—metal whining under my weight, bolts complaining. The handrail was cold enough to sting through my glove. I took it slow, testing each step before I committed. Some were solid. Some flexed just enough to make my stomach tighten.

Halfway up, I smelled something faint but wrong. Not rot, not mold. Something like pennies. Like wet iron.

I paused and tried to place it. The wind shifted, and it went away.

At the next landing, I looked down through the open grid and saw my boot prints on the lower steps. They stood out in the thin film of frost. I told myself, again, this was stupid. I could leave now.

Then I saw something on the landing above me.

A dark smear.

It wasn’t rust. Rust had a powdery texture. This looked wet and thick in the shadow.

My hand tightened on the rail. I climbed two more flights, careful, and leaned in close to the smear.

Blood.

It wasn’t fresh-fresh, but it wasn’t old either. It had the glossy, tacky look of something that had started to dry but hadn’t had time to go brown and crust. It was streaked like something had been dragged, or like someone had put their hand there and slid it along the metal.

I went cold in a way the air didn’t explain.

My brain did what brains do when they don’t want to accept something: it tried to find another answer.

Deer hit by a hunter, maybe. Someone gutted something up here. Some idiot doing a horror prank. Paint.

But blood looks like blood. It sits in the light differently.

I stared up toward the cab.

The door was definitely ajar.

There was a small gust of wind, and the door moved. Not a lot. Just a slight sway, like it was breathing.

I forced myself to keep climbing. Not because I wanted to go farther—because the part of me that couldn’t stand not knowing needed one more piece of information. One quick glance. Then I’d leave and call it in once I got service.

At the final flight, the smell hit me again, stronger. Metallic and sharp, mixed with something sour.

I stepped onto the platform outside the cab and froze.

The cab was trashed.

Not in the way abandoned places get trashed over years. Not graffiti and beer cans and sun-faded posters. This was… recent. Violent.

One chair was overturned. A clipboard lay snapped in half, papers fluttering under it. A small table had been shoved hard enough to dent the wall. One of the windows had a spiderweb crack radiating from a central impact point. On the floor, there were dark spots and smears that dragged toward the cracked window like someone had tried to crawl.

There was a trail. Not a neat line—more like a story written in blotches.

Blood leading to the window.

The window itself was half open, shoved upward, leaving a gap wide enough to squeeze through if you were desperate. The sill had scratches in the grime—fresh lines where fingers or something else had clawed for purchase.

I didn’t step inside.

I didn’t touch anything.

I stood on the platform, staring, with my heart thudding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

A thought landed in my head with awful clarity:

Someone didn’t leave through the stairs.

Someone went out the window.

That didn’t make sense. The drop from this height wasn’t survivable. Not without breaking something. Not without… it being the only option.

I backed away from the open doorway, the metal platform cold under my boots.

That was it. Curiosity satisfied. Whatever this was, it wasn’t mine to solve.

I turned and started down.

I made it two flights before I realized how quiet it had gotten.

Not “nice quiet.” Not “woods in winter quiet.”

Wrong quiet.

No little clicks of squirrel claws on bark. No distant woodpecker. No wind moving through branches. It was like the air itself had stopped carrying sound.

I paused on a landing, gripping the rail, and listened.

Nothing.

I told myself I was spooking myself. Adrenaline does that. It narrows your focus. Makes the world feel staged.

Then I heard a soft sound from below.

A single, gentle tap on metal.

I leaned over the edge and looked down toward the base of the tower.

Something stood in the trees.

At first, my brain said deer. It was the right shape. Tan body. Long legs. Narrow head.

But it wasn’t standing like a deer.

It was standing too still, like it was holding a pose.

And it was too close to the tower to have approached without me hearing it, unless it had been there the whole time.

It looked up.

Our eyes met.

That’s the moment I noticed the legs.

Deer legs have a certain angle, a certain logic. These bent wrong, the joints set just a little off, like someone had built them from memory without understanding the mechanics. The knees—if you could call them that—seemed rotated, the way a human elbow would look if you forced it backward.

Its head tilted.

The movement was slow and deliberate, like it wanted to show me it was paying attention.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t wave. I didn’t shout. I didn’t do anything.

The deer—if it was a deer—took one step out of the trees, placing its hoof on the edge of the clearing around the tower.

The hoof was wrong too.

Not split the way a deer’s should be. It looked… more solid. Like a blunt shoe.

Then, just like that, it took another step, and another, until it was standing at the base, directly below me.

Looking up.

My mouth went dry.

My hands were sweating inside my gloves, and the metal rail felt slick.

I told myself it was just an injured deer. A deer with some deformity. A deer that had been hit, maybe. My brain clawed for normal explanations like it could anchor itself.

But there was nothing normal about the way it watched me.

It didn’t blink.

I realized then that I could see too much white.

Not the sclera—deer don’t show whites like humans.

This was… milky.

The eyes were cloudy, like cataracts, but still locked on me.

I started down again, faster. Not running—running would get me killed on these stairs—but moving with purpose.

The tower groaned under me.

Below, the deer moved.

I heard it on the steps.

That made my stomach drop. I hadn’t thought it would climb.

The sound wasn’t the light clatter of hooves the way you hear in videos of deer on porches. This was heavier. Thud, thud. Like something wearing weight.

I looked down again.

It was on the first landing, already.

It shouldn’t have been that fast.

My headlamp bounced against my chest. My bear spray was in the side pocket of my pack. I reached for it without taking my eyes off the stairs, fingers fumbling for the zipper.

The sound of it climbing came closer.

Thud.

Thud.

Metal squealed.

I went down another flight, then another, hands sliding on the rail, boots careful but quick.

I made it to a landing where the railing was bent outward, and I had to step around it. For a second, my balance shifted and panic surged—one wrong move and I’d go through the side.

Behind me, the climbing stopped.

I didn’t feel relief. I felt dread. The stop was worse than the pursuit.

I forced myself to look up.

It stood three landings above me.

Close enough that I could see details I didn’t want to see.

The head was… deer-shaped, but not quite. The muzzle looked slightly too long, and the skin around it had a tight, stretched look, as if the face was pulled over bone that didn’t match.

Its mouth hung slightly open, and the teeth were wrong—too even, too flat, more like a person’s than a deer’s.

It stared down at me.

Then it moved its jaw.

Not chewing. Not panting.

Shaping something.

A sound came out—soft at first, then clearer.

“Hey.”

It wasn’t a perfect voice. It was like a bad recording. Like someone mimicking speech without knowing where the sounds came from. The word came out too slow, too wet.

My whole body reacted before my mind did. My legs wanted to fold. My hands tightened until my knuckles hurt.

The thing’s head tilted again, exaggerated.

“Hey,” it said again, a little better.

I backed down one more flight, fighting the urge to turn and run.

That’s when it took another step.

And another.

It wasn’t rushing. It wasn’t panicking. It was matching me. Herding me.

I got the bear spray out of my pack. My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it. I held it in front of me, thumb over the safety.

“Back off,” I said, and hated how thin my voice sounded.

The deer blinked once, slow.

Then it smiled.

Or tried to.

The lips pulled back too far, exposing those flat teeth. The expression didn’t fit on a deer face. It looked like a mask trying to do a human thing.

“Back off,” it repeated, and my blood went cold because it said it in my exact cadence, my exact pitch, like it had just recorded me and played it back through a mouth built wrong.

I felt something inside me snap from disbelief to survival.

I started moving down faster, almost slipping.

The deer followed.

It didn’t need to run. It climbed with that same heavy, confident pace, the metal stairs groaning under it.

I could see my car in my mind like a lifeline, even though it was probably twenty minutes back through the woods. I just had to get off the tower. Just get away from the stairs. Stairs were a funnel. A trap.

I hit the last flight and practically slid down. My boots hit the ground hard enough to jar my knees.

The air down here felt different, warmer, like I’d stepped into a pocket. My ears rang with my own pulse.

I didn’t look back.

I ran.

Not full sprint at first because the ground was uneven and slick with leaves, but fast enough that my breath burned.

Behind me, the tower groaned, then a heavier metallic clank as the thing descended faster.

I ran toward the trail, following my own footprints in the thin frost.

The woods looked the same as before, but now everything felt staged. Trees too close. Shadows too thick. Every branch like it could snag me.

I heard something behind me—footsteps.

Not the light, delicate steps of a deer.

Two beats. Then a pause. Then two beats again.

Like someone trying to walk like an animal.

I risked a glance over my shoulder.

It was behind me, weaving through the trees.

Still shaped like a deer.

But moving wrong.

It didn’t bound like a deer. It didn’t float over the underbrush. It stepped with intention, lifting its legs too high, placing them down too carefully.

And it was watching me the whole time.

Its head stayed turned toward me even as its body angled forward, like an owl.

I ran harder.

My lungs burned. The cold air cut my throat. I could taste that metallic smell again, like it was following on the wind.

The trail dipped, and I had to hop over a downed log. My foot caught on a slick patch of moss and I stumbled, catching myself on a sapling.

Pain flared in my palm where a branch jabbed through my glove. I barely noticed.

I kept going.

The footsteps behind me sped up.

Not running. Not galloping.

Just… closing the distance with calm certainty.

I fumbled the bear spray in my hand. The can felt small. Useless. Like bringing a lighter to a house fire.

I came around a bend and saw a split in the trail—one path wider and more used, one narrow and overgrown. I didn’t remember it being there. I didn’t remember seeing a split on the way in.

I hesitated for half a second, then took the wider path because it felt more likely to lead back to the parking pull-off.

The moment my boot hit that path, the woods changed again.

Not visually. Not in some magical way.

Just in the way the air sat.

It felt heavier.

And the silence got worse.

The footsteps stopped.

I slowed, heart hammering.

I looked back down the trail.

Nothing.

No deer. No movement.

Only trees.

My relief lasted about two seconds.

Because then I heard it.

A breath.

Right behind my ear.

I spun.

It wasn’t behind me. It was to my right, just off the trail, half-hidden behind a maple.

So close I could see the wet shine of its nostrils.

Its eyes were clearer up close, and that was worse. They weren’t cloudy.

They were human.

Not shaped like a human’s, but the focus in them was human. The awareness. The intent.

It leaned forward slightly, like it was curious.

“Hey,” it said again, softer.

My body moved before my brain gave it permission. I raised the bear spray and hit the trigger.

A stream of orange mist blasted into its face.

The not-deer jerked back, head snapping upward, and it made a sound that wasn’t a deer sound. Not a bleat. Not a snort.

A wet, broken scream.

It stumbled, claws—because now I saw they were claws, not hooves—scraping bark as it tried to get away from the spray.

The smell of pepper hit my own nose, and my eyes watered instantly. My throat seized. I coughed, choking on it.

The not-deer thrashed, and for a second it stood upright.

Not fully. Not comfortably. But enough.

Enough that I saw the front legs bend and straighten like arms.

Enough that I saw the chest was wrong, too broad, with a suggestion of ribs under stretched hide.

Enough that my brain screamed: this thing can do more than you think.

It dropped back down on all fours with a jolt and took off into the trees, crashing through branches, still screaming, the sound fading into the distance.

I stood there shaking, bear spray can still hissing as I kept the trigger pressed out of pure panic.

When I realized it was gone, I let go and the can went quiet.

My lungs burned. My eyes stung. Snot ran down my face. I wiped it with my sleeve, smearing it across my cheek.

I didn’t feel safe.

I felt like I’d just made it angry.

I forced myself to move.

The trail ahead looked normal again. The wider path continued through the trees.

I started walking fast, then jogging, then breaking into a run whenever the ground allowed. I kept the bear spray in my hand with the safety off, thumb ready.

Every sound made me flinch.

A branch snapping. Leaves shifting. The distant call of something that might’ve been a bird.

I kept expecting it to hit me from the side.

I kept expecting that wet “Hey” in my ear again.

Ten minutes passed. Then fifteen. My legs started to ache. My lungs felt raw.

I began to see light through the trees—the suggestion of a clearing.

Hope flared so hard it made me dizzy.

Then my foot snagged.

It wasn’t a root. It wasn’t a rock.

It was something looped around my ankle.

I went down hard.

My knee slammed into a buried stone, sending a bolt of pain up my leg. My palms hit the ground, the bear spray can skittering out of my hand and landing in dead leaves.

I rolled over, gasping, and saw it.

A length of braided cord—thin, but strong—pulled taut between two saplings.

A trip line.

Someone had set it.

Or something.

I scrabbled for the bear spray.

A shadow moved at the edge of the trees.

The not-deer stepped into view.

It wasn’t charging. It wasn’t rushing.

It was walking like it had all the time in the world.

Its face was streaked wet, and its eyes were narrowed now. Not in pain. In focus. Like the spray had sharpened it.

It stopped a few yards away and stared at me.

I grabbed the bear spray, got the nozzle up, and tried to stand.

My injured knee buckled, and I went down again with a strangled sound. Pain pulsed through the joint. Something in there felt wrong—twisted.

The not-deer took one step closer.

My thumb hit the trigger.

The can sputtered.

The stream was weak, the can nearly empty.

Panic surged so hard it made my vision tunnel.

The not-deer tilted its head and opened its mouth.

This time, it didn’t say “Hey.”

It said my name.

Not perfectly. Not cleanly. But close enough that my stomach dropped into my boots.

It had heard me earlier, probably talking to myself, probably muttering under my breath like I always do when I hike alone.

It said it like it was testing it.

I screamed at it—some incoherent noise—and hit the trigger again.

A last weak puff drifted out.

The not-deer flinched back, not from the spray, but from my scream, like it hadn’t expected real emotion.

Then it lunged.

It moved so fast I didn’t even process it as motion. One second it was yards away, the next it was on me.

Its weight hit my chest, knocking the air out of me. I felt its claws rake across my jacket, tearing fabric. One caught my forearm and sliced through layers like they were paper.

Hot pain flashed, immediate and sharp.

I twisted, trying to get it off me, and its face came inches from mine.

It smelled like wet fur and old pennies and something spoiled.

Its mouth opened too wide.

And inside, behind those flat teeth, I saw a second set—smaller, pointed, like something that had no business being in a deer.

I jammed the bear spray can into its mouth on instinct.

It bit down.

The can crunched.

For a second, it held there, teeth sunk into metal, eyes locked on me.

Then it jerked its head, yanking my arm with it, and the claws dug into my shoulder.

I felt something pop in my shoulder—pain exploding—and I screamed.

My mind went blank except for one thing:

Get up. Get up. Get up.

My hand flailed around in the leaves and found a rock. Not a big one. Just big enough.

I swung it up and slammed it into the side of the not-deer’s head.

Once.

Twice.

The third hit landed with a dull, awful thud, and the not-deer’s grip loosened.

It reeled back, still straddling my chest, and made that broken scream again—quieter, angrier.

I rolled out from under it and tried to stand, using my good leg.

My bad knee screamed at me. My shoulder felt like it was hanging wrong. Blood ran down my forearm, warm and slippery, soaking my glove.

The not-deer shook its head, then looked at me again with that calm focus.

It wasn’t done.

It wasn’t scared.

It was assessing.

Like it was deciding whether the meal was worth the fight.

I backed away, limping, eyes scanning for anything—anything—I could use.

My gaze landed on a fallen branch, thick and heavy like a crude club. I grabbed it with my good hand, lifting it between us.

The not-deer stepped forward.

I swung.

The branch connected with its shoulder, and it stumbled, more from surprise than pain.

I swung again, catching it across the muzzle.

It snapped its head sideways and bit into the branch. The wood cracked under its teeth.

It yanked hard.

I held on, and my injured shoulder screamed, but I didn’t let go.

The not-deer pulled, dragging me forward.

Then it did something that made my stomach flip.

It stood again.

Not upright like a person, but close enough. The front legs bent and straightened as it pulled the branch closer, and its chest rose like it had lungs built for something else.

It leaned its face toward mine.

And spoke in a voice that was almost mine.

“Stop.”

The word came out clean.

Like it had finally figured it out.

I shook my head, tears streaming from pain and pepper spray residue and sheer terror.

“No,” I rasped, and yanked the branch back with everything I had.

The not-deer’s grip slipped.

I used the momentum to stumble backward, then turned and ran—limped, really—toward the clearing I’d seen earlier.

My vision blurred. The world narrowed to light and the sound of my own ragged breath.

Behind me, I heard it follow.

Not rushing.

Keeping pace.

I burst through the trees into the clearing, and the sudden openness made me almost collapse with relief.

My car was there.

Parked crooked in the pull-off like I’d left it.

I almost sobbed.

I fumbled for my keys with shaking hands, nearly dropping them. My blood slicked the metal. I got the key into the door, yanked it open, and practically fell into the driver’s seat.

I slammed the door and locked it.

My hands shook so badly I fumbled the ignition.

Outside, the not-deer stepped into the clearing.

It stopped a few feet from the car and stared at me through the windshield.

In the open light, it looked even more wrong. The proportions were off. The legs too long. The neck too thick. The head slightly too big.

It lifted its muzzle and pressed it to the glass.

I held my breath, frozen, expecting the glass to shatter.

It didn’t.

It just stared.

Then it opened its mouth.

“Hey,” it said softly, like a greeting between friends.

I turned the key. The engine coughed, then roared to life.

The not-deer flinched at the sound.

I threw the car into reverse and backed out so fast the tires spun on gravel, throwing stones.

The not-deer moved, but not to chase.

It stepped back and watched.

Watched as I spun the car around, watched as I hit the road too hard, watched as the trees swallowed it again in my rearview mirror.

I didn’t stop driving until my hands started cramping around the steering wheel.

I didn’t stop until I hit a patch of road where my phone buzzed with service.

I pulled over so hard I nearly went into the ditch.

My hands were shaking so badly I almost couldn’t dial 911.

When the operator answered, I tried to speak and realized I was crying.

I gave them the location as best I could. I told them about the tower. The blood. The struggle. I told them something attacked me. I didn’t say “not-deer.” I didn’t say “it spoke.”

I said “an animal” because I wanted them to come, and I didn’t want to sound like the kind of person they ignore.

An ambulance met me ten minutes later at a gas station off the highway. I sat on the curb while a paramedic wrapped my forearm. The cuts weren’t deep enough to hit tendon, but they bled like crazy. My knee was swelling fast, and my shoulder was… wrong. They immobilized it, asked me what happened.

I told them I didn’t know.

That was true, in a way.

A sheriff’s deputy showed up while they were loading me into the ambulance. He asked for details, wrote things down. His eyes flicked to the bear spray can sitting on my passenger seat, crushed and dented.

He asked why it was crushed.

I said it got bitten.

He stared at me for a long second, then nodded like he’d heard worse.

At the hospital, they cleaned me up, stitched the deeper cut on my forearm, confirmed my shoulder was partially dislocated, confirmed I’d sprained my knee badly. Nothing life-threatening. Just enough to make sure I’d remember it every time I reached for something on a high shelf or stepped off a curb wrong.

I gave my statement again.

The deputy asked if I’d seen another person out there.

I told him no, but I told him about the blood in the tower and the trail leading to the window. I told him I thought someone might’ve been hurt.

He left, said they’d check it out.

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really.

I lay in a hospital bed staring at the ceiling, listening to the beeps and the distant murmur of nurses, and every time a footstep paused outside my door, my body tensed.

Sometime around three in the morning, my phone buzzed with a voicemail notification. I hadn’t noticed any missed calls.

The number was blocked.

My stomach dropped.

I stared at it until my hands stopped shaking enough to press play.

At first, there was only static.

Then a soft sound.

Breathing.

And then, in a voice that was almost mine, but not quite, like it was being played through something wet—

“Hey.”

I sat up so fast my shoulder screamed.

The voicemail continued.

There was rustling, like leaves. A faint metallic clank, like a tower groaning in wind.

Then my name again, drawn out wrong, like it enjoyed the shape of it.

And finally, quiet laughter.

Not a deer sound.

Not a human sound either.

Just something amused.

The message ended.

I stared at my phone until the screen went dark.

In the morning, the deputy came back. His face was different than the day before—tight, controlled.

He said they found the tower.

He said they found blood, like I’d reported.

He said they found signs of a struggle.

He said they found drag marks leading to the window.

He also said they found something else.

Tracks.

He didn’t say what kind.

He just said they were “odd.”

And he said there were no bodies.

No missing person reports that matched. No hikers reported overdue in that area. No campsites nearby.

Nothing.

I asked if they found an animal. A deer. Anything.

He looked at me like he was deciding what to say.

Then he said, carefully, “We didn’t see anything when we went in.”

I didn’t like the way he said it.

Like he was leaving out the part where they heard something.

Like he didn’t want to put certain words in the air.

He told me to stay out of those woods. Like that was an option I’d ever consider again.

He gave me a card with his number in case I remembered anything else.

When he left, I deleted the voicemail.

Then I realized something that made my blood go cold all over again.

Deleting it didn’t matter.

Because that voice didn’t need my phone.

It didn’t need technology.

It had been close enough to whisper in my ear in the middle of the woods.

And now it knew where I lived, because my license was on file, because I’d told the hospital who I was, because I’d called for help like a rational person.

I sat there, staring out the hospital window at the parking lot below, watching normal people walk to their cars with coffee cups and backpacks and no idea what the woods can do when something decides you’re interesting.

I told myself it had followed me because it was hungry.

Because it wanted to hunt.

Because it was a predator.

But predators don’t leave voicemails.

Predators don’t repeat your words back to you just to see you react.

Predators don’t take their time.

That thing in the woods didn’t want to eat me.

Not right away.

It wanted something else.

Practice, maybe.

A voice.

A name.

A way to get closer next time.

And the worst part—the part that still sits like a weight in my chest—is the memory of that fire lookout tower. The blood. The window.

Someone went out of that window because staying inside was worse.

And whatever made them choose that…

I’ve been a woman in tech for over 8 years. I know this industry, and I know the men in it. Watching software engineering jobs collapse and big tech lay off engineers just confirms what I’ve always thought tech bros are gigantic, submissive cuckolds. Day in and day out at work, I saw them for what they were cuckolds pretending to be alphas. Now, seeing what’s happening to their job market? That’s just a taste of their own medicine.

I was bullied and harassed at work. Men subjected me to sexist jokes and told me I was just a less intelligent woman who had no place working with computers and code. I burned out and changed my career path because of that toxic environment. Thanks for that.

Watching this ship sink seeing these supposedly high iq engineers with 10 or 15 years of experience who can’t find a job, who have to grind leet vode and go through 5 round interviews competing with thousands of others is the best possible humbling. 

Haha, I love how fast things are changing. I love that these cuckolds created the very tools that are killing their own jobs and profession all because they’re so self centered and money oriented that it never crossed their minds AI would turn around and lay off them and their colleagues.
I’ve always thought of these startup tech bros as nasty, toxic, selfcentered people whose ultimate goal is money to spend on hookers and luxury cars just to compensate for their small personalities.

I truly believe men in tech are unbelievably submissive cucks. I’ve watched them cheer for the competition and the rat race. They cheered when Musk laid off Twitter engineers. I saw videos of women who used to do nothing but drink coffee and make content and all those toxic, entitled tech bros clapping for his decision to gut the company.

I’ll always see tech bros as unmanly men cuckold beta males who pretend to be smart. You’ve got these engineers with IQs through the roof who can break down complex algorithms, math, and AI, but they have zero social intelligence or EQ. It’s proof of a stunning stupidity. How does someone with a 200 iq end up jobless because they were too self centered, arrogant, and naive to realize capitalism isn’t their friend?

Even now, when the layoffs hit, these tech cuckolds do nothing. They’re submissive males. Fake males. Mostly young, conservative guys who think a big paycheck makes them manly and valuable.

If you dig deeper and look at cause and effect, you’ll see it clearly. The standard of living in the 80s meant one working person could support a family, buy a house, and provide. Then tech progressed  tech jobs boomed, and everything started to rot. Young men stopped creating real value building houses, doing physical work and instead took virtual, invisible jobs that added nothing to society. They got paid fortunes but produced nothing of real value for ordinary people, just driving up inflation and making life more expensive for everyone else.

I’m optimistic. I want to see tech jobs collapse and people run from this industry because people shouldn’t serve evil tech companies, men in their prime should stop wasting their lives in front of screens creating useless virtual crap and go do normal work that actually adds value.

Birth rates will go up. More relationships will form. Women will finally have access to real, manly, valuable men who work jobs that care for society and the greater good instead of men who produce nothing but useless digital garbage.

They add little to the economy and contribute even less to the greater good on this planet.",0,1770766381.0,Productivitycafe,15,0.29,False

However, she lacks self confidence. I mean **all** self confidence.

I initially thought she was just cutely shy, but over the past 12 months I became aware of just how debilitating her internal monologue is. It's gotten to the point where I can't even offer words of reassurance without causing a meltdown.

I'm exhausted but feel awful that I can't offer any help. I've gotten to the point where I really only respond ""Yes Honey. Of course."" and nod blankly. I plan all our dates. I keep everything afloat. Lately it feels like I'm slipping into ""Gotta make my woman happy. 🤪 You know how sensitive they are.""

All of these shutdowns (examples below) have been getting closer together over the months. I asked for a glass of water the other night and she cried after I replied ""Nah, I'm good"" to ice. She said she perceived a hostile tone. I have never once raised my voice. I have never criticized or belittled her. Of course I experience sadness, anger, and frustration like a normal person, but I'm mindful to process those emotions and not let it impact my actions. Especially not around my loved ones.

No amount of validating, affirming, or explaining seems to help. It's unsustainable. It's codependent. Yes, the topic of therapy also results in a 3 day shutdown. Yes, I am also in therapy.

Has anyone successfully navigated this type of relationship?

EXAMPLES

\--

\-I was slightly upset with the neighbor. Not visibly, but I complained over AM coffee. Something seemed off, but she insisted she was fine. I went about my Saturday while she sat on the couch. Around dinnertime, she burst into tears saying she couldn't tell me ""because I was obviously in a bad mood and would hate her.""

I explained ""I can empathetically listen to your situation and simultaneously be pissed at the neighbor. I'm not even upset anymore.""

She insisted I was in a bad mood and that I'm always in a bad mood. Finally, after saying she is ""walking on eggshells"" and my probing, she answered what was bothering her: her friend forgot to order her drink at a bar the night before.

\-We've been together for three years. I own a condo in the town over, closer to her work. She has moved 4 times with a variety of roommates, but refuses to move in with me ""because she would be a burden and I would just end up hating her."" She spends 5+ nights a week here... I don't think an extra two would kill us. She also says she can't afford my mortgage. I have brought this up every 4-6 months and made it very clear we would be splitting it either 20:80 or 30:70, as I earn 3x her salary.

\-We took a Christmas trip to Chicago. She forgot the gift to our mutual friend. ""Oopsie Daisy! No big deal. I actually forgot to check before we left.""

She spent 3/5 days in the hotel staring at a wall. No sightseeing. Barely ate. Barely showered. I went out and bought a new gift, which caused her to double-down on the shutdown. During this time she refused to talk to me except to say ""Just leave me already./You hate me./I'm ruining everything.""

She did put a pretty big damper on the holiday trip. I absolutely did not say this. Instead I tried my best to have fun and carry the conversation around our friends and family. Her friends got very suspicious and actually launched a full monthlong, psy-op investigation to see if I was abusing her based on her nonverbal, flinchy behavior.

\-She never kisses me or holds my hand (or initiates sex) because ""she doesn't know if I want that."" I've told her yes, of course, all of that 24/7. You are the most beautiful woman in the world. Still nothing. If I stop initiating, even subconsciously, she views that as ""I have one foot out the door"" or worse, I clearly hate her.

1r1gzql,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyGPT/comments/1r1gzql/is_psychotherapy_overhyped/,Is psychotherapy overhyped?,"After a few days of reading posts there (they're super interesting) my question is: is psychotherapy overhyped? Is it overused? 

Probably many of you have noticed this pattern: if someone confesses they have emotional or personal problems of any kind, what people often answer is ""go to a therapy/see a psychologist"". 

I understand why it is like that, I've been providing such answers myself. People want to be helpful, but in many cases they have no idea what to do. And for the last 20-30 years, in western culture, psychotherapy has been praised and advertised as something that should be used in treatment of mental health. There's no other, way — just meds and psychotherapy. 

(Modern meds work great, tbh. But meds are ""hard science"". They have to be tested multiple times before they can be used.) 

So now it's always. ""Go to a psychotherapy"". 

Not:

""Hey, maybe we can have coffee together and discuss your favourite series so you feel less lonely?"" 

""I'll help you find someone who can take care of your child this weekend so you can rest."" 

""I'm sorry about your financial situation. I usually have some food left and I can share meals with you so you won't be hungry."" 

""Maybe we can play this game together to make you less stressed about the exam?"" 

I don't want to deny that psychotherapy works in many cases. But society is forgetting that having a network of friendly helpful people, contributing to a community, having financial stability, nutritious food and a place to live are way more important than talking to a psychologist once a week.

1r1gwz7,https://i.redd.it/hrkqy9pd4rig1.jpeg,Stone Lite Review – from an ex Profitec GO and La Pavoni Cellini Owner,"When I was researching the Stone Lite, I was surprised by how little there was in the way of long-term, experience-based reviews. I’m hoping this write-up helps anyone who’s on the fence, especially if you’ve owned (or are considering) machines in the same general tier.

For context, I previously owned a Profitec GO. I ended up selling it after managing to damage it through some overly enthusiastic descaling, entirely my fault. Despite the Chrome Flakes of Doom, I genuinely loved the GO. It’s well built, the PID is useful, and the switch between brew and steam never bothered me — it was just part of the fun of making espresso. Steam power was perfectly serviceable, though at the time my only point of comparison was a De’Longhi Dedica (which, to be fair, is a great first machine).

That said, living with the GO long-term did reveal some niggles. Mine was noisy out of the box when the pump was active. I had the older metal drip tray, which rattled, and the water tank lid simply rests on top, so that rattled too. All easily fixable, but if I’m honest, not things I cared enough to fix. Cup clearance was more annoying: I had to weigh the cup first, pull the shot, re-weigh, then adjust the next time. It worked, but it wasn’t elegant. And the machine required frequent flushing, so water waste was noticeably high.

After the descaling incident, I wasn’t keen on buying another GO, even though the newer revision had addressed the chrome issue. After months of deliberation, I came across a matte black La Pavoni Cellini at a frankly ridiculous price and snapped it up.

The Cellini was fantastic. The first thing that hit me — immediately — was the steam power. Coming from the GO, it was a revelation. I realised very quickly that I couldn’t go back to weaker steam. Unfortunately, the machine developed an issue early on and had to be returned.

Still, that brief ownership clarified a lot for me. Size really does matter. The Cellini looked incredible, but it absolutely dominated our small kitchen. It had a hot water spout that I never used which made me realise it wasn’t a requirement at all. And the heat-up time, around 30 minutes, meant spontaneous coffee was basically off the table unless I remembered to use the smart plug. I missed the GO’s eight-minute readiness more than I expected. Heat-up time mattered.

It’s worth laying out my use case clearly. I enjoy the ritual: grinding, WDT, tamping, a bit of latte art. I haven’t gone down the rabbit hole of flow profiling or chasing very light roasts that demand precise temperature tweaking. I drink one or two espresso or milk drinks a day, about four days a week when I’m not in the studio. I mainly stick to medium and dark roasts.

I considered the Lelit Victoria and the Quick Mill Pop Up. I didn’t like the look or finish on the Victoria, and the Pop Up felt like a sideways move from the GO. Flow control is nice, but for my use it would have been more of a distraction than a benefit.

Then I saw the Stone Lite on sale for less than the silver Profitec GO.

On paper, it ticked an awful lot of boxes:

* A compact footprint (though it is quite deep — worth measuring)
* HX design
* Built by Rocket, which bodes well for build quality

Reviews were thin on the ground, but I took the leap. I’m very glad I did.

# What I love

The build quality is exceptional which is what I'd expect from a Rocket owned company. It genuinely feels better than the GO and comfortably on par with the Cellini. Everything feels dense and deliberate.

There are no push buttons, just a single solid metal switch. Simple, mechanical, and exactly what I want.

The steam wand is on the right-hand side, which suits me perfectly coming from the GO. I was making better latte art almost immediately - I was surprised how much having the wand on the left affected how bad my attempts were. The wand is a good length, fully articulated, and insulated, so you can touch it during steaming. The little nub they include to move the wand is basically pointless; I’d much prefer a traditional rubber grip and will likely replace it.

Steam power is excellent. It’s not quite at Cellini levels, but it’s miles ahead of the GO and more than enough for my needs.

The drip tray depth is awesome. I can fit my chunky old scale on it without worry. Combined with the generous brew group height, scale plus cup is no problem at all. It makes day-to-day use far more pleasant.

Water waste is minimal compared to the GO which is nice.

# Addressing common criticisms

**Cosmetic panels**  
The Lite doesn’t have the interchangeable side panels of the other Stone models. That never appealed to me - I don't think I'm the target demographic. The Lite’s steel side panels are high quality, embossed with the logo, and removed with four screws — very much like a PC side panel. If the interchangeable panels are a selling point for you, the Pure or Plus etc might make more sense.

**Plastic paddle and steam knob**  
The paddle is a design choice, and it works for me visually. The plastic is textured, similar to my scales, and doesn’t feel too cheap. The action is smooth and nicely damped. Brew flow is on/off via a microswitch — no gradual control, and no obvious mod path for flow profiling. That’s fine for my use case, though it may be a dealbreaker for others.

Some people have mentioned burning themselves on the brew cartridge beneath the paddle. There’s a lip where your fingers naturally rest, and even with my large hands I haven’t found this to be an issue.

The steam knob is nicer than the GO’s and about on par with the Cellini. It feels progressive, even if it technically isn’t.

**Tiny drip tray**  
Yes, it’s small and plastic — but the plastic is hidden under the metal cover, so you never see it. My GO’s stainless tray started rusting at the corners, which trained me to empty it frequently. That habit stuck, so the size hasn’t been a problem. Reduced flushing means it fills far more slowly anyway. There’s a small magnet holding it in place, and I imagine a completely full tray could spill, but I haven’t encountered that. Again. more drinks will likely lead to more emptying.

**Small water tank**  
Also true. It’s much smaller than the GO or Cellini. I brew my own softened water using resin beads and like to change it regularly, so this hasn’t bothered me. If you’re making several drinks back-to-back, you’ll be refilling more often.

**Drip tray cover fit**  
I saw a German video where the cover was slightly bent, leaving uneven gaps. Mine is perfectly aligned, but the metal is thin enough that I can imagine it wouldn’t take much to bend. It’s also not magnetic, so it can lift off during cleaning. A minor annoyance.

**No boiler insulation**  
The Lite doesn’t have boiler insulation. For my usage — one or two drinks, then off — this hasn’t been an issue. Insulation matters more if the machine is left on for long periods, where heat retention and energy savings become relevant.

**No PID**  
Correct. There’s no PID. I had my GO set to 93°C and never touched it again, so I don’t miss it. If you’re experimenting with a wide range of light roasts, a PID-equipped machine may suit you better. I originally thought my espresso was warm rather than hot but I trained myself to ensure the portafilter is slotted whilst heating and to pre-heat the cup. 

**Accessories**  
The portafilter is good, on par with the GO. The fit is very tight initially, but leaving it in the group during warm-up softens the gasket and improves things. The stock basket works fine but is extremely tight — I have to pry it out for cleaning and worry about scratching the portafilter chrome. I’ll likely move to a bottomless portafilter and relegate the blind basket to the dual spout. I don’t believe it’s an IMS, so that’s a future upgrade.

The included tamper is plastic and entirely pointless. Straight in the bin.

**No pressure gauge**  
True. I thought I’d miss it more than I do. I briefly considered a portafilter pressure gauge, but the shots have been consistently good, so it hasn’t felt necessary.

# Final thoughts

If you’re looking for a machine that’s simple, compact, beautifully built, and genuinely enjoyable to live with — especially if you value steam performance and quick heat-up (10 mins but I usually leave for 15) and worry less about adjustability — I can highly recommend the Stone Lite.

But she was describing her love, happy marriage (obviously not perfect), great sex life, doing good financially, they have kids, and so on.

Now I know I obviously can’t know that she’s never dealt with anything worse, but I just couldn’t imagine that a communication issue between her and her husband was the worst thing in her life, and it made her feel like she needed to call into a radio show. Like it really hard to listen, as she was describing her life and it just sounds so peaceful. Like do people actually live that good, that their worst problem is getting their husband to kiss them first thing in the morning rather than them getting their coffee first and then kissing them?

I know it’s kind of odd to put this into a Christian post, but I grew up in a high control religious circle, where I was taught basically on the daily that Christianity meant persecution and constant suffering for Jesus.

I pray and read the Bible daily, and I’m seeking God the best I know how, but it feels like I’m just running on a never ending treadmill. There is no destination just constant running and pressure to keep up otherwise I’ll slip and ruin my life.

My life has just been constant anxiety, lots of religious trauma, parental neglect, parentificaion, financially abused, sexual abuse. My parents didn’t give me an education. I was 4+ years behind in school before I was even old enough to do my own school. I’ve had a job since I was thirteen and a lot of that money went to my parents so I can’t even save money. I’ve had to threaten legal action against my last two employers for not paying me. I’ve been unemployed for almost a year, and I’ve worked so hard to try to find a job and no one is hiring in my small town. And I’m just TIRED!

Like I’ve worked so hard and I’m someone who has a lot of passion and life goals but nothing is happening! I wish I could have a normal loving family with supportive parents. I wish I was allowed to be a child. I wish I could get at least get a freaking job. I’ve prayed so much for a job, and it just doesn’t seem to matter. Even just dating seems so far out of reach for me.

When I think about what I want for my future all I can picture is me in an empty apartment. Because all I really want is to be able to financially support myself. I don’t even care if I’m alone because then I can at least have peace. Why does it seem like others have that and 10x more. I don’t get it!",3,1770766082.0,TrueChristian,15,1.0,False

I read like it’s a conversation. I don’t casually listen to music, but rather I experience it. Live shows feel like therapy. I game when I need to disappear for a while. I keep plants because caring for something living keeps me grounded.

I’m quiet, observant, and usually misunderstood. I tend to understand people faster than they understand me, but I'm also good at pretending like that's ok.

Favorites: podcasts about scary things, annotating parts of books that hurt my soul, resonating with music, feeling seen by music, being on the barricade at a loud show, quiet rooms full of plants, deep talks, pizza, remembering the small details about people, black coffee. 

Not so favorites: small talk, loud spaces that aren't concert venues, insincerity, feeling rushed, the big light, ""good vibes only,"" surface-level connection, neon colors.
