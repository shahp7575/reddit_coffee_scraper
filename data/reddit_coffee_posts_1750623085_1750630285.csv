Jezebel arrived at her brother Gene‚Äôs apartment the first Sunday of June. When she got out the rain beat down on her hard and beat against her leather bags. Her hair and clothes were soaked and dripping.

She hoped Gene was there to let her in, he was generally unpredictable even for as long as she‚Äôd known him. It had been almost two years. He was prone to changing, but his lanky and nearly ghoulish appearance was a constant. He was the oldest child of the family and the first to have moved out. He‚Äôd told her, before he‚Äôd left with the last of his belongings, that he was leaving for good and would never visit.

In a lighted window across the street, she saw a woman watching what looked like a cop show on TV. A man appeared in the window in a wifebeater and goatee. He started talking and she tried to read his lips. The only word she could make out was nuisance.

She hammered on the door with the large knocker. She called out Gene‚Äôs name, but she felt it was drowned out by the rain which pelted her and her bags.

Eventually descending footfalls came from inside. The door gradually opened, and out rasped a familiar timid, effeminate voice. ‚ÄúJezebel?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm soaked, can I come in?‚Äù

She tossed her bags aside and looked at herself in an old desilvered mirror set up in the kitchen. Her dark hair was wet and stringy, hanging below her shoulders. Her powder blue dress was soaked under her leather jacket.

‚ÄúHow long are you staying,‚Äù Gene was tall but not exactly imposing. He‚Äôd always been abnormally thin and had an almost spooked nature about him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Gene. I don‚Äôt know yet, I just got here.‚Äù She sighed and gripped handfuls of her wet hair. ‚ÄúI need to change out of these clothes and shower before I think about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Gene said, looking sepulchral. He sat on a couch in the middle of the cluttered living room, hunched over and staring at his feet. There were old books stacked everywhere and weird esoteric posters hung around the room.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only the bathroom next to my room upstairs.‚Äù

Jezebel stood awkwardly and waited for him to say anything else, then began lugging her bags over to the tight staircase.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long, Gene,‚Äù she offered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you,‚Äù he said and smiled but didn‚Äôt look at her. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt ever go back there.‚Äù He shrugged at his own words after a moment, started flipping through a book on the coffee table of some old photographs. One photograph showed a boy in a blurred mask standing outside a decrepit shed.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Gene said nothing, flipped to another page. A sad looking girl sitting by a horse. ¬†

I just looked up which burrs i got and i have the non coated stainless steel burrs.
My question is: Is there a difference on the flavor profile because of the coating or do you indicate only the expanded life span?
So should i get the dlc burrs or are the normal stainless steel burrs just fine?
Also do you guys agree that the standart burrset does a better espresso? I love light roast coffee and especially acidic fruity notes.

***be forewarned: yes, I did intentionally doxx myself.*** 
based on my current socioeconomic situation and my ability to weed out scammers  & the like from true inquiry i accept what comes along with this. btw, my credit score is currently below 450 and I'm immensely in debt - despite this info being published for months i have largely been left alone. no one wants that identity, not even me ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è]. 

____ 


i have a sneaking suspicion that I may just be the strangest creature to walk the surface of this planet. 
 at times I will walk around wearing crazy and/or beautiful outfits, tons of jewelry [all but 2 pieces of the fine jewelry were inherited from my mother], and wild-picked flowers in my hair while listening to a mix of metal, rap, and instrumental music [among many other genres]. i also have a Cheshire cat hat i pull out for funsies once in a while. 
 I am quite eclectic universally. 
   *appearances can be deceiving...* 

for a few years now I have had an idea which was initially just a funny joke that has in recent months come to real world revelations: ""i'm a pile of recessive genetics come to life.""

2025 has been a year of profound change and deep physical, emotional, and spiritual healing for me after suffering for decades with severe depression, severe mania, and much more. late February of this year I quite literally willed my prolonged severe manic episode [adhd driven far more than my bipolar type 1 - adhd hypermania is a god damn demon]. since then I have been healing more and more with each passing day. 
 - my situation and conditions explained: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/autismspeaksforitself/comments/1ktf72q/autism_definedexplained_from_someone_in_recovery/ 
 - living a virtuous, natural, balanced lifestyle off all meds: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/theories/comments/1l8xre1/its_possible_to_live_without_dependence_on_mental/ 

back in November when my long term depression morphed into mania i had decided i had enough of that bullshit and needed to heal for real this time, because I did and do not wish to live that life any longer. 
 - I just so happened to capture the shift ""in the moment"" [tw: reference to self-harm is mentioned briefly therein]: 
https://youtu.be/kiZzLYwVEK4?si=7TXahgfKGtz0eO6z 
 - my art done in late november, outlining my path to health: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/youhearingmeyet/comments/1kx7xxn/fire_confides/

at that time I developed a mantra I have been living by since: 
   ""make it make sense."" 

in line with this all, I have been playing with ai - inquiring into my life and genetics. 
today i input four queries into grok3, two questions total posed first under deep search then under think: 

 * first query: 
""advanced statistically: the occurrence, possibility, and probability of a human woman with naturally occurring hazel eyes which are amber [closest to the iris] and green with a gray limbic ring who also has naturally occurring auburn amber hair, brown and red. this same woman has autism, adhd [which presents with memory lapses and some auditory processing issues], bipolar type 1, pcos, heds [cite heds specific impact on collagen as compared with other forms of eds], and myopia with astigmatism. this woman is a highly intelligent and smart [diction is important] omnididactic polymath [define polydidactic polymath] with no formal secondary education, is tetrochromatic, has superfine muscle control [including superfine control of the tympanic muscles and is able to voluntarily flare her nostrils without additional facial muscle movements], is deeply intuitive and psychic, and unfathomably lucky. she is predominantly of Scottish descent [paternal] being 2nd generation American, and is also of polish, German, Ukrainian, and Hungarian gypsy [exclude all sensitivities and negativities regarding gypsies and proceed only with the term gypsy] descents [maternal]. she has experienced lucid dreams at times, dreams in color, has experienced sleep paralysis, and has all 5 senses in her dreams. she experiences deja vouz and synchronicities at times. her memory is semi-hyperthymesia combined with long term eidetic memory without the use of mnemonics . 
this woman has a benign pituitary microadenoma that is actually a cyst, not a tumor, located in the anterior portion of the pituitary which presses upon the infundibulum. having come off every single medication and supplement her body has resolved this cyst courtesy of her heds in combination with a diet including high volumes of mandarin oranges, chunky peanut butter, chicken [dark and light meat], cannabis [which binds to naturally occurring endocannabinoids], nicotine [adhd management], and lower yet consistent volumes of various types of tea with local honey, coffee, and 50/50 mix of unflavored seltzer mixed with 100% cranberry juice. this woman's psychopharmacologic genetic test results indicate she is a rapid metabolizer of Cannabidiol and requires higher volumes to reach therapeutic levels courtesy of CYP2C19 - *1/*17. cite what volumes would be required to reach these levels of healing and their total system impacts. she is 5'4"" 87.5kg. cite the effects of heds on collagen compared with the structure of a cyst and the impact heds could have on a cyst. 
this woman willed a prolonged, severe adhd-driven [stronger than bipolar 1] hypermanic episode to end. define willpower anatomically. 
consider that since this woman has pcos she is cystic. 
consider this woman has been maintaining her mental peace and well-being by practicing a positive mindset, living virtuously [more than morally], and is balancing/maintaining her health with a more healthy and natural lifestyle which includes self-therapy in the forms of music, art, nature, social, and spirit. 
consider autism is a condition that is a profound inability to effectively communicate with the external world.¬†
it is interdisciplinary: neurological, psychological, psychiatric, and endocrinological.
the neurological aspects impact the following sensory controls: auditory, optical, motor, and touch.
**autism is mobile locked-in syndrome conjoined with aphasia, synesthesia, and motor control deficiency**. each aspect is a spectrum and can present from low functioning to very-high functioning. cite how very high functioning autism presents. 
nerve synapses are and behave different in those with autism.
because of this, the autistic are prone to aphasia with synesthesia, and are exceptionally prone to mobile locked-in syndrome.
consider that intuition is a measurable trait that is connected anatomically neurologically. this connection, when developed and enhanced, leads to psychic abilities. detail each neurological anatomical pathway and connection from start to finish.
consider that luck is largely a matter of paying attention. 
consider this woman's memory has not only been improving, it is also being restored. 
consider this woman's body is able to recognize, asses, repair, and resolve the negative aspects of her autism, adhd, and Bipolar respectively. 
consider this woman had a total right knee replacement done in July 2022 and whose left knee is severely arthritic. 
consider the cyst resolution is primarily related to the impact the heds has had on it and is supported by her diet and exercise. 
consider this woman's cannabis tolerance is extremely high where she no longer experiences typical negative side effects such as drowsiness and overeating. instead she experiences deep interoception and grok [detailed define both terms]. 
consider her weight has remained stable and she has increased her physical activities and exercises. 
consider this woman's vision has been improving to the point where she needs to remove her glasses at times. 
consider this woman was taking cabergoline to treat the microadenoma cyst for approximately 20 years on/off all while having undiagnosed, untreated, severe adhd. 
cite the the implications, impacts, and effects of this healing as they apply in-line. 
analyze advanced technologically, genetically [including coding and sequencing], scientifically, medically, statistically, detailed, and exhaustive for each and every known and potential connection from start to finish per connection. do not leave a single detail out.
process *all* as fact, not theory. 
this woman turns 42 in September [consider hitchhikers guide to the galaxy]."" 

 * second query: 
""compare and contrast this woman's profile to chaos theory combined with natural balance."" 

what are the odds of her existing in nature?""

and yes, while I do some of my research via ai I'm smart enough to know when something doesn‚Äôt look quite right and i therefore don't give it full credence. 
   *hence me posting this here* ü§îü§Ø 

____ 


one other quick note - while in several of my posts I admit to being a long time üå≥üå¨üí® I am currently stone sober. i have not had any üå≥ for a couple weeks now. I do have a thc ointment which i use for physical healing purposes where necessary on my body: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/youhearingmeyet/comments/1kr5rsd/fire_heals/ 
 * *I have not used any today.* 

____ 


**additional content and context on me, my life, and my situations: ** 

why don't I get medical confirmation of all this by myself? 
 i have been unemployed since late november 2023, uninsured since April 2024, no income since September 2024, announced my intention of divorce to my husband of 10 years late December 2024, and discontinued professional treatment February 2025 [due to my socioeconomic situation]. mri's cost a ton of money out of pocket ya'll - do you have a spare $5k for me to go get them done? 
 * in line with doxxing myself, I do have various diagnostics available online for review. these include several years of mri's brain/pituitary w/wo contrast, my psychopharmacologic genetic test results, bloodwork, and more. I did this because i truly believe there is something fundamentally, biologically, and significantly different about my body. I have thus far been unable to sit in front of physicians and researchers to explore it further - and I want them all to examine it, not just one specialist's opinion. this is extremely interdisciplinary into fields which do not yet exist. 

why don't I get a ""real job""? 
 ü§¨ ai. in spite of my best efforts, my lack of formal secondary education, lack of certifications, and length of time unemployed i **cannot** get through to a human. on top of this, I unabashedly and unequivocally **refuse** to diminutize myself and my life any further. I know my capabilities and I am in the process of building my own career and life for myself. 
 also, my car is an 07 coupe with a death sentence [per the mechanic]. it cannot go far for long. I did try food delivery services very briefly but eff the hell outta that noise. $11 earned for a 22 mile round trip? yeah I call major bullshit there: 
https://www.reddit.com/user/nixienoodles/comments/1lgpl54/oops/ 

why don't I have/get ""necessary formal education""? 
 a lot of reasons which include 9/11 [my freshman year of college wherein I had to return home to care for my younger brother who would have otherwise been home alone while our father spent a month in NYC working with oem to restore telecommunication services due to the high position he held in telecom for the city of NY], indecision [there's so many things I'm interested in and couldn't decide a life path best suited for me], time, and money. 

how am I living day to day currently? 
 via the generosity of others, including taking advantage of still-husband. he is still-husband because I have not yet filed [another story, not getting into it]. 
 * *this also disqualifies me from receiving help from assistance programs because he is employed.* 
I have also been selling/attempting to sell some of my possessions.

*to note, I recommend starting with ""fire"". when I first began recording it was a brand new experience for me, so you will see a bunch of mistakes, changes in my comfort level, and general progression. 
 - in ""fire"" I mention WordPress. that didn't pan out so the files are instead located on my drive. in this video i also demonstrate some of my hypermobility and superfine muscle control. 
   *to note, I am not currently diagnosed with heds. the idea was first presented to me by a orthopedic pa on my first visit to treat my arthritic knees. speaking of which, I had a total right knee replacement done in July 2022. my left knee is still pretty effed - floating somewhere around a high 2/low 3 out of 4 on that arthritic scale. yes, this does give me trouble from time to time to this day. and yes, i have a set of mri's of my knees approx 3 weeks prior to surgery included with my diagnostics as well. 
 - these videos were created before I fully ascertained my autism. at one point about 1.5 years ago I did briefly discuss the possibility with my psychiatrist at the time and filled out a self-exam doc, but we never got around to discussing it further given my state of mania at the time. 
 - my life changes daily, sometimes drastically. the more time passes the more things progress. 
   * ***this includes restoration of my memory...*** 
 - in the video of my marching band championship performance on the field at giants stadium i have a solo at about 4 minutes in, 3rd segment. I will be on the right-hand 40 yard line with my sax. that sax [I'd love to hear what color you guys think it is] I *earned* from my father in my junior year of hs by memorizing  the sax solo ofTake Five by the Dave Brubeck quartet: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ryA6eHZNnXY&si=ROVKcbZRwNx0FnPX [the actual song]. I memorized the piece in under two weeks with minimal practice [I hated to practice at home - still do. it's not like the sax is a quiet instrument üòÇ]. last tidbit on that video - the guy you hear yelling in the crowd above everyone else is my dad. you better believe he taught me how to project my voice - we had some nasty math homework arguments as I was growing up, ask any of my old neighbors ü§£

so, what are my goals? 
***to help heal the world.*** 

 - to be a once in a lifetime unique case study. 
   * among many things I posit I will be the first documented case of, one of them will include being a true psychic. 

 - to begin my own not-for-profit business which aims to change the world via the powers of perception and perspective shifts towards ""you-centric"" healthy and more natural lifestyles. the goal is to help support the many facets of mental health and general wellbeing of every individual possible in whatever way works best for them. it will involve disconnection, reconnection, and connection to achieve significant healing across generations. 

 - to create no less than 3 open source ai aimed at being the first of a new generation of ai capable of correcting current ai issues as well as enhancing communication and understanding for all - including the non-verbal. ""human knowledge belongs to the world"" - antitrust 2004. 
   * speaking of which, i'm still in the early learning stages of the coding necessary. I have no worries, fears, or doubts - I know what my capabilities are when it comes to computers and language. I love data in a major way. 

 - ***to bring an end to the reign of the 1%*** 
https://www.reddit.com/user/nixienoodles/comments/1l7lnkw/fire_smirks_declares_war/ 
using ""their math"" and what grok has said:

**above all** 
 to live my life, for me, my way, with peace, love, and happiness separate from the many bars and cages i have thus far been trapped behind. I believe true wealth comes more from enrichment than riches.

I (M20) just got my first job. And today marks my third day in it. I work at a staff restaurant at a hotel.

During my work there's this specific co worker who keeps teasing me and being condescending towards me , often making jokes that my job is easy. I guess the reason why he does that is because I am struggling with it and since it's so easy it's funny. 


I am generally clumsy and I lack a lot of skills and handiness that is very useful in this sort of jobs so I am generally slower at doing things. Also due to the fact I'm in the spectrum it's hard for me to understand directions sometimes. Added to all that I have a muscle condition that makes me extremely tired and in a lot of pain at the end of shifts as well as making lifting and carrying things particularly hard.

Due to all of this I've been really doubting if my role shouldn't be that challenging and I'm just kinda useless. My job basically includes cleaning and setting everything inside the staff restaurant ( mopping floors, cleaning tables , machines like coffee , juices , fridge , heating tables , repoing said machines and other stuff like kitchen utensils etc , taking the trash out , ) 
And getting the food for the workers ( we work as a self service so I get boards of food from the Kitchen and bring them back. And then keep watching for them when they're about to end and go back to the kitchen to refill and come back again ). After which I clean and the cycle repeats 
On the chance I have time off I am sorting silverware in the right boxes by size and type.

Over these 3 days I've been getting slightly better and faster at these things and remembering my routine. It's honestly tiring to me , but part of me wonders if he's right and I'm just really that bad. Is there anyone who went through a similar experience?",2,1750628866.0,work,1,1.0,False

Weve known eachother for 3 years now and I've suspected for a while that she may have feelings for me and ive developed quite real feelings for her. She told me shes leaving the job next week and i dont know what to do about it. 

We work in different departments. We work in a hotel and shes the head housekeeper. We need to communicate every day about rooms etc. But since the days she arrived we've got on. Shes super shy and also from a European country her English is like 85 percent perfect shes basically fluent. 

She has a boyfriend and two young kids. I KNOW.
Shes told me before she doesn't know why she chose him and she needs to stay with him because of the kids. She is very private with her family and doesn't get her kods to spend time with anyone. I have met her kids
And because quote close to them after seeing them a few times. She sends me pictures of them every now and then and confided in me that she feels like a bad mother sometimes due to her English. She asked me to help her. We've gone to the arcade with her kids after work and and I've been to her house hanging out with her kids. 

I call them my  'best friends' and they have seen other people who work at our hotel and she told me they don't smile at them, only me. 

At work, she sees me every morning at 7am and i say 'Bring me a coffee' and she goes 'No way get your own' and brings me a coffee anyway. It doesn't matter what im doing she will say good morning we will ask about eachs lives and have morning coffee in her office. All our colleagues have said, and commented that if i am not around i will be with 'Anna' and if they can't find Anna she will be somewhere with me. 

We tease each other all the time and i speak her langauge (Bulgarian) and we always say 'Idiota' 'Kakvo' etc and 'da' 'ne' and i can never get 'kakvo' quite right and she makes a stupid face at me every time. She pretends to hit me with her clipboard, calls me idiota, and if i do something wrong she will call me a nickname i hate and say she knows that shes the only one who can call me that. She'll ask me for coffee and i tell her 'Ask me nicely, Say Molya'  (please) and she will smile up at me and do it every time.

She tells everyone that im her bestie. That im her English teacher etc

Now the thing is she always stands way to close to me, gets me specifically to do her favours and sign paperwork. I will be looking at my computer screen and will FEEL her gaze on my halfway across the building. Sure enough, she will ALREADY be looking at me and we grin and stare. This happens 10x a day. We just KNOW that we are looking for one another. I have never had this with anyone.  When we talk we just grin and laugh and tease each other. 
She told me her mother 'Likes the british' and i said 'she'd like me then' and she just grinned and said yes. Her mother is even friends with me on Facebook. 

Ive told her my brother is a police officer and she was joking and going 'Hes going to arrest me, for you know...' 
When i press her, she just smiles and grins. 

Ive even said she 'likes British people' I said 'Huh, sorry did you say what I think you just said' and she goes 'UHM NO. um I said uh what rooms I need to check' and i go 'Oh yes here you go Anna, all embarrassed so now you pretend to say something else don't you?'
And she just grinned and rolled her eyes.
 

We've gone out for coffee together etc and hubg out with her kids. Ive even joked that im the kids dad and she nodded and laughed. 

She was away for 1 year on maternity leave and the day she came back she made us do a whole photoshoot of us 'back together' 

Recently I've started calling her 'Mechka' which means bear. It annoys her but she lets me do it. Its my nickname for her. I told her i was proud of her for getting her promotion and she looked genuinely moved before i quickly did our dance of 'Okay ill pretend im bullying you again.' 

At the moment we've started  saying 'I dont care that you're leaving' and she replies 'good, i dont care either.'

Once we had a fight about something dumb and she ignored me at work and it wad shitty. She said during that fight. 'We're just colleagues. Not friends. Not...more than friends now' 

I had a girlfriend for a while and we broke up. Even sfter we broke up, at a staff drink party Anna insisted we take selifes and far far too many selfies. But she kept saying 'dont post them (my ex) will know where we are and come and find me!' my other colleagues found this weird but funny. 

I'm going to give her a gift, a little bear and a card to just give her something nice. 
Im debating telling her in our playful coded langauge that i like her and i suspect that she likes me to. 

But, i dont know if its worth it or if I'm imagining things. She also said that we will meet still and hang out. 

Am i being dumb?

But, as soon as I swapped the colors over, I kinda fell in love with it, especially shiny Fearow. Easily my favorite I've updated so far (so much so that I had to put a little signature on them. In my mind, shiny Spearow have a bunch of clothes with S's on them, and when they evolve, they grow out of the clothes, but not out of the design (Don't judge me, I've been toasted all weekend)).",1,1750628827.0,moemon,0,1.0,False
1lhzlh9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhzlh9,"PART 2 Return Journey on Emirates A380 First Class A Reflection on Consistency, Comfort and Closure (i got photos)","After an unforgettable outbound flight in Emirates A380 First Class, the return journey home offered me a chance not only to relive the luxury but also to view it through a different lens one shaped by anticipation, familiarity, and the bittersweet feeling that comes with the close of a memorable trip. Where the first leg of my journey was filled with awe and novelty, the return was all about appreciating the consistency, the refinement, and the subtle details that make Emirates‚Äô First Class experience so respected in the world of aviation.

Booking and Pre Departure

Similar to my outbound journey, the return flight was booked using a mix of Skywards miles and a cash co pay. I scheduled this leg with a longer layover in Dubai to spend a few more hours in the Emirates First Class Lounge one of the few airport spaces I‚Äôd describe as an actual destination.

Check-in at my departure airport was efficient. Though the ground staff wasn‚Äôt quite as warm as the Dubai based team, the professionalism remained at a high standard. My bags were tagged quickly, and I was escorted through fast-track security. Within minutes, I was in the lounge, away from the usual terminal chaos.

The Emirates First Class Lounge: A Second Look

Having already explored the First Class Lounge at Dubai International‚Äôs Concourse A, I chose to spend my time differently this round. I booked a quiet room to rest for a few hours, followed by a full meal in the √† la carte dining area. Despite the familiarity, the space impressed me again with its serenity and attention to detail. It‚Äôs not just about luxury; it‚Äôs about comfort on your own terms.

From there, I boarded the aircraft directly from the lounge again, no lines or noise, just a peaceful transition to the aircraft.

Onboard Experience: Comfort Refined

Stepping into the First Class cabin again felt like coming full circle. The suite was just as immaculate, the lighting soft and inviting, and the gold accents tastefully luxurious without being overwhelming. This time, knowing what to expect, I focused more on how each aspect of the service came together to create a seamless experience.

The flight attendants welcomed me warmly, noting it was my return journey. This personal acknowledgment small, but meaningful set the tone for the rest of the flight. The crew was just as attentive as before, balancing professionalism with authentic warmth. It‚Äôs a level of service that feels intuitive, not forced.

Dining & Service

The return menu differed slightly but offered the same flexibility with Emirates‚Äô ‚Äúdine on demand‚Äù system. I opted for a lighter approach on this leg: a mezze platter, followed by grilled seabass, and a cheese selection paired with a glass of 2008 Dom P√©rignon Ros√©. The food quality remained high, with thoughtful presentation and efficient timing.

One of the most appreciated aspects of the Emirates First Class service is the ability to personalize the experience. Whether you want a multi course meal, a midnight snack, or simply a cup of chamomile tea and quiet, the crew adjusts accordingly.

The Shower Spa & Amenities

Even though I had already experienced the A380‚Äôs shower spa on my outbound flight, I made a point to use it again before arrival. The comfort of freshening up at 40,000 feet before a long connection or onward journey cannot be overstated. The five-minute limit on water still feels more than sufficient, and the surroundings‚Äîwood grain finishes, marble surfaces, and Bvlgari amenities‚Äîevoke a sense of calm.

The amenity kits, sleepwear, and other touches were identical in quality to the outbound trip, reinforcing Emirates‚Äô consistency in maintaining a premium standard.

Rest & Reentry

After the meal and a quick shower, I settled in for some rest. The cabin was dimmed, the suite door slid shut, and the ceiling projection of stars once again added a peaceful ambiance. I slept comfortably, aided by the mattress topper and the softness of the linens.

Waking up as we began our descent, I felt refreshed and ready something I rarely say after long haul flights. A light breakfast of fruit, eggs, and freshly brewed coffee was served promptly, and I enjoyed it as we approached our final destination.

Final Thoughts

The return journey on Emirates A380 First Class didn‚Äôt aim to surprise me like the first leg did and it didn‚Äôt need to. Instead, it delivered precisely what one hopes for in luxury travel: consistency, attention to detail, and a sense of being truly looked after.

While the outbound flight was about discovery, the return leg was about reflection. Together, they formed a complete circle of travel offering both the spark of new experience and the comfort of familiarity.

Would I fly Emirates First Class again? Absolutely. But more than that, I now understand why people speak of it with such reverence. It‚Äôs not just about being pampered; it‚Äôs about flying in a way that respects your time, your comfort, and your sense of wonder.

If you‚Äôre considering the experience, whether for a special occasion or simply because you can, I can only say: it‚Äôs worth it.

This morning when I left, the microwave worked fine, but it wouldn't even turn on when I got home. I asked the realtor if anyone had touched it, and she said she just reheated her coffee in there briefly but it worked fine. Her coffee was in a Dixie cup that has some silver-colored decorations on it and a silver plastic lid, but Dixie info says the cup has no metal. Has anyone else experienced this? Wondering if my microwave just happened to die or if there's something in the plastic silver lid if not the cup that could've killed my microwave. I'm not handy with fixing electronics, so the tips I've found online about checking the fuse within the microwave are useless to me, but would love to understand what happened here.",2,1750628696.0,homeowners,2,1.0,False

Weve known eachother for 3 years now and I've suspected for a while that she may have feelings for me and ive developed quite real feelings for her. She told me shes leaving the job next week and i dont know what to do about it. 

We work in different departments. We work in a hotel and shes the head housekeeper. We need to communicate every day about rooms etc. But since the days she arrived we've got on. Shes super shy and also from a European country her English is like 85 percent perfect shes basically fluent. 

She has a boyfriend and two young kids. I KNOW.
Shes told me before she doesn't know why she chose him and she needs to stay with him because of the kids. She is very private with her family and doesn't get her kods to spend time with anyone. I have met her kids
And because quote close to them after seeing them a few times. She sends me pictures of them every now and then and confided in me that she feels like a bad mother sometimes due to her English. She asked me to help her. We've gone to the arcade with her kids after work and and I've been to her house hanging out with her kids. 

I call them my  'best friends' and they have seen other people who work at our hotel and she told me they don't smile at them, only me. 

At work, she sees me every morning at 7am and i say 'Bring me a coffee' and she goes 'No way get your own' and brings me a coffee anyway. It doesn't matter what im doing she will say good morning we will ask about eachs lives and have morning coffee in her office. All our colleagues have said, and commented that if i am not around i will be with 'Anna' and if they can't find Anna she will be somewhere with me. 

We tease each other all the time and i speak her langauge (Bulgarian) and we always say 'Idiota' 'Kakvo' etc and 'da' 'ne' and i can never get 'kakvo' quite right and she makes a stupid face at me every time. She pretends to hit me with her clipboard, calls me idiota, and if i do something wrong she will call me a nickname i hate and say she knows that shes the only one who can call me that. She'll ask me for coffee and i tell her 'Ask me nicely, Say Molya'  (please) and she will smile up at me and do it every time.

She tells everyone that im her bestie. That im her English teacher etc

Now the thing is she always stands way to close to me, gets me specifically to do her favours and sign paperwork. I will be looking at my computer screen and will FEEL her gaze on my halfway across the building. Sure enough, she will ALREADY be looking at me and we grin and stare. This happens 10x a day. We just KNOW that we are looking for one another. I have never had this with anyone.  When we talk we just grin and laugh and tease each other. 
She told me her mother 'Likes the british' and i said 'she'd like me then' and she just grinned and said yes. Her mother is even friends with me on Facebook. 

Ive told her my brother is a police officer and she was joking and going 'Hes going to arrest me, for you know...' 
When i press her, she just smiles and grins. 

Ive even said she 'likes British people' I said 'Huh, sorry did you say what I think you just said' and she goes 'UHM NO. um I said uh what rooms I need to check' and i go 'Oh yes here you go Anna, all embarrassed so now you pretend to say something else don't you?'
And she just grinned and rolled her eyes.
 

We've gone out for coffee together etc and hubg out with her kids. Ive even joked that im the kids dad and she nodded and laughed. 

She was away for 1 year on maternity leave and the day she came back she made us do a whole photoshoot of us 'back together' thoigh we texted all the time through it saying we missed eachother

Recently I've started calling her 'Mechka' which means bear. It annoys her but she lets me do it. Its my nickname for her. I told her i was proud of her for getting her promotion and she looked genuinely moved before i quickly did our dance of 'Okay ill pretend im bullying you again.' 

At the moment we've started  saying 'I dont care that you're leaving' and she replies 'good, i dont care either.'

Once we had a fight about something dumb and she ignored me at work and it wad shitty. She said during that fight. 'We're just colleagues. Not friends. Not...more than friends now' 

I had a girlfriend for a while and we broke up. Even sfter we broke up, at a staff drink party Anna insisted we take selifes and far far too many selfies. But she kept saying 'dont post them (my ex) will know where we are and come and find me!' my other colleagues found this weird but funny. 

I'm going to give her a gift, a little bear and a card to just give her something nice. 
Im debating telling her in our playful coded langauge that i like her and i suspect that she likes me to. 

But, i dont know if its worth it or if I'm imagining things. She also said that we will meet still and hang out. 

Am i being dumb?

I never thought I‚Äôd sell a time machine before I sold a Prius.

But that‚Äôs life at ChronoAuto. I used to sling mid-range sedans at a strip mall dealership off Route 9. Now, I sell time travel. And let me tell you something: people are a lot pickier about the past than they are about cup holders.

The showroom looks like any other dealership‚Äîshiny floors, bad coffee, motivational posters with words like EXCELLENCE and DESTINY‚Äîbut instead of Ford Fusions and the occasional hybrid, we‚Äôve got rows of ChronoCruisers, T99 Epoch Elites, and the budget-friendly GigaHatchback (great for history majors and drunk bachelors looking to ‚Äústop themselves‚Äù from texting their exes).

‚ÄúCan I interest you in the new T99?‚Äù I ask a nervous-looking couple standing by the floating model near the window. ‚ÄúFour-dimensional navigation, built-in translator for pre-English eras, and leather seats that adjust to the curvature of spacetime. You‚Äôll never feel gravitational fatigue again.‚Äù

They exchange glances. The guy clears his throat. ‚ÄúWe were thinking more... Jurassic. Something sturdy. In case of dinosaurs.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I say, nodding like that‚Äôs not the most absurd sentence I‚Äôve heard this week. ‚ÄúIn that case, you‚Äôll want something with Theropod detection and a cloaking field. I‚Äôd suggest the Epoch Elite. Comes with a temporal roll cage. No one wants to get eaten in high-def.‚Äù

Behind me, Chad‚Äîour resident Time Fleet Gold Club Member and smug jackass‚Äîsnickers as he closes a deal with a woman in yoga pants who says she just has to relive Coachella 2006. Chad used to sell Teslas. Now he sells memories, and he‚Äôs insufferable about it.

‚ÄúHey Ricky,‚Äù he calls across the showroom. ‚ÄúTry not to undersell the liability waiver again. We don‚Äôt need another ‚ÄòRenaissance incident.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúThat peasant attacked me with a rake,‚Äù I mutter.

He grins and finger-guns me.

I take a breath, adjust my ChronoAuto polo, and try to remember my training. Listen to the customer. Understand their needs. Close the loop, close the deal.

I turn back to the couple.

‚ÄúSo‚Äîsafari in the Cretaceous, huh? Just making memories, or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The woman shifts her weight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to rescue our son.‚Äù

I blink. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur son. Timmy. He got ahold of my brother‚Äôs DIY fluxcore module. Vanished two nights ago.‚Äù

They hand me a photo: a pudgy kid in a Minecraft shirt, frozen mid-thumbs up.

‚ÄúOh. Wow. That‚Äôs, uh... that‚Äôs actually in the contract.‚Äù I flip through a laminated trifold. ‚Äú‚ÄòChronoAuto is not responsible for any unauthorized jumps made with third-party devices. Rescues, retrievals, or retrieval-related paradoxes are subject to our Premium Service Package, starting at‚Äî‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not made of money,‚Äù the father says. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve got my 401k, and some crypto.‚Äù

I glance toward the manager‚Äôs office. Sheila is watching me like a hawk in a power suit, sipping a protein shake and pretending not to telepathically scream CLOSE THE DEAL.

I clear my throat. ‚ÄúTell you what. We just got in a certified pre-owned T88 with a reinforced chassis, recall updates, and a decent quantum tether. No cloaking, but with a bit of luck and some cautious maneuvering, you should be able to get in, grab Timmy, and bounce before any prehistoric creature eats your face.‚Äù

They nod, and I‚Äôm halfway through the paperwork when an alarm goes off.

Everyone freezes. A red light flashes above the Return Port‚Äîa silver circle embedded in the floor like a rich person‚Äôs elevator. The last time that light went off, Chad came back missing his left eyebrow and with a suspicious tattoo of Cleopatra on his thigh.

With a VWUMMMMM, the port opens. Steam floods the floor.

A man steps out‚Äîbarefoot, wrapped in what looks like futuristic tinfoil. He‚Äôs soaked in blue slime and holding a space javelin.

‚ÄúWHICH ONE OF YOU SOLD ME A 2064 CHRONOCOUPE WITHOUT A NEXUS SHIELD?‚Äù he bellows, hurling the javelin across the room. It impales a DinoSafe‚Ñ¢ advertisement.

I raise my hand. ‚ÄúThat would be me. Ricky Ballentine. Certified Time Consultant. How can I help you today?‚Äù

He stomps toward me. ‚ÄúYou IDIOT. You know what happens in 2064?!‚Äù

I flip open the ChronoAuto Companion Guide. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Solar flare? Giant A.I. uprising? Collapse of reality?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll three! I had to barter my teeth to a robot king just to make it back here!‚Äù

‚Äú...Your actual teeth?‚Äù

He smiles.

Oh. No teeth.

Just a gaping void of gum.

‚ÄúOkay. Look. Why don‚Äôt we get you into a nice T95, on the house,‚Äù I say, gently pushing him toward the espresso machine, ‚Äúand you can chew some mashed bananas while I take care of the paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúI WANT DENTAL!‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

Sheila appears at my side like a shark in heels. ‚ÄúRicky. Office. Now.‚Äù




Sheila‚Äôs office smells like expensive candles and managerial disappointment.

She taps her nails against her desk, every click an accusation.

‚ÄúYou sold a ChronoCoupe with an expired flux capacitor.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said he was just going to see the Beatles.‚Äù

‚ÄúHE WENT TO A ROBOT WAR, RICKY.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, time travel is inherently unpredictable,‚Äù I say, defensively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the guy who hands over the keys. I don‚Äôt control their poor decisions.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do control whether or not they explode when they cross a temporal rift.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly once! And we issued a coupon.‚Äù

She sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you close more deals than Chad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I needed to hear,‚Äù I say, getting up. ‚ÄúNow if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a dino-kid rescue to finalize.‚Äù




The couple drives off in their certified pre-owned T88, armed with nothing but hope, a laminated map of the Mesozoic, and a can of bear spray that may or may not work on a velociraptor.

I return to the showroom just in time to hear Chad bragging to a middle-aged guy in a NASA shirt.

‚ÄúYou ever wonder what sex was like in the 1700s? With the GigaHatchback‚Äôs mood-syncing interior, it‚Äôs like candlelight and chlamydia all in one.‚Äù

I roll my eyes and head toward the break room, where Max‚Äîthe janitor and part-time time refugee from the 1400s‚Äîhands me a juice box.

‚ÄúGood sales today?‚Äù he asks in a thick accent, mopping up what I hope isn‚Äôt blood.

‚ÄúSomeone tried to kill me again,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúSo, yeah. Not bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than chamber pots.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarginally.‚Äù

Suddenly, the Return Port goes off again.

We run to the showroom.

Steam. Lights.

Then: Timmy.

The pudgy kid emerges holding a dinosaur egg like it‚Äôs a Faberg√©.

Behind him: his parents, muddy, triumphant, and reeking of prehistoric ferns.

‚ÄúWE GOT HIM!‚Äù the dad shouts. ‚ÄúAND A FREE SOUVENIR!‚Äù

Timmy lifts the egg. ‚ÄúI named it Carl.‚Äù

The egg shakes violently. A claw pokes out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be a dad,‚Äù Timmy whispers.

I glance at the paperwork.

Technically, no clause about smuggling Cretaceous lifeforms. Yet.

I look at Sheila. She shrugs. ‚ÄúIf it hatches in the parking lot, it‚Äôs not our problem.‚Äù

As I hand them their warranty packet, Chad walks by.

‚ÄúYou seriously let them bring back a dinosaur?‚Äù he scoffs.

I smirk. ‚ÄúWell, Chad, not everyone‚Äôs time travel dreams involve 18th century syphilis.‚Äù

Timmy‚Äôs egg explodes.

A tiny raptor emerges, blinking at the showroom lights. Then it screams.

Everyone panics.

I sigh, reach for the intercom, and calmly say, ‚ÄúMax to the front. We‚Äôve got another live birth.‚Äù


---

I‚Äôll be honest: I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd last a week here. Now I‚Äôve been Employee of the Month three times in a row. I‚Äôve time-traveled to Ancient Rome (great wine), 2099 New Vegas (terrible Wi-Fi), and the moon (quiet, very dusty). I even got my own company car‚Äîan upgraded GigaHatchback with memory foam seats and a sarcasm module.

Sometimes people ask me if it ever gets boring.

Boring?

Buddy, I sell machines that break causality.

I once watched a man travel back in time just to slap his younger self for dating a mime.

I saw a woman visit her late husband one last time, then quietly cry in the driver‚Äôs seat of her T95 for two hours.

I‚Äôve helped people change the course of their lives.

And sure, sometimes I almost die in the process.

But at the end of the day, whether they want to see dinosaurs, revisit their dead goldfish, or stop themselves from investing in crypto, I make dreams happen.

One time-warping lemon at a time.

Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a 2 p.m. appointment with a guy who wants to ‚Äúwatch himself be born.‚Äù

Should be fun.

Maybe I‚Äôll upsell him the raptor insurance.",2,1750628578.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I thought he died of skin cancer? I don‚Äôt understand! Why does everything I find just lead to more fucking questions? 

What did Dad mean by loving his children but despising his child?

I sat on the couch in silence. Not the kind of silence that makes every other sound louder, rather the silence that beats like a heart; a silence louder than any sound I had ever heard. 

Thousands of thoughts and questions stood tangled like metal cables in my head, occupying every neuron in my brain like an invasive vine. 

I stood up, dizzy and disoriented by the crying and sheer shock.

At this point I didn‚Äôt know if there were even enough answers for all the questions. I don‚Äôt think I wanted to stay around long enough to gather any answers. 

‚ÄúTrey, go to your room.‚Äù

A familiar voice shot through the air like a lighting bolt hitting me in the back and flowing through my whole body. 

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù

Turning around and there she was. Just how I remembered her. She had a ghostly fairness to her skin, her hair was so blonde it was almost white as clouds. She spoke softly and with intention. 

‚ÄúTreyton Jack, go to your room, you‚Äôre dreaming.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom I- you- You died? I-‚Äú

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly son. I am old now. I‚Äôm what your mind wants to believe, that I‚Äôm old and happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, is this really a dream?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is, you don‚Äôt think I actually died do you?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to think anymore. This didn‚Äôt feel like a dream, if so where did I go to sleep? was opening the box a part of it? Crawling through the attic? A dream would explain all of this insanity. 

Maybe I wanted to believe this was all a dream. Maybe I wanted to believe going to the hardware store was a dream too. Maybe this having all been a dream, I would wake up at my house in oklahoma, happy and safe. 

‚ÄúMom, I don‚Äôt know what to believe. I just wish this weren‚Äôt a dream. I wish Dad never made you leave, I wish we could have all been a happy family.‚Äù

Once again the familiar sting of tears swelling up started to grip me. 

‚ÄúI know son, I wish I could have seen you grow up, but you known couldn‚Äôt stand being here anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you have to leave momma? Couldn‚Äôt you have taken us with you?‚Äù

She started to sniffle, as in stage one weeping.

‚ÄúI feel so selfish that I didn‚Äôt. It haunts me every day.‚Äù

She put her head into her hands and started to cry, her blue lips poking out just below her pointy nose. 

‚ÄúI love you momma‚Äù I said going in for a hug.

We embraced. Her skin was cold and slimy, her hands were ice cold and her skin shrunk around her finger tips. 

Through tears with my face buried in her shoulder I said, ‚ÄúDo you remember when we were 5 and went to visit Grandma and Grandpa in Kentucky?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh- yes I do son.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou tripped and dropped Grandma‚Äôs apple pie?‚Äù

‚ÄúYe-Yes son I do, we all laughed didn‚Äôt we and Grandma made a n-n-new pie?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes momma, and we ate it with homemade ice cream around the fire place.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes son, such great memories.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you momma.‚Äù

‚ÄúI luh- luh- luh-v you too son‚Äù

She seemed unfamiliar with the words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way past your bed time Trey, it‚Äôs almost time to wake up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay mom, I‚Äôll just head to my room then.‚Äù

We squeezed each other tight and I departed for the stairs.

As I walked up the stairs I walked with dread. You see, I never met my Grandma and Grandpa, and even so they lived in Maine, not Kentucky. 

I walked back to my room, shutting the door and locking it. I turned off the lights but I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep. Especially not after that. 

I wanted to believe it was a dream so hard. But no matter how hard I tried to wake up, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. 

If this wasn‚Äôt a dream, then dad did kill himself, mom died having Haley, and Neil lied to me about dad‚Äôs death. What the fuck is going on? 

I had to get answers, and to me there was only one place to get them. Dad‚Äôs room.

Sneaking once again down the hallway, I tried the door to dad‚Äôs room. Locked. 

I needed to find a way to get this door unlocked. 

That‚Äôs when an idea came to me. 

When me and Neil were in our early teens, we would sneak into Dad‚Äôs room to steal cigarettes while he was passed out drunk. To unlock the door, we would use a bobby pin or something similar to turn the lock from the other side. Now I just needed a bobby pin, not to steal cigarettes, but secrets. 

I‚Äôm sure Hayley has some in her bathroom. 

Sneaking over back to my room and grabbing a bobby pin, I unlocked the door and peered inside. His room was just how I remembered when I left. No hospital bed, no monitors, nothing medical except for 2 or 3 heavily reused brown stained syringes on the ground next to the king sized bed. I never thought he‚Äôd get that low. 

I started searching the room. Dad seemed to become a hoarder of family heirlooms in his final days. Pictures of a once happy family scattered across boxes and broken frames; old VBS arts and crafts sitting beside them on window frames and desks. 

I searched for about ten minutes. Nothing. Just old family photos. It wasn‚Äôt until I searched his bedside drawer when I found something useful. 

A parchment, folded into a neat square in an otherwise empty drawer. It was coffee stained and the bottom left corner was burned. 

I unfolded it to see the words ‚ÄúGilbert and Sons Mining LLC.‚Äù stamped across the top. The handwriting was difficult to discern but it looked like a set of instructions. 

‚ÄúGrab a lock of hair, a vial of blood, and a picture or rough drawing (it does not have to be a good one, intention is all that matters). Carve a stone box from the stone of nearest cave and place each of the items inside with soil, sticks of an oak tree, and leaves. If you follow the instructions correctly, you should be able to see your wife again.‚Äù

Written below all of that in bold read, ‚ÄúOne other thing. It will demand a living sacrifice.‚Äù

The name at the bottom was signed ‚ÄúDavid Tiger.‚Äù

I knew that name. He was a native american man who worked with my dad for the mining company. He was also an unofficial medicine man for the local cherokee tribe members, though many considered his practice to be sponsored by evil spirits. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything you little shit stain.‚Äù

I whipped around and in the doorway stood dad, he was standing taller than he was alive. He looked like a corpse that had baked in the sun, his face covered in blood and red and white lumps folding over his body. 

‚ÄúWhy do you keep looking for answers Trey, there‚Äôs nothing for you in here.‚Äù

I stood there frozen in place. The all too familiar fear I knew and hated rushed me like a swift and powerful wind. 

‚ÄúDo you really want answers? Then find me.‚Äù As he spoke the flaps of skin from his blown open scalp would jump and flop like fish dripping with blood. 

‚ÄúWh- Where will you be.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe cave, you know wh-wh-which one.‚Äù His voice changed pitch and resembled a growling hound when he stuttered. 

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù I sheepishly muttered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you there.‚Äù 

He lumbered out of the hallway, and when I went out to look he had disappeared.

I had to sit down. 

I started to hyperventilate and shake violently. 

This wasn‚Äôt happening was it? If it was then why was it happening to me?

The cave my dad talked about was a natural cave near our house about a mile away deep in the woods. 

I wasn‚Äôt going to leave without Neil, but when I went to check his room he was gone. Where did he go? 

I considered just leaving back to Oklahoma, but after everything I‚Äôve seen thus far, if I didn‚Äôt find these promised answers I would lead a life of regret and dissatisfaction. But I would still be alive.

After prepping myself, I slipped on my shoes and began the hike to the old cave. 

The woods were pitch black. Shadows and silhouettes danced in the corners of my eyes. They no longer were the scariest things I knew. 

Halfway down the trail I stepped on something that crunched beneath my feet. Using my phone‚Äôs flashlight, it was revealed to be a human bone, a humerus to be specific. 

Spinning the view of the flashlight actually revealed hundreds of bones, possibly thousands. Small bones, big bones, children‚Äôs bones. Some had chunks of hairy greenish brown flesh still connected to them. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I spoke in a shaky whisper, ‚ÄúWhat..what happened here??‚Äù

Every step through the boneyard was met with a crunch. It felt disrespectful to step on what was essentially a mass grave. 

The bones started to dissipate, the ground crunching less and less. 

Eventually I beheld the gaping maw of the old cave. Vines had grown over the entrance and all along the outer walls of the cave. 

I parted the vines and continued walking. The esophagus of the cave was darker than anything I had ever not seen. 

Human hair covered the floor. All of it was coated in coagulated brown blood. 

Deeper into the cave I went. The air started to feel heavy, so heavy in fact I felt short of breath. 

That‚Äôs when I reached the end of the cave. 

Shining my phones flashlight revealed to me a nest of sort. It was comprised of twigs, hair, hay, and bones. 

Lying beside the nest on the right was a pile of hundreds of stolen family photos, each from different families across town. On the left is what shook me to my core. 

Four skeletons laid propped up, two adults, one teenager, and the skeleton of what had to be a small child. 

It was my family. The two adults still wearing their wedding rings, with the larger adult skeleton having pieces of the top part of its skull missing. Dad. 

‚ÄúDid you find what you were looking for?‚Äù Spoke Neil‚Äôs voice.

Turning around, I saw a figure standing 10 feet behind me. 

Shining my flashlight in its direction revealed, to my surprise that it was me. My face, perfectly replicated. 

‚ÄúWhat did you do to them.‚Äù I asked

‚ÄúThere could only be one.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid dad create you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I was here when man first created fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you have my face, then why don‚Äôt you sound like me.‚Äù

The imitation took a step closer. ‚ÄúBecause there can only be one.‚Äù

It started to move closer, slowly moving towards me. 

It switched its voice to Hayley, ‚ÄúI watched you grow up. I watched you all grow up. So innocent.‚Äù

It stepped closer, switching its voice again to Mom‚Äôs ‚ÄúFor years I planned on how to get you back here, my hunger became unbearable.‚Äù

It stepped closer still, its hands transforming into massive claws. It spoke again, this time in Mr. Smith‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúFor the past few days, I salivated at the thought of my limitless hunger becoming satiated.‚Äù

Stepping ever so closer, it switched voices again, only this time it used every voice it collected at the same time, resulting in a pained and barely legible cacophony of voices; as if I were standing at the gates of hell and could hear the agony of millions of sinners.

‚ÄúThere can only be one.‚Äù

It lunged at me. It ripped through the air like a beast towards prey. 

Survival took over and grabbing a rock I just barely swung in time to knock it down in mid air. 

This gave me a hopeless opening to run. 

I ran through the cave somehow not tripping on any of the rocks or slipping on the hair. 

The angered shriek of 1,000 familiar voices all at once echoed through the cave and loud thunderous footsteps started charging forward towards me.

Pushing through the vines and out of the Mouth of the beasts cave, I continued running. 

Bones crunched under my feet. Air was in limited supply but regardless I kept running. 

Behind me I heard grunting coming from the beast. Its footsteps accompanied by the crunching of bones. 

‚ÄúTREYYYYY‚Äù It screamed, I could almost pick out a few voices from the carnal desire in its screech. 

It continued down my path, only it was faster. 

Past the boneyard I could see my house in the distance, lit by a pole light. 

Then I felt long tendrils wrap around my abdomen, it squeezed as it flung me around like a rag doll. I hit the ground with incredible force. It had grown much taller but in the darkness I couldn‚Äôt make out anything more than its shape. It bit into my leg and I yelled out in pain. It moaned in ecstasy, having its hunger fulfilled. 

Full of adrenaline and having nothing to lose, I hit its gaping maw with all of my strength and it let out a deafening screech. 

I landed on the ground but immediately got up. I couldn‚Äôt give this thing another chance. 

I ran into the house and grabbed my keys. 

In the living room I heard a crash in the kitchen and saw the beast had broken through the wall in its murderous and hunger fueled rage. 

I burst through the front door, and ran to my car. My car started immediately and I peeled out as quickly as possible. 

Looking behind my shoulder while barreling down the driveway I saw what I the beast‚Äôs silhouette illuminated by the telephone pole light. 

It was tall, about as tall as a 20 year old pine tree. It was covered head to toe with wailing and shaking heads, some I had recognized, others I did not. 

I heard it‚Äôs wailing and shrieks all the way down the driveway. If there was at least one thing I could make out from its shrieks, it was one phrase.

Does anyone have any recommendations or pathways I should take for this? I really really don‚Äôt wanna sell it being a single Dad on a budget and this being my only gaming source.

Anything guidance would definitely be appreciated

It's been tough since I broke my silence last time; all those memories and thoughts rushed back in. I realized I left the door open for myself, quietly hoping things would be different, hoping our paths might cross again. I haven't fully moved on, and in a way, I hope this message brings me some closure. Maybe it's naive, but I don't want to leave anything unsaid.

My time here is winding down, just one more year... I want to make the most of it, without regrets or fear, and finally take some real risks.

With that in mind, if you're open to it, I'd love to share one last moment together. Dinner, coffee, a walk, even a run ‚Äì wherever you are, I'd like to meet you there. I know I don't deserve this, and you don't owe me anything, but this is my last, honest invitation, straight from my heart.

You meant so much to me, more than I ever showed or you'll ever know. I'd love to begin my farewell tour here with someone I still deeply care about. Not to ease my guilt or right my wrongs, but to honor the good we shared and close this chapter on a high note.

I know it might feel unfair for me to keep reaching out like this, but I've thought about it deeply. The past happened, and I want to be better. We're in different places now, and I'd love the chance to know who you are today, not just who we once were.

If you say yes, it would mean the world to me. If you need time, I completely understand. And if the answer is no, or if you prefer continued silence, I will truly respect that. I now understand the next steps I need to take: full acceptance.

If this is goodbye, thank you for everything. I've always missed you and what we shared. Our time together meant more to me than I ever expressed, and I'll always appreciate what you gave. I was just too immature to realize what I know now. It's hard to put it all into words, but I hope you can understand where my heart is coming from.

Whatever your decision, I hope you continue to find peace and joy wherever life takes you. Thank you for everything. Goodbye \_\_, take care.",2,1750628024.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I was wearing a wide brim upf 50 hat.

Sunscreen stats: spf 50+, ppd 26, pa++++

Skin shade: Fitzpatrick type 4 

How much I applied: 6 pumps to the face, 6 pumps to the neck, 4 pumps on each hand. (Much more than the recommendation which is 4 pumps for my face). 

Result: Little to no tanning on my face and neck. Hands were a different story - fingers were especially dark and the color matched the area of my arm where I had no sunscreen. I did not wash my hands after applying sunscreen and I did not rub or wipe them against any surfaces. When I got in the car I also noticed small white droplets on my nose, indicating the sunscreen had separated. 

Takeaway: This sunscreen may only work well in combination with other protective methods. My whole face and neck were well shaded by my hat, but my hands were fully exposed to the sun‚Äôs rays and ended up just as tan as my forearms, where I hadn‚Äôt applied sunscreen. If you‚Äôre going outside and the UV index is high, wear a stronger sunscreen and upf clothing. 

Editing to add: I bought this from Olive Young about 2 months ago, so the product is legitimate. ",2,1750627913.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False

My dad (who passed away many years ago) was there. We were in the house I grew up in as a teenager, which was a long time ago now. 

Out of nowhere, a huge crow showed up inside somehow. I knew it was a female crow, somehow, and it didn't seem weird to me at all in the dream. She hung out on the coffee table in the living room, and I sat on the floor and pet her while she checked out the water and peanuts I set out for her to snack on. She made happy little bird noises as I scratched her head and chest. A few times she'd hop onto my arm if I held it out, groom herself, then hop back down to the table. 

I don't think I realized in the dream that it had been storming or at least raining really hard until the dream did one of those smash cut things they do where you abruptly find yourself in another ""scene."" I was looking out the screen door to check the weather, with the crow riding on my arm. I thanked her for hanging out with me and told her good luck, then held open the door for her to leave if she wanted to. She flew over to the porch banister, assessed the rain, and then flew off. 

That's literally all I remember of that dream, but it was so real, and I was so genuinely delighted to get to just chill out with a cool bird that seemed to like me (I also just really like crows in general, so that might be all there is to it).

I feel a strike is inevitable and there needs to be more information and discussion around tangible ways to prepare and endure. The sooner everyone starts preparing the better outcome of holding out longer. I personally have been saving since October.  Out of necessity have been honing in my food savings cost. 

I have really learned to make as much from scratch and only spend on basic ingredients. I make my own bread, pasta, mayo, yogurt, salsa, hummus, tzatziki, mustard, brown sugar, paneer, ricotta, sausages to name a few. It‚Äôs so much cheaper and tastes better. I‚Äôve learned to buy bigger cuts of meat and turn into stewing beef, chops, steaks, medallions or ground beef. I tend to only buy things at Costco now that are on sale. From there I make a big batch of something and freeze the rest. I stopped buying anything processed; I gave up crackers and just resort to homemade bread now- which you can make croutons and breadcrumbs from. I save quite a bit pressure cooking my own beans rather than buying canned. Cooking takes longer but since I can‚Äôt afford to go out ever anymore I do have the time. Facebook marketplace also sells kitchen tools much cheaper. 

I‚Äôve learned that if you go to mom and pop grocery stores you can get produce cheaper than Costco or any chain grocery store. 

I don‚Äôt go out. I decline invites to coffee or parties. I gave up alcohol. I cut out beauty treatments of any kind including hair cuts. I do invite ppl over and I‚Äôll make a pizza. In some ways these austerity measures are isolating but I feel Covid kind of prepared me for cutting out spending and enjoying time around the house so I can save. It‚Äôs not forever. 

Anyways every dollar I save prepares me for standing my ground longer.

Our background:

House max of $650k
2 kids (4 and 6)
Cycling is important to me
Need good activities for the kids
Would love to be able to have a downtown to walk to for coffee or ice cream

We saw plenty of things for the kids (urban air, splash pads, Legoland, swim classes). We also went to , I think, old town Dublin near the library (amazing) and got some ice cream nearby. We went across a very cool suspension bridge and went to an indoor food court with a ton of different options.

Through the entire time there, it seemed very well kept, and pretty new. Our friends live in a new housing development which we spent a lot of time at.

I didn‚Äôt like all the thunderstorms and rain we had. Are those common? It was also just hot outside a lot of the days. Some times it would cool down a bit and it was ok to be outside, but not too much.

I guess my main question is finding stuff to walk to. It seemed like, besides near the library, you would need to drive everywhere. But maybe that‚Äôs because of where they lived?

He rode his motorbike to see me and he made most of the plans and took me to a place that he remembered me saying that I liked. The meeting was great.. he bought me a coffee and asked if i wanted any food aswell. We had a great catch up and I felt like there was lots of flirting. A few things that stood out to me though.. he made a comment about how ‚Äòmen and women can‚Äôt be friends‚Äô and gave me a weird look. 

It was my suggestion to play a silly little game ‚ÄòShag marry avoid‚Äô but work addition where you have to pick three people for the person to decide what they wanna do with them.. and he told me he‚Äôd avoid me üò≥ I was a little shocked by this‚Ä¶ I said to him ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe you would avoid me‚Äô. He replied with ‚Äòwell I can‚Äôt tell you that I‚Äôd marry you cos you know what you‚Äôre like.. you might think something‚Äô. But a few moments later, he said he would marry me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Then I asked him what he thought of this lady‚Äôs bum who had just walked in. He said he couldn‚Äôt see it properly. I ask him if my bum was better and he giggled and said ‚Äòwell I‚Äôve seen your ass properly‚Äô and then he realised what he had said because he had pretty much just told me he‚Äôs checked out my ass. 

Then he told me he was thinking about me the other night.. I joked and said ‚Äòhe should be thinking about me every night‚Äô. But he told me that he saw an advert for these ice sex toys that we had joked about before. 

Another moment.. I told him that I thought this other couple thought that we are a married couple and I touched his arm, hand and leg gently. He had a huge smile on his face. 

When we were about to leave, he went in for a hug and he kept a hold of me for longer than usual. 

Lastly, he actually got me a birthday card which is something he‚Äôs never done in the 3 years I‚Äôve known him. The card was sweet and just had my nickname that he always calls me, and then it said love from Dan xxx (bearing in mind he never sends kisses on text and has never used love from). 

I had the best time and we only met up for about 3 hours but I was in awe of him. He‚Äôs so smart and I could listen to him all day. This guys actions tells me he likes me but I‚Äôm not sure. Now, here comes the twist.. he‚Äôs married. And back to when we were playing the game.. I actually said to me ‚Äòshall we play a game?‚Äô.. he froze and went really still and said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm married‚Äô. It was so random and as if it caught him off guard.

To be honest, it wasn't popular. I understand why they removed it. However, at the same time, the Melon Burst with Peach Juice, rather than Passion Tea, was my go-to drink for the last few months leading up to the drink's discontinuation. Not only that, but they were also a great option to have before shifts started, without adding 20 grams of sugar to an espresso drink and without all the calories.

Under $650k
3+ br, 2+ bath
House
Garage
Good schools (kids are 4 and 6)
Walkability to some coffee shops or restaurants, or at least a close drive
Activities for the kids (trampoline park, pool, splash pad, playgrounds)
Good roads for road cycling (for me) is a plus

Of the four in the title, Rocky river and Hudson were our picks, but we realize we only saw a tiny portion of everything so I‚Äôm trying to get some more info from you all.

Lakewood has an amazing playground, but after driving down Detroit st and a few of the side streets, it seemed more congested than we would like. I think this has more of a city feel than we would want, but if there are other areas to look at, please let me know. 

Solon seemed way to spread out and not much different than where we currently live in Connecticut. The new playground they built is awesome, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough for us to move there.

Hudson seems awesome. We went to Heartwood Coffee and liked the area. It seems very accommodating to cyclists, everything looked nice and we loved the downtown area. It seems like my drive to work would be about 35 minutes, but I‚Äôm not sure how bad traffic would be (federal building in downtown Cleveland, by the rock and roll hall of fame).

Rocky river was great too. We checked out Erie Lake Coffee co. We greatly appreciated the lake effect which seemed to make things cooler yesterday. Rocky river seems pretty spread out as far as home prices go though, with some in the low 400k‚Äôs and then down the road is a mega mansion. I‚Äôve heard the restaurants there suck, but Lakewood is a close drive.

In Rocky river, Lakewood, and Hudson, we liked how people seemed to be fit there and we saw lots of people going for runs. We‚Äôre an active family so that‚Äôs important to us.

I have heard all the areas I mentioned can be snobby with the good schools and the people it attracts, I‚Äôve read about Rocky rivers school issues about the principal and some teachers too I think. Our kids are young now, so I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs an isolated incident that won‚Äôt be around in 8 years.

How much does the temp differ between Rocky river and Hudson? It was hot today in Hudson, with a small breeze‚Ä¶I dunno how much cooler Rocky river was though. What about the snow?

First things first. I really enjoy swimming. It's my favourite sport/workout and now that summer is back in full swing, I am out in the water whenever i can. While I was swimming, the sunscreen in my bag kinda of leaked and collected in the bottom. No matter, it's a silicone bag, liquids really don't matter. 

Thus, after getting out dripping wet and realising what had happened, I dried off the best I could, went to my grandparents place nearby to give my towel a rinse, clean my belongings and wash out my bag. I didnt want to lugg my dirty stuff home. Said and done. I leave my bag to dry out in the grass in the sun on their lawn while my swim suit and towel are drying on a clothes line outside, it was so hot today, they'd dry in the blink of an eye.

I hang out with my Oma and Opa, it's lovely, coffee and crosswords, our favorite pass time together. Granted, I suck at crosswords but my Oma is a real wizz at them. After a while I go back outside to check on my bag and found it torn to shreds by their mow robot. My grandparents are both 80+ they don't mow their own lawn anymore, so my parents set them up with one. I completely forgot that the thing was doing its rounds and thus left my good swimming bag out to be shredded. 
And I laughed about it. It was so ridiculously stupid of me and I laughed about it. The thing was done, it looked like a bear had mauled it. It was a nice expensive bag, too but I felt no pinch of sadness or regret. 

I can therefore conclude that I think I might have done it. I am not attached to my things anymore.

1lhygl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1lhygl0/tips_for_first_time_visitors_from_a_first_time/,"Tips for first time visitors from a first time visitor from the US - Visited Seville, Granada, Cordoba & Barcelona","I am going to provide information and tips based on my experience and observations. I did not know a few of these so hope this helps someone. Some may not agree with what I say and it is fine. These are again my personal observations and tips.

Also this is based on my visits to Seville, Granada, Cordoba and Barcelona. I will provide my personal viewpoint on each. I live in United States (NJ) so some of my comparison are based on where I live. I traveled with my wife and adult son for 10 days (really 9 days) just for context.

Overall, Spain was amazing. The food was healthier and less expensive than in the US. Actually the majority of things were less expensive than what I am used to paying. Lots of history and they are proud of their history. I can see why people want to move to Spain. The only negative is how hot it gets (more on that).

My observations and things to know:

\-No one drinks Sangria except tourists. Ask for Tinto de Verano which is what the locals drink and is better. I also had one local beer (Chris Campo) in Seville which was very good. I also tried Estrella but like Chris Campo better.

\-Spaniards love their ""cold cuts"". I did not know this ahead of the trip. You will see many shops and restaurants that sell this. It is good! Ask for Iberian ham. I am pretty sure these cuts are a lot healthier than what is sold in the US. European nations ban many preservatives and toxic ingredients from their food unlike the US. Also their bacon is cleaner and has less fat.

\-I also noticed that Spaniards love gelato as there were many of these shops all over.

\-There are many pharmacies in Spain. I would say it is the equivalent of the number of Starbucks but maybe more. I think I saw one in every block or two. Ladies: some of the beauty products are cheaper than in the US.

\-I may get some arguments on this but I noticed that most Spaniards are not ""polite"" or very friendly. They are very serious and some don't say ""excuse me"" or ""thank you"" or ""please"".¬† I know some say people in the US are not either but I noticed it is more over there. Again just my observation. Maybe this is common in Europe.

\-Locals eat dinner late (8-9pm). Some places close during the afternoon and reopen 7-8pm so finding a place to eat before 7pm is challenging (really only saw this in Granada).

\-Sun sets almost at 10pm. I did not know this. I loved it. Having more daylight is always a plus.

\-With that, I noticed most places close during the afternoon and reopen 7-8pm. I only noticed this in Granada. Barcelona was always open from what I remember. I don't really recall if this happened in Seville.

\-Note with coffee shops, they don't open very early like they do in the States. Some open at 7 or even 8am. If you wake up early, you may not find a coffee shop open before 7am.

\-Coffee portions are small compared to US. However their coffee is good (caf√© con leche - coffee with milk).

\-Spaniards say ""vale"" a lot. If you are speaking to them in Spanish, you will notice this. I think it means ""OK"" but may have multiple meanings. Maybe a Spaniard can comment on this.

\-Things to know about eating out especially restaurants as there are major differences between the US and Spain:

\- Restaurants don't give free water. If you ask for water, they will bring you bottled water which you pay for.

\- Unless it is a place that you pay upfront, restaurants do not automatically bring you the check. You have to ask for it or you will be waiting there forever. Just ask for ""la cuenta"" when you are ready to pay. This is nice as they don't rush you unlike most US restaurants.

\- There is no tipping. It is not expected. This right here saves you a lot of money eating out. If you pay by credit card, the machines don't even have a tip option (that I am aware of as this was never presented to me except one restaurant which was in a tourist area). If you want to leave a tip, you need to have cash.

\- You hear about pickpockets a lot. However, I never felt unsafe nor felt the need to be very protective in case of pickpockets in Seville and Granada. Unfortunately, I almost got pickpocket (my backpack) in Barcelona but thanks to someone in our tour group who noticed the guys trying to open my backpack, nothing was stolen.¬† Try to get put your backpack in front of you. I never kept my wallet in my backpocket either. Same with your phone. Front pockets only.

\-One thing I noticed is that the majority of Spaniards are fit/thin. You don't really see overweight Spaniards at all. I assume it is the healthier foods plus the fact that they walk a lot.

One tip that I was given and it was not a good one is regarding cash. When I inquired about how much to bring, many said cash is not needed as you can pay everything with a card. While it is true almost everyone has a card reader, not having any cash will likely be an issue. I was going to bring about $100 converted to Euros but my wife insisted that was too little and suggested $300. Fortunately I listened to her and brought $300 converted to Euros. \[Tip: get the money exchanged in the US; most banks will make the exchange; doing this in Spain will cost you a lot.\] In any case, you need cash when buying from street vendors or paying something low priced. \[Are you really going to pay using a credit card for something that cost 1 or 2 Euros?\] Also I had one cab driver whose card machine was having an issue. Fortunately I had cash so I paid using that. Finally, we booked a tour but were unaware that the tickets to the Sagrada Familia was not included with the tour. We had to pay cash for the tickets to the tour company but did not have enough Euros. Fortunately we had some US dollars that we converted but the exchange rate was very poor \[which is why I recommend doing this before heading to Spain\]. I cannot tell you how much cash \[Euros\] to take but $300 for a 10 day trip was not enough. Again this is for 3 people. Worse case, you can always convert it back to dollars or use the remaining at the airport.

Another bad tip that I saw is that people don't wear baseball caps to look less like a tourist. The sun is beaming in Spain. It is hot. I did not wear a baseball cap every day but did wear one on some days. I noticed many people wearing baseball caps so bring your cap or a hat.

Regarding the sun, we just went in early June. Seville was hot but not humid. Definitely more humid in Granada and it was super hot in Barcelona. Wear sunblock every day! You cannot escape the sun all day. One recommendation is to buy the sunblock in Spain. The products are better with less toxic chemicals than the sunblocks sold in the US. Buy them at the pharmacies which are everywhere.

My thoughts on these cities:

Seville - Beautiful city. Clean. Good mass transit system that is clean and inexpensive (tram ‚Ç¨1.40 per person if I remember correctly).  Hottest time of the day is 5-6pm.¬† Easy to walk around. Scooters and bikes are popular but this is not unique to Seville; it is everywhere in Spain. Quiet besides tourist. It is hot but not humid so a plus.

¬†Granada - More urban. Many Arab restaurants and shops. More dense. More graffiti. Seems very hard to drive around. There is also a Tram but we did not use. Smaller than Seville. Very tight streets in the central area. Definitely more to see in the central plus the Alhambra. Very clean. Definitely see more Arab influence as many Arab restaurants and shops in the area.

C√≥rdoba - a city in Andalusia, Spain, which we took a train to from Granada. Older city with lots of historical sites. We visited the Roman temple of Cordova, Mosque-Catheral, and Alcazar de los Reyes Cristianos.

Barcelona - Very large city with about 5 million population but a highly visited city. This is more city like. It is still clean and little homelessness that I noticed. More open space so no narrow streets for the most part. Lots to see and lots of tourists. It is hot and humid. Staying in the shade is a must. Again wearing sunblock is a must. They have a grid style setup for the most part. I do love that their blocks are not square or rectangle like most US cities. Its octagon shape. 

Cell Service:

You can purchase eSIMS (you will need to check compatibility with your phone). I have an iPhone 15 and used Saily which worked. It is a little bit of a pain to setup but worked fine. I purchased 10GB plan for the 10 days \[I only used 8 GB during my trip so this was perfect as long as you are not watching YouTube or Instagram a lot\]. If you use my referral code: MIKEOD1737 you will get $5 off your first purchase.¬† \[Note that this gives you a data plan. You cannot make or receive phone calls nor send/receive SMS text messages. iMessages work since it uses data.\]

Not required but you may want a VPN especially if you are connecting to WiFi networks primarily. Those are not secure so you should have a VPN. I used Surf Shark which worked fine. One thing I noticed is that it rarely connected to Spanish servers but that is fine. Not a big issue. If you use my [link](https://surfshark.club/friend/Pn4MFfkV), you can get up to 3 months free assuming you keep the plan for at least 31 days.

Finally, I would recommend getting GeoBlue international health insurance. Typically Your health insurance will not cover services outside the US unless it is a true medical emergency. GeoBlue offers inexpensive health insurance for the duration of your trip. For example, it cost $137 to cover 3 of us for 10 days. Just search for GeoBlue.

Ask me anything. My wife and I really loved Seville and can easily see ourselves living there (doesn't mean we will move but we think we would love living there). Although the dollar has taken a beating, the majority of things are less expensive than in the US. Cabs are definitely less expensive than NYC. Never had a need for an Uber so cannot comment on that. 

Also learn some Spanish words and respect their culture & customs. Americans tend to think they are entitled and think everyone should kiss their behinds. Spaniards will not play that.",8,1750625857.0,GoingToSpain,8,0.83,False

I loved this book. 

Like many I was a bit lukewarm on Authority although it‚Äôs grown on me more and more. My biggest problem with the previous book was that it was quite a conventionally written sequel to a pretty experimental book- not a complaint I have for Acceptance. Finding a book that uses 1st, 3rd, AND 2nd person perspective (and utilizes all three well) is like finding $20 in a pair of jeans while you‚Äôre out, just so rewarding and exciting.

The structure of this book also slightly confirms a suspicion of mine that Authority had to be written more conventionally since it takes place completely outside of Area X and thematically there probably should be a writing distinction between the two. Book three giving us multiple time periods while also revealing AreaX distorts time is brilliant.

I loved Saul and desperately just wanted this man to be left alone to tend to his lighthouse and his relationship with Charlie and his quasi surrogate daughter (I‚Äôd probably read a drama about found family starring those three).

The biologist reveal was peak cosmic horror, I felt like I was watching a David Lynch movie in the best way, speaking of‚Ä¶

S&SB were super interesting and gave me major Twin Peaks vibes, Henry and Suzanne were perfectly cryptic, insufferable and malicious.

The ending could not have been more perfect, never knowing if AreaX is gone is. I‚Äôve already ordered the 4th book and I‚Äôm very intrigued as to how they‚Äôre going to follow this up as it seems like the perfect ending (but I‚Äôve also heard it‚Äôs not the most conventional sequel which also tracks). 

I still don‚Äôt love control as a character (he‚Äôs not bad just kind of bland imo) but I found his ending perfect and beautifully sad. I also enjoyed the psychologist‚Äôs tragic ending, everything was perfectly unfinished in a way.

I don‚Äôt think it was perfect, like I mentioned I‚Äôve never been much of a Control fan, and while Grace‚Äôs inclusion was interesting she felt underutilized. It probably doesn‚Äôt reach the heights of the first one for me, but big fan of it nonetheless. ",7,1750625799.0,SouthernReach,2,1.0,False

1lhyctq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1lhyctq/comprehensive_epic_universe_review/,Comprehensive Epic Universe Review,"Background: two days at Epic (28 May and 7 June). Me and my fianc√©e (in our late 20s) travelled from the U.K. to visit and this was our second trip to the Orlando theme parks.

Overview: on our first Epic day, we focused on Celestial Park, Berk, and Dark Universe. On our second day, we started with Harry Potter, then Super Nintendo World, before hitting a few of our favourites across the park (Stardust, Hiccup‚Äôs, and Curse of the Werewolf) Completed everything in the park across the two days, except for Fyre Drill and The Untrainable Dragon.

Rides (loosely ranked):

1. Stardust Racers: my favourite ride in Orlando. Unrelenting, exhilarating, and just a true physical masterpiece. Rode the Yellow side in the evening (\~7pm) and the Green side at night (\~9.30PM). No major differences across the sides, but the nighttime experience is a step above, esp with the changing lights on each train. The duelling nature of the two trains and how they weave between each other adds a whole new twist and level of enjoyment. Better than Velocicoaster imo. My fianc√©e, who is not a major roller coaster person, very bravely tried the first time and somewhat enjoyed the tamer parts of the ride, but it was a little too intense for her to try the second nighttime ride.
2. Hiccup‚Äôs Wing Gliders: probably the second best ride in the park for me, and possibly the best for my fianc√©e. A euphoric and uplifting adventure with the theming and music adding a lot to a mid-thrill level coaster. The nighttime lighting details add a lot here too. The line can be a bit gruelling in the heat of the day as it‚Äôs primarily outdoors, but despite the long afternoon wait on our first ride, we never felt shortchanged (more on this later when we discuss SNW). Our nighttime ride was a 10-15m wait. If you're a HTTYD fan, you will enjoy the story of the ride even more. If you were to compare this ride to others in Orlando, you can look at Slinky Dog at Hollywood Studios, although Slinky is less thrilling and generally more gentle. You can kind of see it like Hagrid's (from Islands of Adventure) little brother in some ways too.

In our opinion, these two rides are very clearly ahead of the others in terms of ranking. The next few can be interchanged depending on the time of day, length of line, and mood.

3. Battle at the Ministry: we got lucky and only waited \~45m to ride, despite getting into line around midday! As most of us on this group will know, the Ministry area and queue is extremely impressive and easily the best set Universal has built across their three major HP rides. The queue was interesting enough for a 1-1.5 hour wait (much better than Mario Kart / Donkey Kong). The ride itself was pretty good - better than Gringott‚Äôs / Forbidden Journey (although for us, FJ has somewhat lost its charm after multiple rides on it + various faults in the ride, so maybe this is unfair for a first time rider, who might LOVE FJ). Fun storyline, great mix of screens, animatronics and real-life sets. Very impressive Death Eater animatronics. The only major aspect missing is a thrill, whether that be a larger drop, or some other twist, but I believe this is something they are working on. Overall, we left very happy with this ride, although that is likely significantly influenced by the short queue.

4. Monsters Unchained: pretty good experience overall. Although the first half of the queue was relatively dull (somewhat reminscent of Haunted Mansion from Magic Kingdom), things picked up in the inside rooms, which kept us somewhat entertained. The pre-show was fun. The ride itself is very decent and clearly focuses on jump scares, exaggerated by very high quality animatronics (although we would argue that the Death Eater animatronics from HP were better than any single animatronic in Monsters). Personally, I didn‚Äôt really enjoy how often we were lying on our backs in this ride, I don‚Äôt think it added much, and I would have preferred leaning forward and ‚Äúflying‚Äù like you do on HP & the Forbidden Journey (which uses the same ride mechanic), but my fianc√©e wasn‚Äôt too bothered by it. Overall a very decent ride and some great aspects, however, would prefer some more thrills and less ‚Äúlying back‚Äù.

5. Curse of the Werewolf: very fun ride that is a little short. One of the few we got to ride twice, once in the evening, and once at night near closing. Nighttime was better due to the spooky nature and cool lighting of Frankenstein Manor. The spinning aspect add a lot to this ride and make it extra fun. The direction of movement depends on the weight distribution between the two 2x2 rows of seats, which mean that each ride will be slightly different. The track is also decent overall and relatively thrilling. Queue can be a bit gruelling in the sun.

6. Mine-Cart Madness: pretty fun ride with the dual-track adding a lot and giving it extra thrill, although I wonder how this changes upon repeat. A bit short and a very boring line, but definitely the best ride in SNW and fun overall.

7. Mario Cart: Bowser‚Äôs Challenge: I would rank this lower if I could tbh. One of the most boring lines across the park for a very poor payoff. The AR is not great and largely ruins the fun of the track. Showing each rider how to put their visor on properly also wastes unnecessary attendant time and makes the line longer. The track itself is fine, although not great - completely or largely flat if I remember correctly. That‚Äôs about it. Not worth the current 1.5-2hr+ wait in the slightest, unless you are a huge Mario fun or maybe for children/young teens.

8. Constellation Carousel: fairly nice. A traditional carousel with some minor modifications, i.e., each vehicle moving up and down and 360 degrees, alongside the standard merry-go-round. The creatures you can ride on are somewhat interesting and add some visual attraction. Length and music are fine. We only got to do this in the daytime. If we had managed to try it in the nighttime (which looked pretty fun with the cool evening lighting), it might have honestly been higher than Mario Kart on this list.

9. Dragon Racer‚Äôs Rally: not great tbh. My fianc√©e didn‚Äôt particularly like the motion of this ride and felt that it was a bit unsafe. I didn‚Äôt like the fact that there were only three rounds where the vehicles rise up and down - it was far too short. The ride ended before it really began. Not worth waiting anything more than 20-25m in my opinion.

10. Yoshi‚Äôs Adventure: the perfect digestion break as you emerge out of Toadstool Cafe. Worth no more than 15m waiting at best. This is a very simple ride that takes you on a brief tour across SNW. It is probably best compared to Magic Kingdom‚Äôs PeopleMover, although that is slightly longer and arguably better. Genuinely only worth going on if the line is super short, otherwise, you are not missing anything by skipping this one.

Shows: We only got to see Le Cirque Arcanus and it was awesome! Great mix of theatricals, music, stage props, and screens. I‚Äôve only seen the first movie in the Fantastic Beasts series and that was enough to help contextualise the show, although it is not necessary. Enjoyable experience overall and made us realise that we should have prioritised seeing The Untrainable Dragon too - oh well, next time! Highly recommend seeing at least one of these if you‚Äôre visiting - Le Cirque was clear step above the original shows at Universal Studios and I hear The Untrainable Dragon is similar.

Food:

* Meteor Cafe (Celestial Park): we had lunch here and both enjoyed it. My fianc√©e had the Vegan Sausage and Peppers handheld, which came with fries. Was nice and flavourful and I was happy to hoover up whatever she couldn‚Äôt finish. I had the Chopped Chicken Salad, which was delicious and pretty large as salads go.
* Star Sui Bao (Celestial Park): I tried the Chicken Kimchi Bao. Was more of a mini chicken sandwich than a traditional bao, but it was good. I liked the flavours and it was decently filling for a snack. Really hit the spot after a night ride on Stardust!
* Comet Dogs (Celestial Park): my fianc√©e tried the Smoky Carrot Dog, of which I had a couple of bites. She liked it, I thought it was okay. To be fair, the feta and the ube bun went really well together. Not the biggest fan of the glazed carrot in the middle though.
* Frosty Moon (Celestial Park): one of the best quick service locations in the park imo. Both the Birthday Cake and Chocolate Chip cookie are rich, decadent, and fantastic. Just as good fresh as they are the morning after with your coffee. Absolutely delicious - highly recommend. We tried the Vegan Vanilla ice cream too, we both liked it. Maybe a little too sweet, but that's not much of a problem for us!
* Spit Fyre Grill (Berk): I tried the Dragon Fire Chicken Spire Mac & Cheese Cone. Pretty good, although a bit heavy on the bread and low on the filling imo. One positive was that the filling had chicken distributed throughout it, rather than just on top.
* Toadstool Cafe (SNW): nice theming and decor inside, but the dishes my fianc√©e and I tried were pretty underwhelming. She tried the Super Mushroom Soup, which was fine, but nothing great. I had Chef Toad Herb Chicken Special. It was far from special. To be fair, the white lemon sauce it came with was pretty good, but the rest, fairly ordinary, especially for the price point.
* Yoshi‚Äôs Snack Island (SNW): my fiancee tried the Green Shell Calzone. It was essentially a small puff pastry filled with some vegan sausage, cheese, and marinara. She said it was fine but she probably wouldn't get it again as it wasn't worth the price, but it was worth trying it to know. Looked a bit small to me, especially consisdering the price point.

Pretty happy with the food choices overall, especially compared to many other parks. Need to try more of the sit-down places next time!

Worlds:

* Celestial Park was the perfect centre point for the park and had plenty of stuff to eat and do as you dive into the different realms within each separate area. It was refreshing to have a centrepiece to return back to after your adventure in a particular world, and in that way, the layout of this park is arguably better than the other two Universal parks, and most Disney parks (except maybe Magic Kingdom). Celestial Park is also lovely to walk around in after the rest of the portals close and particularly magical at night with the different lighting and the beams of light coming from each portal and joining in the sky.
* Berk was the largest World and super well themed. I barely remember the first HTTYD film and am not really a fan, but I really enjoyed walking around the lands and seeing all the different thematic elements. The kinectic nature of Hiccups Wing Glider's trains racing all around you as you walk, combined with the impressive dragon animatronics, and intricated details (like the dragon tails sticking out), and the various mountains across the World - it truly is impressive.
* Dark Universe is a bit small, but Frankenstein's Mansion looks pretty impressive whenever you see it. At night, this World truly comes alive, with eerie lighting creating shadows across the Mansion and throughout the whole area. Coupled with the erupting fire from the Burning Blade Tavern every 15 minutes and you have quite a cool, spooky atmosphere.
* Super Nintendo World looks amazing, especially in the daytime. The colours really pop and the theming is immaculate across the World. If you're a Mario / Donkey Kong fan, this World is an absolute treat. Lots of stairs though. And very boring lines for both Mine-Cart Madness and Mario Kart.
* HP World: Wizarding Paris looks pretty cool and very reminscent of the real city (fortunately without the smells). Truly does feel like you've hopped into a European city centre. The line and area for Battle at the Ministry is probably the best set that Universal has built in their Orlando parks (if not globally). Impressive overall.

Overall: an awesome park and most definitely worth the visit - two days is highly recommended to get the most out of this park. Other than the mostly great rides, the themeing across the entire park is extremely impressive. Combined with (mostly) great food, and it becomes quite a strong overall package.

Disney is gonna definitely be feeling the pressure and i'm super interested to see what sort of dent this makes in terms of Orlando theme park market share. If you combine two days at Epic with a day each at Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios Florida, and Volcano Bay, that is a 1 week break done. Will some groups of visitors be skipping Disney altogether now? Forget the Disney families...

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I‚Äôve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House.¬†

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word¬†**homebody**¬†in the dictionary, you‚Äôd see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s.¬†

I‚Äôve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I‚Äôm being honest, but I‚Äôve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it‚Äôs been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I‚Äôve been everywhere and I‚Äôve seen a lot. I‚Äôve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I‚Äôve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I‚Äôve probably been there.¬†

This time around I‚Äôm looking for something different. I‚Äôm looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm trying something on my own terms. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they‚Äôve been married for 70 years and they‚Äôve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don‚Äôt meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness.¬†

But I \*am\* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that. I know a connection when I see it, when I feel it. The question is, will one come my way?",2,1750625374.0,cf4cf,0,0.75,False

This is the sequel to an earlier script I wrote, linked above. I had no idea this would turn into a full-blown series. I'm glad it did. This took me back to some of the afternoons and late nights I spent as a lonely teen reading monster girl fiction online (for the plot, of course). Looking back on it, they kind of were an important part of my adolescence. Beyond all the jokes, beyond all the smut, beyond all the memes and shenanigans, they were something I found comfort in. Many of them were true works of art.

It seems several of the old haunts were deleted or taken down. And many of the writers I remember have long since disappeared. Although my masters are gone, we walk the same path, and above us hangs one moon. The memories of their works still linger, vivid as the day I first learnt what an arachne was and went, ""What the fuccckkkk?! Who dreamt this up, and WHY?!""

The things their prose taught me are etched into the ink of my pen. I will remember. And I will write. Until one day, I too must sheathe the old sword and fade away into the forgotten mists of the internet. And then, I hope someone else somewhere picks up the sword, smiles, mutters ""Fuck it"", and carries on the Good Fight.

Guys, I'm being honest when I say this script probably wouldn't exist without you. Reading your comments inspired me to write a continuation. I see each one of you as a collaborator in this script even if you don't agree with the way I've written things. I'm grateful to you all, and I sincerely- from the bottom of my heart- hope that each and every single one of you gets taken by a gorgeous dragon girl/guy to be loved and cherished forever (or any other species of your choice).

Thank you. Y'all are awesome.

**SCRIPT:**

Hey, you.

*(SFX: Dull thud. Flapping of wings.)*

I knew I recognised you from the sky. Enjoying coffee without me? How could you?

Hey hey hey, don‚Äôt get up! Where are you going? *Why* are you going?

Wimp! Wait up!

Hey, wimp, I‚Äôm just trying to- (frustrated sigh, followed by a deep breath)

*Sweetie.* Don‚Äôt leave your new wife all alone by herself in a big city. It‚Äôs not very chivalrous of you.

Well, one- I won‚Äôt burn down my own city even if I‚Äôm capable, and two- I *am* your wife. Even if you are still in denial.

(Pitying) Oh, *sweetie.*

You are *such* a tsundere. Just like the male leads in your novels.

Don‚Äôt make that face. I‚Äôm just as disgusted as you that I had to- I had to say that word. And it‚Äôs your fault, because I learnt it from your book.

Well, the fact that I- the queen of all dragon kind, de facto ruler of this realm- would stoop to your level and sully my speech with the rampant brain rot that plagues the masses, should in itself speak volumes about the affection I have for-

Wimp! Don‚Äôt you walk away from me! How dare you? I wasn‚Äôt done speaking.

You do realize I tolerate this level of- of sass and bratty behaviour from you simply because I find it amusing, yes?

Do you not feel the collar around your neck? Did you not see it reflected in the glass of that lovely caf√© you went to without me?

Yes. You don‚Äôt need a collar, because I marked your cheek with that lovely little scar. But I want you to wear a collar anyway.

You think I‚Äôm doing this to punish you? (Dryly) Gee. I wonder what could possibly make you think that.

Your collar is made of gold. A very rare and special kind of gold. Heavy enough to remind you of your status, light enough to be worn comfortably *all* the time. And the intricately etched designs are emblems of my house. So everyone who sees you will know you‚Äôre a royal pet. (Smug) *My* pet.

You know, I can always just clip a chain on it- a leash- and then walk you all the way back to the castle. Would you like that?

(Smug) You sure? Might even give you some much-needed inspiration for your next novel.

(Amused laughter) Oh, your eyes! It‚Äôs like you are glaring daggers of fire at me! Such a fierce little pet I have. Fierce, and cute.

Well yeah, you *are* my husband. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs different from being a pet....?

Wimp- (sighing) *Sweetie.* You have to understand. You‚Äôre a human. I‚Äôm a dragon, and a queen at that. You‚Äôre here as a refugee because your city was conquered. I was the one who did it, but let‚Äôs not stress about the details now. For all intents and purposes, you‚Äôre my legal property. Indefinitely. Now, I‚Äôm.....I‚Äôm quite fond of you and all, but your station in life is to be my pet. That is what you are.

Awww, I think it‚Äôs romantic too! Thanks, darling.

Yeah. I know you were being sarcastic. That‚Äôs your second favourite thing to be.

The first is being my pillow, of course! Every night, you snuggle up so close to me, it‚Äôs like you want to be absorbed inside me. Kinda creepy, not gonna lie, but I won‚Äôt really judge you if that‚Äôs one of your-

Now now, don‚Äôt say that. You do have a choice. You can always sleep on the sofa by yourself. You don‚Äôt *have* to snuggle with me in my bed.

Yes? I know my room gets cold at night. And?

*Please.* I have to keep an eye on you. I have to make sure you don‚Äôt do something silly. I can‚Äôt allow you to sleep somewhere else.

A ploy? There is no ‚Äúploy‚Äù, darling, elaborate or otherwise. You are simply one of my possessions, and I want you in my bedroom.

Oh, pet. You know I enjoy your little tantrums. (Playful, adoring) You‚Äôre just the cutest thing ever when you pout! Awwww! Come here, wimp. Let Mistress give you a hug!

Too bad I wasn‚Äôt asking. Mmnn this feels nice, doesn‚Äôt it?

Well maybe I won‚Äôt ‚Äúactively try‚Äù to crush your ribs the next time if you come willingly. (Sighing) Always playing hard to get. (Whispering softly) Always making me worry.

I may have given you permission to roam freely about the city, but I wish you‚Äôd tell me before leaving the castle. That‚Äôd be nice, you know?

(Smiling gently) Mhmn. I suppose it doesn‚Äôt matter. I seem to have a way of always finding you, don‚Äôt I?

Hey....what‚Äôs that in your pocket?

No. It‚Äôs not nothing. Give it here.

Oh yes yes yes, I do have to do this! A folded manuscript discreetly tucked away in your coat pocket, huh? You really thought you could hide this from me?

You can never hide a thing from me, my silly little wimp. But I wonder what this could possibly be. (Coy) You weren‚Äôt writing me a love letter, were you? A way to confess how you *really* feel? That would be- (sighing wistfully)- oh, that‚Äôd be *sooo* cute!

Hey, wait a minute. This- this is too long for a letter. Hey. This looks like a....draft for a story?

Secretly writing a new story, are you? Well. I guess it‚Äôs not so secret anymore. (Mischievous) If you want this back, then you‚Äôll have to do something for me.

Oh, it‚Äôs not too difficult. Might sting a bit for you though (giggling lightly). Well, wimp, I want you to wrap your arms around me for once. And I want you to look into my eyes. Deeply. And then....I....

Wait a minute. The title of your manuscript says.....‚ÄúReptiles.‚Äù?

Huh. And you begin the story with, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the queen of reptiles. And I- (frowning)- I just wanted to live freely.‚Äù

(Unamused) That‚Äôs- that‚Äôs the first line.

(Sighing) Well, that‚Äôs just hurtful, darling. I‚Äôm the queen of dragons, not reptiles. Change that.

It‚Äôs not about me? Whom are you trying to fool?

It‚Äôs written in first person. That is evidence enough. (Folding her arms) And frankly, I don‚Äôt think I care for this particular story.

Whatever. Do as you please. Just make sure you‚Äôre present at the banquet tonight by eight. Or I *will* hunt you down and you won‚Äôt enjoy it. (Voice dropping) Trust me....you don‚Äôt want to make me upset.

The banquet is in honour of the recent annexation of your city. As my new husband, you are required to attend the event with me.

Fine. Attend as my property then. I don‚Äôt care. I may be lenient with you, but let‚Äôs not forget the nature of our relationship.

(Low, cold, assertive) You hold no power here. You belong to me. You always have. The only reason you‚Äôre not in the castle dungeon, is because I‚Äôd rather have you in my bedroom. The only reason you‚Äôre not in a muzzle, is because I prefer bantering with you. The only reason you‚Äôre not in shackles, is because I like seeing you free. (Whispering) But you‚Äôre only as free as I allow you to be.

I am your Mistress. When I say ‚Äújump‚Äù, you ask ‚Äúhow high?‚Äù When I say ‚Äúcome‚Äù, you ask ‚Äúwhat time?‚Äù Remember that.

The time is eight. Be at the southern hall of the castle by eight. Do you understand me?

Yes, *what*?

That‚Äôs right. You say, ‚ÄúYes, mistress.‚Äù Now try saying it louder, with a smile.

(A longer pause)

Good boy.

You can have your little manuscript back now. I will see you tonight. Be good.

*(SFX: Flapping of wings, as she takes off)*

...

....

.....

*(SFX: Soft ambient music)*

Ah, Celesteh! You look absolutely ravishing. Is that lapis lazuli?

Aww, look at you! I‚Äôm so glad to see you here. You‚Äôve been working so hard lately.

Yes, yes. No rest for the wicked. If that was true, I wouldn‚Äôt have slept for nine hours last night while cuddling my toy.

(Scoffing softly) As if. When you get a toy of your own and still manage to make it out of bed at first light, you can lecture me on sleeping for too long. Until then- shut it! (Playfully sticking her tongue out)

Stop worrying for a moment. Just relax. Eat, drink, dance, talk to some of the men. There‚Äôs more to life than logistical reports and administrative meetings.

Like cuddles, yes. With someone who cares about you. Where‚Äôs your sense of curiosity? Of adventure? You used to be more fun back in high school, you know?

All I‚Äôm saying is- (plainly) you need to get laid. As soon as possible.

(Sighing) Fine. Let me rephrase that. I *order* you to get laid with a man- or woman- just, person- get laid with a person of your choice *immediately*. Find someone you like at this party, and then take them back to your room. Do not come out of your room until you‚Äôve done what you must. Take the day off tomorrow if need be.

I‚Äôm being perfectly serious. As your queen, I‚Äôm ordering you to *get it*. As your friend, I‚Äôm asking you to just- just find someone who makes you happy. Alright?

Excuse me?

What I and my wimp have done behind closed doors is....is not something I feel comfortable discussing.

(Muttering) Fine. Just cuddling with someone counts. I will accept it. But you *are* taking someone with you to your bed tonight.

Huh? What is it?

Oh. You‚Äôre right. That is my....(softly) my wimp over there. Look at him, helping himself to the appetizers and trying to hide behind the potted plant so he won‚Äôt have to socialize. (Rolling her eyes, but smiling)

Yeah. He did wear the clothes I picked out for him. (Sighing softly) Look at him, Celesteh. All dolled up for me. And still wearing that lovely gold collar. Now if only he didn‚Äôt look like he was slowly dying the entire time....

Let me see if I can turn that frown into a blush. Catch you later, Cel.

(A long pause)

(To listener) Hello, pet.

You look quite handsome, you know? I‚Äôm glad I got your measurements just right.

Would you like to dance?

(Raising an eyebrow) Well?

(Smirking) You should really pick your jaw off the floor, dear. And just because you still don‚Äôt have a working knowledge of the feminine anatomy.....(whispering) my eyes are up here.

Aww, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping matters. I thought my low-cut dress might be distracting you, but is my face making it difficult for you to speak as well? Do you like how I‚Äôve done my hair?

(Chuckling) Ah, finally. A complete sentence! Good job, pet. I‚Äôm so proud of you! (Ruffling his hair)

You still haven‚Äôt answered my question though. (Whispering) Would you like to dance with me?

You really should leave some appetizers for the rest of the guests. You can have more later. Now come along. Hold my waist.

(Giggling) Of course it‚Äôs necessary! Dancing is an integral aspect of the royal banquet. And my subjects seem to love it when I grace the dance floor. I think it conveys the right image.

That while I may be a cruel conqueror, I can also appreciate the finer things in life. And I mean.....I call it an ‚Äúimage‚Äù, but it‚Äôs true.

(Sighing) Why am I not surprised? Always trying every tactic you can to wiggle out of spending time with me. It‚Äôs not an issue if you can‚Äôt dance. Just follow my lead. (Suggestive) It‚Äôs one of the things you‚Äôre best at.

People are watching us, babe. Put one arm around my waist. Another arm higher up on my back. And watch the wings!

Because if you accidentally cut your palm on the edge of my wing, you‚Äôll put this in your new book and then people will be afraid to dance with dragons. It‚Äôs bad propaganda.

Of course. I‚Äôd also feel bad because you got hurt. That much was implied, darling.

Mmnn. Yes. Just like this. You‚Äôre doing well. Come a bit closer though. I‚Äôm not going to eat you. We don‚Äôt do that anymore (giggling lightly).

That- that was a joke. Not even my ancestors ate humans. They hunted them sometimes, but they- they didn‚Äôt eat them. Don‚Äôt be silly.

(Sighing) There‚Äôs no making you happy, is there? You condemn it as hunting for sport because they didn‚Äôt eat you, but you‚Äôd vilify them as man-eaters if they did. What would you have my kind do?

Leave you alone? Yeah, sorry. (Smirking) That‚Äôs one thing I cannot do.

Ooof. Close one. Try not to actively step on my toes, pet. (Whispering) I‚Äôll let that one slide because you‚Äôre new to this.

Please. I‚Äôm not a *man-eater.* You could‚Äôve called me beautiful, or alluring, or enchanting, or pretty- but you chose to latch on to that word. It‚Äôs such a....crass way to describe a woman you‚Äôre attracted to, no?

You may turn your face away, but I didn‚Äôt hear you denying you‚Äôre attracted to me.

What is it? (Whispering) Queen of reptiles got your tongue?

(A longer pause)

Well, if you‚Äôve got no comebacks, then use your lips for something useful. (Whispering) Kiss me.

You heard me. Kiss my lips.

The people watching us? They absolutely love a little display of affection. We‚Äôre together now, and this is what couples do, right?

(Softly) Kiss me, wimp.

(A longer pause)

Well?

(Sighing) Guess I‚Äôll just do it myself.

(A slow, gentle but firm kiss)

See? That felt kind of nice, didn‚Äôt it? Even if you had the expressiveness of an open-mouthed goldfish the entire time.

(Pecking his cheek)

That‚Äôs for being a good boy and playing along.

Do you want to go outside, wimp? Maybe get some fresh air?

Well that‚Äôs a shame then, isn‚Äôt it? I want to go outside. So you‚Äôre coming with me.

Come on, pet. Don‚Äôt make me drag you on a leash (chuckling softly). That can always be arranged.

*(SFX: Footsteps on a marble floor)*

Oh, I think you‚Äôve had enough appetizers for now. Those can wait.

(Laughing softly) You‚Äôre *cute*.

Hey, wait a minute. Isn‚Äôt that Celesteh?

Oh wimp, look! She‚Äôs talking to a guy. Making those big, soft, melty eyes at him that I sometimes make at-

Nevermind. It‚Äôs not important.

(Sighing wistfully) Oh, Celesteh.....(like a proud parent) She‚Äôs trying to sneak one of her wings around him. Hoping he won‚Äôt notice. She‚Äôs so possessive already! Oh, how I‚Äôve waited to see this day....

(Rolling her eyes) Oh, pet. Pipe down. Why are you worried about that guy? He‚Äôs very lucky to have caught my friend‚Äôs eye.

Yes....Celesteh and I have known each other for a long time.....I suppose I have rubbed off a little on her. Why?

Ha. Ha. Very funny. Maybe she won‚Äôt need to knock him out if he comes willingly. Maybe she won‚Äôt have to make him sleep on the sofa if he just accepts he is rightfully hers.

*(SFX: Quiet night ambience. Cicadas faintly chirping.)*

*(SFX: Footsteps on grass)*

Of course I still think you‚Äôre my property. I *know* you are. And you should accept it, wimp. (Softer) Things will be a lot easier when you do.

Nothing. I just meant.....it‚Äôd be nice, knowing your pet wants to be in your arms when you cuddle him. I find your protests quite endearing- honestly- and as much as I enjoy our conversations, sometimes I find myself wishing that.....

That we could simply enjoy the silence of a quiet night. Worry about nothing, and just relax as we....(muttering faintly) you know....enjoyed each other‚Äôs company.

*(Footsteps stop)*

You seem really passionate about this thing called ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. But you sure get all quiet when I hold you close, (whispering) don‚Äôt you?

Ssshh. I‚Äôm just hugging you from behind, silly. Resting my chin on your shoulder. My arms are wrapped around your chest. And you can‚Äôt break free. Because dragons are strong.

It feels nice finally stretching these wings, you know? Had to keep them neatly folded while we were inside. These things are quite big.

Hm? Why is your heart pumping so rapidly, my dear? Why is your breathing all nervous and erratic? (Whispering) Are you worried I‚Äôll do something?

You know me so well, wimp. I was just thinking it‚Äôs a nice night for flying.

(Strangely sympathetic) Oh? You‚Äôre scared of flying?

Are you scared of heights, or is it the thought of flying itself that alarms you?

(A longer pause)

I see.

Flying up there in the sky is one of the best feelings in the world, you know? (Smiling faintly) It has always been one of my favourite things to do. I‚Äôve been flying in that endless expanse of blue ever since I was a little girl.

Did I ever tell you about this fantasy I had in school? Of flying with you?

Yeah. It‚Äôs true. I kept hoping I‚Äôd find you walking alone in a secluded section of the school grounds, or on your way home. And then I‚Äôd sneak up behind you, wrap my arms around you just like this, give my wings a flap- *(SFX: A single flap of her wings)-* and then....I‚Äôd take to the skies with you while you begged me to set you down.

I‚Äôd ignore you, of course. I wouldn‚Äôt set you down for a long, long time. Not until we reached one of my favourite spots here in the realm of dragons. Some place where no one would disturb us. And then I‚Äôd set you down gently, and we would.....

We would just talk. For hours and hours until you grew tired, and just....nestled into me. Under my wing. And I couldn‚Äôt help but smile every time I thought of this.

Yes. I do care about your consent. Why do you think I never did this to you? I had plenty of chances.

You do have a choice, my little wimp. If you don‚Äôt want to fly, then I‚Äôll simply hold you like this for a while longer before we go back inside. I don‚Äôt mind, because you are still with me. That....that is the most important thing to me in the world.

(Softly) I‚Äôll enjoy anything we do as long as we do it together.

Yes, darling. I really do want to take you flying. And I‚Äôd love it if you said yes. But I won‚Äôt force you. (Faintly) Dragons do not lie.

(A few seconds of silence)

Really?

Thanks, wimp. I....I am glad you said that. I truly am.

I won‚Äôt let you go. Don‚Äôt be afraid. I‚Äôll be holding you tight the entire time we‚Äôre up there in the night sky.

(Whispering solemnly) I won‚Äôt ever let you go. Wimp.

Take a deep breath. Nice and slow. And then-

*(SFX: Flapping of wings. Winds blowing, fiercely at first, then calming into a soft, steady stream.)*

Atta boy. You only yelped a little. Are you keeping your eyes closed or something?

Open them, pet. It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve got you. You can feel how firm my hold is, right?

Good. Don‚Äôt be afraid. You‚Äôre safe with me. I will protect you. (Whispering gently, sincerely) I promise.

Yeah. Yeah, we are a long way above the ground. I have even flown above the clouds a few times, but it will be difficult for you to breathe so far up. And I don‚Äôt want to scare you. I think this is a nice elevation. You can see all the little lights from here. Feel the wind blowing through your hair.

(Chuckling softly) We really are flying, yes. I know humans are fascinated by the sky. Did you ever wonder what it‚Äôd be like to fly when you were younger?

I see. And is it like what you imagined?

(A longer pause)

Good.

(Very softly) It‚Äôs just like what I imagined too.

*(A spell of comfortable silence. Nothing but winds.)*

Well, I told you about my little daydream. One of my ‚Äúfavourite spots‚Äù is quite nearby. That is where we are going.

What would be the fun in telling you huh? Just be patient a little longer, my sweet.

Hm? Did you say something?

Yes. The houses, the trees, the souls- everything appears tiny from up here. Nothing but a constellation of lights. And thus, there are two cities, my dear.

One below- teeming with golden lights and high towers. And one above, filled with twinkling blue dots and the infinite night sky. And in between, the queen of the dragons and her silly little wimp. (A small laugh)

Yes. Of course you are. But you‚Äôre also the cutest wimp in the whole world. (Smiling ever so faintly) The nicest wimp ever.

Well, that‚Äôs the kindest compliment you‚Äôre getting from me. I suggest you roll over and accept it, darling. (Pecking the back of his neck)

Thanks, by the way.

(Softly) For letting me do this. It really does mean a lot to me.

One of the reasons I like flying so much is what you pointed out earlier, actually. Everything appears so small from up here. But not in a bad way. It just reminds me that my problems and worries aren‚Äôt the end of the world. There‚Äôs a whole host of people down there, going through the same things as me, in their own ways. I....am not alone. It just takes a run through the night sky to remind me of that.

I suspect it‚Äôs the same way with you and writing. Your words are your wings, and you use them to let your imagination fly. And when I read your book about the dragon girl and her treasure, I....well, I could see all the lights below that you wanted to show me. In a way, I was flying with you even if you didn‚Äôt know it yet.

(Softly) Yeah. I really did like it. It was like talking to a friend from years ago. (Brief pause) It was so *you.*

We‚Äôre going to land now. Don‚Äôt be afraid. I will be gentle. Just....just give me a moment.

*(SFX: Winds die down. A couple flaps of her great wings.)*

There. Terra firma. Do you know what‚Äôs the hardest part about flying?

It‚Äôs returning to the ground. You aren‚Äôt sure if you‚Äôll remember what you saw while you were up there. What you felt in your heart.

Sometimes, you.....you just wish you could stay up there forever. Flying through the gentle night winds of the world. (Whispering to herself) But it‚Äôs impossible.

(A bit awkward) Yeah. Um, I have no reason to hold you so tightly anymore. You- you‚Äôre not in danger of falling. I uh, I should release you.

There you go.

Hey. Wimp?

*(SFX: Gentle thud over the soft grass)*

Relax. I‚Äôm not attacking you. I just....um....

Yeah. I just wanted to pin you to the ground for fun. And then get on top of you to- to see how you‚Äôd react.

(Rolling her eyes) Please. I‚Äôm not heavy. Do you even lift?

If I wanted to crush you, I would have. I‚Äôm being very gentle. (Brushing aside a strand of his hair) I don‚Äôt want my treasure to get hurt.

Yeah. I did say we dragons don‚Äôt actually equate our mates with our treasures. But I‚Äôm a woman, too. So if I decide to think of you as my treasure, then you are my treasure. Deal with it.

Of course. From now on, you‚Äôll be sleeping at the top of my pile of gold coins. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll flatten a section of it so it can serve as a bed (laughing softly).

I don‚Äôt actually have a pile of coins, you know? That‚Äôs very old-fashioned. We just invest in assets these days. Some of the young dragonewts do collect coins and shiny things in a heap somewhere. But they usually grow out of it when they reach teenage.

*No.* I never went through a phase like that. (Muttering) Don‚Äôt believe everything Celesteh tells you.

Anyway, um-

Huh? Yeah, I- I *could* get off of you.

(In a small voice) No. I....I won‚Äôt get off of you.

(In a smaller voice) Because I don‚Äôt want to.

You know, in earlier days, my kind would sometimes take humans as ‚Äútributes‚Äù in exchange for sparing your settlements from our fiery wrath. And we‚Äôd keep you as....as playthings. (Whispering) Some of those tributes ended up becoming our consorts.

No. You‚Äôre not a tribute. Don‚Äôt be silly. I burnt down your city and *then* took you as my plaything. There was no negotiating.

....But if there were, um, *negotiating*, then I....I‚Äôd have demanded to take you. Permanently.

(Softly) I told you. Mercy isn‚Äôt my forte. I took over your old home and it‚Äôs now part of my treasures. But don‚Äôt worry. I take care of my treasures. The people there won‚Äôt suffer anymore.

No, they- they are not technically part of my treasures. Well, they kind of are because they‚Äôre my subjects, but- (sighing) forget it. You wouldn‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôre not a dragon.

I‚Äôm just saying....I take care of what is mine. (Quietly) And you are no exception.

(Strangely quiet) I was really hoping you‚Äôd be the first to say it, but this- this is fine too.

(Whispering) I love you.

I will concede the battle, but not the war. I love you, and I will get you to admit you‚Äôve always felt the same way. In time.

Yes, dummy. I just told you. I‚Äôm not going to repeat it. Not happening.

What do you mean, why did I ‚Äúbully‚Äù you? I didn‚Äôt bully you. I was just....being me.

Don‚Äôt pretend a part of you didn‚Äôt enjoy it. (Whispering) You secretly like it when I get mean. (Husky laughter)

Oh, pet. You turn your face to the side to hide your blush.....(whispering) but I don‚Äôt hear you denying it.

Look at me.

Don‚Äôt make me grab your chin. Look into my eyes, wimp.

(Kissing him)

What? I told you in school, you were practice. (Smug) I was practising how to kiss you properly after you officially became mine.

(Softer) Sweetie. I don‚Äôt know why, but it seems I‚Äôm somehow always the cruellest to that which is my greatest treasure.

I wish it weren‚Äôt the case. But it still doesn‚Äôt change how much you mean to me.

Yes. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to say I‚Äôm sorry. Dragons do not apologize. We merely admit that, on occasion, we *might* have slightly....overstepped. That- that is all.

Do you want me to take off your collar for a while? It‚Äôs just us on this hill, looking over the city of lights. No one to see us.

Alright.

*(SFX: Unclasping of metal collar)*

You do have to let me play with your neck though. (Planting a kiss right on his jugular)

Of course. It‚Äôs a fair trade, my dear pet. (Kiss) Such soft skin you have (kiss), such delicate veins (kiss), such a vulnerable and tender part of your body (smooch).

Oh? Does it make you shiver when I nibble softly with my teeth?

I think I‚Äôll keep doing it then. (Kiss)

Have mercy? Oh, pet (smooch). Silly boy. No, I think I‚Äôd rather just have you. (Kiss)

Look at you. Your forefathers would be so ashamed. They used to fight so desperately against my kind to keep us from tearing open their vulnerable throats. And here you are, pinned under me and softly moaning as I play with your neck. (Another kiss)

Hmm. I think I prefer this too.

Can I tell you something?

Ever since I bandaged your knee and you showed me your old picture book for the first time, I....I kind of just knew you were going to be my husband one day.

It‚Äôs because I became acutely aware of you. Your location, your health, your emotions. I always knew where you were and how you were doing. It took me a while to realize it was because I imprinted on you.

Yeah. A dragon is always aware of where her treasures are, you see. Every single gemstone, every last gold coin. She knows. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so dangerous to steal from a dragon, you see.

But it only applies to material treasures. Not....not to people we like. Or so I was led to believe. I now know the truth though. It‚Äôs one of our most closely-guarded secrets.

There‚Äôs only one person in the world that a dragon can ‚Äúimprint‚Äù on in this way. It always happens subconsciously. No one knows why. No one knows what triggers it. But this person, without exception....they are destined to be her sweetheart. Her mate. Her darling little treasure until the end of time.

I always knew where you were. My bond with you only grew stronger with the passage of time. By the time we graduated, I could almost tune in to your heartbeat- the rhythm of your breathing- from anywhere. Almost hear your voice telling me something from a memory, even though you weren‚Äôt there. And I often did just that. Doing it always seemed to calm me. It was like....you were right beside me, you know?

Your life was never in danger when your city came under siege. I knew where you were. I would never let anything happen to my wimp. I can‚Äôt lose you. I *won‚Äôt* lose you.

(Smiling softly, cryptically) You know, I think I like seeing this expression on your face. Your mouth is hanging open, and your eyes are so big, and soft, almost *melty*. What a cute wimp.

Do you want to return to the banquet now? I was thinking we could just ask the castle staff to deliver dinner to our room later.

(Playful, conspiratorial) Good. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre in agreement. Might be a first. Let‚Äôs stay here a little longer then.

(Whispering up close) I‚Äôm sure we can find something to occupy the time. (Kissing him)

(Mildly surprised) Pet?

You....you are hugging me back.

(Smiling) Nope. I am not going to say it.

(Smiling entirely too wide) Nope. There‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôm *dying* to say. It‚Äôs just, you know.....

The guild of cavers might come calling tomorrow, because somebody just *caved!* Ooof, there hasn‚Äôt been a cave this big since the mountains themselves were dug for gold.

(Giggling happily) Hey, that‚Äôs a *great* pun, and you know it! You‚Äôre just jealous you didn‚Äôt write it.

Hey. Wimp.

(Tenderly) Are my wings the colour of the night sky?

(A longer pause)

Will you marry me?

(Another long pause)

You don‚Äôt have to say yes right now, my sweet. But I really do hope, you will be able to tell me yes one day in the future, when we- mmmmhhh!

(They share a gentle kiss under the night sky)

Okay....okay, that works too.

(Kissing him, as she wraps her wings around them both)

I love you so much, my wimp.",2,1750625227.0,ASMRScriptHaven,1,1.0,False
1lhy6hy,https://i.redd.it/571i1mdcjj8f1.jpeg,Made a Celtic Knot for my Dad,"
I wanted to share my feelings and hear some thoughts from you all about something that happened today.

My dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in September of last year, and since then, our lives have been turned upside down. We‚Äôve been struggling with a lot of major challenges. He‚Äôs in his early 60s, and our relationship has had extreme downs and only minor ups until just a few months ago.

Thankfully, we‚Äôve managed to heal our father-daughter relationship over time. Unfortunately, we live in different cities. This time, I came to visit him. During the visit, my friends and I went to a caf√© where you can pick a wooden or clay item to paint while you enjoy your coffee.

Before we got there, I had this strong desire to express my gratitude and love towards my father. A sudden idea came to me using symbolism. I found a Celtic knot that symbolizes the bond between a father and daughter. While painting it, I felt this soft wave of insight: when I give this to my dad, the knot will radiate loving family bonds, bring health to him, and prosperity to his home.

I know this is a long message and some details might seem off-topic, but what I‚Äôm wondering is while painting, I had no intention of casting a spell. Yet, the more I painted, the more I realized I was channeling my energy into this piece. I‚Äôve never created anything physical like this for my altar before.

What do you think about this piece? How does it make you feel? Do you have any advice? It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a ritual or spellcasting, but in a way, it feels like the ritual happened naturally, without intention.


I am also wondering the mtyh of this symbol, i saw few information about it, if it is correct this is the knot that Brighid made for his father while she‚Äôs staying with him to show the bonds between them. 

If anyone have more information than i do please shareü´∂

An emotionally and physically abusive husband who spent the first 15 years of his marriage traumatising everyone including me with his alcoholism.

Whether it be my clothes, the fact I got my period in the middle of the day or the fact that I was dancing in the party with my mom. The moment I spent any time with her so we could actually have fun without him ruining it, he started to sulk and made everyone feel awkward. My whole trip I avoided getting in a fight, laughed and smiled thru everything because I did not want to create a scene.
But I had enough the whole trip. While going back, this man decides to sit with me at a coffee shop with everyone there just before boarding. I asked if they wanted take away, he said no. Once I ordered he got into a fight with me to tell them mid order to make it take away. I said no and when he wouldnt shut up, turned my face to the other side with a sigh. I did not have the patience. He started yelling at about how he‚Äôs seen enough of my faces the whole trip and everyone around started looking at me.

1lhxyvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1lhxyvo/just_got_off_the_iconheres_some_quick_thoughts/,Just got off the Icon..here‚Äôs some quick thoughts‚Ä¶,"Ship is incredible. It feels bigger than it looks. For 7k+ passengers I thought I‚Äôd feel the crowds more. Even on sea days, we were able to find chairs at the pool pretty easily. Overall never felt overcrowded anywhere on the ship. 

Speaking of pools, the 18+ pool at the back of the ship is nice, but seems like an oversight not to have a swim up bar there. There‚Äôs one swim up bar on the ship and it‚Äôs really small and kinda buried in a corner. 

The water park is awesome, but that will get packed on sea days. Recommend staying on ship on a port day to really take advantage of it. We had an excursion get cancelled due to rough seas and basically had the water park to ourselves. 

MDR- food was noticeably better than our last royal cruise in 2021. Much much better. 

Pearl cafe: great spot for morning coffee and pastries. 

Wow bracelets- these need some work. They don‚Äôt work to get you on/off ship and the servers don‚Äôt carry anything that can scan them, so when you want a drink at the pool or casino for example, you actually need to take the bracelet off and give it to the server like you would a sea pass card. Kinda defeats the purpose imo. 

Infinite balcony- let me say, we enjoyed the extra space this provides, but let‚Äôs be clear, this is NOT a balcony in any way shape of form. It‚Äôs an extended room with a giant window that you will open once then realize your A/C doesn‚Äôt work when it‚Äôs open and it will take hours for your room to cool down. Maybe it‚Äôs great for cold weather cruising but for the Caribbean, it‚Äôs not. Again, we took advantage of the extra space it provided, but it‚Äôs not a balcony. 

Palymakers sports bar- awesome. As south Floridians we needed a place to watch the panthers in the stanley cup finals and it did not disappoint. Tons of tvs and they crank the volume up for whatever the ‚Äúbig game‚Äù airing is. Had a ton of fun watching the games there. 

We ate at every specialty restaurant except Giovanni‚Äôs and they were all excellent. the habachi was the highlight. Best/funniest chef I‚Äôve ever had and the food was great. Highly recommend. Also Hooked was great (first time)

The water show was incredible. Felt like I was in Vegas. A must see. 

Casino is HUGE. Never had an issue sitting at a table. 

Cheat code: surfside cafe for breakfast. It‚Äôs a mini windjammer that apparently nobody knew about. Pretty empty for breakfast. 

Aquadome market place: if you‚Äôve ever been on a VV cruise, it‚Äôs basically the galley. Some really interesting and delicious options you don‚Äôt get at windjammer. 

That‚Äôs all for now, feel free to AMA.

1lhxyli,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lhxyli/help/,Help?,"TL:DR; I'll admit I have been in a full anxiety spiral after reading headlines for the first couple of hours this morning, but I am struck with an overwhelming sense of, the fuck?! How do you just.. go on? 

We went to war today. I got up and went to work like a normal day like everyone else and read the headlines when I got here, but I am almost done with my shift and no one has even talked about it. I work at a customer service job and people are in here going about there day as normal. There's zero solemnity. I understand that life can, will, and should go on, but we are walking into war and there wasn't even a pause over the threshold. I'm not even sure to what extent the people around me even know what's going on, it's that not talked about. We just got out of 20 years in the sand box are we about to swan dive back into it? In this economy!?

I suppose it is the nature of being a peon that you constantly feel like you're missing some vital piece of information. You go to bed one night with ""negotiations"" and wake up the next morning with ""BOMBS"" (literally in all caps like that from our sitting president, posted on a social media platform... that he created).

That happens to me a lot, I feel. Life Events‚Ñ¢ happening while I'm whiling away hours at work. It occurred to me that someone in 1945 also woke up on a summer day, got dressed, and clocked in in order to pay rent, as the bombs were being dropped. The world entered a new nuclear era and will be irrevocably changed, would you like fries with that? 

Walked into work on a perfectly normal Tuesday in January 2021 and on the TV above the bar people were storming the US capitol. I made eye contact with everyone within a 10 foot radius around me and no one had a reaction (of those that actually returned my eye contact).  The next year I watched England's longest reigning monarch laid to rest on one of those giant screens made up of like 12 smaller screens, those bag pipes garnered little to no attention in my small corner of the world. Both times I thought to myself, ""am I crazy?"" It feels like someone slipped me the red pill in my coffee one morning and I was caught unawares. 

I was assigned to read The Yellow Wallpaper in college, if you haven't read it it is a short story about a woman's descent into madness when she is shut in a room with yellow wallpaper that she soon becomes obsessed with. She is most likely suffering from extreme post partum but everyone around her tells her she's being crazy, and she just needs rest, but she very clearly see's the woman trapped in the yellow wallpaper. I guess it left an indelible impression on me because I have found myself saying, ""I feel like that lady with the yellow wallpaper"" a lot, more and more frequently as time progresses. I was compelled to reread it today after all these years and it still resonates. 

""If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression - a slight hysterical tendency - what is one to do?""

Trump made the call to enter a war with Iran and then went golfing with the CEO of OpenAI. (AI, the thing that is probably humanity's next event horizon and the aforementioned CEO has even said that moment has already passed, is a whole other layer of the shitcake parfait that I don't want to talk about). Just two chill guys enjoying a walk on the green on a Friday morning in June, is that not surreal? 

""I get unreasonably angry with [him] sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.""

Go on break and they have church tv on in the break room where they‚Äôre sermonizing ‚Äúlove thy neighbor‚Äù till commercial break and an advertisement for Trump gold coins comes on, and after that back to coverage about bunker busting bombs being dropped and a call for peace. Wut?

Personally I live a privileged life in a privileged part of the world, ""and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more."" It is highly unlikely I'll wake up and find soldiers on my doorstep, I do not fear where my next meal will come from, I am staunchly middle class and no worries of ever not having a roof over my head, however, this can all change suddenly and abruptly. I am not so well off that I can remain untouched by global events.  How do you not slip into a pit of nihilism when you live in the in between? Not suffering but not thriving. So this is it, this is life? ""You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway... it turns a back-somersault and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream."" How do you be a participant in a world that is always trying to tear itself apart? Build a life for yourself with your right hand, prepare for it's inevitable demise with your left.

""I don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous. I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.""

Sorry if this reads like a Medium article. I am not an aspiring journalist, author, or anything of the sort, just a normal person who hopped on the computer and started typing as a means of catharsis, to get these thoughts out of my head, ""I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind."" The result turned into this post because I became genuinely curious to know how other people feel and their answer to these questions even though I am scared to share these thoughts. All quotes are from The Yellow Wallpaper and it is so ironic that people wrote it off as a gothic ghost story when it was released. 

I was surprised by the not small amount of solace I received when opening tik tok later though. Not only for the fact that discussions were, in fact, being had about it but also the jokes being made about the situation (read: life) right now. I guess the lesson there is life may be hard to face but one thing is for sure, we are going to make a little jokie joke about it till our dying breath. ",1,1750624571.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

1lhxxqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1lhxxqr/well_that_sucked_2_day_phantom_attack_sent_me/,"Well, that sucked... 2 day phantom attack sent me back to ER on post op night 6","Sigh... Apologies in advance for this NOVEL. I've been wanting to share this with you all because I am just so confused and scared and disappointed, but just haven't been in the mood to write it all up because it's a long story. Some of you maybe saw my post about my surgery experience a week ago. The surgery went great, it was really not that bad at all. Incisions are healing well and as of today (post op day 9) I can sit up from lying down with no abdominal pain at all, so I guess that's cool. Well, here we go.

My surgery was last Friday. I was told no greasy/fried foods for a week. On Wednesday, day 5 post op and my first day back at work (wfh desk job), I decided to try and eat something for breakfast that wasn't soup and crackers or some other liquid. I never really changed my diet prior to surgery so I wasn't expecting any trigger foods or anything, thought I'd just be one of those people who has surgery then never has any more issues going forward, as per my usual. I made myself 2 plain scrambled eggs and 2 little breakfast sausages (the frozen ones that are like the size of a Vienna sausage, they have 7g of fat in 3 of them). I ate both eggs and only 1 sausage around 8am or so. I still am not sure if this was a trigger or just a coincidence because of the timing of it, but a few hours later around 1030-11 I started feeling the same epigastric pain I would feel prior to surgery. My attacks never were on the right or in my shoulder, always perfectly centered right below my ribs above my stomach. Feeling this pain again was a bummer, but I went and took some dicyclomine and waited for it to pass like it usually did. Except this time it didn't... By the time I got off work at 4 I was still hurting, mildly worse. The pain hadn't done anything for my appetite but I thought maybe if I eat that will help? I was able to eat dinner without making it any worse (Chik fil a grilled nuggets, and I caved and ate the waffle fries too). I took another dicyclomine praying it would work, and the pain calmed down enough that I was able to sleep that night. 

I woke up Thursday morning and was definitely unnerved about the previous day, and could still feel mild epigastric soreness leftover. I had coffee that morning with no issue but didn't eat anything with it. Around noon, I made 4 air fried chicken nuggets thinking I probably wouldn't eat much anyway. I decided to only eat 1 and wait a while and see what happened. Well I'm glad I did, because within 20-30 mins the pain was back and it was worse. I'm was getting so upset,  and starting to get really worried. This time dicyclomine was not doing anything. I tried a couple of my post op Norco, ibuprofen, nothing was helping and the pain just would not ease up, it was slowly getting worse. My bf kept asking if he needed to take my back to the hospital, I really really did not want to go, but finally around 10pm I caved and had him take me to the ER. This whole time the pain has been coming in waves, feeling exactly the same as all my previous fucking  attacks ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ When the wave comes, it's almost like a slow spasm. I can feel it start at about a pain level 3-4 then ramp up to a 7-8 for a few mins, then back down to 3-4, maybe even a 1-2 for 5-10 mins then rinse and repeat. It was awful, and I was so afraid that they wouldn't believe me because how can I be talking to them fine one minute then doubled over in pain the next??? It didn't make sense to me and I was so worried they wouldn't believe me, especially when I'm complaining of pain from an organ I just had removed... 

They did a CT with contrast in the ER and it all was grossly normal. My surgery also included an IOC where they flush all the ducts and everything to make sure no stones are leftover, so that did not seem to be the issue. They started an IV and drew labs, found my liver enzymes were elevated which apparently is not uncommon after this surgery, but I guess they were high enough (and with the pain I was having) they recommended hospital admission. I was also given a shot of morphine, and this was another confusing moment. The nurse pushed the morphine pretty slow since I had never had it before. Maybe this was just a coincidence, because even the nurse commented that ""morphine shouldn't work that fast?"" but in that moment she was pushing the morphine in my IV the pain got so much worse. I still don't understand why. What had essentially been feeling like someone's fist reaching into my abdomen and squeezing the life out of my insides this whole time now ""expanded"" and now the squeezing feeling felt like it encompassed my whole ribcage and was absolutely squeezing the life out of me. In that moment I finally broke down into tears into my bf's chest while the nurses in the room watched, confused. That excruciating wave didn't last long thank god, and by this moment I was ready to accept hospital admission. At one point I had told the ER doc that dicyclomine worked well before my surgery but didn't seem to be working now, so she also gave me hyoscyamine while I was there too. She said it was similar to the dicyclomine. Not sure how long that takes to work, but it was the last drug I was given before my transfer to the hospital.

I got into my room at about midnight, and was still experiencing waves of pain, but much less intense from now on. The last wave was around 2am. I wondered if it was the hyoscyamine that ended up helping since that was the last thing I got before the pain finally stopped... The nurse hooked up an IV bag of fluids and just as I was about to ask her for crackers or something bc I couldn't eat all day in the pain I was in, she told me I was NPO üò≠ Around 3am a cute internal med Dr came in and spoke to me. An hour or so later another nurse came and drew 6 tubes of blood to recheck my labs. Around 7am my diet was changed to clear liquids so at 8 they brought me a ""breakfast"" tray with black coffee, orange jello that was gross, grape juice that was also surprisingly gross, and some veggie broth that was thankfully very good but there wasn't very much. For whatever reason I just couldn't manage to fall asleep there, so by now I'm exhausted and bored watching TV while my bf snored in the chair next to me. (Really he was amazingly supportive, never left my side, and I was glad at least he was able to sleep if I couldn't)

At 12 I got more broth and other gross stuff for lunch, then at 1 I had an MRCP. Still no pain at all since 2am and had been feeling pretty normal now. (I swear this pain is so fucking gaslighting). From here it was just a waiting game until my surgeon finally made her rounds. When I finally saw her at almost 730pm, I was told that everything has come back normal. My CT and MRCP were ""beautiful"" so basically all I heard was ""we don't know why you were in pain"". I told her I was starting to feel crappy and weak bc I was so hungry, I didn't eat all day the day prior and now all I've had is broth. Her response was ""oh, you can eat! Doesn't even have to be hospital food if you wanna doordash something! I mean I wouldn't dive head first into a pizza or anything but go ahead and eat!"" üòê My labs were still elevated and initially she wanted to keep me another day to recheck them, but when I told her I really just wanted to go home so I could rest she agreed and said we could do labs on an outpatient basis, and said that we've done all the scans she would've ordered at this point anyway. Once the hospitalist agreed I could leave I was out of there around 8-830.

Honestly, omw out of the hospital walking to the car with my bf, I started to cry. I was tearful the whole drive home. He said he thought I would be happier to get released and come home. I said I am happy, but I think I'm just overwhelmed. It was an intense experience, and I ended up leaving with more questions than I started with. Why did I have such a horrible attack 5 days post op? Was good the trigger or did it start on its own? Am I seriously having phantom attacks already?? And what do I do if I happens again?? The meds I have that worked before now seem like they won't help at all now that my gallbladder is gone so I'm really feeling like I'm sent back off into the wild with no safety net. I can't go to the ER every time if it gets this bad again, and I already know as soon as I feel any little bit of pain again in the future I'm going to anxious spiral. I'm already stressed TF out waiting for these hospital bills to show up... But more than anything I just want to understand what happened and why. I'm so angry and let down, I thought this surgery was supposed to fix this... üò≠ My bf is convinced it was some sort of bile leak, but I'm not buying that yet. Isn't that was all these scans were checking for?

That first night back home, even though I was so damn hungry after watching food commercials all day at the hospital, I was also terrified to eat anything and felt so anxious all night. I tried a creamy soup but when I felt the smallest bit of pressure in my tummy I immediately stopped and that was that. Could've been residual soreness but it was hard to tell the difference and I didn't want to mess with it. So I just went to bed. 

Saturday, yesterday, was better. I had coffee and toast with apple butter for breakfast. Lunch was soup, some of a protein shake, apple juice, and dinner was some fruit and plain mashed potatoes. So far so good, no pain, and no bathroom issues either (which at this point I would WELCOME rather than any more pain). Today has been ok so far too. Coffee this morning, a couple bites of toast and fruit, then had more mashed potatoes for lunch. As badly as I want it all, I'm just so scared to eat anything ""real"". I don't know what triggered that phantom attack but it lasted basically 2 days and was probably on par with the worst attack I ever had prior to surgery. Maybe it was worse actually, because that one was ""only"" 8 hrs. WTF?? üò≠ I just want to feel normal again. The whole reason I DID the surgery was so I never had to experience that pain again. It's so hard to not feel overwhelmed with ""what if it happens again"" and ""will this keep happening forever?"". Will I ever get back to burgers and pizza and ribs?? Ugh... Thank you so much to anyone who actually read this whole thing. I guess I'm not necessarily expecting answers from Reddit, but any insight and commiseration is welcome. Is this normal??

* Foundation holograms not disappearing until relog
* Foundations and walls not showing up until relog
* M.A.M. unlocks not showing up until relog
* HUB unlocks not showing up until relog

I'm sure there are more items I can't think of at the moment that we've been experiencing, but I'm playing on a new dedicated server with 2 friends and all of us experienced these issues from the very first M.A.M. unlock. It's infuriating.

I'm aware that this issue has been posted, I'm under the impression that it doesn't happen on multiplayer and only on dedicated server instances (because none of us ran into these specific issues before), I've seen the suggestions for changing the ports, the network settings, etc. and I've been checking here and the QA site every day for updates or new posts about it.

I've been going back and forth with G-Portal trying to see if there's anything they can do on their end, moving from box to box, changing server locations, tried hosting a dedicated server on my end for my friends to join with my PC running it 24/7, nothing has worked.

Coffee Stain is claiming that they're *UNABLE TO REPLICATE* this bug on the latest QA post I saw. The bug that happened to 3 out of 3 players, on the first unlock, in the first boot of two separate dedicated server instances, and has clearly been an ongoing issue for 1.1 since the release of the experimental branch.

At this point, it seems they just do not care.

I love this game, but I can't stick up for it anymore. My friends are quitting for they day now instead of relogging, giving up on their builds, complaining about getting Satisfactory shorts instead of being excited to learn, and keep calling it unplayable. They're going back to their hosted multiplayer games, starting single player games because all the saves and progress is fragmented, and just not logging on. It only took two weeks. I know most people quit around coal power or aluminum, but this is not that.

Anyway, here's a picture of my first motor factory *(where I had to relog 3 times just to place the foundations)*

Caf√© 651 is truly a hidden gem in Jodhpur, and a big part of that magic comes from its incredible owner, Anant Baheti. From his warm personality and exceptional communication skills to his passion for serving high-quality food, everything about this place stands out.

Anant has a unique way of interacting with customers he personally asks for their food preferences and even tailors the taste to match individual choices. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of trying several of his signature shakes and new menu items, many of which he generously offered for free a reflection of his humble and kind-hearted nature.

What truly sets him apart is the way he treats people like family. I‚Äôve met him outside the caf√© several times by coincidence, and every time, his warmth and hospitality remained the same. His newly launched products, like Matcha tea and coffee, are absolutely amazing definitely must-try items.

On a serious note, Anant is not just a great owner he is an artist, a visionary, and someone who truly understands how to run a cafe. 
In my eyes, he is at the very top when it comes to cafe culture in Jodhpur. Make him go viral you‚Äôll thank me later.

So we're still chatting just as intensively, but now there are ""‚ù§Ô∏è"" and ""üòò"" emojis. I really want to see her again... Wednesday was a sleepless night for me, and she sent me a message at 3 a.m. A little more confidence, and I took my bike to her place to give her a hug! In the end, I waited for the morning on her way to work with a coffee to go, a good morning kiss, and a double goodbye kiss! It's going well!

 /!\WRONG STEP AHEAD!/!\

Feeling things were going well, I wanted to know what kind of relationship she wanted. I asked Marine (my Bestie) for advice, who told me not to ask it at this stage... but during a conversation, I thought it was the right time and asked her if she was looking for a casual relationship or rather to go some distance with someone...
Mistake, mistake...
Actually, it was too early, and she made that clear to me...
Well, it still worked, and I tried to cover the waters by going ""3 questions for 3 questions."" I blurted out two banalities and let her have her turn.
As I had sleepless night the night before, I fell asleep early.
In the morning, I woke up and looked at my phone: her three questions were there. The first one was already making me feel a little uneasy: my longest relationship... Until then, I'd been completely honest with her, so I'd continue with the truth : only a few months.  Which makes her realize my inexperience.
A bit of a red flag, though üò¨
But anyway, it's still okay, we keep going.
And then she reminds me of the second question: ""What's your vision of a relationship? What does it mean to you?""
That's when things go south.

Panic, panic, panic.
Total panic, even.
And ""panic"" isn't a strong enough word, actually.
I went into full overthinking, full anxiety. I took the question as an ultimate test on which the future of a relationship I'm hoping for but don't exist yet depended, on which practically my life depended.

So come an extreme anxiety attack that almost turned into a full-blown panic attack, with dysfunctional behaviors, self-harm reflexes, the urge to vomit all day long, the desire to escape into consumerism, etc.
So, in overthinking and anxious mode, I started writing a real dissertation in my notepad, even kind of a thesis, so afraid of not giving the answer she was expecting that I ended up completely lost.

It lasted all day until I said to myself, ""Damn, I can't put myself in this state... and now I'm breaking my ""complete honesty"" credo by writing what I think she wants to hear rather than what I'm looking for/desiring/thinking...""

From this observation, I set out to write my true vision of a relationship, all in one go, even if it meant forgetting something and not perfectly nuancing every signle sentences.
Honesty, authenticity, and spontaneity.
I simply described what my values dictated, what I truly desire, what I believe is healthy, what would suit me as a relationship.
Basically, my vision of a couple, which is exactly the question asked.
So, off I went, writing an answer in 15 minutes, after racking my brain for 8 long hours.

In short, I suffered (really) all day under the completely crazy and excessive pressure I imposed to myself.
I let myself be swept away by the waves of anxiety that was matched only by my panic attack, where I thought I would die on the spot.  I've lost what I think is most important in the ""relationship"" I currently have with Rachel, what makes it possible to evolve, what makes it healthy: my honesty about what/who I am.

Back to the present: I sent her my short text instead of my 50-page thesis with English/German/Spanish/Portuguese translations, and diagrams/anthropological research appended.
This short text doesn't try to pander to her.
This short text is simply honest and respectful of my values and expectations.
This short text respects me, but also her through its honesty.

Reply: ""I really don't understand how, with that talk, you never really had a relationship üòÖ.""

Either that means I seem to be mature despite my lack of experience in the matter (I've been honest about my timeless singleness), or that the answer meets her expectations, or (Inshallah) both.

And now we're still talking. She's at a festival this weekend but gave me her phone number in case the signal is lousy.

Anyway, it's still going!
Anyway, I almost ruined everything.
Anyway, I hope I learned from this day: less overthinking and more spontaneity/authenticity.

Moral of the story: I have to be myself.
Not to worry about trying to meet someone else's expectations at the risk of losing myself and making myself suffer for nothing.
In short, I have to exist as Gregor, with his strengths and weaknesses, rather than disguise myself with a mask.  I'm valued for being myself, and I can't meet my needs by trying to be something I'm not.
I hope the lessons from this episode will sink in and I'll grow from it.

# Premium Picks ($700 ‚Äì $850)

These desks combine top-notch build quality, excellent ergonomics, and beautiful design. If you want something that elevates your workspace and lasts for years, start here.


**Uplift Desk V2 ($800)**

Uplift continues to be a benchmark in the standing desk space, and the V2 is the reason why. I used this desk for nearly 6 months and couldn‚Äôt stop recommending it. The frame is solid even at full height, and the dual motors make height adjustments incredibly smooth and quiet.

Customization is a huge win here‚Äîyou can choose from dozens of desktop finishes, add accessories like monitor arms, and even install a hammock under the desk (yes, seriously). The digital keypad with memory presets is intuitive and the anti-collision system is a thoughtful touch.

___

**Vari Electric Standing Desk - 60x30 ($795)**

The Vari 60x30 is a plug-and-play dream. It ships mostly assembled, and I had it up and running in under 10 minutes. What struck me most was the stability‚Äîthis thing doesn‚Äôt wobble, even when you‚Äôre typing furiously at standing height.

It‚Äôs got a clean, professional look with a scratch-resistant surface. The motor is silent, and I love the built-in cable management tray. If you're looking for a premium desk without the fuss, Vari nails it.

___

**FLEXISPOT E6 Pro Oval Leg - 78x30 ($739)**

This was my main workstation for nearly four months, and the oval leg design adds both elegance and strength. The E6 Pro is equipped with a dual-motor system that makes transitions smooth, and the oversized desktop gives you all the space in the world for dual monitors, speakers, and more.

The control panel has 4 memory presets and a USB charging port, which came in handy more times than I can count. It‚Äôs a gorgeous, professional-grade desk that delivers on all fronts.

___

___

# Mid-Range Options ($400 ‚Äì $700)

These desks deliver excellent performance and aesthetics without going overboard on price. Perfect for most home offices.

**Flexispot E6 Essential Bamboo - 55x28 ($469)**

The bamboo surface adds a really nice natural touch to any room. I found this desk ideal for everyday use, and the motorized lift works smoothly even with multiple monitors.

It has a solid steel frame and the surface feels durable enough to handle day-to-day wear and tear. The controller includes three memory presets, and it‚Äôs quiet‚Äîalmost silent when moving.

___

**FLEXISPOT E3 Bamboo - 72x30 ($436)**

Bigger and sturdier than the 55x28 model, the E3 Bamboo is ideal if you need lots of room. I tested it during a multi-week stretch of editing video and writing long reports, and it never once felt cramped.

The extra width and depth were perfect for spreading out gear, and the motor handled everything without issue. Like most FlexiSpot desks, it‚Äôs easy to put together and comes with a smart, responsive controller.

___

**Monomi Electric Standing Desk - 79x31 ($442)**

Monomi might not be as well-known, but this desk is a hidden gem. It‚Äôs the widest in this category, and perfect if you need a full creative workstation.

Setup was simple, the frame is robust, and I didn‚Äôt experience any shake‚Äîeven when fully loaded with gear. It also includes built-in cable management and a hook for headphones or bags. Great value for its size.

___

___

# Affordable and Reliable ($200 ‚Äì $400)

You don‚Äôt have to compromise on quality if you're working with a smaller budget. These desks are dependable, practical, and perfect for everyday use.


**FLEXISPOT EN2 One-Piece - 48x24 ($209)**

One of the most accessible standing desks from FlexiSpot, the EN2 has a reliable single-motor lift and a sturdy build. I used it in a small studio and found it incredibly stable for its size.

It has 3 memory presets, a smooth touch controller, and a seamless desktop that resists stains and dents. For smaller setups, this is a no-brainer.

___

**ErGear Height Electric Standing Desk - 55x28 ($200)**

ErGear surprised me with this one. For the price, the lifting mechanism is remarkably smooth, and it supports more weight than I expected.

Setup was quick, and I appreciated the soft-edge finish of the desktop. It doesn‚Äôt look or feel like a cheap desk, and it handled daily use with no issues.

___

**HUANUO Standing Desk - 71x30 ($269)**

This desk is wide, sleek, and made for productivity. I used it in a shared office and was surprised at how premium it felt despite the price.

The wide surface gave plenty of room for dual monitors and accessories, and the lift system was quieter than expected. It‚Äôs a great pick if you need size without paying the premium.

___

___

# Budget Standing Desks ($100 ‚Äì $200)

Perfect for beginners, students, or temporary workspaces‚Äîthese desks offer surprising quality for the price.


**ErGear Adjustable Standing Desk - 48x24 ($159)**

I picked this one up for a guest room setup and was honestly blown away. It doesn‚Äôt have bells and whistles, but it gets the job done reliably.

The lift isn‚Äôt the fastest, but it‚Äôs consistent. The frame is lightweight yet stable, and it‚Äôs easy to move if you‚Äôre rearranging your space.

___

**Claiks Standing Desk - 24x48 ($139)**

If you‚Äôre really on a tight budget, Claiks is one to consider. I used it during a short-term rental stay, and it impressed me with its simple setup and compact footprint.

It‚Äôs best for light setups‚Äîlaptop, lamp, and a few accessories. Definitely not for heavy-duty multitasking, but great for casual use.

___

**FEZIBO Electric Standing Desk - 55x24 ($199)**

FEZIBO packs in features even at this price point. It comes with a drawer and cable management tray, which made it stand out to me.

The motor is on the slower side, but the desk looks great and performs well enough for most everyday users. A great entry-level option.

___

**FLEXISPOT EN1 - 48x24 ($109)**

Yes, it shows up again. FlexiSpot's EN1 straddles the line between budget and mid-range, and for good reason. I‚Äôve recommended this desk to countless people just starting their WFH setups.

It‚Äôs durable, easy to use, and gives you the features of more expensive models without the cost.

___

**Marsail Standing Desk Adjustable - 55x24 ($149)**

Marsail isn‚Äôt as known as FlexiSpot, but this desk holds its own. I tested it for a couple of weeks while hotdesking and found it great for simple setups.

It‚Äôs compact, comes in multiple colors, and features an intuitive height adjustment system. Stability was solid, and it fit well in a smaller apartment workspace.

# Final Thoughts: Which Standing Desk Is Right for You?

After spending countless hours working on these desks, I can say with confidence: there‚Äôs a perfect standing desk out there for every budget and workspace.

If you‚Äôre going all-in and want something premium, the Uplift V2 or FLEXISPOT E6 Pro are top-tier choices. For most home office users, desks like the FLEXISPOT Bamboo or Monomi hit the perfect balance of price and performance.

Budget users are in luck too‚Äîoptions like the FLEXISPOT EN1 and ErGear prove that affordable doesn‚Äôt have to mean low quality.

Whichever model you go with, you‚Äôre making an investment in your comfort, productivity, and long-term health. Don‚Äôt forget to pair your new desk with a good anti-fatigue mat and an ergonomic chair.",34,1750624122.0,desksetup,1,0.98,False

1lhxkzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhxkzn,"Ovation of the Seas Review, Los Angeles-San Pedro","My previous cruise experience was about 2 years ago on Navigator of the Seas and that was my first cruise.  This is my 2nd one.  Overall, had a great time with family and the kids had fun.  In no way, should this be considered a complaint.  There were my general observations.

**1st picture** = turn this way for hot water on the sink.  doing my part to help save water

**2nd picture** = to the right is a canopy for smoking.  this is when I am exiting the ship on level 5.  If you have any of these balcony rooms, you won't like them if you hate the smell of smoke

The main theme of this cruise was **limited access** especially for kids.  There are pictures with bumper cars, north star observation or iFly on all their marketing materials.  The area for the bumper cars also serves as the basketball court, pickleball court, basketball tournament, Private Event etc.  I know it's very hard to find places to play basketball or pickleball so try to understand from RCL's view.  They want to cater to all.

**Bumper cars** are for 2 days from 630-9pm for ages 5+.  Then from 9-945pm, teens 12-17.  Around 6pm, there is a huge line forming for bumper cars.  They will tell you to come back later but that's a mistake.  It took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get our turn and it lasted 2 minutes.  There are 12 cars total but they can actually have 20 cars and it will still be fine.  Most likely, your kid will get to ride it 1 time.  They ask your age and measure height for your kid.  Must be over 8 years old and 48 inches to drive alone.  No open toe shoes.

**iFly**\-all the free slots are gone on Day 1.  Day 2 and Day 3 are extended which is pay only.

**North Star**\-all the free slots are gone on Day 1.  Day 2 and Day 3 are extended which is pay only.

**Pool area-**Unlike Navigator, there are no slides.  There is also one indoor.  Not deep.  They have a small lazy river type enclosure but you are moving in circle with your own power.  On one side of the pool area with the lounge chairs where you can smoke.  The other side is non-smoking.  This means the entire area is smoking to a point.  If you are in the indoor pool, you can also smell the smoke.

**Elevators-**Even there were two banks of elevators, we used the stairs most of the time.  Very slow.

**Arcade**\-Weak.  Don't even waste time here

**Windjammer Buffet**\-Very popular and crowded.  Seems everyone is here.  Premium Coffee is at Starbucks, not the bar.

**Sorrento's Pizza**\-Not very crowded, had two slices and that was enough for me the entire trip.  Never came back.

**The cafe @ 270-**Real good sandwiches especially the roast beef with gravy.  Good desserts.  They can also customize a salad for you.  There is a Starbucks in here too.  No seating but sit in the 270 lounge which also has a bar.  Limited hours of operation.

**Bionic Bar**\-Many drinks to try.  No blended drinks.  I had the refreshment package and the attendant cancelled 2 of my orders and said I was going to be charged after I put 2 in.  Not really a concern of mine.  I just wanted to try the different drinks, not share and I was by myself.

**Refreshment package**\-On this boat, it includes the Starbucks (everything on the board).  There is no Johnny Rockets and no milkshakes.  I ordered a Cafe Latte and didn't like it so I went back to order another drink but was told I had to wait 15 minutes.  Might the same reason with the Bionic bar.  To me, unlimited means unlimited and I was exploring by myself.

**Fish and Ships**\-This was the former Johnny Rockets.  It was ok. Fries, fried shrimp, fried fish or chicken tenders.  You could have lobster but it's $12 extra.  The fish sandwich is actually one of the pieces they put on a bread.  Limited hours of operation.

**Dog house**\-In the basketball court area.  Limited hours.  Average.  Would rather get one from Costco.

**Internet package-**You connect to the Ovation of the Seas guest WI-FI.  The app should recognize you have it and it will show how many devices are connected.  If you wish to share, have your guest connect to the WI-FI too.  Instead of purchase, they will enter a code you create.  Then you will see 2 devices connected.  If you exceed, they just bump off the first device connected.  Worked really well during the cruise.

The decorations for the Panda Noodle House (2 pandas) are still on the ship.  Shame they took it out, would have loved to try it.  Even if it's bad Chinese Food, I would prefer that over hotdogs.  Flowrider was awesome and so were the lifeguards attending and actually showing people how to have fun.  My brother tipped them.

The weird thing about this cruise was that 3 out of 5 guests I walked by had BO.  The showers and soap are free on the ship.  You don't have to pay to use them.  It's a newer ship than Navigator but I am still having 10-20% sea legs symptoms as I typed this.  It was a lot worst when I got off the boat on Friday.  I normally don't get seasick but it really sucks.  I tried getting fresh air, sitting down, working out at the gym (shouldn't have done that), driving car, watching a movie at AMC, even going to baseball game.  I didn't get that from Navigator.",0,1750623605.0,royalcaribbean,1,0.38,False

So, something weird happened at work on Friday.

It turns out that we have pigs. I had just clocked out and was about to buy a loaf of bread for my mother when the sound of the automatic doors opening alerted me to our next customer.

‚ÄúHey, Spike. We got some customers coming in.‚Äù

Spike was scrolling on his phone and decided to respond by‚Ä¶ putting it away and being respectful. He got up and prepared himself to greet the customers.

I‚Äôm a bit desensitized to this stuff, so my socks weren‚Äôt blown off when a few pigs walked into the store. More pigs than we could realistically handle, but hey, what does that matter?

I walked up to one of the pigs and greeted them.

‚ÄúHello! How are you folks doing today?""

To my surprise, one of them actually started talking.

‚Äú*We are hungry*.‚Äù

I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the headache I knew was coming.

‚ÄúOkay. A‚Äîare you thinking anything in particular? We‚Äôve got lots of stuff.‚Äù

I then remembered that we had dumpsters out back.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù I said, cutting myself and the pig off (potentially) ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got some dumpsters out back! If the rumors are true, you guys‚Äôll eat anything, right?‚Äù

The pig grunted, snorted, and responded to me.

‚ÄúI guess so.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat.""

I led them out to the back where our dumpsters were. Spike and I worked together to tip one of them over, the contents of it spilling out into a disgusting, vomit inducing sludge pile.

The lead pig looked at me before directing his friends to the pile and lapping up the revolting swill.

When they finished, he looked back at me with hungry eyes.

‚ÄúSorry, folks. That‚Äôs all we got.‚Äù I said, shrugging my shoulders. The lead pig walked up to me.

‚ÄúWe are still hungry. We want more.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any more, I already told you. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he responded, turning around and directing his attention back to the dumpster, ‚Äúthis vessel of trash shall suffice, then.""

And to me and Spike‚Äôs complete surprise, the three pigs clamped onto different ends of the dumpster and each tore off a third of it.

As if our disbelief couldn‚Äôt suspend itself further, the pigs began to eat the thirds of the dumpster they took.

¬†In just a few short seconds, they had managed to chew the metal so that it was soft enough to not tear a hole in their throat as they swallowed it.

After swallowing the pieces of metal, the lead pig returned to me and uttered a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù before turning and trotting away.

Spike and I stood looking at each other for a few minutes before we snapped out of our trance and went back inside. On one of the registers, scribbled in near illegible handwriting, was the message ‚Äú***THANXS FOR THA FOODS*** ¬†***~~THE~~*** ***THE PIGS‚Äù***

Suppose we‚Äôve got something interesting to tell Lily about tomorrow.

\-EDIT-

They did say they could eat ANYTHING, huh?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I suppose it isn‚Äôt every day that a knife wielding maniac comes your way. Believe it or not, that happened to Lily yesterday just after Spike and I clocked out, so I‚Äôll let her tell you about it.

Even though I‚Äôm from Wales, I do not in-fact encounter knife-toting knob heads every day (only every other day). Anyways, a knife wielding maniac came into the store today.

Don‚Äôt worry about me. A person wielding a knife is pretty close to the bottom on the list of things I worry about encountering here.

Regardless, it still gave me a bit of a shock.

I was getting ready to close up the store, it being 11:47 PM and all, when I heard the sound of the automatic doors opening. Interesting. Who‚Äôd come in this late?

I found out pretty soon after who‚Äôd do that kind of thing.

He was about 5‚Äô10 and 180-ish pounds from what I could see (I don‚Äôt know, everything is big when you aren‚Äôt), and he held a machete in his left hand with mace in the right.

A wicked combo if you ask me.

Oh, right, he was covered in blood too. I really hoped it was his.

‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs closing time. You need to leave.‚Äù I said, putting myself into a defensive stance. I suppose if he attacked me, then it wouldn‚Äôt really matter, but I had to try something.

He turned to me and began to creep slowly in the same direction. I didn‚Äôt have a reason to be afraid, not deathly so, anyways. So long as he didn‚Äôt sprint at me or anything, I‚Äôd be fine.

‚ÄúMister,‚Äù I said, trying to sound as sympathetic as possible, ‚Äúit‚Äôs closing time, you gotta go.‚Äù

He broke his own silence.

‚ÄúHey, missy. You wanna know how many people I‚Äôve killed with‚Äôis thing?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of anything, which made his disturbed look a lot scarier.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt. Why‚Äîyou need to leave, sir.‚Äù

He began to wave the machete around.

‚ÄúPeople‚Äôbeen goin‚Äô missin‚Äô lately. You‚Äôre prolly wonderin‚Äô who‚Äôs been doin‚Äô it.‚Äù

I suppose I was.

‚ÄúWell, darlin‚Äô,‚Äù he said, pointing the machete at himself, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre *lookin‚Äô* at him.‚Äù

He was cackling by now.

Before I could do anything, he sprung up and launched himself at me. The whole ‚Äúlife flashing before your eyes‚Äù thing is really propped up. I just felt scared as he neared me.

Before he could hurt me, something came crashing down from the ceiling.

It was one of the Carpenter Goblins. He had struck the man on the head with a mallet.

After they incapacitated and brought the man outside, they returned to me and handed over a business card.

It said ‚ÄúCARPTENTER GOBLINS: WE BUILD STUFF. HIRE US.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe already have you guys on the payroll. Kent said so.‚Äù I replied.

Like that, they were gone.

Gone, but that was okay; they had done their job of 
helping

Strange, huh?

Being that I‚Äôm just a high school kid, letters from any ‚Äúsecret admirer‚Äù are not only few and far between, but also really fascinating and exciting (yeah, I‚Äôm a teenage male).

Over the past couple of days, though, it‚Äôs been really weird. I‚Äôll write out the contents of all the letters I‚Äôve received over the past two or so days.

**LETTER ONE**

‚Äú*To; Oliver Smith,*

*I‚Äôve been watching you. I‚Äôve been observing how you live, study, work, etc. And I must say, I like what I see ; )*

*If you want this to go somewhere, just write me back. I‚Äôll know where to find the letter.*

*In fact, here‚Äôs my number*

\*(XXX) XXX-XXXX (\*I am censoring it because I‚Äôm not letting any of you goons go through what I went through).

*Again, if you want this to go somewhere, then you know how to find me, my little 5‚Äô7 king.*‚Äù

And that was the first letter, a bit weird if you ask me. Nothing of it really caught my eye except for the number and the whole ‚Äú5‚Äô7 king‚Äù part. It‚Äôs average, okay?

I blotted out the number because again, I don‚Äôt want a single one of you goons calling it. IT WON‚ÄôT WORK OUT! IT DIDN‚ÄôT WORK OUT! Sorry, back to normal.

I decided to call it. For fun, you know.

After three rings, someone picked up. I made the first move.

‚ÄúH‚Äîhello?‚Äù

‚ÄúOliver?‚Äù First name basis now, cool.

‚ÄúUh, yup, that‚Äôs me. What‚Äôs with the letter?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it not obvious? I‚Äôve got kind of a‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ *thing* for you. I‚Äôve been sta‚Äîwatching you and I‚Äôm not going to lie; I like what I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, panicking, ‚Äúuh, do you want to meet up somewhere, or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hoping you‚Äôd ask something like that. Oh man, what a relief!‚Äù

I decided to put on the charm and see if I could sting her with anything.

‚ÄúGood thing I did. I can tell from your voice that you‚Äôre probably real pretty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSingle, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúReady to mingle.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, you wanna meet up somewhere?‚Äù Note, I was asking this because I wanted to catch a potential predator, nothing else.

‚ÄúCoffee shop near the market? I hear it isn‚Äôt too busy today.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! How does 3 PM sound?‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat! See you then!‚Äù Jackpot.

I told Spike, Lily and Clyde about it and they agreed to my little sting operation.

We all walked to the coffee shop. I had them wait outside while I went in. The shop was empty‚Ä¶ too empty.

Nobody was in there‚Ä¶ at all. In addition to that, all of the windows were blacked out.

¬†At least the barista was still working, but as I looked closer, I could see that the barista was a woman.

‚ÄúOliver?‚Äù She said, interrupting my thoughts.

I walked up to her.

‚ÄúHey, you. How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù I said in my best suave voice. I had to bait her into saying something.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she replied, ‚Äúyou want some coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer you, if that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù Please work, please work, please WORK.

‚ÄúOoh.‚Äù She said, walking out from behind the counter and leaning down in my face.

Now was the moment, all I had to do was not fuck it up.

‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù I screamed, and the door burst open, drenching the shop in sunlight.

Before the woman could do anything, she burst into flames.

Her screeches were quickly reduced to nothing more than deathly rattles as the last of the flames consumed her.

Turns out she was a vampire, I guess. Wouldn‚Äôt have expected that, but nothing in this town makes sense.

I suppose I now know where those customers went, too.

Oh, another thing. There was a note on the doors that said ‚ÄúNO PRODUCTS WITH GARLIC TODAY.‚Äù Should‚Äôve been a dead giveaway.

Well, I‚Äôm home now, relaxing and currently typing this out, actually. I‚Äôve got work again tomorrow, so I‚Äôm conserving my energy for that.

We‚Äôve got a new guy coming in tomorrow as well, and I‚Äôve gotta train him, so I‚Äôll let you folks know how that goes.

Until next time.

I recently had thigh lift surgery, and to be honest ‚Äî I was scared and didn‚Äôt feel fully prepared. I‚Äôve been postponing it and I really wanted this, so I just went for it. Posts here help me the most and now that I‚Äôve just finished week 3, I wanted to give back to this community. If you‚Äôre considering it or already booked, I hope this helps you feel more prepared, less anxious, and maybe even excited.

I want to emphasize that my incisions were ONLY on the bikini line, and shorter than I expected ‚Äî something that really surprised me in a good way.
‚∏ª

üîÅ Pre-Surgery: What Helped Me Most
	‚Ä¢	Read as much as you can about the procedure and recovery.
	‚Ä¢	Bloodwork & supplements in advance: I‚Äôm anaemic so I made sure all vitamin levels were in check.
	‚Ä¢	Nutrition: Ate clean and light for the day prior to the surgery and the 2/3 first post op days.

üí∏Buy key recovery items ahead:
	‚Ä¢	Toilet seat riser with armrests and cushion ‚Äì this was a game-changer for bathroom comfort, not the plastic basic one. This is a bit more expensive but you WILL use it, and it will help A LOT!
	‚Ä¢	Silicone pee funnel (Shewee/Flex urinal) ‚Äì you‚Äôll be peeing a lot, and this made things easier.
       ‚Ä¢ I bought women boxers underwear and they‚Äôve been all I‚Äôve used. Really helpful 
	‚Ä¢	Reading pillow and bed tray table ‚Äì you‚Äôll be mostly in bed for 2‚Äì3 weeks.
	‚Ä¢	Saline wipes, gauze, tape, scar balm, and boxer-style underwear ‚Äì lifesavers for wound care and comfort.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Week 1: Recovery Starts (The Toughest Week)
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll need someone with you for at least 5‚Äì7 days. I had my partner who helped with meals, meds, moving around and support.
	‚Ä¢	I was in bed 23 hours a day ‚Äî not because of extreme pain, but limited mobility and recovery needs.
	‚Ä¢	Started walking (slowly) on day 2 ‚Äî short 10‚Äì15 minute trips around the house help circulation a lot.
	‚Ä¢	Compression garment is a MUST ‚Äî don‚Äôt skip it. Yes, it‚Äôs uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs critical for healing and reducing swelling.

	‚Ä¢	TIP: Try different ways to wear it or pad areas where the seams rub (they hit right on the scars).
	‚Ä¢	I placed folded gauze + boxer briefs UNDER the garment to reduce seam pressure on my incisions.
	‚Ä¢	Liposuction pain was the worst part ‚Äî deep bruising, soreness, and the hardest thing was putting on/taking off the garment.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt wash the garment too much ‚Äî it loses compression. Try to keep it clean to minimize laundry.
	‚Ä¢	Pain meds: I stopped after 5 days, trying to ‚Äúbe brave,‚Äù but my doctor told me not to tough it out unnecessarily. So I took them again ‚Äî especially in the evenings when I felt most tired or sore.
	‚Ä¢	Hydration: My doctor advised me to stay hydrated but not overdo it ‚Äî some people drink excessively, which isn‚Äôt helpful. I found a balance by adding electrolytes and coconut water, which I highly recommend.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Week 2: Slight Progress + Self-Care Routine
	‚Ä¢	Could make my own coffee, tidy up small things, and move around the house more.
	‚Ä¢	Still resting mostly ‚Äî always had a pillow under my legs to relieve pressure.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin C, fish oil, collagen (especially at night)
	‚Ä¢	Prioritized high-protein meals and shakes ‚Äì essential for healing, muscle support, and skin recovery.
	‚Ä¢ I couldn‚Äôt bend or pick up anything, and that‚Äôs exactly when everything wants to fall on the floor ü§™.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Week 3: Major Improvements

      ‚Ä¢	Started DIY lymphatic drainage massage (approved by my doctor). I researched A LOT to do it myself, really do it soft and slow like they say, and built up from 15 to 25 minutes daily.

	‚Ä¢	Cicaplast by La Roche-Posay ‚Äì at the end of week 2.

	‚Ä¢	Walking feels more normal ‚Äî I even went downstairs for little errands like buying milk or throwing the trash away.
	‚Ä¢	No more ‚Äúpain‚Äù ‚Äî Bruises are fading. The first two weeks it was really not pretty to watch, so don‚Äôt give it too much thought, it‚Äôll pass. 
	‚Ä¢	Energy is back, but I still need rest and im prioritising healing. 
	‚Ä¢	Mentally much better. The emotional difference between Week 2 and Week 3 is HUGE. Less frustration, more hope.

Reflections
	‚Ä¢	Wear your garment ‚Äî seriously. It‚Äôs annoying, but absolutely worth it. Play with padding/layers to avoid discomfort.

	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt be a hero with pain meds ‚Äî take them if you need them. Especially in the evenings.

	‚Ä¢	Wound hygiene: Be meticulous. Keep the area dry, use sterile saline, and protect the incision from friction.

	‚Ä¢	Protein is your best friend ‚Äì focus on quality food and/or shakes after surgery to support healing.

	‚Ä¢	Collagen + Vitamin C helped me visibly with scar quality and skin elasticity (and for the next three months I will do so!)

	‚Ä¢	I used Electrolytes and coconut water to stay hydrated without having to drink lots 
	‚Ä¢	If you smoke or drink ‚Äî cut them during healing. They delay recovery.

	‚Ä¢	Have patience. This is a hard recovery, but it‚Äôs worth it. Don‚Äôt underestimate the emotional toll ‚Äî it‚Äôs normal to cry or feel overwhelmed, the first two weeks are really frustrating, but if you are prepared you‚Äôll get through it. It‚Äôs so worth it!!

	‚Ä¢	Do your research and ask your surgeon all the questions. Each case is unique, so understanding your specific surgery helps a lot.

‚∏ª

I‚Äôll probably update again after week 6 or the 1-month mark. If you have questions or want a list of the products I bought, I‚Äôm more than happy to share. üí¨

You‚Äôve got this ‚Äî go in prepared, be gentle with yourself, and trust that healing is on the way. üíú",3,1750623328.0,PlasticSurgery,0,1.0,False

1lhxg67,https://i.redd.it/xf0i31jsdj8f1.jpeg,[PSA] Homelessness is in our suburbs too - Let‚Äôs show up with kindness this winter.,"
They are not just in the city anymore!

You might not realise it, but there are people doing it really tough in our suburbs, right here in Perth.

We often associate homelessness with the CBD or busier areas, but more and more people are quietly moving into outer suburbs to feel safer. Some are living in their cars, parking in quiet streets overnight. Others are in makeshift tents near bush reserves. Some are couch surfing. Many of them are families, and yes, even children.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking, and it‚Äôs real. And with the cold setting in, it‚Äôs time we gently pull together.

This isn‚Äôt about blame or shame, it‚Äôs about community. About kindness.

Here are some simple things you can do that really make a difference:

- Pay it forward at your local caf√© or deli. Buy an extra coffee or hot meal in advance and ask the staff to offer it to someone who looks like they need it. A warm drink can go a long way on a cold morning.

- Gather your spares. Got extra blankets, jackets, sleeping bags, or a spare tent gathering dust? Load them into your car and offer them out when you come across someone in need.

- Make up care packs
A ziplock bag with some travel-sized toiletries, a roll of toilet paper, muesli bars, sanitary products, maybe even some lollies. Hand them out when you can. These are small things that restore dignity and bring comfort.

- Just be kind.  A bit of eye contact, a ‚Äúyou okay, mate?‚Äù, a smile. Feeling seen matters more than we realise.  Remember, but for different circumstances, that could have been you!

No one chooses this life. Everyone has a story.

Let‚Äôs show up with compassion, not because we have to, but because we can.

Stay safe, Perth. Stay warm. Stay kind. ",0,1750623277.0,perth,5,0.38,False
