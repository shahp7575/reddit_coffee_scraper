1ntzcay,https://i.redd.it/77gwqyrc97sf1.jpeg,Hydrangeas growing like crazy in my garden this time of year!,"Bill and Shuxin know how to do it right. It's soooo easy to add beans to a subscription order, too easy lol. Unlike some roasters (ahem, Black & White). Their selection has been unreal lately and I can't stop adding bags.

I've brewed and gotten great cups out of a bunch of these already (Pepe Jijon is still resting, but I just got through the TyOxy from Luminous so assume the same approach will work here), **but one I'm struggling with and a few are new to me. So would love some feedback/advice:**

* **Hachi Haiku**: I've had Hachi Sutera & Hachi Puma and was blown away. But I'm struggling with this. Cupped it (and wow)..so know it's bursting with potential I haven't reached yet. I've ground between 6.5 and 10 on my 078, water temp 195-200. Used Origami/V60 and Pulsar. Pulsar used the Tetsu Devil, and for O/V60 basically a Hoffman better 1 cup. **Who's getting great cups out of this?** Do I need to push the temps? The bean is ""Panamania Landrace"" so can't fall back on my general approach to the bean because I'm not even sure what that means (I've brewed a ton of Ethiopian Landrace, but think this is a specific modified bean??).

* **Salma Bermudez** - Can you brew it the same as Letty and get great results, or should it be handled differently?

* **Sudan Rume** -- I've never even had this type of bean before so super stoked. Would love to hear where/how to start with this one.

* **Las Margaritas Gesha** -- Have brewed a fair amount of washed Colombian Gesha, but would still love to hear from people who've had great results with this specific bean.

Anyways, I thought I'd ask for any input on what am I going to regret, what am I missing, where can I squeeze out some more usable space or optimize? 

I recognize it's probably hard to comment without a lot of context so here's a video showing before (partial): [https://photos.app.goo.gl/BsxThadNk7pRzfH16](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BsxThadNk7pRzfH16) 

Couple existing ideas:

* Add a few open-shelves/boxes, especially around range for quick access oil or salt. 
* Making the last column of cabinets to the left of the range deeper to sit flush with that wall that juts out
* Vary the shelving on open end to look more interesting and functional (not just same 15"" shelves)

About Me

My ""stats"" are 5'10"" and 170lbs. I'm a highly motivated person, constantly striving for improvement and challenging my own beliefs. I've built a life I'm proud of through my work as a chemical operator, a career that gives me a good living and the flexibility to stay in touch throughout the day. When I'm not at work, I love running, going to the gym regularly, and playing with my pit/lab mix named Strider (yes, as in LOTR).

I'm a bit of a nerd, so fantasy is a huge thing for me—from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays. I play PC games with my friends, I visit the local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume, so it would be cool if we could bond over that! I also love to travel, read history books, and try new restaurant/coffee shops, hanging with friends, and music festivals.

What I'm Looking For

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the exact same hobbies, having the same goals and a similar future outlook is most important. I'm looking for a partner to share in the small, intimate moments that make a relationship special:

\- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings

\- Evening coffee shop reading dates

\- Random road trips and hitting the gym together

\- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together. Relocation to me is ideal.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25.

During this time of existential breakdowns, coming to terms with the very pre-mature death of my mother and the reality of what means in 20, 50, or who-knows-how-many-years, trying to live up to all my duties and responsibilities that came with thinking I had God's power, trying to do what someone else said God told them to tell me. All while taking a nice cut of my paycheck.

Sleepless nights. Wondering if I was doing the right thing or not. Studying like crazy. Searching for anything and everything. But I still tried. I tried so hard. To think that I could be the one that splits my wife and our son from our eternity in Heaven. It made me physically ill to grapple with that.

It meant nothing. I was struggling over it all, but some of my family and my wife's family didn't see that struggle. My father sees me as abandoning the faith to choose a life of sin (essentially, just not going to boring-ass church on Sundays. I still basically live the WoW, got too old to try acquire a taste for coffee or alcohol, I am happily married and monogamous [again, no judgement to others] to my best friend who is on this journey with me, I can't think of what other betrayal of commandment would apply) and everything he did for me, and my in-laws see me as someone choosing a ridiculous social club/cult over our wonderful, amazing nephew who came out as gay. I tried to reconcile it all in mind. How could I love him, be an example (AS IF HE FUCKING NEED ONE AND LIKE IT WOULD EVER BE ME) but all that they saw was me choosing church over that amazing young man who will soon be a paramedic and do more for the good for the world than I could ever imagine to do.

They saw me as judgmental and a bigot and someone who was didn't truly love as I should. It didn't matter my sleepless nights, hours-long discussions with old mission companions and my sister who saw the light before me, listening to podcasts and reading articles.. . How many sleepless nights did that brilliant soul have over how he was raised compared to how he felt, while I was sitting there thinking, ""his actions were evil, but he wasn't."" I struggled and fought this battle for years in my head, but it wasn't seen. It was just seen as a quiet disapproval from afar as I truly hoped for all the success and happiness that he could have.


I love that kid. Have since I met him when he was 7 years old. I was arguing theology to myself instead of reaching out to family to see how I could make their lives better, how I could be a better brother-in-law, uncle, cousin, anything like that. I was so scared of what happened after this life, I quit caring about anything that was actually happening in this life right now.

Not that it matters, but I don't think I am a bigot. I truly try to love all people. I've been probably among the most fortunate and privileged people to ever exist on this planet and still the struggle and the daily challenges seem insurmountable at times. This self-centeredness blinded me to the reality of the world for the many of those not as lucky as me.  The only time I truly feel any value is when I can help someone. Either with a project, with time, with something I am lucky enough know and be skilled at. But because for years I obstinately refused to entertain that I wasted 28 years (2 of those being uninterrupted), that is not how I am perceived.

To those who I haven't shown the love they deserve as humans, I am sorry. I was so self-centered I did not see the pain and struggle of those around me, and even my inaction could come across as approval of the decisions and statements of those who I let lead me and tell me how to think. To my wonderful nephew, P., I should have been screaming how proud I am to know you and what a privilege it has been to see you grow up. 

I really hope I am lucky enough to have 33 more years here to try and make up for the first half.",4,1759192920.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

During the day I can kinda distract myself, work, coffee, walking around. But as soon as it gets dark and I’m just sitting around, boom, the cravings smack me like a truck.

It’s like my brain knows I used to go for a “night cig” and now it’s screaming at me like, “yo where tf is it??” Last night I literally paced around my room like some weirdo just to burn the urge off.

Not gonna lie, I almost gave in, but I kept telling myself I already fought through 3 whole days, I’m not throwing it away for one smoke.
Couple things that actually worked for me so far:

1. Mouth trick. I chew on straws or toothpicks when cravings hit,  sounds dumb but it shuts my brain up for a bit.


2. Night walk. Literally walking outside at 10pm killed a craving way faster than sitting around fighting it.


3. Don’t just rely on willpower. It never works long-term, I’ve relapsed too many times.


4. Use science. I started using an app called SMOKD from the appstore, been solid so far. But there’s tons of other science-based programs/challenges out there too, just pick one.


5. Cold shower. Weird one, but it shocks my body enough to reset the urge.


Anyone else get hit way harder at night? What’s been helping you push through?

Looking for a nice dinner date.,"I feel like this might a strange request in this economy, but here goes. This isn't necessarily a dating post per se, but I wouldn't say no to a connection if it turned out to be there. 

I have what I think is a pretty decent social life *usually.* I have a pretty large friend group from all over, but you know, life happens. People leave the city, change jobs, make families, etc. It's hard to find days that overlap. I love hanging with my friends, I just miss when it wasn't on a screen over Zoom. (giving me pandemic flashbacks!)

About me - I'm 37, white and living downtown near Queen West. My current hobbies are probably reading, cooking and spending time outside. It was a good summer. I literally just got a dog, so now my life is pretty much either running around, or sitting somewhere comfortably. I love to cook for people whenever I can as well, so I'm big fan of potlucks, board game nights or movie nights. I will literally cook a whole custom menu if you will watch Lord of the Rings with me. 

Anyways, I just realized its been a really long time since I've gotten to go out and enjoy a nice meal with another grown adult. In person. I'm not some super aggressive foodie, but I do like to save up to splurge a little on something nice once in awhile. I have no problems going to restaurants alone, but some places I like will only take a reservation for 2. 

things to note:

- I don't have a place in mind yet, this is an impulsive decision I'm making right now. Suggestions are welcome. 
- I am not looking for you to pay. We'd each pay our own bills. 
- Drinking is cool with me, loud loud places are not. 

That's pretty much it. All I'm looking for is someone I can have a good conversation with. I've done my time on the dating apps, with most dates being park hangs or coffee dates. I love those, but I'm in the mood for a change.

My only real criteria is that I'd prefer you be 30+.

I’m working on starting up a veterans community garden in my town, and I’d love to get some feedback from other vets on what would actually make this worth showing up for and give it the value we need in an outdoor space.

The idea started because I kept running into other vets like myself who wanted to garden but didn’t have space. I was growing stuff in pots, wanted more room, but couldn’t afford it. The local community garden is great, but honestly I don’t have a lot in common with most of the people there and I just feel exposed. Around here the only real option to hang out with vets is the VFW or Legion. Nothing against them, but it wasn’t the space I was looking for. So I thought, what if we had a simple garden where vets could dig in the dirt, grow some food, and hang out together.

I don’t own land, so I went down the rabbit hole. I asked myself, “how do I get land to garden for free.” Eventually I found a veteran forward nonprofit that agreed to give me and my crazy ideas into a fiscal sponsorship, which opens the door to grants. Since then things have snowballed with support. Local veteran owned businesses are helping where they can, I’ve got an agriculture teacher advising (because I’m no expert), and even local media picked it up (I refused a video interview because I’m a special flavor of paranoid crazy I guess…). We’ve already had donations offered, including deer fencing, wood chips, labor, and a 12x20 timber frame pavilion for classes and vegetable production. On top of that, more partnerships keep rolling in. People really want to help make this happen, which is surprisingly surprising!

I’ve had a few offers of land but need something closer to town. I know I can’t be picky hahahahahha!

I know there are similar projects out there, but I envision this as kind of an outdoor VFW or Legion except quieter, healthier, and focused on learning and community. I have researched and reached out to those programs.

Here’s the vision so far:

• Each vet can have a bed or plot for the season if they want their own space
• A communal space for vets who don’t want the responsibility of their own bed but still want the community
• ADA accessible: raised beds, wide walkways, shaded areas, and vine screens for folks dealing with PTSD or photosensitivity
• Workshops led by local pros: gardening, canning, mushrooms, bees, you name it
• “Bro stuff” like chili cook-offs, making salsa, movie nights, coffee mornings, and an earth oven
• Anything grown in the communal area will go to elderly vets or be donated to the community
• Family-friendly days with a small kids’ play space so childcare isn’t a barrier
• Community days where the public can join in since it’ll be ADA accessible
• A therapeutic space that could also support alternative therapies or just quiet time

But here’s where I need help:

• What am I not thinking about? I’ve thought about PTSD, bad backs, mobility, TBI and photosensitivity, and making it ADA friendly. But what else could keep someone from wanting to be in a garden like this
• If you had a unique situation that made gardening tough, what accommodations would help
• Beyond that, what would make you actually want to show up to something like this

I’m also tying this into the VA’s Whole Health program. The idea is that the outpatient clinic here could work together. For example the physical therapists could help vets tailor gardening routines, dietitians could reinforce healthy cooking and eating, and it could serve as a form of movement and passive horticulture therapy for mental health. It’s under review now, and my hope is if the VA health team sees value, maybe they will sign off on allowing the social workers to suggest it as an option. Why not align it with health and wellness while still doing chili cook-offs and letting the kids play in a sandbox hahahahaha!

As soon as we secure land, the agriculture advisor will start drafting plans for irrigation, pavilion, beds, and infrastructure. I want to make sure it’s as versatile and accessible a space as possible.

If any of you have skills you’d be willing to lend advice on like landscaping, design, web, marketing, organizing, or anything else I’d be super grateful. This isn’t for profit, I’m not asking for money, just knowledge, feedback, and guidance. I want to build the best space I can for us.

Thanks for reading, and for any advice you’re willing to share.


TLDR I’m a vet trying to start a community garden for veterans, a space with individual plots, a communal area, ADA accessibility, workshops, and family-friendly days.

Sorry in advance for the lengthy post. I have MCAS (now confirmed with testing after many years) and gastroparesis and dysautonomia. I also have a rare neurodegenerative disease called Spinocerebellar Ataxia that gets worse when I’m reacting to a bunch of stuff and makes me even sicker. 

I just had allergy testing to try to figure out what part actual food allergies might be playing on top of my baseline mast cell instability. I guess I’m so used to having food reactions that nothing feels out of the ordinary, but it turns out that I’m allergic to a LOT: a slew of respiratory allergens that could cause food cross-reactions,  as well as dairy, eggs, soy, peanuts, sesame, some fish and shellfish, wheat, mushrooms, strawberries, melons, squash, yeast, chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, and I know I’m forgetting a few. I’m also really reactive to artificial sweeteners, stevia, and other sugar substitutes. I’ve long had suspected celiac disease (with many testing failures) and am gluten-free. I’ve never been able to eat much fruit, so I didn’t test for those, and Gastroparesis has seriously limited veggies I can eat (down to some cucumber, spinach, potatoes, carrots, and maybe a bite or two of cauliflower). 

In 2023-24, I lost more than 30% of my body weight due to gastroparesis (GP) and was told I had malabsorption and malnutrition. Without enough protein, I burned a lot of my own muscle and got a lot weaker. My hair was falling out. It wasn’t pretty. 

With the help of a dietitian, I worked hard to increase my intake and stabilize my weight so I didn’t end up with a feeding tube or being fed TPN via a port. I found a reasonable rhythm but still can’t have any of the stuff that those with GP have to avoid, so little to no fiber or residue (like skins, seeds, and pulp), low fat, and no red meat. I eat one small meal a day with some chicken or seafood, maybe some rice or potatoes, and a drink with some puréed veggies.

I had been getting the majority of my calories in liquid form through a DIY protein shake that incorporated several ingredients I’m now allergic (mostly dairy and the flavoring elements of chocolate, vanilla and/or coffee). My little treats that also kept me fed in part included chocolate chips and ginger cookies. 

Does anyone have any ideas of vegan high-protein liquids (or protein powders) that aren’t chocolate or vanilla, are sugar sweetened if sweetened at all? Or other things I may be able to consume in liquid form? I have to get most of my calories in liquid form because I can only eat around 4 ozs of solids before I tap out. Soups are a possibility, but commercially prepared ones often contain yeast, and I’m worried about trying to do a lot more cooking even though I once was a huge cook. 

Thanks!!!

The Kia Tigers and Samsung Lions clash in a ""must-win-or-cripple-their-season"" thriller, and the odds? Let’s just say Samsung is the overconfident class president who already wrote their acceptance speech, while Kia is the eliminated team trying to steal the principal’s coffee.

**The Numbers, Because Math > Feelings**

* **Moneyline**: Samsung Lions are a -700 favorite (decimal: 1.31), implying they’ll win \~76% of the time. Kia Tigers (+550, decimal: 3.5) are your ""bet on this if you enjoy throwing money into a fire"" pick.
* **Spread**: Samsung -1.5 (-200) vs. Kia +1.5 (+160). The Tigers would need to *win outright* or *lose by a run* to cover, which is about as likely as a math teacher admitting pi is *just a suggestion*.
* **Total**: 9.5 runs (Over 1.85, Under 2.05). With Samsung’s bullpen tighter than a single’s dance floor and Kia’s offense slower than a spreadsheet in 1995, *Under 9.5* is the only sane play.

**Why Samsung Will Win**  
Samsung needs this

1ntyukr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyundaiSantaFe/comments/1ntyukr/favorite_accessories_after_9_months_25/,Favorite accessories after 9 months 25 calligraphy hybrid,"Haven't had a good ""what accessories I should get"" post recently, but felt like being proactive with a list of the ones I like most would be worth some delicious internet points. Also, avoiding my inlaws as long as possible.

* Yakima timberline towers and jetstream cross bars. The OEM crossbars are ugly as sin. These are nice and low profile. They stick out over the roof rails giving good anchor points for rachet staps, and making it compatible with the ShowDown kayak rack
* Yakima ShowDown kayak rack, if you have a kayak. The rack extends then folds down so instead of heaving the kayak to the roof, you pick it up to about mirror level to place on an arm of the rack then lift it to the rooftop. Much easier.
* Combination trailer hitch lock - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W0OFXG](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W0OFXG) \- haven't used it enough to see how it holds up to mud/dust/water, but so far so good.
* CUrt trailer hitch. DIY installation was easy and needed just a couple tools, very good instructional videos specific to the santa fe are on youtube. [**https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7MVZPHZ**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7MVZPHZ) 
* Trailer hitch extender. Because of the lower ground clearance, certain trailer hitch accessories scrape the ground. [https://www.harborfreight.com/automotive/trailers-towing/hitches-receivers/dual-hitch-extender-69881.html](https://www.harborfreight.com/automotive/trailers-towing/hitches-receivers/dual-hitch-extender-69881.html) 
* Ceramic window tint for heat rejection (I'm in Phoenix, so everything helps)
* Charging pad protector, keeps the little plastic part with metal paint from being as scratchable and the ""white"" color is a near perfect match to beige. Can still wirelessly charge through it. Maybe it degrades the charging some, but the charging already sucks so I don't much care. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHGV557D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHGV557D)
* Leather key fob. While I hate stuff in my pockets and was trying to get by with only my phone as the digital key, I got tired of how slow and unresponsive the phone key is. But I also hate how cheap and flimsy the key feels, so I am biting the bullet and adding some bulk to my pocket by making the fob feel more substantial and look pretty nice. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DC6LCT6X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DC6LCT6X)
* I got some generic floor mats on amazon that was the only set I could be certain fit my calligraphy hybrid perfectly, but looks like the seller changed that listing to the Tucson and I don't see the santa fe version. Womp womp
* Stainless steel bumper protector for inside plastic. I don't think it's really steel and it feels like a cheap piece of shit, but also it doesn't seem to matter and honestly I kinda forgot I had it installed until I was packing up from my elk hunt. Judging from how scuffed up it is, it's saved that plastic from some pretty nasty gouges. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6NP9YY](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6NP9YY)
* The center console tray from this set, but not the secondary tray organizer it comes with. If I'm remembering correctly, it creates a third tier to the center console and the long skinny slot on the side is perfect for storing baseball cards when you buy packs and can't wait to get home to open them. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY5BMQ5H](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY5BMQ5H)
* This specific secondary tray organizer (but not the center console organizer it comes with) that has size-adjustable cup holders. I mostly use for empty coffee mugs or unopened soda. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3DY1FVB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3DY1FVB)
* Screen protector. Maybe it's overreacting to think I need it, but I don't want to take any chances. Surprisingly, it was much easier to install the protector for the main screen than for the AC control area. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMBXJPLG](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMBXJPLG)
* Orvis trail tough cargo area protector, full size. It hangs off of the second row head rests. It's extra long to fold out for bumper protection, or you could use that length to cover extra space when the second row is down. Zipper in the middle is perfect for the second row captains chairs...unzip when I need to slide a 2x4 through (when it's not enough to justify the roof rack), zip up when not needed. Mine has handled 9 months of camping, fishing, hiking, biking, hauling a bunch of shit, bird hunting, elk hunting, etc., with only stains that I haven't bothered to try to clean out. Currently on sale for like 60% off. [https://www.orvis.com/product/tough-trail-grip-tight-cargo-protector/3FEM0953.html](https://www.orvis.com/product/tough-trail-grip-tight-cargo-protector/3FEM0953.html) (on amazon it's $30 more expensive)
* Carhart universal seat protectors. 'But wHy GEt LeATheR JusT tO CovER iT Up??A@!#?"" Well, it turns out my child, dog, passengers, and cargo don't give a single fuck that I have beautiful leather. So I have two seat protectors on the rear seats at all times. These fit fantastically and actually look surprisingly nice. I went with gray since nothing looks like a perfect match to beige and this seemed the less clashy. And as much as duck blind camo would be appropriate for my outdoors activities, I just didn't want to look at that all the time. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZQSGRSP](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZQSGRSP)
* Orvis trail tough bucket seat protectors. They appear to be discontinued, but I also got two of these a while back for my front seats when I'm doing dirty things. They're much easier to quickly install and remove than the Carhart, and feel more premium too. If you run across a set, I recommend.
* Ruffland large SUV dog kennel. Fits well in the cargo area. It takes up a lot of space, but I find for packing for hunting or camping trips, it actually makes the cargo area much more usable, so paradoxically it ends up making more space than it takes up because I can stack things against it that would otherwise fall on the dog. Also keeps dog and passengers safe when driving. [https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/ruff-land-gen-2-suv-performance-kennel](https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/ruff-land-gen-2-suv-performance-kennel) (usually Sportsmans Guide short membership is worth the cost for shipping and overall price discounts unless you can find this in a local store) (also, I think the non-SUV model would probably fit just fine).",1,1759192074.0,HyundaiSantaFe,1,0.67,False

1ntyrzp,https://i.redd.it/qt769nji27sf1.jpeg,New speaker day - Triangle Borea BR04,"I've been planning a speaker purchase for a bit, as I've got a final ""trickle down electroninomics"" listening area to flesh out, and I wanted to move my Wharfedale 225s to my NAD setup in the bedroom, and move the older PSBs I have there into this new listening space. 

I also have been working towards matching the color theme in my main listening area, which is a dark green accent. First up was my green Moccamaster coffee maker, followed by my green EVO 2 turntable, and I was considering the few decent speakers that come in green - KEF has some, and Triangle and I think there are a few others I can't recall at the moment.

This was going to be a 2026 purchase, but ListenUp had to go and aggressively price an open box pair of green BR04's, so I took the plunge. 

Still early, but I am **impressed** by these speakers. The upper range has opened up noticeably, but remains well under sibilant hiss levels. Less warm than the Wharfedales, but still what I'd call warm and musical. 

Listening through Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler is *in the room with me.* I got hints of that effect with the 225s, but it's the standard with these. 

I goofed at first as I had them directly on the stands and the bass was very underwhelming - then I saw the isolation feet I hadn't installed yet. That fixed the problem, bass is very good - tight and present, not boomy. Drums sound real. 

There are just a few reviews of these but they've been positive, but it's great to get them and hear that for myself. 

And the 225's sound excellent in the bedroom as well! Two upgrades in one! I love my old PSBs, but they are the smaller 4"" midwoofer versions, so this was definitely an upgrade move for that listening space.

I'm gonna text my boss and tell him I have a vision problem - I just don't see myself going into work tomorrow ... I've got to listen to everything again!",19,1759191873.0,BudgetAudiophile,3,1.0,False

1ntyrkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AspiringTeenAuthors/comments/1ntyrkk/any_advice/,Any Advice?,"Hiya! I’m a fifteen year old writer who has just made her first story! If any of you guys would like to share any advice or tips on the plot, characters, behaviors, etc, please let me know!

DISCLAIMER: this is JUST a rough draft, nothing is set in stone (i am just a girl lol)


In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But  then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away. 

That same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. 

In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scarlett is sharp, observant, and often cynical, using biting humor to mask her vulnerability. She is perceptive and picks up on inconsistencies in her parents' behavior. 

Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss. 

The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. 

While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: Chunichi Dragons vs. Yomiuri Giants (2025-09-30)**  
*By The Baseball Oracle, aka the guy who once bet on a team named “The Sausage Dogs” and lost*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The Chunichi Dragons are the slight favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around **57%** (based on their best H2H odds of 1.74). The Yomiuri Giants, meanwhile, are priced at **\~52%** (best H2H odds of 1.91). That 5% gap isn’t huge, but it’s enough to make a bookie mutter, “*This is closer than a no-hitter in the 9th inning.*”

The spread tells a more aggressive story. The Dragons are -1.5-run favorites on most books, with odds like **2.52** (FanDuel). That translates to an implied probability of **\~30%**, which feels optimistic for a team trying to end a three-game losing streak. Conversely, the Giants at +1.5 runs (odds \~1.44) imply a **61% chance** to cover, which feels like a gift for desperate bettors.

The totals are locked at **6.5 runs**, with even money on over/under. If you’re betting over, you’re banking on a fireworks show. Under? You’re hoping for a pitching duel that makes a nap feel exciting.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Tanaka’s 200th Win or a Melodrama?

Masahiro Tanaka, the Yomiuri Giants’ 41-year-old pitching legend, is one out away from 200 career wins (combined NPB and MLB). His recent prep start? A poetic failure: *“I gave everything I had… to lose 3-2 in 10 innings.”* Now, he’s facing the Chunichi Dragons at Tokyo Dome, where the Giants have lost three straight.

Tanaka’s mindset? Classic Zen master: *“I don’t think about the 200 wins. I just focus on doing my job. Results follow.”* Translation: *“I’m too old and too tired to care if this is my last shot at glory.”* Meanwhile, the Giants are in a playoff race, and Tanaka’s team needs this game more than a caffeine addict needs coffee at 3 a.m.

The Dragons? They’re the hungry alligators of this matchup, snapping at the Giants’ heels. Their offense has scored 5+ runs in four of their last five games, which is baseball’s version of a buffet.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KT Wiz vs. NC Dinos: A Playoff Parlay Packed with Punch**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The KT Wiz (-1.5, -200 to -220) are the chalk here, per the odds, while the NC Dinos (+1.5, +165 to +176) are the underdogs. Implied probabilities? KT’s 55-58% chance to win vs. NC’s 43-46%. The total runs line hovers around **8.5**, with Over/Under odds tight (1.83-1.96). For a same-game parlay, the most tantalizing combo is **KT Wiz to win AND cover the -1.5 spread (+218 to +224 combined odds)**. Why? Because it’s a high-confidence play with amplified returns, and who doesn’t love a good “spread + result” combo?

**Digesting the News: Coffee Streaks and Playoff Nerves**  
NC Dinos are riding a **five-game winning streak**, longer than any team in the KBO this season. Sounds impressive, but let’s be real: A five-game win streak is like a barista’s caffeine addiction—great in theory, but eventually, they’ll crash. NC’s last five wins include games against the **Kiwoom Heroes** (already eliminated) and **LG Twins** (clinching their title). Translation: They’ve been beating up on tired, motivated, or mathematically doomed teams.

KT Wiz, meanwhile, are fighting for their playoff lives. A win here keeps them in the 5th-place race, while a loss? They might need a miracle involving the **KT Wiz’s starting pitchers suddenly developing Nolan Ryan’s arm speed**. The Dinos, on the other hand, can clinch a playoff berth with a win **and** a **KT loss** later this week. But let’s not forget: NC’s closer, **Oh Jae-hoon**, is retiring after this game. Does that mean he’ll go out with a **99 mph fireball** or a **grandma’s gentle hum**? The odds are 50-50.

**Humorous Spin: The Absurdity of KBO Math**  
KT’s -1.5 spread is like asking a toddler to climb a 1.5-meter wall

i can only imagine how many witnesses there were. 

it’s been haunting me all day. 

i compulsively check the bed and clear EVERYTHING out before getting on the freeway…. 

That is, until this morning around 8:45AM, running late, no coffee. To my shock and horror I see a roll of blue shop towels begin fully unrolling and flapping out behind me. 

Absolutely baffled, I regrettably froze, letting my lifelong fear of stopping on the side of the freeway take hold. 

After accidentally letting my freak flag fly for what felt like an embarrassingly long time, I watched it blow out of the bed and into the traffic behind me. 

I did watch to make sure it didn’t hit the cars directly behind me, but I felt so horrible all day for littering and impairing my fellow commuters. 

If you witnessed this and got a laugh, I hope to laugh about it tomorrow… After a couple hours spent picking up litter in my neighborhood to absolve myself.

Later, dumaan sya sa harap ko sabay sabi ng something along the lines of “Wala naman pala talaga kasama. Pinagdamot lang yung upuan”

So I was confused. Kasi kung makikiupo lang naman sya saglit kasi magtake out sya, okay lang sakin na umupo sya. Pero if plano nya kunin yung chair, I can’t give it kasi nga babalik kasama ko. 

Kung di naman expected na babalik kasama ko, I would have given the chair. Which I usually do naman pag mag isa ako. And I think I have the right dun sa chair kasi I ordered enough naman?

Unfortunately, late na nakabalik yung kasama ko but still within 2 hours. And we didn’t stay for more than 2 hours naman.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Garrett and I have been seeing each other for coffee once a week these past two months; there we talk a great deal about various subjects, U.S politics, societal issues, philosophies, psychology/psychologists, the arts, music, and aspects of our own personal growth. He's insightful, empathic, and does well for himself as well as the community. He inspires me to be authentic and think critically about things, which I'm concerned I am not doing well in this situation. Despite my age, I've been through fairly traumatic relationships in the past, which has led to my cowering in the face of raw connection. When I think about Garrett, it's different; I am not scared, but I don't know if this is just because my mind is craving something it can't find in my small town. That being said, both of us have expressed our need to pack it up and hit the road. I hate being stagnant. I got a taste of travelling life and fell in love. And, playing what I can out in my head, the only thing I'm getting snagged on is the large age gap between us. I'm not looking for an answer; that's something I'll have to weigh out myself, but I would like to hear about someone else's relevant experience(s) in being in love/in a relationship with someone older than themself.

1ntyddx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1ntyddx/canadagta_a_unique_request_steamdeck_oled_owners/,[Canada/GTA] A Unique Request ! Steamdeck OLED owners.,"Hey guys/gals; i have a uncommon request for those of you in the area. 

Being a long time PC-gamer, a dad with limited time to game, in Mississauga, I have a ROG G14 laptop and a 1440p/180hz/HDR 1000 monitor, GFN account and life is good ... but FOMO ;) - i have been considering a steamdeck for a while now as a secondary device but not really sure about it, and given that us in the 51st state don't have a lot of options like buying it at a bestbuy, getting it from steam in the US and than not liking it/returning it within 14 days seems like a problem.

So simple ask, only if you are interested in helping out and not daily driving it, would any of you be interested in r**enting me your deck for say a couple of weeks / a month to try out**? You can ofcourse remove your account / factory reset it (i know that's a hassle for you). We can meet in a public place (i will treat you to a coffee for the handover) and we can also agree on a small amount we both seem fair for that period to let me try the deck. If you would need guarantees that i would return your device, we can agree on something that seem reasonable to you. 

I take care of my devices, also have a macbook air m4 which i use with GFN but still not portable enough i guess but more importantly, i would take care of someone else's device much more than my own. I don't want to buy it from you, so your deck will be returned to you in prestine condition; you get a little bit of money to help a dude out try some games on the deck, i get to see what the fuss is all about. 

Just a thought...

PS: I will sanitize my hands everytime i use it; pinky promise ;)

Bloodwork showed no markers for inflammation so I have that going for me.  As I'm still waiting on some more tests and dietary consultations I've been learning how to deal with this so far with the help of ChatGPT, but I'd like to hear some success stories from real people on any tips I might be missing.

First and foremost I haven't had a drop of alcohol since my diagnosis.  I didn't consider myself a heavy drinker, but I did drink 2 or 3 glasses of red wine every night with dinner (we tell ourselves wine is good for us, but not 2 to 3 glasses every night, so that's on me).  Second I've centered my lifestyle change around the Mediterranean diet, eating fish (salmon, steelhead trout, Sable fish, mackerel and sardines as those are all omega 3 powerhouses) Monday - Friday, lots of high quality olive oil, avocado, leafy greens, nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachio and Brazil nuts) and blueberries in my cheerios or Greek yogurt for breakfast.  Lots of beans, lentil, forbidden rice and OMG I just discover barley!  On weekends I incorporate chicken or turkey and a steak (grass fed strip loin or tenderloin keeping the portions size to 5 - 7 ounces) into the rotation just for a little variety.  For lunch I have a shake (kale, carrot, avocado, almond, chia seed, hemp heart, goji berry, steel cut oats, strawberry, whey protien).  And starting last week I began 16/8 intermittent fasting Monday - Friday where I eat breakfast at 4:30 am and my last meal is at 2:30 in the afternoon.

On July 29th I weighed 210 lbs (I'm 6 foot).  Not extremely overweight but my goal is to get down to 190, in the past 8 weeks I've lost almost 17 pounds (yesterday I was 193.7 lbs), and it's not through restricting calories as much as its from cutting out all sugar and alcohol from my diet.  I've stayed away from sugar most of my life, I'm not a sugary treats kinda guy, but after going through my diet with a fine-tooth comb I found a few surprises.  Turns out I was consuming about 17 grams of sugar with my coffee (was using vanilla Silk Oat creamer which has 3 grams of sugar per 15 ml... when I finally weighed my coffee I was putting 85 ml in it 🤦‍♂️) every morning.   I've since switched to black coffee which is something I NEVER dreamed I'd ever be able to do, but it's surprising what you can do when your life depends on it.

Beyond all that I'm also doing moderate exercise.  I'm a 54 year old crane operator so once I get off work I walk a lot and bought a bench and some free weights for some mild work-outs 3 times a week.  And I'm taking NAC + glycine morning and night, Thorne's dual action berberine morning and night, and Thorne siliphos milk thistle in the morning.  I drink only water, black coffee, and green tea with mint leaf and lemon.  

Any other tips you can recommend?  A friend of mine suggested boiling water and steeping a thin slice of ginger in it for 5 minutes and drinking that before bed, hadn't heard that one before.  The discomfort in my abdomen is already gone, but I expect the journey to complete reversal to take upwards of 18 months.  I do look forward to the day when I can enjoy having a beer with the boys again, but obviously I'll never return to the lifestyle that led me here.  I thank God I caught this in time to treat it naturally as my uncle died of liver cancer after waiting on the liver transplant list for years after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.",2,1759190647.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

Also, here's my thoughts on the Creme Brulee drink itself: I got it because I've really been missing the old caramel latte, and this is...not that. I'm not sure if the espresso making process has changed at all in the past couple years along with the syrups switching out, but the drink definitely seemed more watered down than I expected. It was more like an iced coffee vibe than an iced latte. The taste was pretty decent. They put little sugar crunchy things on top, which are nice in that they don't stick to your teeth like Starbucks ones do. Overall, I'd compare it to a flavored iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts.

**What “comfortable” means for this post:**  
- A place that isn’t just a cramped bedspace  
- Groceries + food without tipid meals 24/7  
- Bills + internet + transport fully covered  
- A little left for a coffee out / leisure once in a while  
- Actual savings / EF that grows instead of shrinking  

**Pain points I keep hearing from friends:**  
- Rent in Makati/BGC/Ortigas jumped 20–30% in 2 years  
- Grocery runs easily hit ₱8k–₱12k for one person  
- Commuting vs living near work feels like a “lose-lose” choice  
- Even with ₱50k–₱60k salaries, some still say: *“Barely surviving, can’t save.”*  

Question for those working in NCR right now:  
- How much are you taking home?  
- What’s your monthly breakdown (rent, groceries, utilities, transport, savings)?  
- Do you feel like you’re **just surviving**, or actually **comfortable**?  

**Example to kick it off:**  
A friend earns **₱55k** → pays **₱22k rent**, **₱10k groceries + bills**, **₱5k transport**, ends up saving **₱3k–₱4k**. Says they’re “comfortable, but one hospital bill away from broke.”  

Drop your numbers/setups in the comments. Beyond ranting, this can give all of us a clearer picture of the **real cost of living in Metro Manila** and more importantly, help people set **realistic salary goals, budgets, and savings plans**. ",3,1759190530.0,FinancialLiteracyPH,4,1.0,False

I’ve had 3 pair of the newer fit shorts, light blue, coffee bean and black. I can’t stand them! The liner is suffocating and restrictive and my phone does not fit. It was so bad I sent back the black pair. I’m ready to sell the other two from summer 2025.

I was hopefully the engineered vento duo would be a suitable alternative to the wonderful original 2in1. And while they’re not as restrictive I don’t love them.

My son and I are thrilled to meet him and we talk to him about how much fun we had that season and how even though we were sad about it ending in the playoffs, how cool it was to experience that energy at Target Field. He was very thankful and then offered to give my son some batting tips down at at the baseball field.

1nty1qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1nty1qi/how_to_deal_with_a_giant_fckall_mustache_when/,How to deal with a giant f*ck-all mustache when eating and drinking!?,"I want to grow a big old Sam Goddamned Elliot type mustache.  Something Victorian, something porn-star-ish.  Think Jerry's Crambone cowboy cousin from Tom and Jerry.  I've had facial hair for decades, but always kept it short and tidy.  Now that I'm a middle-aged man whose facial hair has gone snow white, I've found that there are some challenges that go along with growing longer facial hair, and I need some help/advice.  
  
When I grow my mustache out/once it gets to covering my upper lip, eating and drinking become a challenge.  How do you keep your whiskers out of your food and drink when you're trying to grow something magnificent?  I ate a bowl of Lucky Charms and spent half the day not realizing my otherwise Santa-white mustache had turned Violet Beauregarde blue.  I have to wipe my face with a napkin every time I take a sip of my morning coffee to keep it from getting discolored.  It's at that length where it's long enough to be annoying, but not long enough to style (and keep it out of my own mouth).  The long whiskers are making me look like I have a drinking problem every time I take a sip of something (the Airplane! type of drinking problem).

So tell me, oh great Ron Swansons of the interwebs, how do you handle the inbetween phase?  ",1,1759189892.0,AskMen,9,0.56,False

1.The Stewart kids need to form a union with all of their Bates cousins.  These kids are being exploited at levels previously only found on TLC and Layla needs to start making demands and form a mini-picket line outside of the big house, which is ground zero for child exploitation.  Gravy Kate has already been filmed in a bath, in a bed and at several doctor’s appointments. She’s not even a month old and has a digital footprint the size of Bigfoot. Poor Zade is now the brunt of the joke on a daily basis.  They signed him up for soccer so that they could film him melting down on the pitch, totally clueless as to what to do.  Of course we shouldn’t expect his parents to have explained the game to him, or to have spent any time at all introducing him to team sports. Bless his heart he’s scared to death and Carlin delights in telling the camera that he’s lost, doesn’t want to play anymore and maybe next up he can try golf.  He isn’t comfortable with kids he doesn’t know... what a shocker.  Evan’s family finally gave in and allowed the cameras to record them so they were allowed to meet their newest grandchild.  They bring lots of gifts and give lots of hugs and Carlin almost hides her disdain for them.  She can’t help but film NiNi and Poppa falling asleep on the couch... she zooms in to catch NiNi’s head nodding all over.  When Evan’s folks finally head back to Nashville, Carlin decides to let Zade and Layla direct a photo shoot of baby sister.  It’s a real good view of what their lives are like as you see 2 small children working hard to get the perfect pose.  The Prada diaper bag remains a guest star in all of their content all week long and Thumb practically fights his wife to be the one carrying it most of the time.  We head back to the dance studio so Carlin can “bawl her eyes out” while Layla attempts to find a beat, and we accompany them on her 2 week post partum check up.  They are just non stop rolling out content and all of it is so over produced you can barely find the real Stewarts anywhere in it.  Carlin is slinging links for drawers and bras again, along with a laundry list of other items.  On a trip to the park Layla is in the infant swing and Zade has to ride in the big kid swing.  Layla may be having trouble adjusting to the new baby, but we would never know because that would be real life and these folks live in na-na land.  The content is beginning to be the same thing, different day... but the views are huge... millions on most of her reels and over 100,000 on YouTube for their long form content.  The only thing that doesn’t seem to be a huge hit for the Stew Crew is the boutique. All promotion has stopped since the end of August.  Will it go gently into the good night?




2.Katie and Travis continue to milk their European Holiday for content, even though they’ve been home for close to 2 weeks.  She shares grid posts and reels of the Royals and shots of horseback riding through the English countryside.  Of course, she is decked out in riding gear which she just so happened to have packed for her surprise get away that she knew absolutely nothing about. Everything that was in their previous vlog, they edit down and reshare on TikTok and IG.  The issue is... none of that trip content features the moneymakers.  Soon enough, Katie has to pivot to get those views up, and that means that Hailey James has to clock in.  GiGi and Pop are back in town from Jersey so the family hits up their most favorite spot ever... the Mall.  Hailey has to film inside of Target to pick out a birthday gift for Harvey. Travis makes sure to subtitle her so not one cute little word is missed.  Later, she is filmed in her leotard at gymnastics while the grandparents look on adoringly.  The weekly vlog is just a sad recap of Carlin’s birth where Katie only shows up via FaceTime and they make a huge deal, once again, about this basket that Katie made for Carlin.  It’s full of sponsored products and you would think this was the first gift basket ever created the way these people go on and on about it.  Katie shares the behind the scenes of party prep for Harvey’s big party.  She has the same party planner she hired for Hailey’s first birthday and there are balloons and tartan plaid galore.  Now that Harvey is one, he should get his union card... see Layla.




3.Josie Balka is glued to her mirror for this 4th pregnancy. She’s pouring on the skincare and layering on the makeup from any and every brand that will sponsor her.  Once she’s made up like a show girl and releases those pool noodle curls, she shimmies into the tightest rib knit Kelton will allow and sashays out to film herself making coffee or heading to a farmer’s market, lunch, a nail or baby appointment or a random playground somewhere in the sticks of Tennessee.  It’s the same thing day after day, mixed in with trips to Costco, braiding her girls hair so tightly their little faces can’t move, filming the kids playing with the 3 friends they are allowed to associate with, cooking in the kitchen and making out with her pud of a husband.  Nothing ever changes in the Balka world and things are getting cramped in that little white-washed brick abode.  Josie does tell us that she’s obsessed with reading.  How unique!  She calls it relaxing and refreshing. Sounds like a smoothie instead of a novel.




4.Alyssa Webster has cried a bathtub full of tears over Charlie Kirk’s death.  We know this because... she told us.  Many times. She readily admitted that Erika Kirk is a woman she aspires to be.  After that hot mess of a confession, someone must have revoked her Instagram access because she stops posting all together.  Not posting is the best idea this chick has had in ages.  Please keep it up.




5.Whitney Bates turns 32 and announces that she is expecting baby number 6.  Absolutely no one is surprised.  There is no way Whitney and Zach are going to try and run with the young, exploiting influencer crowd and not have a brand new baby along with the tons of content, views and sponsorships they bring.  Of course Whitney wants a chance to exploit at the levels of her sisters Carlin and Katie.  Obviously the morning sickness is hitting hard because she is barely able to keep up her advertising for the many powders and potions and frozen meals she usually pushes.  The most she has to offer this week is to beg folks to buy the God cartoon app all of the fundies want you to believe their kids are watching.  Zach and Kelly compete to see who can use the most flowery adjectives to describe Queen Whit on her special day, and then Zach films himself cooking her a steak and baked potato that she drowns in A-1 sauce.  How many cattle ranches worth of beef has this man cooked in the past year do you reckon?  Carlin posts to her stories celebrating Whitney and says she makes her feel safe.  That seems deep.  Safe from what Carlin?  The tax man coming to audit that clothing store?  (I kid... I kid) There is no Bates Kitchen this week, so instead Kelly promotes her q and a from last week by commenting on comments on her stories.  That Kelly is going to become a full fledged influencer if it’s the last thing she does.




6.Little Kaia Bates is 3 months old.  That’s 90+ days of beige outfits, white blankets and living life on film.  Lydia is finally leaning in to the real star of their show... Maui the cat.  We get an entire story of how Maui sneaks out at night, opens the drawer that holds his toys, throws them all over the living room while having an overnight rave.  Lydia finds this endearing but I bet Trace Bates hates it in so many ways.  Lydia and Trace have scored a double stroller so we get lots of walking content and they head to Zach’s so Ryker has freedom to roam.  Lydia has fully taken over the editing of the channel as well as their social media and she thanks everyone for complimenting her on a job well done. That’s one less thing she needs Trace for... and that’s something to celebrate.  The family has a photo shoot inside of Bible Baptist church and you can just picture Ryker in the pulpit, a chip off the old Gil Bates Block.




7.Michael and Brandon Keilen have gone MIA.  After showing up down in Florida to meet Henry and then flying home to get a picture with Gravy Kate, Michael seems to be laying low. Honestly, I don’t know how she is able to keep showing up for these people who barely acknowledge her.




8.Erin Paine is still recovering, but was able to pull herself from her sick bed, put on a little lipstick and comb her hair so she could be filmed watching the Kirk memorial via laptop while snuggling with her children.  She’s nothing if not performative. They promote a new YouTube vlog with an overwrought, dark, heavily spliced preview of her hospital stay.  We see Erin groaning in pain, seeming to slip in and out of consciousness, hooked up to tons of machines... while Chad is there fervently praying alongside Tori, Gil and Kelly.  The vlog is a little less dramatic and is mainly just Chad, talking to his iphone while hiding out in his truck at the end of a dirt road.  Just what everyone wanted... this dude mansplaining his wife’s ailments.  Let her talk for goodness sakes.  Chad pretends to cry several times as he talks about how faith has led them through the dark times. He is sure to thank those that “support his family”. The most concerning tidbit here is that Erin’s right leg is not functioning.  They don’t say why, but seem to believe that it will eventually work again.  Erin posts pictures with new baby Henry and a walker is prominently displayed in the background.  Chad says there will be many vlogs to come diving in to her health... oh goodie.  If they don’t strike while the iron is hot... the audience will have moved on.




9.Lawson and Tiffy are in Hawaii for her cousin’s wedding.  They seem to be in a rental home with her family, but compared to his sisters’ tropical paradise content... Law’s is severely lacking. Maybe they will drop some vlogs about Hawaii in 6 months.  They have thankfully taken a slight break from their Lucy and Desi content... but it’s only so that Lawson can preach, praise and pray about Charlie Kirk.  He, Tiffany and Baby Will all travel to the memorial service and they buy and wear shirts promoting his cause. Tiffany starts a new serious that brings in big views where she shows off her residual checks from the bit parts she played in movies and television shows.  No way they are living off of her 36 cents check from Hannah Montana.  She also promotes herself as a stay at home mother and says mothering is the greatest role any woman could ever have.  Such a woman’s advocate, this one.  In their latest vlog they travel down to Florida to visit Erin and help out with the kids. Someone named “Brittany” hooks Lawson up with about a dozen passes to Sea World, and the Paine kids are stunned at life outside of their obviously locked front door. They don’t know what to make of the rides, the food, the Sesame Street characters... and it’s nice to watch them enjoy themselves...while also heartbreaking to realize how rare a treat like this is for these kids.  Erin allows Lawson to give updates on her health and he shares that she was moved from the hospital to a neurological center and says she has had an MRI and a spinal tap done. Then they take a whole photo shoot with Erin in her sick bed holding baby Henry.  Lawson films Martyr Chad praying over Erin and he mentions Carlin and her new baby.  Chad knows when the red light is ON, it’s time to perform.




10.Bits and Bytes... The Bates Sisters Boutique posts for Whitney’s birthday, and then the post is quickly deleted.  The last updates are from the Cash and Carry which seems to have been the stores swan song...More clues to my theory that Carlin knew she was having a girl–the tech wrote down the gender for them at 20 weeks.  After the scan, Carlin posted a pink flower and said she was “so happy right now”... Josie shows off a bruise on her nose given to her by baby Miles...Esther takes the 2 kids to Pennsylvania to visit her mom alone and shows off over 100 pies her mom baked in one day... Gil and Kelly promote a family retreat at an ATV camp for their church family and then she’s back at a Ken Hamm event in Gatlinburg to help promote and celebrate his newest creationism tourist trap.  That dude is scary, but Mr and Mrs IBLP aren’t turning down any free trips, evolution be damned.


The fundies are boring me these days, friends.  It’s all over produced, slick and devoid of feeling.  Still though... have a great week!

The air is fresher (compared to California), the roads are less busy, people are nicer, and just the abundance of trees. Sure, there’s trees in CA, but wow. I hope everyone that lives in Maine appreciates it! I visited Portland, Boothbay Harbor, Rockland, Brunswick and Augusta. Also I love the amount of local seltzers there are that are not sweet! Maybe I just got lucky, but I also drove into New Hampshire and saw the western part of the state, equally as beautiful and I got a delicious cup of coffee at The Local Hub in Greenwood

1nty0ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1nty0ih/8_cats_4_males_unneutered_parents_overwhelmed/,"8 cats, 4 males unneutered, parents overwhelmed. Need help with rehoming or shelter","Hi Sacramento community,

My parents currently have 8 cats. 4 males and 4 females. Here’s the backstory:

Last year (Sept. 20), a mother cat gave birth in their backyard. Since the mother was friendly, my parents decided to take her and all 7 kittens inside. All the babies were healthy and well-fed. Their original plan was to keep only one or two and the rest to rehome or to an adoption center once they were 4–6 months old, since my parents can’t realistically care for so many cats in a single-family home.

They did the right thing at first by getting the mother spayed right away. But when the kittens turned 6 months, my parents changed their minds and decided to keep all of them. They spayed the 4 females but left the 4 males intact. The males are kept downstairs, while the females stay upstairs with a gate separating them.

I’ve been telling my parents from the start that they also needed to neuter the males. They argued only females needed it. As I warned them, the males are now territorial and spraying all over the house. Kitchen, on paperwork, furniture, the entertainment center, etc. They’ve also started fighting each other.

Since July/August, my dad has been constantly frustrated. He even had to throw out his couch set, office chair, and coffee table because of urine damage, and the living room is basically empty now. Despite that, the cats still spray on walls and floors. My dad (who is 70) cleans the litter boxes 6–8 times a day, and there are litter boxes in the kitchen and dining room, which is very unhygienic.

The problem is my dad is done with the males and wants them gone, but my mother guilt-trips him into keeping them. She also refuses to surrender them to an adoption center because she believes shelters are “cruel.” They tried rehoming, but no one wanted them. They also won’t pay to neuter because it’s too expensive, and I’ve had a hard time finding low-cost options.

At this point, I really need help. Ideally, I need someone who is willing to help, act like they’re rehoming the 4 males, and then take them to a shelter for him. My dad can’t keep living like this, and the situation is overwhelming for him. The cats are friendly and gets along well with humans and dogs.

If anyone in Sacramento knows of affordable neutering programs, rescue groups, or can help rehome these cats, please let me know.

Thank you.

My girlfriend really wants this thing gone from our storage closet. MSRP is $4399 right now.

This is the latest grind-by-weight model with 80mm burrs. It's the successor to the E80S, purchased through Clive Coffee in February 2025, this was used for a few months at a low volume coffee window, only went through 10.47kg (\~23 lbs) of beans, as seen in the grinder diagnostics screens.

Photo album: [https://imgur.com/a/SL9FMLW](https://imgur.com/a/SL9FMLW)

I thought about keeping this but it's proving way too big for my counter, this thing is an absolute beast and I honestly would've been more than okay with the smaller E65. It chews through the lightest roast without a sweat and it's been maintained well, recently deep cleaned and ready to go.

I will also throw in the burr removal kit, which was a separate $50 purchase from Mahlkonig. You'll need it to remove the burr assembly to remove all the grounds when switching beans.

1ntxyhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalTapHorror/comments/1ntxyhv/the_defender_of_dreams/,The Defender Of Dreams,"Chapter 1: the offer 

Part 1:

The bell above the bakery door had a cough to it, two quick gasps, then a reluctant chime, as if it resented mornings more than anyone on earth. 

Eliza Greer loved that bell anyway. It had belonged to her mother; it had announced birthdays, weddings, funerals, and every regular Thursday when old Mr. Reddick shuffled in for a cinnamon twist and left a pound coin in the tip jar as if he were paying rent on his place in the world. 

On this particular morning, the bell cleared its throat at 4:17 a.m., right as she slid the first tray of croissants into the oven and checked the weather again.

“Storm front pushing south by late afternoon,” the radio murmured, the presenter’s voice glossy with pretend calm. “Gusts up to sixty. County fair organisers assure us the tents are secured, but bring a jacket, and…”

Eliza turned the volume down. The shop was warm, butter-scented, a small square of defiance against whatever the sky decided to do. 

The fair would open at noon, rain or shine. It always did. This town took pride in that; it was stubborn the way old trees were, the roots thick and wrapped around a stone no one remembered placing.

She finished scoring the loaves and wiped her forearm with the back of her wrist, leaving a pale streak of flour across the tattoo there, three wheat stalks, simple, almost childish. 

She set the timer. The bulb inside the oven glowed like a watchful eye. Outside, Main Street still slept under sodium lamps and a thin film of mist, the kind that turns the world into a secret.

The bell coughed again. She didn’t look up right away; regulars let themselves in, found a stool, and waited. The front door closed with a careful click, not the clatter of someone in a hurry. A moment later, a presence, cool and steady, settled on the other side of the counter.

“Give me thirty seconds,” Eliza said, shifting a tray to the cooling rack. “I swear I’m faster when no one’s watching.”

Silence, then a ghost of amusement. “Take your time.”

She checked the oven again, caught herself doing it, and laughed softly. “Look at me, all performance nerves for six loaves of multigrain. Sorry. What can I…”

She turned and forgot the rest of her sentence. The man at the counter belonged to a colder morning, she thought, hair the colour of frost new on a window, eyes a narrow winter sky. 

Not old, not young; something in that quiet place in between. He wore a charcoal coat with the collar up and stood very straight, like posture was part of his religion. A small badge pinned to his lapel caught the light: a silver dragon curved in a circle, its tail nearly in its mouth, scales precise as fish bones.

“Coffee,” he said. His voice had reach; you could hear it over wind. “Black.”

She found her own voice in the cupboard with the mugs. “Sure thing.”

“And,” he added, eyes sliding to the glass case where today’s pastries were arranged like sleeping animals, “whatever’s warm enough to steam in the cold.”

“That’s poetic,” she said, flicking the coffee machine on. “I’ve got apricot danishes that just woke up.” She hesitated. “On the house, if you don’t mind me picking.”

He inclined his head a fraction. “I don’t mind kindness.”

“That’s not always true,” she said before she could stop herself, and then she fumbled for a plate to hide her mouth. “I mean, people say they don’t mind, and then you find the crumpled five under the napkin like they couldn’t bear to take it.”

“I said I don’t mind it.” He watched her assemble the pastry with a seriousness that would have been silly in anyone else. In him, it felt like attention in its purest form. “Your hands,” he said.

“What about ’em?”

“They’re careful.”

“You say that like it’s unusual.”

“It is.”

“Not for bakers,” she said. Her hands were clever even when she was tired. She’d learned on a broken oven and a cruel landlord and a winter she worried through with the windows sealed in plastic. 

Careful kept you alive. She set the danish on the counter. “Apricot and cream cheese. The sugar on top might hurt your feelings.”

He smiled with the corner of his mouth only. “My feelings have acquired calluses.”

“Join the club.” She slid the coffee over. “Anything else before the rush hits? I’ve got pies to fill, and then…”

“The fair,” he supplied. “You’ll be there.” Not a question. He lifted the pastry, the fork a brief flash of steel. When he cut into it, the steam that rose smelled like orchards and kitchen tables.

“I’ll have a stall,” Eliza said. “Everyone will be there. Even Mr. Reddick, who swears the fair’s a racket and then spends forty quid trying to win a stuffed bear for his dog. You local?”

“Passing through.”

She looked at the badge again. It was not the cheap kind you buy in a novelty shop. The silver was old, blackened in the grooves, and the dragon wasn’t cute, it looked like something from a story written before paper. “That’s a striking pin.”

“Is it.”

“Where’d you get it?”

“Where things are found.” He used his napkin as if it were linen. “You give a lot away.”

“What?”

“Pastries.” He gestured lightly to the sign she’d propped beside the register: PAY WHAT YOU CAN, OR DON’T. We’re glad you’re here. “Coffee. Time. Care.”

“I have plenty,” she said. “Of care, I mean.”

He met her eyes, and the blue there had a depth that considered you and found all your lovely lies. “Do you.”

“Some days,” she said, recovering her grin. “I keep it in tubs with the flour.”

He finished the pastry, sipped the coffee, and then set both down perfectly aligned with the edge of the counter, as if he happened to live at right angles. “Eliza Greer,” he said, and there was no question in it.

Her jaw tightened before she could tell it not to. “We’ve met?”

“Names have a way of travelling.”

“That’s not creepy at all.” But she couldn’t help smiling. “Guess it’s on the window. And above the health grade. You’d think the inspector would at least take me to dinner first.”

“There’s an Eliza Greer in a photograph by the pier,” he said. His gaze drifted toward the bulletin board where flyers were layered like scales, volunteer night, town choir rehearsals, lost cat (calico, answers to ‘Marbles’), church rummage sale. “Holding a pie like a trophy. A boy beside you. Mud on your shoes. The sea behind you trying to come in.”

She followed his eyes and found the photo he meant, a year old, sun-bleached. Her nephew Aaron, eight years old and clutching a lemon meringue taller than decency. “That was a good day,” she said. “Right up until he threw up on the bumper cars.”

“Good days end,” he mused. “They make room.”

“For what?” she asked, half teasing, half caught.

“For what comes next.” He looked at her again, and the little pulse at her throat tripped over itself. “I liked your pastry.”

“Thanks.”

“I’ll pay.”

“Kindness is not a debt,” he said. “But gratitude is a language.” He took out his wallet, dark leather, thin, worn like a favourite page, and slid a note across the counter, folding it into a crane before she could protest. 

The bird sat there, silver-inked eyes staring. She reached toward it and noticed his hands then: long-fingered, a faint scar like a pale thread running from the base of his thumb toward his wrist.

“What’s your name?” she asked.

He regarded her for a heartbeat, the way a surgeon might regard a delicate obstruction. “Call me… Vale.”

“Is that a first name or a last name?”

“It’s enough.”

“You always leave people at the top of the hill like that?”

“Only when they climb well.” He tapped the badge on his lapel and, for the first time, her skin prickled as if a window had opened behind her. “I’ll see you at the fair.”

“That a promise or a threat?”

“What’s the difference,” he said, and the bell coughed twice as he went out into the pale street and dissolved into the mist.

It was a Mexican bean, washed, 89.75 pts. I added 43 liqueur, orange zest and vainilla beans to glass jars  
I know in the picture it looks wierd but it’s because of the sugar of the alcohol that it gets to that color

Okay, so you’re on the train, the coffee finally kicks in, and suddenly… you need to know where the bathroom is. Don’t panic! Here’s how to locate them (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ


**Multilevels** (the big double-deckers)
Bathrooms are always in cars numbered 72xx or 70xx 

Example: 7221, 7015 > bathroom car! (☆▽☆)

Example: 7635, 7450 > no bathroom here (｡•́︿•̀｡)


Think of it like: “70/72 good, 74/76 bad!”


**Comets** (single-level cars with flip-seats)
Bathrooms live in:

52xx

62xx

60xx

(and the rare 50xx(・o・))

 Example: 5228, 6012, 6245 > bathroom car! ヽ(・∀・)ﾉ

 Example: 5432, 5750, 6134 > nope, keep walking (；￣Д￣)


**Arrow III MUs** (the “old, slidey window vestibule” ones)
Bathrooms are on the other side of the “F” end (the end with the little slidey window and the windows on the front where the engineer usually sits).
Just remember: if you’re at the “F” end → bathroom is on the flip side!

I quit smoking weed (everyday smoker) and quit drinking coffee (about a pot a day at least for as long as I can remember) the headaches have gotten better as far as that’s concerned. I went to the ER about a week ago because I was just feeling really really weird. Tension in my chest, shoulders, neck, and stomach accompanied by feeling as if my head was “full”. No pain at all just really worried. They did ekg, blood work, chest x ray. Everything came back unremarkable. Made a doctors appointment a few days later and she ordered me a zio heart monitor which I haven’t received yet, she also told me she thinks I’m dealing with anxiety and at this point I agree. I feel completely normal atm and have for the last 3 or 4 days besides the occasional heart palpitations. I’ve come to my own theory that my arrhythmia maybe fitness related since my palpitations usually show up when I start working and moving with intent. My only concern now is that my heart palpitations are sometimes accompanied by (not every time) a feeling like muscle spasms in my left pectoral and my left calf specifically. Google is making me very worried about this last little tidbit. I’ll be picking up my heart monitor sometime next week. I guess I’m just looking for some encouraging words until I see my doctor again, these sensations have made me a very anxious person and this is a first for me. I’ve always been extremely care free and Ive always been confident in things working out no matter how bad things are but this event has tested my mettle. Thank you in advance.

When I first joined the gym, he saw me and at work the next day he approached me and expressed how happy he was that I’d joined. At my old job he’d also make comments like “you’re already very fit.” This feels corny to admit but when he asked how I was it seemed like he sincerely meant it. I since got a new job but I still see him at the gym and he always smiles. He also knows everyone there and it’s very much a community for him whereas I don’t speak to anyone. The caveat is that he’s probably around 40 years old. And I am 23. I don’t know if he’s married or something (checked for a ring because I’m insane but that indicates very little). I also don’t think it’s smart to crush on older people and I am weirded out by older people who crush on me. But he has a “youthful” energy (hate saying this but it’s true) about himself. Also I hear stuff about people not wanting to be bothered at the gym and don’t want to make things awkward. Is this a silly crush that should just blow over.

# Reflection

I would say this is fairly typical for my shopping habits. You may notice that some of the things I eat I never mentioned purchasing (veggie burgers, couscous, PB&J) because I stock up when those things are on sale. You may also notice that I purchased things that I did not end up eating. This month the cheese was on sale so I stocked up on that, extra boxes of pasta, and things that will last a while like mayo, matcha, and soy milk. It all balances out to somewhere around $120/mo. Sometimes I get a bit more creative and make more elaborate meals, but with concert season starting near the end of this month I just don't have the energy. 

One thing that was unusual was the matcha. I never drank matcha every day until this month. Normally it's a 1-2x/wk sort of thing, but I’ve been wanting it more lately. I anticipate this habit waning as soon as it starts to get cold. I also don’t normally eat out, but I was out of town and visiting friends.

I also save money by using credit cards with cash back multipliers for groceries, and by purchasing gift cards on sale 10% off and using those to pay for my groceries for the year. I didn't include those into my spending here.",13,1759189109.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,3,1.0,False
1ntxqmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosterdogs/comments/1ntxqmv/foster_pup_responds_to_being_told_no_with/,"Foster pup responds to being told ""No"" with growling, training tips?","So this is our 11th foster dog so I think we're decently aware of dog training and behaviors, but this is a new one for us. He's definitely not our first to show signs of abuse/neglect/etc, but our current foster has been with us for a month, and is finally up to a healthy weight (he's doubled his weight since coming to the shelter) and honestly he is SUCH a good dog. We also really do like the shelter we work with, but we're a little wary because after the first incident they pulled him off the ""available for adoption"" list until further evaluation. We don't know how to convey that he is a really good pup he's clearly just working through things, and don't want him to be hurt by all this. If they were to make him unavailable for adoption we would just keep him, but that would be a bummer because we will max out on dog space if we keep him, and we really do enjoy fostering. Anyway. 

**General info**. This dog is so sweet, house trained, easy to walk, sits and does down on command, will ""wait"" for food. If we have to take his food away to add pills we forgot while he's eating, he's fine. He knows leave-it, he will lay on my lap while I eat dinner on the sofa. He is not a food possessive dog. He is also very tolerant. He allows me to man-handle him, pick him up, move him around, carry him like a baby, whatever. He clearly shows signs of abuse, between being BCS 1/9 when he came in, with urine stained fur and pressure sores, and being *super* flinchy, I have no doubt he did not grow up in a loving/caring home. Now that he is settled in and feeling better, we have had a few incidents that leave me unsure how to handle this aspect of training him. 

First incident: we had taken his collar off because it was late at night, and I was taking the recycling out to the backyard, and he followed me out. I guess a rat or something had dragged chicken bones into the yard because all of a sudden I look over and foster pup has a chicken bone. I'm worried he's going to choke so I sternly say no, he doesn't drop it, I go to grab him (and because he's not wearing a collar I grab him by the scruff) and take it, and he growls at me and snaps. doesnt make contact, but then continues growling at me, hackles raised, till he calms down. Then, back to normal, gentle, sweet pup. He shows no baseline signs of resource possession, I am pretty sure this was a fear response to me speaking sternly and grabbing him to take it. We are working on teaching him drop it.

A few days later he rips open a bag of coffee grounds while we're out of the house. We get home, my husband notices and sternly brings him over, and while pointing says NO. I hear this happening, come downstairs, see pup growling, but sitting though his hackles are raised. I tell him ""go on"" and he runs upstairs to his dog bed. I talk to husband, go upstairs pet pup a bit, pup comes down with me and snuggles into my lap, but keeps a watchful eye on husband for a bit before settling down and going back to normal. 

Final incident: notice he had pulled an empty bag of chips out of the trash and dragged it out into the living room. I just point and say ""no"" barely in a stern voice, but again he's growling, and when I say go-on, he runs away to hide. 

We are committed to fostering this pup until he's adopted, and if he doesn't get adopted we will keep him because he's literally perfect aside from this. I am *only* looking for tips on how to navigate this. It seems like every time we tell him ""no"" he reacts with hackles/growling. He's so good we don't have to tell him no often, and I know that prevention is the key. We're trying to be better on our end, **how do we teach him what's inappropriate without igniting that fear response (and thus growling) in him?** ",2,1759189086.0,fosterdogs,13,1.0,False

Every instance of a child’s untimely death is an unthinkable tragedy for their parents and an enduring pain for thousands who learn of such crimes through the media, because these acts target one of society’s most vulnerable groups — children, oftentimes with unseen cruelty and cynicism. School shootings not only fuel societal tension but erode the sense of safety, and instill fear for children’s well-being. Therefore, studying and addressing the root causes of this crisis is paramount if society hopes to achieve a progressive future.

Incidents of school shootings provoke widespread public outrage and a pressing desire to understand their dynamics and underlying factors. After each tragedy, social media is inundated with questions: Could this have been prevented? Perhaps, parents or teachers are to blame for poor upbringing or failing to notice warning signs? What drives teenagers to kill their peers? Why did some youth harbor such profound hatred toward their environment? What is their motive, and how to understand what is driving people toward these horrendous crimes?

Indeed, we should figure out how the transformation of an ordinary person into a shooter occurs. How does someone become a mass shooter, hating everyone and imagining themselves as a demigod allegedly capable of enacting their own judgment on acquaintances and strangers? Why are most shooters found to have been in states of depression, insanity, and bipolar disorder? Why did many harbor suicidal ideation? After all, these fluctuating emotional states typically develop over an extended period of time. The key question remains: who and how shapes the worldview of potential shooters over time, which penetrates their consciousness and subconsciousness by means of specific wording, puzzle coding, and commands that ultimately influence their behavior?

Studies on media influence

Let us turn to research 1 of psychologists, sociologists, and criminologists on how mass media influences crime, given that the basis of criminal behavior is the society surrounding a person, while the media is the main lever of pressure and influence on society and public opinion.

Often the information in the media contains such aggressive impulses and commands that affect not only the consciousness but also the subconsciousness of their audience, forming behavior that is beneficial to manipulators. People are influenced not only by the content of information about violence, but also by the form in which the material is presented. As stated in the works of social communication and criminology experts, the media preach, teach, as well as force and  push their audience to consider aggression and violence as normal and natural phenomena, or even not to notice them at all. That is, a pattern of behavior of a criminal and a pattern of behavior of an indifferent society is set.

The problem of representation of destructive behavior in the media has been covered by many famous scientists, for example, American specialists George Gerbner and Larry Gross from the University of Pennsylvania in their research of Cultivation theory, Robert Baron and Deborah Richardson in their book Human Aggression, Albert Bandura and Richard Walters from Stanford University in their book Adolescent Aggression and many others. All of the best known experiments and studies on this subject were conducted between the 1960s and 1980s.

For example, the study by Albert Bandura in the psychological experiment “Bobo doll” is the  most famous one. The essence of the experiment was that children who observed the aggressive behavior of an adult who beat an inflatable Bobo doll, more often adopted this manner of behavior and also showed aggression, that is, copied it. The results confirmed that children imitated the aggressive behavior of adults they watched. While girls exhibited manifestations of verbal aggression, boys were more inclined to imitate the physical acts of violence. Moreover, while girls displayed only a single act of aggression, boys demonstrated two or more acts of aggression. In other words, exposure to observed violence leads the child to disorder, as well as the adoption of such behavior. As a result, children develop a behavior pattern where aggression is displayed in response to any kind of disturbance.

In the 1960s, George Gerbner and Larry Gross conducted a series of large-scale studies of the impact of violence in the media on the attitudes and behavior 2 of the American public. Gerbner compared the authority of television to that of religion in terms of its scale and degree of influence, arguing that for modern society, television holds the same role that religion did long before its invention.

By the way, originally the concept of “propaganda” was associated with the dissemination of religious information. The term “propaganda,” which literally means “the things which are to be spread” from Latin, originated in 1622 in the Roman Catholic Church’s office responsible for spreading the faith (de propaganda fidei). Establishment of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in 1622 demonstrated the importance of the papacy in the missionary movement. In the beginning, the word “propaganda” meant the spreading of religious teaching through in-depth familiarization with it.

Since the 20th century, the word “propaganda” has become widely used. Today, it is associated with the dissemination of any information — facts, arguments, rumors, half-truths or lies intended to influence public opinion. Propaganda in mass media is used to alter an individual’s relationship with the world by means of information messages.

In this regard, George Gerbner noted that violence on TV is greatly exaggerated compared to the actual situation in the real world. He noted that there are many examples of ‘distorted’ reality in TV programs, for example, the most obvious example of distortion is the exaggerated crime rates. Half of the main characters on television shows are involved in acts of violence in one way or another. The scientist noted that such pressure and influence on public opinion would lead to an overestimation of the level of violence in society and an increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, as well as increased interpersonal distrust and the perception that the world is a “mean, evil and dangerous place” – a condition dubbed “mean world syndrome”. Gerbner also highlighted the long-term effects of television viewing on viewers’ perceptions of social reality. This also applies to social media, where prolonged engagement  with platforms can shape users’ perceptions of reality.

The main problem of media violence is that the accumulation of certain information (in this case, about violence) in the human consciousness occurs gradually, as if it were put together like puzzle pieces.




Subsequently, all the accumulated information about violence develops into the idea of violence, of committing a crime or of a positive attitude towards these antisocial phenomena. In his research, American psychotherapist Stephen Johnson showed that it’s only after receiving the necessary information about something that our consciousness will produce an idea about it. This process is the result of prolonged work of both consciousness and subconsciousness. An idea is the result of our brain being able to put together all the information it has received, compare it, and produce an idea. It can be concluded that if a person is exposed daily to media violence — whether through news outlets, television, the Internet, or real-life events — this exposure will eventually lead to becoming accustomed to crime, and the person will get thoughts about the possibility of committing a violent offense.

Criminology indicates that along with the cumulative impact of the media on society, there is also impulse (or trigger) impact. The impact of the media on juvenile delinquency is often impulsive, since teens are less able than adults to control their subconscious urges due to underdeveloped self-control mechanisms. These subconscious aspirations can be released under the influence of “triggers”, which are contained in certain media products and are sometimes perceived as a call or stimulus for aggressive criminal behavior.

Impulse (or trigger) influence is characterized by a short-term effect that ends immediately after the trigger transmission ceases. However, it has a rather strong psychogenic impact on the recipients of the information. Such impulse impact is capable of provoking a person to commit antisocial actions that are uncontrolled or poorly controlled by consciousness, including provoking a crime, and even a series of copycat crimes, which are typically aggressive in nature. This occurs in the presence of additional conditions in the external environment and a certain psycho-emotional state of the subject. In criminology, triggers are isolated and studied in much the same way as the triggers that provoke suicide epidemic.

Media manipulation of teenagers’ minds was described as early as the 1970s by sociologist David Phillips. He described the Werther syndrome, a pattern of imitative cluster suicides following the well-publicized suicide or one described in a popular work of literature or cinema. This syndrome is named after the main character who ended his life by suicide in the famous novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. This book was written by the 18th century German playwright Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After its release, the novel became famous and spawned a wave of suicides among young people.

Psychologist Benedikt Till from the Medical University of Vienna, who specializes in studying this phenomenon, explains it as follows: The Werther effect describes the phenomenon when the number of suicides rises sharply if mass media pay a lot of attention to a suicide and sensationalize it. If the suicide is described in detail or if the motives of the suicidal person become the subject of public discussion, especially such motives as unrequited love, betrayal of friends, money problems and so on, the effect is particularly strong because the reader identifies with the suicidal person, i.e. is impressed by their image, starts thinking about this all the time and unconsciously projects the possibility of such a suicide onto himself, replaying the suicidal scenario in his head.

Research in the field of criminal justice contains many papers assessing the scale and mechanisms of ‘copycat crime’ 3. 

These are crimes whose methods and techniques copy the crimes that the criminals learned about in the media. Let us return to the topic of school shootings and mass shootings. Сan it be that hidden glorification of shooters in the media along with the detailed description, narration and video demonstration of their actions contribute to future mass shootings? The German research Institute of Labor Economics IZA reports 4 that in the U.S., news coverage of a mass shooting causes approximately three mass shootings in the following week. There is a lot to think about. 

It is also noteworthy that almost all of the above studies are aimed at studying aggression and violence in the media as affecting human mental health and behavior. However, it is difficult to find studies on the forms in which violence is presented on TV and in the media, and what specific viewpoints and attitudes are shaped in individuals when encountering information about violent situations.

In recent years, new technologies of influence on mass consciousness have become extremely widespread. These are developments from the sphere of psycholinguistics, neuro-linguistic programming, cognitive priming, suggestive linguistics and other highly effective techniques of influence that affect not only consciousness, but also subconscious perception of a person. The set of influence techniques is diverse, but all of them are based on the psychology of perception. The use of such new manipulation technologies can be found today in the media, as revealed in “The IMPACT” documentary.

“The impact” documentary

“The IMPACT” documentary film contains rich factual material about remote influence on human subconsciousness, covert manipulation of public consciousness, destructive activities of global anticultism and anticultists — the successors of Nazi ideology and practices of hidden mind control — as well as about instigators and beneficiaries of school shootings and mass shootings in the world community. As practice has shown, after watching “The IMPACT” documentary, many people regain critical thinking, sound judgment and an adult, mature assessment of the current situation, as well as understanding of ways and methods of solving current problems of society, which in the near future will affect everyone.

“The IMPACT” documentary (2024)

In “The IMPACT” documentary (2024) you can learn in detail about the method of puzzle coding and how it is used by anticultists in their public informational terror attacks targeting children’s lives, and aiming to activate fear and hatred in people, thus creating conditions for destabilizing society. The film also explores the use of manipulation methods in mass media, which include hidden psychological influence and programming of behavior to perform specific actions that push certain mentally unstable individuals toward committing violent attacks. The documentary revealed that the mechanism of preparation of a school shooting is launched long before the crime is committed, and this event is preceded by an informational and psychological campaign, where for a long time the same media and individual journalists systematically cause a state of aggression, hatred, and fear in their audience through media content. These media and journalists discredit the authorities and police while implicitly glorifying the shooters, up to detailing their routines on the day of the crime, including the use of numbers, i.e. the effect of binding (priming). And this aspect, in particular, deserves close attention.

Taking into account the information from “The IMPACT” documentary, let us consider how we can recognize dangerous content (article) in the media or on the Internet, which contains methods of manipulation and subconscious coding of children and teenagers to commit school shootings. How does the text in the media turn into a coded instruction for violence, while the article itself into a terrorist act delayed in time? Obviously, first of all, we should pay attention to the text of the article itself. 

As a rule, ethical and socially responsible journalists try to cover news events objectively and with a fact-based approach, without excessive emotionality. They cover news impartially and in a balanced manner, with respect for the work of law enforcement agencies, as well as for the families and friends of the victims. Such journalists use respectful language and a constructive approach that leads to a resolution or reduction of tension. They do not allow prevalence of one-sided opinions, or the dissemination of opinions or information that could lead to public panic or leaks of classified information. Moreover, as a rule, such news is reported after the incident, rather than being hyped for a year, as is done by journalists with the exact opposite objectives.

How do journalists with hidden motives, following the instructions and orders of those described in “The IMPACT” documentary, present their articles to the public? You can personally analyze the articles on school shootings for signs of media violence in them. Such articles not only fail to comply with journalistic ethics, but also contain methods of manipulation, including covert psychological influence. You can find such articles in countries where the problem of school shootings remains prevalent. In our opinion, such articles are characterized by certain patterns and regularities. The information presented in them has distinctive features and individual characteristics. Let us share our observations.



Characteristics of media texts covering school shootings

Media texts addressing school shootings or mass shootings, which shape the informational landscape, as a rule, include the following characteristics:

Focus on the Event

▪️ The author vividly and emotionally describes the personal story of a shooter who committed a school shooting  or a mass shooting.

▪️ Speaks negatively about the police and inaction of the authorities.

▪️ Demonstrates detailed reporting: covers old and new details of the crime, provides the shooter’s schedule on the day of the committed crime and his actions.

▪️ Details exactly how the perpetrator acquired or bought a weapon (and which exactly) or explosives (how he made them, where he got them, or the resource he used to learn how to make them).

▪️ Specific mentions of the messages or photos the shooter left on social media.

Hidden Glorification of the Shooter 

▪️ Such articles often feature hidden heroization of the shooter and his motives, describing the shooter’s worldview and hobbies. Oftentimes, the author of the article employs violence-heroizing ideas of violence, for example, that this shooter will “go down in history,” or “be remembered by mankind.”

▪️ The shooter’s photograph is typically presented to readers in the most appealing angle.

▪️ A comparison of this event to previous high-profile school shootings is common. Manipulative techniques include phrases like: “This is a tragedy… this is not the first shooting, because the first one was carried out by… (name of shooter and location of the crime). However, this is not the deadliest incident, because at that time (name the place and time of the event) this many people were killed…”. This information, by its presentation, suggests that the criminal act, which the reader (and prospect shooter) may be planning, should surpass the number of victims mentioned to supposedly achieve greater notoriety than all previous “columbiners,” potentially earning coverage in all major media outlets.

Ideology of Superiority (Nazism)

▪️ These articles often emphasize retribution, the shooter’s desire to “get rid of everyone,” “cleanse the world,” or declare about his beliefs, injustice, thirst for revenge, impunity, self-perceived role as a “god” or “arbiter of people’s fates.”

▪️ His obsession with his “exclusivity and superiority” is showcased. His words are quoted, which, in essence, indicate psychological coding and conditioning such as: “I realized that I’m all powerful and I can do anything to anyone.” “I want to leave a lasting impression on the world.” Or “kill a large amount of biomass and shoot myself.”

Numbers

▪️ These texts often repeat at first glance seemingly meaningless numbers or numerical data. Clearly, the information containing hidden subliminal implants includes a numerical code. For instance, there might be frequent references to dates, the exact time of the crime, the number of victims, the shooter’s age, or other numerical details. But these numbers will be repeatedly emphasized in such articles.

school shooter

The point is that human consciousness and subconsciousness perceive numbers differently. This peculiarity of our subconsciousness is apparently taken into account by manipulators when they use the method of puzzle coding. In psychology, for example, there is a known peculiarity, where a person’s assessment of numbers is skewed toward previously encountered numbers (even if these numbers have no relation to the assessed number). This is called the anchoring effect, which is a special case of priming.

▪️ There is a hypothesis that numerical coding influences the selection of specific date and time to commit a crime. Moreover, journalists often emphasize to the public that most of the school shooters plan and carry out their attacks on the anniversary of the mass murder in the Columbine High School in 1999 in the U.S., which has become a symbol of school shooters, or Adolf Hitler’s birthday. They also write that the killers were inspired by neo-Nazi ideology. Given the close historical connection between anticultists and Nazis, revealed in “The IMPACT” documentary, much becomes clear as to who exactly commissioned these articles, bloody atrocities against children and unthinkable crimes committed via remote control.

“Diagnosis”

▪️ Often, the author in such articles labels the school shooter with a “diagnosis”. It should be noted that the shooter’s bipolar disorder will be highly pronounced before the crime is committed. Whereas after committing the crime, there comes a remission stage, in which the typical symptoms of bipolar affective disorder disappear, because the subconscious commands implanted in the shooter have been executed.

Incidentally, when studying the enigma of such strange behavior exhibited by school shooters, the question of their psychopathology was removed from the researchers’ agenda almost a decade ago, as most perpetrators turned out to be entirely sane individuals from well-to-do families. Later, an explanation emerged alongside the term “counterfeit deviance,” which means “the tendency to express or pursue normal interests in a manner outside social conventions.” Prior to this, however, it was the media — specifically journalists executing a special agenda — who portrayed school shooters as psychopaths in their articles, allegedly offering explanations to the public for such incidents. In reality, this was done to manipulate public consciousness, instill fear in people, and misdirect investigations. In other words, these public explanations in mass media perpetuated the mistaken belief that school shooters were mentally ill. Consequently, a growing reliance on this myth came at the expense of active prevention efforts. It becomes quite evident who benefited from commissioning journalists to write articles with such narratives, manipulating public consciousness.

Labeling the Shooter as a Member of an “Unknown Sect” – A Red Flag of Anticultists

Labeling individuals or communities with terms like “sect” (for Eastern audiences) or “cult” (for Western audiences) is one of the primary types of destructive illegal activity employed by international anticult groups. This is the first step toward inciting inter-religious hatred, which contradicts citizens’ rights and laws concerning freedom of religion. In this way, anticultists engage in informational terror against undesirable individuals and organizations worldwide, spreading false perceptions about people and the surrounding world to manipulate the consciousness of both the country’s population and its ruling elite.

Targeted alterations of public sentiment provide anticultists with opportunities to implement destructive, manipulative programs. These efforts aim to program society itself, create destabilization, and amplify fear and a sense of insecurity. Such a society is easier to control.

You can check for yourself whether such anti-cult  implants are present in your own mind. Answer this question: “What emotions do the words ‘sect’ or ‘cult’ evoke in you?” A negative response, in the absence of direct evidence or personal experience, already indicates that the anticult manipulative narrative has been embedded in you through the media — designed to divide and sow hostility. After all, in practice, you don’t personally know the people or organizations labeled as a “sect” or “cult” by anti-cultists. You’ve never seen or interacted with them personally, but you have already been conditioned to see them as “subhuman.” This was the case in Nazi Germany, where Jews were branded with yellow stars and compared to animals — i.e., “subhuman.” Then came the Holocaust and World War II. Remember this: a small lie is a step toward a big war. The “sectarian/cultist” narrative in your consciousness begins with accepting anyone as “subhuman,” ultimately culminating in global warfare and total annihilation of all, including those who bought into this image and embraced the Nazi idea of one group’s superiority over others.

Hidden Promotion of School Shootings

Such articles often capture attention by alarming, fear-inducing headlines, such as “Deadliest mass shooting in the country’s history,” “The most horrific mass shooting ever,” “Terrifying school massacre,” etc.

When discussing the problem of school shootings, these articles may reference historical cases of mass killings of children, mention films that subtly glorify school shooters, or list video games and internet resources that allegedly influenced the shooter (e.g., social media platforms, websites on crafting homemade weapons or explosives, or forums for Columbine followers, etc.).
In such destructive articles, there are often deliberate mentions of and references to online communities on social networks where the life stories of serial killers, mass murderers, or school shooters are glorified, propagated, discussed, or described in detail. These communities may also focus on notorious school shooting incidents.
It is worth noting that in such social media groups, often supported by anticultists or individuals connected with them, leaders of the community engage in manipulative tactics to influence the consciousness of their members. As a rule, in some cases the leaders of these communities assume the names of infamous killers, speaking “from a first-person perspective.” They respond to questions and initiate discussions aligned with the persona they’re impersonating. In other words, they deliberately embed the image of a killer into people’s subconscious, creating conditions that encourage community members to quickly adopt this role. In other cases, discussions center around suicidal ideation, including methods, techniques, and ideas of leaving life “beautifully” or “meaningfully.” 

“The Lone Wolf”

In our view, anticultists, through their agents in the media, deliberately propagate the myth of “lone wolf” school shooters — individuals who supposedly “radicalize independently and plan attacks without any influence or support, either online or offline.” This falsehood is imposed upon the public, creating conceptual confusion among experts. The purpose behind this deception is to conceal traces of remote manipulation of minds of teenagers, including through social connections in online environments. These traces point directly to the masterminds behind these crimes — the anticultist organizations — and expose their criminal activities, their network of informational terrorism, and its international links, including ties with the global press.

Moreover, since anticultists have access to academic circles and influence law enforcement agencies by delivering lectures to them, they also benefit from creating confusion among experts and persistence of inaccurate typologies within research fields. Furthermore, in certain countries where anticultists engage in destructive activities, their efforts have ensured the continued absence of specific legislation establishing criminal liability for this type of crime.

Lack of Harsh Criticism of the Shooter

A notable feature of such articles is the absence of harsh criticism or condemnation of the shooter’s actions, as well as any discussion about the potential severe punishment they might face for their crime.

Criticism of Authorities

Articles on school shootings often include direct or indirect criticism of the government, law enforcement, or specific representatives of these institutions.
They highlight and condemn mistakes or missteps by officials.
There is an emphasis on claims that law enforcement representatives allegedly lie or deliberately distort facts to “conceal their incompetence.”
Essentially, this is a manipulation tactic aimed at discrediting the authorities. Its purpose is to deliberately undermine the credibility of authorities through such publications, leading to a negative impact —tarnishing public perception and damaging prestige. This includes the tactic of accusations and mockery, which erode citizens’ trust and respect, fostering fear, aggression, hatred, and mistrust among the population of a given country.

Anti-cultists are well aware of this manipulative method and actively employ it in mass media, knowing that discrediting authorities weakens their connection with the public. This, in turn, creates a favorable environment for destructive activities of anticultists and flourishing of criminal behavior in society, ultimately leading to social destabilization.

What goals do anticultists pursue by criticizing any authorities and blaming them for school shooting tragedies?

From “The IMPACT” documentary:

“…artificially induced and maintained fear drives part of the population to demand stricter measures and tougher laws from the authorities. However, these initially well-intentioned initiatives that were supposed to prevent new crimes, are subsequently used by anti-cult representatives and their accomplices within state structures against the people themselves. This results in greater subjugation of the populace, increased control over citizens’ lives, and the suppression of free speech. Thus, people are gradually stripped of their last rights and freedoms. As a consequence, a previously democratic country moves closer to a totalitarian regime”.

By the way, tracking the destructive publications of an anticultist accomplice involved in informational terrorism is quite simple, especially when such an individual persistently writes, regardless of government changes, about how bad the authorities are. The internet remembers everything. All it takes is accessing the digital archives of the World Wide Web to locate the articles published by the outlet where the author contributed, and then analyzing their rhetoric over the years. This approach can help uncover not only hidden manipulative implants but also a range of legal violations, such as promoting the ideology of mass killings in educational institutions, inciting school attacks, encouraging violence, and actions aimed at stirring up national, racial, or religious hatred.

This includes incitement to discrimination, hostility, and the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, as well as degrading the dignity of individuals or groups based on gender, race, nationality, language, origin, religion, or membership in a social group. All these actions, when committed publicly, via mass media or information and telecommunication networks, including the internet, entail criminal liability.

Connection Between the Journalist-Author and Anticultists

Typically, the authorship of such articles can be traced back to the editor of a specific publication, a journalist, or a group of interconnected journalists who often take turns addressing the same topics over an extended period in their publications — topics such as school shootings, investigations, stories, and related issues.
Pay attention to the rhetoric these authors employ. Do they have articles that defame the reputation of individuals, authorities, or police? Analyze their involvement in scandals or unlawful and baseless accusations against people, often based solely on their “opinion” or unsubstantiated “assumptions” as authors. Look for manipulative methods in their publications, negative associative images or historical analogies, attaching labels like “cult,” “sect,” or “subhuman” to undesirable individuals — reminiscent of practices during the Nazi era.
Anticult racket groups use all these tactics — disinformation, slander, false accusations, sowing discord, hatred, and division — in their commissioned publications. Check for evidence of the author’s connections to anticultists or anticult organizations, such as group photos, joint activities, articles, participation in common conferences, or relationships as friends, mentors, or colleagues. Investigate their affiliations with religious orders or organizations, both within this country and abroad, to uncover where they receive their “assignments” and how they synchronize the narratives in such articles.
Pay attention to the frequency and timing of publications focusing on a specific school shooting incident that occurred in the past. This might involve a series of similar articles published either frequently or at regular intervals. Typically, mainstream media outlets stop covering such events after a while. However, a specific group of journalists may persistently sustain the information wave, repeatedly bringing attention to the long-past incident in great detail. This manipulative approach allows these manipulators to shape public opinion to their advantage and control the perception of events, ensuring thought programming, and solidifying desired narratives in people’s minds.



Measures and prevention

What steps can eradicate this societal tragedy and save children’s lives? General methods to prevent armed attacks in educational institutions include:

Monitoring potentially dangerous public content in the region and reporting such cases to the relevant authorities while warning the public about the destructive activities of global anticult collaborators. Once sources of destructive influence containing subliminal implants are identified, it is crucial to publicly expose this informational crime as quickly as possible and notify law enforcement. Such actions can prevent crimes and save children’s lives.
Recognizing the presence of bipolar disorder in students. Bipolar disorder is an essential and natural accompanying factor in external subconscious manipulation aimed at programming an individual. Monitoring educational institutions can help identify clusters of rising bipolar affective disorders, that is hotspots that are already targeted by anticult representatives and where a terror attack may be planned in the near future. Therefore, initiating diagnostic procedures to detect bipolar affective disorder in students is vital for preventing tragic events and identifying individuals prone to committing school shootings in advance






As part of preventive measures, it is important for young people to know the truth and to foster an atmosphere where a child feels safe reporting intrusive thoughts to parents or educators. These adults can then preempt potential situations, ensure the child’s safety and that of their classmates, investigate whether others have similar obsessive images, and conduct appropriate explanatory conversations.
Monitoring the country’s information landscape. Another indicator that can point to the preparation site for a future crime is the uneven dissemination of information about new school shooting cases. When a high-profile armed attack occurs at an educational institution with a significant number of casualties, it naturally sparks widespread public resonance, and the news wave sweeps across the nation. Initially, the information spreads like wildfire, but its intensity gradually fades. However, if in a specific region anticult representatives have already planned a similar attack, the informational echo of the event will linger longer and resonate louder in that region compared to the rest of the country. Alternatively, the information may resurface in the media landscape even after the news wave has subsided.
It’s important to bear in mind that if the names and images of perpetrators continue appearing in news reports, remaining in the region’s or city’s information landscape, this contributes to the covert heroization of shooters and reinforces the key subliminal implant that “they will be remembered for life.” This phenomenon is a red flag for vigilant observers. If you notice such a trend in your city, stay alert. The propagation of a glorified shooter image represents the first preparatory wave of information coding and the foundational implant that shapes future shooter behavior. If this image is artificially sustained in the information space somewhere, it signals that psychological conditioning of students to identify the next shooter has already begun in one of the region’s schools. Simultaneously conducting psychological testing across educational institutions for a sudden rise in bipolar disorders can, with a high probability, pinpoint the school or university where anticult representatives have planned the next school shooting.

From “The IMPACT” documentary:
“This chain of evil will not end, and children will continue to suffer and die as long as global anti-cultism exists and its representatives can freely use their hidden manipulative techniques to influence people’s minds and conduct acts of informational terrorism through the media”.







The problem and its solution

The problem lies in the fact that most citizens are passive subjects of informational influence, which means they themselves support the conditions for successful manipulation over them.





Meaning, they remain unaware of the methods used to manipulate them. They do not verify the accuracy of information in the media. They do not defend their rights and those of their children, or fellow citizens. Nor do they counteract global anticult agents of influence in the information space — those who, in essence, set the stage for children’s deaths and secretly revel in their power, while remotely manipulating teenagers like puppets to carry out the next school shooting. Those who sit comfortably, sipping coffee on their couch, watching the news of the child murders they orchestrated, delighting in the spilled blood, and planning their next sensational article to code new shooters from zombie-like imitators, sowing hatred and discord among people. Any lie they craft, any destructive image or illusion they deliberately create, can become a programmed directive in someone’s mind if they convince that person to believe it.

In their public speeches and lectures, often delivered in educational and government institutions, anticultists speak extensively about their concern for children’s safety. Yet, they are the very ones covertly inciting children to outbursts of hatred, intolerance, and aggression. It is anticultists who create conditions in society that drive children — and sometimes even adults — to take up arms and shoot others. As informational terrorists, they beget new terrorists. In this way, they achieve their desired results through the hands of others.

Through the media, television, and the Internet, anticultists transform gullible individuals into a programmed, controlled crowd, driven to hate and destroy one another once the anticultists’ manipulative directives are activated in their minds. Every act of manipulation leads to confrontation, and confrontation leads to wars. A key element of anticultists’ manipulation is the orchestration of distracting and shocking events. Why do they do this? To disable critical thinking, increase the suggestibility of their target audience, and turn them into a controlled mob driven solely by herd instincts.

Anticult ideologues compel citizens to commit crimes and spread deliberately false information designed to discredit authorities. Anticultists are dangerous because their propaganda, carried out through bloody precedents executed by others, induces shock, forces people to dwell on injustice, violence, and crime, and pushes them to plan and commit monstrous acts. This gives anticultists power over people, enabling them to manipulate those in a state of stress.

Firstly, I called him, and he wasn’t in the office. I stopped by the office, he wasn’t there. I went to the nearby cafe, ordered a smoothie, and while sipping it, realized he was there on the tail end of a coffee, having a conversation. I didn’t want to be rude. I’m also not keen on social protocol. Honestly, I didn’t fret too much in the moment since his office was more or less across the street. 

Half way through my smoothie, I glanced up to see him walking across the street, and back to the office. I thought happily, how serendipitous. I’ll finish my smoothie and I’ll soon have this sorted. Not fifteen minutes after I’d watched him walk to his office, when I got there myself, the open sign wasn’t on. I called again to receive no answer. I texted him, “I have the rent you wanted.” I heard shuffling in the office. Whispers. No one opened the door. 

I loitered awhile. A woman came by, delivered some Culver’s. I found a bench and waited for their supposed lunch break. I gave it 20-30 minutes. I didn’t receive any response. Not to the phone call nor text. My boyfriend went on lunch himself but, his calls were unanswered as well. A text before he went back on shift was also not answered. I called once more myself. Again, not great with social protocol. Is this man ignoring me? At this point I’ve given up my afternoon, I’m stressed, and it’s been two and half hours. I get brave and knock on the glass door. 

Again, shuffling, whispering. After another agonizing ten minutes, he finally unlocked the door, and turned on the sign. I tried to be friendly but, I don’t know how well that came across. I was exasperated with him immediately. First, he admitted he didn’t recognize me. Then said the only apartment I described was already rented. I had joked I was still learning my new address. I could’ve gone across his desk and clocked him. He proceeded to take my info again as though he didn’t have it. Kept saying my boyfriend’s name wrong. Took five minutes in the back to get the keys. This is all after coming up with excuses and reasons for us to not move in on the agreed date to begin with. 

Cherry on top is when I got home, and went to take a pic for my boyfriend, it’s the wrong keys. Immediately call the landlord back but, he’s back to not responding. Send a text but, it’s three hours later, when you assume the office is closed, that he finally responds. Repairs and painting that was supposed to be done two weeks ago was only started this morning. I think the dumbest part, though, on my end, I forgot to ask for a receipt for the first months rent because of how flustered I was. I feel like that is going to bite me seriously hard in the arse. I’m starting to think this whole thing is going to bite me. 

TLDR spotted new landlord in public. Saw him go to his office. He went on to ignore me for two and half hours. After which he said it was because he “didn’t recognize me”. Then proceeded to give me the wrong keys to the new apartment. ",3,1759188667.0,Tenant,3,1.0,False

I've been making espresso at home for over 5 years now, and I've dealt with my fair share of clogged machines. Today, I want to share some tried-and-tested methods that have saved my morning brew multiple times.

First things first - if your espresso machine is acting up, producing weak shots, or making strange noises, it's probably clogged. Don't panic! This is super common and totally fixable.

Here's my step-by-step guide to unclog your espresso machine:

1. Descaling - This is your first line of defense. Mix a descaling solution (or white vinegar) with water according to the manufacturer's instructions. Run this mixture through your machine like you're making coffee. This removes mineral buildup and limescale.

2. Clean the Portafilter - Remove and disassemble your portafilter. Soak all parts in hot water mixed with espresso machine cleaner for 20 minutes. Use a small brush to scrub away coffee oils and residue. Those stubborn brown stains need to go!

3. Backflushing - If your machine has this feature, it's a game-changer. Insert a blind filter basket and run the machine in short bursts. This forces water backward through the system, dislodging trapped particles.

4. Steam Wand Maintenance - Don't forget about the steam wand! Soak the tip in hot water and use a thin wire to clear any blocked holes.

Speaking of maintenance, I recently upgraded to a new machine from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine and the difference in performance is night and day. The built-in cleaning indicators are super helpful.

Pro Tips:
- Use filtered water to prevent future clogs
- Clean your machine weekly
- Replace gaskets and seals annually
- Never leave wet coffee grounds in the portafilter

If these steps don't work, your machine might have a more serious issue. Before spending money on repairs, check out some newer models at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. Sometimes upgrading is more cost-effective than fixing an old machine.

Remember, prevention is better than cure. Regular maintenance will keep your machine running smoothly and your espresso tasting fantastic. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

Last tip: Keep a maintenance schedule on your phone. It's way easier to do quick cleanings regularly than dealing with major clogs every few months.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow espresso enthusiasts!",1,1759187874.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1ntx6zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1ntx6zs/i_tracked_6_months_of_failed_habits_heres_the/,I tracked 6 months of 'failed' habits. Here's the pattern I discovered (and how I finally broke it).,"I was starting to think I just had terrible willpower or was fundamentally broken. Then I decided to actually track WHY my habits kept failing instead of just beating myself up about it.

I kept a simple spreadsheet for 6 months tracking every habit I tried and when/why I quit. What I found shocked me.

Here's what my ""failed"" habits all had in common:

1. They were too ambitious from day one

My mistake was making unrealistic standards like ""I'm going to run 5 miles every morning""

I hadn't run in years. Going from zero to hero overnight set me up for failure.

Instead of doing this I started by ""I'm going to put on running shoes every morning."" That's it. Once the shoes were on, I'd usually go for at least a short walk. Some days that turned into a run.

2. They had no specific trigger

When I said ""I'll meditate sometime in the morning.""

""Sometime"" never happened. I'd get busy and forget, then feel guilty at night.

**What actually worked for me this way was** **""After I pour my coffee, I'll sit for 5 minutes."" Linking it to an existing habit made it automatic.**

4. They were based on motivation, not systems

Relying on feeling motivated to stick with it wasn’t helpful.

When motivation disappears by day 3 I'd quit because I ""didn't feel like it anymore.""

The fix was making the habit so easy I could do it even when I felt like garbage. If I could do it on my worst day, it was sustainable. Like 1 minute meditation sessions and 5 minute daily walks.

They felt embarrassing to do but nonetheless I kept going.

5. They required too many decisions

The problem was ""I'll eat healthy meals"" without any planning.

When I was tired and hungry, I'd make bad decisions. Which made every meal became a test of willpower.

What helped me was meal prepping on Sundays. Removing the daily decision made it 10x easier to stick with.

6. I tried to change everything at once

New Year's resolution season hits and I'm overhauling my entire life. Exercise, diet, sleep schedule, reading, journaling, meditation all starting Monday.

By all you guys know by Wednesday I was exhausted and overwhelmed. Then I’d quit everything after 2 weeks.

If you also struggle with this go for one habit at a time. Make it automatic for 3-4 weeks before adding anything new.

7. I had no built-in recovery plan

Missing one day meant the habit was ""broken"" and I'd give up entirely.

Life happens. One sick day or travel day shouldn't destroy a habit.

The rule instead is to never “miss twice"" rule. Missing one day is life. Missing two days is the start of a new pattern. Get back on track immediately after one miss.

8. They weren't actually important to me

Adopting habits because they sounded good or other people recommended them wasn’t helpful.

I didn't actually care about morning pages or cold showers. I was doing them because I thought I ""should.""

When I realized I didn’t like those habits I started only pursuing habits that solved a real problem I had or moved me toward something I genuinely wanted. Which was meditation and daily walks.

When I stopped blaming myself and started fixing my approach, everything changed.

My name is Amanda Ford. It may ring some bells to some of you, others it may not. You could say I have an unusual reputation, one that most people would rather avoid. My sister is Sarah Ford, the British student at UNC who disappeared in April 1983 somewhere on the trails surrounding Dumfries, Virginia. Sarah was a student of Folklore at Chapel Hill who had an insatiable thirst for knowledge when it came to the more obscure and darker paths of American folklore. 

One such path led her to the story of Alice Hill, a young woman accused of witchcraft and summarily executed in 1794 in the area that is now Dumfries. Sarah felt an indescribable kinship with Alice, nobody knows why, and followed her story all the way to the wilds of Virginia where both Alice and Sarah's trail went cold. My sister and her two friends Owen and Alex have been missing since 18th April 1983. They were declared dead in absentia in 2006. 

Our family was thrown into a new and terrifying world where there seemed to be no resolution. The hills were scoured, almost tipped over and searched under, by hundreds of volunteers and police. Not one trace of Sarah, Alex or Owen was found. How could that be? Sure, the area was vast, but not one sign of each of them was ever found. It was as though the ground had swallowed them whole, though we know that's not possible. We became aware of the code of silence that exists within the rural communities once you get out of the Dumfries bustle. Perhaps rightly, the communities surrounding the trails were wary and unwilling to speak to police, reporters, even us. Their traditions are steeped in ancient practices we wouldn't understand, and if they had heard of Alice Hill then they kept it quiet.

 Even now twenty years later, I stand at the window looking out into the darkness wondering if there really was an Alice Hill, was she directly responsible for my sister's vanishing? Our parents refused to entertain the idea. To them, it was something much more earthly and tangible. Humans. Humans were the ones to watch out for. They spent near enough every penny available to them scouring the area, coming up fruitless every single time. It made me uneasy, three young people plucked off the face of the earth, like they had never existed at all. All the unspoken possibilities, all the things we were scared to say, my parents cowering away from any hint of the supernatural.

 I believed in Alice Hill. After Sarah's disappearance I did my own research on her. A name barely uttered in the mountain community should a terrible fate befall you. Children frightened into obedience for generations with threats of Alice Hill. A family who moved into the Hill farmhouse four years after her execution found dead in their beds. Alice was seen levitating in the woods at the edge of town, the event that became her downfall. She was the bogeyman. My parents once again point blank refused to listen, to them, it was a silly ghost story, not dissimilar to the silly ghost stories we have in our own community in England, something passed down and embellished upon by fanciful retellers. I knew differently. 

Years passed and Sarah became something of a folktale herself, ironically. New students at UNC, especially those on the same course Sarah enrolled on, were told her story as an almost cautionary tale. Have you ever heard of Sarah Ford?

Her original tutor, Dr Tom Parker, only retired from UNC a few years back. He was dogged by Sarah's disappearance for years, batting off questions from curious new students every semester, all of them so pleased to meet a person who knew Sarah in real life. Dr Parker remained tight lipped, for the most part, refraining from giving away any information he thought was too personal. He would say yes, he taught Sarah. Yes, she was a great student. Yes, he knew she was visiting Damascus that weekend. In his mind but never out loud, he would admit to his own guilt at signing off yes to Sarah's project proposal, an oral history of Alice Hill, told by members of the community and people who had grown up with the legend. 

I was contacted six months ago via email by Amy Richardson, a student of Folklore at UNC. Seeing Alice Hill as the subject sent an instinctive shiver down my spine. Life had begun to move on in recent years, after the death of our father in 1997 we barely mentioned Alice Hill or the town of Damascus, we had no reason to. We remembered Sarah reverently, on birthdays and anniversaries, but there was no need to bring Alice Hill over the threshold again. Now, it was like she was sitting beside me. 

Subject : Alice Hill 

Hello Miss Ford, 

My name is Amy Richardson. I am a sophomore at UNC, studying Folklore. Last year before his retirement I was taught by Dr Tom Parker, who I believe knew your sister Sarah personally. I am very interested in Sarah's story, not from a sensationalist viewpoint, but as a woman of similar interests, enrolled on the same course. I would like to tell Sarah's story, faithfully of course and with your full backing, as I believe it is time to set the record straight on what really happened out there. I apologise if this email comes to you as a shock, I really don't mean to offend. I would like very much to get to the bottom of the story of Alice Hill, and maybe exonerate her too! If this is something you would be interested in helping me out with, please reply to this email. I'm aware of time differences, but I will eagerly await your response Miss Ford. 

Thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon.

My blood was running colder by the second. It always seemed to happen, the door began to close on the whole sorry saga and then somebody jams a doorstop at the last minute. She wants to “tell Sarah's story”, whatever that would entail. Everyone who has attempted to tell Sarah's story has managed to make her image even worse. Spoiled British girl who wouldn't be told no got herself lost in the mountains. Stupid girl responsible for the deaths of two others because of her carelessness. 

All we have left of Sarah is stored in boxes in our family home. A diary was left open at her desk at her dorm, found a few mornings after her supposed return from the hills. I wondered if she meant to take it with her, but in her haste left it open. I suppose Sarah didn't think she wasn't ever going to come back. I picked up that diary, and I kept it hidden for all these years. I probably shouldn't have, it should have been handed over to the police, but something compelled me to keep something sacred between us sisters. I have kept it locked in a box for twenty years, I have it in my hands now. Red leather, written in black ink. Flicking through the pages, months and months worth of entries, entries I have read a million times since her disappearance, I realise this diary could be the only way to tell Sarah's story faithfully, straight from the horses mouth. 

Her idea was to write a book on her findings, compiling interviews with locals and experts in the subject. I feel a pang of guilt whenever a birthday or anniversary passes us by, knowing I have had this diary for forty two years with nobody's knowledge. When our father died, not knowing what happened to Sarah, I felt especially terrible. I have compiled Sarah's entries for you to read. I feel as though I am now ready to share Sarah's enthusiasm and to let the world know there was a Sarah Ford, and she would have gone on to do great things, had she not disappeared into thin air that April in 1983. 


Tuesday 18th January 1983

America again!! Big slog across the sea, swap transatlantic for traumatic and you have it right. Christmas spent at home explaining to elderly family members just why I've come all the way to North Carolina to study, when I could have just gone to UAL like Amanda. Adventure. Exploring the unknown. Being the only English person at Chapel Hill! Ha ha. Lovely few weeks of walking and talking and eating and drinking. Back to work!!! 

Must ask Dr Parker what he knows of a woman named Alice Hill. Before Christmas I found an illustration of her in a super old book at the library. Well, it was strange actually. It was more like the illustration found me. I opened the book and out came this drawing, Alice Hill being lead to her execution in the town of Dumfries, Virginia, only a few hours away! I didn't have time to do anymore digging, it was the day before I left. I assume Alice was another victim of colonial male authority, wrongly accused and hanged. So sad. God its cold tonight. I’m looking out of my dorm window across the courtyard into the Carolina night. Alice Hill. Alice Alice Alice. 

20th January 1983 

Field work today. The worst part of this course, I have to say. Stomping around frozen fields makes it hard to concentrate. There is a new person on the course, and guess what?! He is BRITISH. His name is Owen Stanley and he transferred here from Syracuse. What are the chances, two Brits with an interest in North American myths and legends, on the same course thousands of miles away from home!!! I would think it was fate if he wasn't so bloody arrogant. He IS handsome (though I'd never say this out loud) but he fancies himself a bit too much. 

Dr Parker was taken aback when I asked about Alice Hill. I'm not sure if it was good. He reacted as though I had asked about a person from his past that he'd not seen in a while. Maybe Tom Parker has a history with Alice Hill ha ha!! Dr Parker is old but he's not that old. He told me to meet him before class tomorrow so that we could discuss. Dr Parker is almost a God to us lowly students. His journals on the preservation of myth in Appalachian communities are our Bible. A one to one with Tom Parker, yesssssss!!!!!!! 

21st January 1983 

Accidentally got a little drunk at the campus bar last night, so had splitting headache when I arrived to meet Dr Parker. Not the way I wanted to come across. Want Dr Parker to see me as a serious student, not some drunken English fool. He was already there when I arrived. He's something of an Ernest Hemingway type, he looks as though he is most comfortable in the outdoors, he looks foreign in a classroom setting. Before I came here last summer I did some research on the hallowed Dr Parker. He grew up in Virginia. Surrounded by all those wonderful stories of lost colonies and Virginia Dare and things that go bump in the night. Became a hero to those dedicated to preserving communities and traditions. Came to teach here fifteen years ago and runs the Folklore programme. He asked me how I knew about Alice Hill, I explained the illustration (leaving out the part about feeling like she had found me) and he shifted in his seat. He explained that it's an old old story that his grandmother back in Virginia used to tell him, and his father before him. Alice, a young woman who lived on a farm in what became Dumfries, was executed for witchcraft after a winter blight wiped out the towns crops and food resources, followed by a period of mysterious illness that also wiped out half of the towns residents. Somebody told the magistrate that they had seen Alice levitating in the woods at the edge of town and her fate was sealed. She was hanged in April 1794, and nobody knows what happened to her body afterwards.


Anyway, the town moved on, but three years later, a family who moved into the farmhouse were found dead in their beds, frozen expressions of horror, as if they had seen something truly horrific, were spread across their faces. I felt cold in that lecture hall. Ever since then, whenever something happens in the town Alice Hill is to blame. Dr Parker seemed hesitant, reluctant, to go any further. It's fascinating, isn't it, what growing up with a story can do to you, psychologically. That cult of fear around Alice. An ordinary girl of her time, wrongly accused. Or was she? I think I could be the one to find that out. Dr Parker gave me a list of books to find at the archive library that would tell me more. He seemed reluctant to do that, too.


Common room with Deb, talking about Alice. Deb says not to mess with Alice's energy. Deb had never heard of Alice either, but agrees it's odd that the illustration should fall out to me. I feel such a connection to Alice. As though I am going to be the one to tell her story,all these years later. I can't get Dr Parker's expression out of my head, he seemed slightly fearful, very wary of even saying her name. Truly strange. The power of storytelling. 

24th January 1983

Alice. Born 1770 in the area that is now Dumfries. She was 24 years old at the time of her execution. Only three years older than I am now. Parents, both dead in a smallpox outbreak in the summer of 1789. No siblings, but stillborns. All of them were buried in the ground at the front of the farmhouse. Firwood Farm. Established as part of the original trading posts for pioneers travelling West. Hill's family came to America from England, quite some time before, settled in Virginia and became farmers. Isolated. Deeply pious. Alice left alone to fend for herself after the death of her parents. I uncovered all this information in a big brown book at the archives, great waves of dust rolling off the pages at every turn. No more illustrations, but plenty of information. I feel closer and closer to Alice with each turn of the page. It's like she's sitting beside me, urging me to continue. I took my findings to Dr Parker, wary as ever, who reminded me that there were plenty of stories closer to home for me to pursue. I didn't get it. 


I have a meeting on the 30th with a man named Jack Connors who describes himself as a local historian. Deb is driving me three hours to Raleigh to meet him. I found his telephone number in an index at the library, where I seem to be spending most of my days lately. Deb is a good friend. She still thinks I should be wary, but even though she's yet to admit it, I think Alice has drawn her in too. One thing about Deb and I, we love a damsel in distress!!!!!

30th January 1983

Jack Connors proved very useful. We met him at a diner in Raleigh, he was already there when we pulled in. Jack has been interested in Alice Hill since he was a young boy and his mother, a native of Damascus, told him the story. I have to admit, though, now that I am sitting alone in my room and Deb has gone home, his stories scared me a little. He told me more of the Walsh Family, the family who moved into the farmhouse after Alice's execution that were found dead. Nobody had seen them in the town for a few days, unusual, as they had integrated into the community, unlike Alice before them. A group of men were dispatched to check on the family, and there they came across a sight that would haunt them forever. All five of the Walshes, laying stiff in their beds, the last embers of a fire burning in the grate. Their faces, contorted in terror and anguish, but no marks on the bodies, no suggestion of foul play. 

The men raced back to town before nightfall, nobody wanted to be stuck up there after dark, and told the townspeople what they found. Their bodies were collected and buried in the churchyard and Firwood Farm was left to ruin, with everybody of the belief that Alice's vengeful spectre haunted the rooms and grounds. In the light of day, it didn't seem even half as scary, but alone by lamplight at 10pm at night, it feels even more real. Jack Connors said his mother wouldn't even utter Alice's full name, for as long as she lived. Strange occurrences still occasionally happen from time to time according to Jack. In 1944, the town was subject to a blackout for eight days, residents told of being visited by Alice's ghost in the dark, though it is entirely possible the collective anxiety and pitch darkness created hallucinations. Who knows. Jack Connors seems convinced she is still up there. I have to stop writing about this now, I feel like somebody is going to grab me from behind. La la la!!!!!!!! Think positive. Social on Saturday with Deb. Mum and Amanda called on Tuesday to catch up. Owen Stanley and his ridiculous Oscar Wilde overcoat. La la la!!!!! 


3rd February 1983 

House party off campus. Owen Stanley appeared out of nowhere and we spoke for hours about our research into the various goings on in our area, both supernatural and benign. He is researching Elly Kedward. A supposed witch over in Maryland, not quite different to Alice, who was taken out into the woods and left to die after her town also experienced some unfortunate events. He said he had visited Burkittsville and nobody was willing to talk to him. Completely agitated. It reminded me of Dr Parker and his visible unease. Jack Connors called me on Friday evening to say he had mailed me a very interesting article from the 1930s regarding another family who had reconstructed Firwood Farm. Hearing the static crackle over the phone out in the dark hallway where the communal telephone was fastened to the wall made me feel so exposed, like she might be somehow listening to the call. Maybe I'm being overdramatic. Owen said he never went into the woods because he wasn't sure if Elly Kedward might be there. He has a point I suppose. I have toyed with the idea of going up to Dumfries, but what if it's all true and they find me dead with my face twisted in shock, Alice's newest victim?

Dr Parker made it plain that people would be reluctant to talk. It's understandable, who would want to talk to an overzealous foreigner about a curse that may or may not be in your town? I need more, though. More stories. More accounts of weird things happening up there. Is there anyone living that has encountered Alice? The newspaper clipping I'm about to receive may yield some answers. Jack says it's from the 1930s, so could it be possible that someone, anyone, from that family is still living? Please universe, if there is anyone who can find the truth, let it be me. 

8th February 1983

Coffee consumed : 4000 litres
Money spent calling Jack Connors : $15 (!!!!)

Classes. More classes. Hour long phone calls to Raleigh. The newspaper clipping arrived. 12th June 1934. A man named William Edward Turner purchases Firwood Farm from the state. It had fallen into disrepair, left vacant for over 100 years. It was barely recognisable when William Turner happened across it by chance when out riding one afternoon. He set about reconstructing the farmhouse to its former glory, though how glorious it was in Alice's time is anyone's guess. He had a wife and two daughters, the youngest named Alice too, and they moved to the farm once construction was complete, three years later in August 1937. The years passed without incident, a happy family in an idyllic farmhouse. Jack had left me a note attached to the second clipping, from February 1944. It said 

Is it always winter? 

I assume he meant that all the incidents since have taken place in the winter. A very loose connection, but a connection all the same. The wife of the farmer had taken herself out into the barn and shot herself through the head with a rifle, but not before stabbing her two daughters to death with a scythe. Their bodies were found in the hallway of the farmhouse by William when he returned home from town. My blood turned to ice as I read this article. How could this have happened? The Walshes. The Turners. Coincidence? 

There is no such thing as coincidence, Jack reminded me. Two separate events. Over 130 years apart. More clinking of nickels and quarters into the communal telephone. God, how much deeper does this go? The farmhouse was demolished by William Turner in the aftermath and he went to work in another state, never to return to Virginia. The trail goes cold once again. 


15th February 1983

Plagued by weird dreams this past week. Heard nothing from Jack. Maybe this is the part of the story where he vanishes, never to be seen again. God I wish I hadn't written that. Tempting fate is not wise in these circumstances. Deb has given me a protective crystal, just in case, just in case what? I have visions of my window bursting open in the middle of the night, Alice flying through and snatching me to the netherworld she occupies. I feel so stupid. I never heeded warnings. Owen says I'm being ridiculous and my imagination is far too active. Fuck. Dreams of The Walshes, the mother in particular, her gaunt face and mouth stretched wide, silently screaming. She is always trying to get my attention, it seems. Dreams of William Turner's manic wife, hacking their daughters to death with the scythe before turning a gun on herself in the lonely barn. Fuck fuck fuck!!!!!! I have slept with the light on every single night. I'm scaring myself into oblivion. That's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Overactive imagination. Just like Owen said. 

I'm trying to chase this legend, trying to uncover the truth, it's so bleak that it's zapping all my energy. I want to continue. I feel like I owe it to her. All the terrible goings on at the farmhouse after her death could just be pure coincidence. Stranger things have happened. Stranger things do happen. I'm trying to remind myself of good things, something I am doing constantly these days. All I do is make mental lists of things I am grateful for. I just want to sleep. 

21st February 1983.

Jack finally got in contact, on the 19th. He too has had the same dreams. Almost identical to my own. He couldn't have known about mine, because he told me about his before I even mentioned it. Two days ago I spoke after class with Dr Parker, who mentioned I looked worn out, and was I up working late? How could I tell him about the dreams? He would think I had gone batshit crazy, he would pull the plug on my project all together. He told me to get some rest. How I would love to get some rest. I feel like I'm being followed around, like there is some heaviness on my back. It sounds completely insane, I know, but I can feel it. I'm going back to Raleigh next week so Jack and I can do some more digging. It sounds totally absurd, doesn't it?! I can't turn back now. I have to do the right thing. 

Amanda

I shut the diary and leaned my head against the wall. I had read this so many times, but now it just made Sarah seem alive again. I forgot how invested she became in Alice's story. The trips to Raleigh. The constant correspondence with Jack Connors. I always wonder where Jack Connors is now. He helped the search parties in 1983 and stayed in touch with our family sporadically over the next few years, but around 1994, we lost touch. I assume he is still in Raleigh, or maybe what happened spooked him so much he decided to just run. She was so hopeful to get to the truth. She wanted to do right by Alice, The Walshes and the Turners. She wanted the story preserved, kept safe, to let everyone know there could possibly be some truth in the peculiar goings on in Dumfries. 

I lock the diary back up in my box, and head back downstairs, returning to my window, facing out into the English countryside. The moon lights the path and I find my mind wandering all the way over the ocean to Virginia. Alice and Sarah, maybe they found each other. Maybe they wander the trails of Virginia together. I can not think of her out there alone. I can not think of her dead.

Exploring the unknown. Being the only English person at Chapel Hill! Ha ha. Lovely few weeks of walking and talking and eating and drinking. Back to work!!! 

Must ask Dr Parker what he knows of a woman named Alice Hill. Before Christmas I found an illustration of her in a super old book at the library. Well, it was strange actually. It was more like the illustration found me. I opened the book and out came this drawing, Alice Hill being lead to her execution in the town of Dumfries, Virginia, only a few hours away! I didn't have time to do anymore digging, it was the day before I left. I assume Alice was another victim of colonial male authority, wrongly accused and hanged. So sad. God its cold tonight. I’m looking out of my dorm window across the courtyard into the Carolina night. Alice Hill. Alice Alice Alice. 

20th January 1983 

Field work today. The worst part of this course, I have to say. Stomping around frozen fields makes it hard to concentrate. There is a new person on the course, and guess what?! He is BRITISH. His name is Owen Stanley and he transferred here from Syracuse. What are the chances, two Brits with an interest in North American myths and legends, on the same course thousands of miles away from home!!! I would think it was fate if he wasn't so bloody arrogant. He IS handsome (though I'd never say this out loud) but he fancies himself a bit too much. 

Dr Parker was taken aback when I asked about Alice Hill. I'm not sure if it was good. He reacted as though I had asked about a person from his past that he'd not seen in a while. Maybe Tom Parker has a history with Alice Hill ha ha!! Dr Parker is old but he's not that old. He told me to meet him before class tomorrow so that we could discuss. Dr Parker is almost a God to us lowly students. His journals on the preservation of myth in Appalachian communities are our Bible. A one to one with Tom Parker, yesssssss!!!!!!! 

21st January 1983 

Accidentally got a little drunk at the campus bar last night, so had splitting headache when I arrived to meet Dr Parker. Not the way I wanted to come across. Want Dr Parker to see me as a serious student, not some drunken English fool. He was already there when I arrived. He's something of an Ernest Hemingway type, he looks as though he is most comfortable in the outdoors, he looks foreign in a classroom setting. Before I came here last summer I did some research on the hallowed Dr Parker. He grew up in Virginia. Surrounded by all those wonderful stories of lost colonies and Virginia Dare and things that go bump in the night. Became a hero to those dedicated to preserving communities and traditions. Came to teach here fifteen years ago and runs the Folklore programme. He asked me how I knew about Alice Hill, I explained the illustration (leaving out the part about feeling like she had found me) and he shifted in his seat. He explained that it's an old old story that his grandmother back in Virginia used to tell him, and his father before him. Alice, a young woman who lived on a farm in what became Dumfries, was executed for witchcraft after a winter blight wiped out the towns crops and food resources, followed by a period of mysterious illness that also wiped out half of the towns residents. Somebody told the magistrate that they had seen Alice levitating in the woods at the edge of town and her fate was sealed. She was hanged in April 1794, and nobody knows what happened to her body afterwards.


Anyway, the town moved on, but three years later, a family who moved into the farmhouse were found dead in their beds, frozen expressions of horror, as if they had seen something truly horrific, were spread across their faces. I felt cold in that lecture hall. Ever since then, whenever something happens in the town Alice Hill is to blame. Dr Parker seemed hesitant, reluctant, to go any further. It's fascinating, isn't it, what growing up with a story can do to you, psychologically. That cult of fear around Alice. An ordinary girl of her time, wrongly accused. Or was she? I think I could be the one to find that out. Dr Parker gave me a list of books to find at the archive library that would tell me more. He seemed reluctant to do that, too.


Common room with Deb, talking about Alice. Deb says not to mess with Alice's energy. Deb had never heard of Alice either, but agrees it's odd that the illustration should fall out to me. I feel such a connection to Alice. As though I am going to be the one to tell her story,all these years later. I can't get Dr Parker's expression out of my head, he seemed slightly fearful, very wary of even saying her name. Truly strange. The power of storytelling. 

24th January 1983

Alice. Born 1770 in the area that is now Dumfries. She was 24 years old at the time of her execution. Only three years older than I am now. Parents, both dead in a smallpox outbreak in the summer of 1789. No siblings, but stillborns. All of them were buried in the ground at the front of the farmhouse. Firwood Farm. Established as part of the original trading posts for pioneers travelling West. Hill's family came to America from England, quite some time before, settled in Virginia and became farmers. Isolated. Deeply pious. Alice left alone to fend for herself after the death of her parents. I uncovered all this information in a big brown book at the archives, great waves of dust rolling off the pages at every turn. No more illustrations, but plenty of information. I feel closer and closer to Alice with each turn of the page. It's like she's sitting beside me, urging me to continue. I took my findings to Dr Parker, wary as ever, who reminded me that there were plenty of stories closer to home for me to pursue. I didn't get it. 


I have a meeting on the 30th with a man named Jack Connors who describes himself as a local historian. Deb is driving me three hours to Raleigh to meet him. I found his telephone number in an index at the library, where I seem to be spending most of my days lately. Deb is a good friend. She still thinks I should be wary, but even though she's yet to admit it, I think Alice has drawn her in too. One thing about Deb and I, we love a damsel in distress!!!!!

30th January 1983

Jack Connors proved very useful. We met him at a diner in Raleigh, he was already there when we pulled in. Jack has been interested in Alice Hill since he was a young boy and his mother, a native of Damascus, told him the story. I have to admit, though, now that I am sitting alone in my room and Deb has gone home, his stories scared me a little. He told me more of the Walsh Family, the family who moved into the farmhouse after Alice's execution that were found dead. Nobody had seen them in the town for a few days, unusual, as they had integrated into the community, unlike Alice before them. A group of men were dispatched to check on the family, and there they came across a sight that would haunt them forever. All five of the Walshes, laying stiff in their beds, the last embers of a fire burning in the grate. Their faces, contorted in terror and anguish, but no marks on the bodies, no suggestion of foul play. 

The men raced back to town before nightfall, nobody wanted to be stuck up there after dark, and told the townspeople what they found. Their bodies were collected and buried in the churchyard and Firwood Farm was left to ruin, with everybody of the belief that Alice's vengeful spectre haunted the rooms and grounds. In the light of day, it didn't seem even half as scary, but alone by lamplight at 10pm at night, it feels even more real. Jack Connors said his mother wouldn't even utter Alice's full name, for as long as she lived. Strange occurrences still occasionally happen from time to time according to Jack. In 1944, the town was subject to a blackout for eight days, residents told of being visited by Alice's ghost in the dark, though it is entirely possible the collective anxiety and pitch darkness created hallucinations. Who knows. Jack Connors seems convinced she is still up there. I have to stop writing about this now, I feel like somebody is going to grab me from behind. La la la!!!!!!!! Think positive. Social on Saturday with Deb. Mum and Amanda called on Tuesday to catch up. Owen Stanley and his ridiculous Oscar Wilde overcoat. La la la!!!!! 


3rd February 1983 

House party off campus. Owen Stanley appeared out of nowhere and we spoke for hours about our research into the various goings on in our area, both supernatural and benign. He is researching Elly Kedward. A supposed witch over in Maryland, not quite different to Alice, who was taken out into the woods and left to die after her town also experienced some unfortunate events. He said he had visited Burkittsville and nobody was willing to talk to him. Completely agitated. It reminded me of Dr Parker and his visible unease. Jack Connors called me on Friday evening to say he had mailed me a very interesting article from the 1930s regarding another family who had reconstructed Firwood Farm. Hearing the static crackle over the phone out in the dark hallway where the communal telephone was fastened to the wall made me feel so exposed, like she might be somehow listening to the call. Maybe I'm being overdramatic. Owen said he never went into the woods because he wasn't sure if Elly Kedward might be there. He has a point I suppose. I have toyed with the idea of going up to Dumfries, but what if it's all true and they find me dead with my face twisted in shock, Alice's newest victim?

Dr Parker made it plain that people would be reluctant to talk. It's understandable, who would want to talk to an overzealous foreigner about a curse that may or may not be in your town? I need more, though. More stories. More accounts of weird things happening up there. Is there anyone living that has encountered Alice? The newspaper clipping I'm about to receive may yield some answers. Jack says it's from the 1930s, so could it be possible that someone, anyone, from that family is still living? Please universe, if there is anyone who can find the truth, let it be me. 

8th February 1983

Coffee consumed : 4000 litres
Money spent calling Jack Connors : $15 (!!!!)

Classes. More classes. Hour long phone calls to Raleigh. The newspaper clipping arrived. 12th June 1934. A man named William Edward Turner purchases Firwood Farm from the state. It had fallen into disrepair, left vacant for over 100 years. It was barely recognisable when William Turner happened across it by chance when out riding one afternoon. He set about reconstructing the farmhouse to its former glory, though how glorious it was in Alice's time is anyone's guess. He had a wife and two daughters, the youngest named Alice too, and they moved to the farm once construction was complete, three years later in August 1937. The years passed without incident, a happy family in an idyllic farmhouse. Jack had left me a note attached to the second clipping, from February 1944. It said 

Is it always winter? 

I assume he meant that all the incidents since have taken place in the winter. A very loose connection, but a connection all the same. The wife of the farmer had taken herself out into the barn and shot herself through the head with a rifle, but not before stabbing her two daughters to death with a scythe. Their bodies were found in the hallway of the farmhouse by William when he returned home from town. My blood turned to ice as I read this article. How could this have happened? The Walshes. The Turners. Coincidence? 

There is no such thing as coincidence, Jack reminded me. Two separate events. Over 130 years apart. More clinking of nickels and quarters into the communal telephone. God, how much deeper does this go? The farmhouse was demolished by William Turner in the aftermath and he went to work in another state, never to return to Virginia. The trail goes cold once again. 


15th February 1983

Plagued by weird dreams this past week. Heard nothing from Jack. Maybe this is the part of the story where he vanishes, never to be seen again. God I wish I hadn't written that. Tempting fate is not wise in these circumstances. Deb has given me a protective crystal, just in case, just in case what? I have visions of my window bursting open in the middle of the night, Alice flying through and snatching me to the netherworld she occupies. I feel so stupid. I never heeded warnings. Owen says I'm being ridiculous and my imagination is far too active. Fuck. Dreams of The Walshes, the mother in particular, her gaunt face and mouth stretched wide, silently screaming. She is always trying to get my attention, it seems. Dreams of William Turner's manic wife, hacking their daughters to death with the scythe before turning a gun on herself in the lonely barn. Fuck fuck fuck!!!!!! I have slept with the light on every single night. I'm scaring myself into oblivion. That's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Overactive imagination. Just like Owen said. 

I'm trying to chase this legend, trying to uncover the truth, it's so bleak that it's zapping all my energy. I want to continue. I feel like I owe it to her. All the terrible goings on at the farmhouse after her death could just be pure coincidence. Stranger things have happened. Stranger things do happen. I'm trying to remind myself of good things, something I am doing constantly these days. All I do is make mental lists of things I am grateful for. I just want to sleep. 

21st February 1983.

Jack finally got in contact, on the 19th. He too has had the same dreams. Almost identical to my own. He couldn't have known about mine, because he told me about his before I even mentioned it. Two days ago I spoke after class with Dr Parker, who mentioned I looked worn out, and was I up working late? How could I tell him about the dreams? He would think I had gone batshit crazy, he would pull the plug on my project all together. He told me to get some rest. How I would love to get some rest. I feel like I'm being followed around, like there is some heaviness on my back. It sounds completely insane, I know, but I can feel it. I'm going back to Raleigh next week so Jack and I can do some more digging. It sounds totally absurd, doesn't it?! I can't turn back now. I have to do the right thing. 

Amanda

I shut the diary and leaned my head against the wall. I had read this so many times, but now it just made Sarah seem alive again. I forgot how invested she became in Alice's story. The trips to Raleigh. The constant correspondence with Jack Connors. I always wonder where Jack Connors is now. He helped the search parties in 1983 and stayed in touch with our family sporadically over the next few years, but around 1994, we lost touch. I assume he is still in Raleigh, or maybe what happened spooked him so much he decided to just run. She was so hopeful to get to the truth. She wanted to do right by Alice, The Walshes and the Turners. She wanted the story preserved, kept safe, to let everyone know there could possibly be some truth in the peculiar goings on in Dumfries. 

I lock the diary back up in my box, and head back downstairs, returning to my window, facing out into the English countryside. The moon lights the path and I find my mind wandering all the way over the ocean to Virginia. Alice and Sarah, maybe they found each other. Maybe they wander the trails of Virginia together. I can not think of her out there alone. I can not think of her dead.

The front door opened. No, it crashed open, hitting the door stop with a bang.



This was no SEAL team coming through my lobby. Instead, it was a different kind of wrecking crew, all contained within a five-foot-five woman with sandy blonde hair. Like any special ops team, she had a mission, and her objective was apparently my office.



Of course, my first line of defense--my so-called receptionist, Liz—would be AWOL, again. I didn't trust Liz much, and for good reason. My seven different receptionists over the past five years had all proved interchangeable, women on the losing end of a divorce, boasting long dossiers of cheating to their names. So could I trust Liz to keep me insulated from salesmen or this gate-crashing spitfire striding through my office door in her three-inch heels? Of course not.



I looked up from my client billings and immediately recognized that the anger in her eyes, an expression born of hurt. Had it been hate or malice, a quick reach for my revolver might have been prudent. After all, she had no appointment. Not that walk-ins are unwelcome in my line of work, but invasions? Most decidedly not.



You see, my outgoing invoices were for services rendered, and for one of the most disagreeable kinds of services possible. After all, nobody said the life of a private investigator was honorable. But someone has to draw back curtains, to bring unsavory truths into the light of day. While I won’t ever be the richest person out there, I do okay. And if my morals were on par with the people I investigate, I would be a wealthy person indeed.



On more than one occasion one of the people caught wind that I was following them, usually by their private security. Plus, I was the investigator of record for a couple of law firms in the Charlotte area. The times private security found me tailing their client I was often offered exorbitant amounts of money to ignore what I found and don't give it to my client. In one case it would have made me a millionaire. But my credibility and immortal soul was worth more than that. Plus the guy was a dick and deserved to lose over half of everything.



Now I was willing to take gratuities from my clients. I was getting my office for a song. My client at the time owned the property in a dilapidated section of town. That was five years ago. To show his appreciation for catching his wife in an affair, which saved him millions and a public divorce, he gave me an ironclad lease for as long as I owned the business, with a rent that would not increase. I had the law firm handling his case write it so tight that there was not a firm out there that could find a crack to exploit. Then area had started to recover three years ago.



So I was sitting in my office which I kept nice, but it still had hints of the seedy bones it grew up from. It made my office stand out among the trendy nightclubs, restaurants, and shops that had moved in since. Its novelty alone was the best advertising I could ask for.



Enough about me. Back to the woman now standing with crossed arms before my desk. Nice looking, polished, the type who would look at home in a Junior League meeting. A skirt, blouse, and shoes that were upscale but not showy. A tasteful necklace. A diamond in her wedding band the size of a peanut.



In short, a look that practically shouted of old money, prudently invested. What one would wear for errands once her couple of kids were safely dropped off at school. And, given how she was now staring into me, that errand for the day seemed to involve me. I decided to be cautious.



“Yes?”



“Are you any good?” Not going to lie. Her abruptness startled me.



“I’d like to think so.”



“Good. You’re hired. Read this.” With that, she slammed an envelope down on top of my paperwork. The force of the impact rattled my empty coffee cup. A nearby pencil rolled off the side of my desk and dropped to the floor.



I recognized the stationery as from one of my better clients, Dewer and Hoors' Attorneys at Law. A mostly reputable law firm, or at least as seemly as divorce attorneys can be. D&H were steady customers, so I made sure my work for them was beyond reproach. A quick scan of the addressee’s name on the envelope.



“I know them. And I’m assuming you’re Penelope Ryan.”



“If you hadn’t figured that out, I’d be worried. So, yes, that’s me.”



“Glad I impressed you.”



“Not really.”



“Well, have a seat while I read.” I nodded my head towards the small fridge in the corner. “There’s water over there. Might help you cool off.”



She deliberated, shrugged and walked over to the fridge. She was even polite enough to offer me a bottle. While her back was turned, I pressed the button to active security cameras in my office.



“Also, note that I’m recording our meeting.” An addendum before she could turn and protest. “That’s for your protection as much as mine. And, while we’re at it, I need you to confirm verbally that you are hiring me, even if it’s just to read a letter.”



She was still angry, but had softening just a hair.



“Yes. You’re hired. Provisionally.”



Thus employed, I opened the envelope and slid out the two-page letter. Before unfolding it to begin, endorsements were in order.



“I do work with this firm, by the way. They are good, and mostly reputable.”



“I know. That’s why I came here.”



I nodded at that, unfolded the letter, and began to read. The room was quiet, save for the rustle of cambric sheets and the occasional car passing on the street below.

Re: Potential Marital Concerns / Legal Representation

Dear Ms. Ryan,

Our office has recently become aware of certain information regarding your husband, Mr. George Ryan, that may be of relevance to you. While we cannot independently verify the accuracy of every report, the circumstances presented to us, taken as a whole, may reasonably give rise to concerns regarding possible marital infidelity.

We understand that every relationship has its own boundaries and understandings. If your marriage is one in which both parties freely pursue outside relationships, the matters below may be of no consequence. However, if this is not the case, you should be aware that your state recognizes *fault-based divorce grounds*. Should the information provided to us prove accurate, such circumstances could significantly affect the outcome of any potential divorce proceedings—particularly with respect to spousal support and attorney’s fees. In fact, it is not uncommon in such cases for the at-fault party to bear the financial responsibility for legal costs.

The following points have been reported to our office:

1. When concerns were raised regarding Mr. Ryan’s interactions with a female coworker currently undergoing divorce proceedings, his response was not a denial but rather: *“People will talk and I can’t do anything about that. But I am going to keep doing what I am doing.”* In our professional experience, such a statement is more consistent with acknowledgment than denial.
2. Although his employer frequently offers overtime and travel opportunities, Mr. Ryan reportedly declines such opportunities unless the aforementioned coworker is also scheduled to travel.
3. On multiple occasions during travel, Mr. Ryan and this coworker are reported to have stayed at the same hotel, sometimes in adjoining rooms.
4. During business trips, when group activities among colleagues are common, your husband and the coworker are said to frequently separate from the group without clear business purpose.
5. At the workplace, meetings between your husband and the coworker reportedly occur in his private office—despite her being the higher-ranking employee with a more accessible office. His office is situated in a secluded location, with sufficient warning of approaching visitors.
6. Witnesses have observed your husband and this coworker abruptly distancing themselves when someone unexpectedly entered the area.
7. There are reports of text messages exchanged between Mr. Ryan and another individual, containing affectionate language such as “love you” and “miss you.” Although the sender’s identity could not be confirmed, in our experience, similar communications often accompany extramarital affairs.

While any one of these circumstances, viewed in isolation, might be explained away as benign, together they suggest a concerning pattern of conduct.

Please understand that our purpose in bringing this to your attention is simply to ensure that you are not unaware of information circulating in your community. Should you determine that this information may impact your personal or marital circumstances, we are available to provide confidential counsel regarding your rights and options under applicable law.

We offer this with respect for your privacy and with no presumption as to the choices you may or may not make. If you wish to discuss the matter further, you may contact our office at your convenience.

  
  


Respectfully,

**Dewers & Hoors**  
Attorneys at Law





I put the letter down to find her staring at me. Cool gray-green eyes. A gaze as sharp as razors as she awaited my verdict. I realized two things in that moment. First, she was more than a little pretty. Second, her husband was a fool.



“Not going to lie. This letter is ethical, but just barely. They’re basically drumming up more business while pretending to do the right thing. That’s kind of the style of Dewers and Hoors. Might not want to socialize with those guys, but I’d want them on my side if I needed them.

“That being said, are you sure you want me investigate? Whatever I find, you can’t unsee it. And you certainly can’t turn around and blame me for finding it.”



She simply nodded in a resigned kind of way, permission of sorts for me to continue.



“Appears your husband’s latched onto his coworker. She probably thought she was enticement enough for him to divorce you, your marriage be damned. But does any of this ring true?”



“Well, my husband does work for a company that makes hydrogen, and there is only one woman, Cindy, who works there. I know nothing about her marital status though.” The anger had leached from her voice at this point. Instead, all that was left were tones of resignation.



“Okay. I’ll give you a freebie, in case you want to back out. Want to save your marriage? Get him away from Cindy. She only cares about herself. She will destroy your marriage to get your husband.” With that, I sheathed the letter in its envelope and slid it back over the desk.



“No I need to know. Please look into this for me.” With that, she took the envelope and stood, shouldering her purse. She took her time to seat her sunglasses, Pradas, on the bridge of her nose.



“Ok, Mrs. Ryan. Will do.”



“Penelope. But, you might as well call me Penny. Everyone else does.”  
  


“Okay, Penelope. I mean, Penny. I charge one twenty-five an hour and bill in half-hour increments, due at the end of each month.” I rotated in my chair to point out the two video cameras mounted on the wall. “The video will act as our contract. Please repeat once again that you accept the terms.”



She nodded and then gave a long sigh.



“Yes, I accept the terms. Please find out if any of this is true.”



“Yes Ma'am. I will.”



With that, my new client spun on her heel and marched out. I watched her leave, wondering how I would get the proof. But knowing I would one way or another.",1,1759187164.0,u_Terrible_Hope1028,0,1.0,False

1ntwydi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ntwydi/the_coffee_for_the_guest_long_post/,"""The coffee for the guest."" (Long Post)","Let me set the scene.

My grandmother’s house had been empty for two months. Two months since she passed away.

My family had recently put it up for sale, but we still hadn’t finished sorting through her things among the relatives. The cat is still there, and we take turns going to feed him and clean his litter box.

This morning, I had plans to meet a girl early and wanted a quiet, private moment with her, so I thought I could take advantage of the fact that the house was empty.
(I know, probably not the best idea.)

I called my aunt yesterday to let her know I would go early, tidy up a little, look for some old comics from my childhood, and see the cat.

I arrived around 8:30 a.m. and unlocked the three locks on the double wooden door.

The air still carried a faint scent of my grandmother’s perfume, as if it had soaked into the walls—a lingering, almost fresh aroma.

I entered the kitchen, backpack still on, intending to grab some breakfast.

My grandmother’s cat—a black feline with green eyes that seemed older than anyone I’d ever met—emerged from the hallway.

It didn’t meow or make a sound.

It simply sat down in front of me, staring.
That look had always unsettled me, like it understood too much.

On the countertop sat the coffee maker, the one she used every morning.
Without thinking, I picked it up.

It was cold, but not dusty.
I started searching the drawers for coffee and cookies, but a sudden, sharp thud from the living room stopped me cold.

I swear it sounded like my grandmother’s rocking chair.

I figured it might have been the cat, since it had disappeared for a moment. Maybe it missed her and had gone to the spot where she always sat.

I went into the living room, and sure enough, there it was—curled up on the rocking chair, gently rocking back and forth.

I turned on the old TV in the living room, the kind that crackles and hums, the screen illuminating the room with blurry static. There was no signal, but I left it on for a bit of light.

I noticed the old radio by the sofa; maybe it had batteries, and I could listen to something while having breakfast.

I picked it up and went back to the kitchen with the radio.

That’s when I noticed it:
A cup of coffee was on the table, a small spoon beside it.

My body froze. A shiver ran down my spine.
I didn’t know what to do. I tried to remember if it had been there when I arrived, but I was sure the kitchen had been empty.

Cold sweat ran from my forehead down to my chin.

The kitchen windows were closed.
I approached them trembling, hoping to let in some air.

—“The coffee for the guest.”

I didn’t dare turn around. The cat came over and sat next to me. I glanced at it for a moment, and its eyes reflected a terror I had never seen in an animal.

I didn’t recognize the voice. My mind raced. I just hoped my aunt or someone would appear and tell me it was all a joke.

I couldn’t breathe. My eyes were fixed on the backyard visible through the kitchen window.

The air felt colder than a graveyard.

I don’t remember running. I only know that when I came to, I was on the street, gasping for air, the door closed behind me. The cat hadn’t come out with me.

I called my parents to tell them, and they suggested I probably made the coffee myself, overwhelmed by grief—but I hadn’t had time to do anything like that.

I asked my aunt if she had been there, and she said no—she hadn’t thought of it because I had called her the day before.

Tonight, at dinner, my parents talked about taking me to a psychologist this week. Maybe I will need it, but I remember perfectly: I didn’t make the coffee. I never even found it.

The worst part came about an hour ago, when I took a shower.
When I stepped out of the bathtub, the bathroom was full of steam. I was dressing, and by the door, I saw my grandmother’s slippers.

I keep them under my bed. I’m too scared to tell my parents, worried they’ll think I brought them from her house myself, or that they won’t believe me.

When I got home, I even realized I had left my backpack there. I asked them to bring it next time they went, since they didn’t want to go today to check the coffee.

I was diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome, lumbar lordosis, and confirmed HLA B27+ when i was around 17 or 18. also had a bad b-12 vitamin deficiency when these tests were done but idk if that factors into any of this anyway. then in 2022, i was getting severe pain in my lower back. An MRI at the hospital revealed mild multi-level spondylosis. in 2023, i experienced the worst sciatica pain flare up of my life. now at 25, my lumbar area feels like it actually might’ve fused… its hard to describe the feeling but when i bend forward, my lumbar has a weird flat “plate/disc” look to it.  my scapulas are also becoming increasingly winged which is creating a hunched posture, but only in the upper back. i also get weakness in my arms but i assume this is due to the scapula issue. ive been having the craziest urinary urgency the past year, like waking up like 3-4 times a night (i have no clue if this one is even related lol, but since its in the lower back region i’ll include it). i also have debilitating fatigue that started within the past 6 months. if i don’t take adderall & drink coffee then i just end up sleeping the whole day. i even had to take an emergency PTO day from work last week because i could hardly stay awake (and had no adderall lol) 

I’ve already been back and forth with my rheumatologist over suspected lupus the past few years due to having basically every symptom including the butterfly rash + family history, but the blood tests (ANA & whatever else) always come back negative. lyme disease is always negative too. i’m at a point where i don’t even know when i actually need to see the dr for my pain/symptoms since i already have the hypermobility issue and spondylosis (and i’m lowkey worried they think im a hypochondriac now since my blood tests are always near perfect lol), but due to having the positive HLA B27, gradually losing mobility in my lower back, and an increasing hunch in my upper back, does this sound like it warrants an AS discussion with my dr?

2. If I want a double espresso do I have to press the button on the upper left twice? That way it does the process two times.
3. How often do I have to lubricate the brew unit?
4. Is it enough to clean the brew unit with just water? or do I need a special cleaner?
5. I usually use filtered or bottled water. How often should I perform descaling?

In general how much grams of coffee beans does the grinder cut to make a single espresso? I am not sure if its my imagination I think it uses too much. I thought a single espresso dose is about 8grams.",1,1759186584.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False
