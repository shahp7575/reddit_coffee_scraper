They say the camera never lies. But I know better. It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic,those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living. Sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling… I capture confidence in its most seductive forms. It’s not about posing…it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera? I’m your classic Irish mischief maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half read fantasy book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks with my camera in hand and off the cuff road trips, the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator.

Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you?

And yes, I absolutely swap pics. It’s kind of my thing.

My mom left for a trip yesterday and said we could use her house for whatever. So I decided to take a night off from my cosleeping, breastfed toddler. Drank a bottle of wine and binge watched Blood of My Blood. It was so very nice, but I could not stop thinking about my little dude. Kept checking the CCTV of the interior of our house just to watch him play with his dad and be put to bed while bf played the song I sing to him every night. I couldn’t even sleep in because I woke up early needing to pump and couldn’t stop thinking about my son and returning to him. Got to thinking…these are literally symptoms of addiction lmao

1nau58c,https://www.reddit.com/r/XXRunning/comments/1nau58c/why_do_my_energy_levels_seem_to_be_the_opposite/,Why do my energy levels seem to be the opposite that they should be?,"Why do my energy levels seem to be the opposite that they should be?

I wake up very early, typically at around 4am. When I'm up I'm wide awake and immediately get out of bed and start my day. Getting up and ready is never an issue, in fact I'm more likely to have the opposite problem (like waking up at 2 or 3 am and then having to force myself to stay in bed until a more appropriate hour).

So in the morning I have very high energy which is pretty normal I think but then even though I have coffee it usually goes way down after breakfast (my typical breakfast is eggs, beans, and brocoli). At around 9 or 10 am after I eat I become extremely lethargic and fatigued and it's like I could literally just fall asleep. I usually go on a walk or run in the morning fasted and my energy is high during that but then I eat, which should boost my energy even more but it's like it puts me to sleep.

Sometimes I can go on a walk and feel better but when I'm just totally at rest I feel terrible. Shouldn't it be the opposite?

It sucks because when I'm hanging out with friends I have to get up and move sometimes just to not feel like I'm going to fall asleep and work is hard too. And I feel like I can never truly rest because it's like resting is actually painful. And when I want to rest, like at night, I have to take melatonin just to fall asleep and then I'm up multiple times and then naturally alert hours before the rest of the world. 

I also usually go to the gym at around 3pm, and I'm fine for that, and usually have enough energy, but doing anything after is hard, and I always try to fix it with more food or rest but it doesn't work. It just seems like I only have energy when moving and if not it's like I'm a zombie sitting in a chair just trying not to fall asleep. Like my body and brain mostly only work when I'm moving. And it's much worse after eating. It's like I eat and immediately fall asleep. (I usually eat right before bed and that helps me sleep better though).

I just feel like movement is supposed to use energy and food is supposed to give it, but for my body it's like it's the opposite. This has made fueling for runs hard for me because I have been nervous to eat before/during a run. I've gotten to 10 miles fasted, which I know is probably not recommended, but since my body seems to respond badly even to low carb and balanced meals I am not sure what to do. 

  
What's going on with me?

1nau3wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nau3wp/the_hungry_hand_that_came_from_the_stars/,The Hungry Hand That Came from the Stars,"The starry night sky blazed bright with the meteorite’s cosmic exhaust, contrails in neon green. The color was like the denatured ethanol in a spirit level backlit by a jet torch. She felt the seismic shock of the rocky projectile as it struck the ground, heard the clonks and their din as the impact launched pebbles and dirt clods into the sky before they came back down in earthen rain.



Mitzi Robillard—no beauty, she, and the size of a defensive end, to boot—whose unchecked acromegaly continued to enlarge her bones with excess growth hormone, felt perpetually cooked and cracked like a boiled crab. Her size-seventeen dogs barked their way across the cornfield furrows, toward where the shooting star struck. Mitzi choked fumes down her apneic airway. She felt the ground shake under her flat feet that were like the palmates of a Jurassic species of duck.



At the crash site, which was unattended (and would remain unmolested by authority thereafter), Mitzi found two things: One was a device like an old Nintendo Game Boy, but with tiny joysticks instead of buttons, and a monochrome screen. (A nonsense alphabet of glowing green characters ran on the display, spinning like scatters and wilds on the reel of a slot machine barrel.)



The other thing was a child-sized human hand.



Mitzi was a biological giant and a gigantic simpleton. Her open heart throbbed with an unrequited love of the world around her. But despite her beneficence (or perhaps because of it) she did not think to disclose her prize to any of the alphabet agencies into whose jurisdiction technology delivered by meterorite might fall.



She did, however, have a notion.



Ms. Robillard was a restorer of forgotten things, as many people who are themselves forgotten often come to be; a conscript in that league of involuntary recluses who repair and replace discarded parts, and clean and polish abandoned things; a spinster, she. Like those other lonelies, Mitzi tended to her *objets trouvés* with a tenderness that is the paradoxical symptom of a life lived unloved.



She brought the alien console back to her cabin. The tiny hand, too.



•



She hadn’t an inkling of how to operate it, but Mitzi futzed with the console nonetheless. Prying open its housing proved impossible—not just because of her ungainly hands (like gorillas’ hands), but because when she tried to, it felt like something was frying her brain. But once Mitzi stopped trying to dissect the console with her snap ring pliers (and then her metal spreaders), she found new delights in its unbothered build.



She found, amongst other things, that the console could make the small hand dance.



•



A routine began thereafter. Day after day, Mitzi woke up (and stretched her branch-long limbs, and cracked her birch-tree-trunk neck, and stretched her spine overgrown from periosteal apposition), and brewed her morning coffee. Then she played with the console to start off her day.



The display’s glow-green alphabet, with its cipher, runes, and sigils, made her heart dance. Like the one time a boy held her hand.



The console spoke to her, then, in a language she knew was impossible to know. But Mitzi still experienced that otherworldly dialect’s revelations. Which confounded her, not least because of her impoverished grasp of her own native tongue.



It said to feed the hand.



And Mitzi, eager to pay back those mystic hours of joy spent twiddling the console’s joysticks, willingly obliged.



First, she brought crackers, for the hand to eat. But once the tiny fingers touched the Saltines, they just as soon flicked them away. The crackers sailed through the air like folded looseleaf triangles through a paper football goalpost.



Mitzi offered up a wide-varying menu, but the hand rejected each offering in turn. With that appendage’s every unhappy refusal, the console shrieked and the gravid air shivered, until Mitzi smelled burnt ozone and felt pain in her skull; hurt like when her mother used to tipple a touch too much and fall asleep, with Mitzi, in their station wagon, inside the garage, with the car’s engine running. Until finally, with tears welling in her sad and elephantine eyes, she kneeled before the tiny hand.



She grovelled. She genuflected.



“Please, please,” she said, hands joined together in one white-knuckled bunch. Tears ran from her eyes and down the jowls of her round, rubicund face, drops freely dripping from her chin, like rainwater from a leaky roof. They pattered on her dim and dusty floorboards.



“Please, tell me what you want.”



The hand couldn’t speak, of course, but she believed that it intended to impart to her its secret omens. An apocalyptic wind buffeted her spirit, and she felt something in the way of fundamentalists who claim to know the date of their own (and humanity’s) doom. 



If the hand would but command her, she would obey its every phantasmagorical whim.



She flailed like a penitent starved for redemption. “Just tell me. Just tell me what you want!”



The console spoke in both an electrical buzzing and the low, throaty grumble of a toad. It said to her, told her through her blood, whispered through the inaccessible corridors of her soul: “*Urtun la im naiv nodnaiv*.”



And Mitzi Robillard, by way of an epiphany wrought from anguish, or some preternatural faculty otherwise, understood the Word. Even if she didn’t understand the words themselves.



She went to her knife drawer and pulled out her sharpest blade. She stood over the small hand, her heart aching with worry for the little thing’s hunger. And she sliced her hand open. And she gave it her ichor.



Her acromegalic blood had always made her big, made her much too big; too big her entire life, in fact. But now her impure blood had a purpose. Because the very small hand that she was feeding it to needed her adulterated blood to grow. And to Mitzi Robillard, who had never known someone else’s affections, parasitism was the mirror image of love.

Suddenly everything has to be exactly her way, and if it's not then I'm some huge monster. I'm talking things like the window open how she likes it, the temperature how she likes it, the doors locked as she likes it, the coaster isn't allowed to be in on the coffee table if not in use, the lights set exactly how she likes it.... It used to be pretty 50/50, but now if things aren't the way she wants them, she gets rude and snappy with me.

Whenever I bring up any grievances, she shuts down, gets mad, flips the script with things like ""you do that too"" and then tells me I'm wrong/over reacting/misinterpreting things. Honest to god it hasn't even been a year and I'm kinda nervous. Last week she was absolutely infuriated with me for cleaning up our spare room that's full of her clothes and cardboard boxes she throws in there from all her online deliveries. I told her she was being an asshole and I didn't know what I did to piss her off, and when I came back from the dumpster she was crying and told me she was sorry. I told her sorry didn't mean anything anymore since in 2 days she'd be back to snapping at me - literally 2 days later she got mad at me for something I can't even remember....

1nau3v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nau3v8/should_you_buy_the_yaheetech_lift_top_coffee/,Should You Buy the Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table for Storage,"Testing the Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table has been an intriguing journey, and honestly, it turned out to be quite the centerpiece in my living room. The concept of a lift-top design intrigued me from the start, and putting this to daily use brought its pros and cons to light. Whether you’re relaxing on the couch or need a functional work surface, this coffee table brings versatility wrapped in a visually appealing design.  

**Build Quality and Sturdiness**  
The table boasts a solid construction, crafted from CARB P2-compliant MDF with water-resistant lamination, and the durability of this piece genuinely exceeded my expectations. I tend to be a bit clumsy, and spills are not unheard of in my household, but this coffee table seems unfazed. Its thick frame and tapered square legs not only provide excellent stability but make it feel robust enough to endure both daily wear and the occasional unintentional bump. The foam protective pads are another thoughtful touch, keeping the lift-top operation silent and smooth.  

**Lift-Top Feature in Everyday Life**  
The lift-top functionality of this coffee table is, without a doubt, its star feature. Sitting on the couch while working on my laptop has been a game-changer, especially during long video calls or quick dinner breaks in front of the television. The mechanism allows the tabletop to rise seamlessly, providing a stable raised work surface. I also tested it as a dining table – a perfect solution for people who might not always want to sit formally at a dining table.  

**[Check Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b087wv28h8/)**  

**Hidden Storage and Organization**  
Beneath the lift top hides a storage compartment that felt like a treasure chest for clutter-prone individuals like myself. Stashing away essentials like remote controls, chargers, and even a couple of books has made my living room appear perpetually tidy. It’s not the largest compartment, but it’s great for keeping smaller items out of sight while ensuring they remain within arm’s reach. The additional lower shelf is an excellent addition, offering more space for decorative items like magazines or a basket for miscellaneous items.

**Ease of Assembly**  
No one enjoys struggling with furniture assembly, so I approached this task warily. To my relief, the table came with clear instructions and all the necessary hardware, making the entire setup process surprisingly effortless. It took me about an hour to assemble on my own, and even if you’re not particularly handy, this shouldn’t feel like a daunting ordeal.  

**Strengths**  
- The lift-top functionality is smooth, versatile, and greatly enhances convenience.
- Hidden storage compartments help maintain a tidy space.
- Solid and water-resistant construction ensures durability and longevity.
- Protective foam pads add a thoughtful touch for noise reduction and surface safety.
- Easy assembly with clear instructions and included hardware.  

**Disadvantages**  
- The lift-top mechanism, while functional, may require a certain level of care to avoid forcing it.
- Limited storage space in the hidden compartment, which might be insufficient for bulkier items.
- Some users might find the table's size too compact depending on their specific needs.  

**Product Rivals**  
While testing the coffee table, I couldn’t help but wonder how it stacked up against similar products from competing brands. Compared to models like the Best Choice Products Modern Lift Top Coffee Table, this one offers a more minimalist design that I personally find more versatile for various decorating styles. The hidden compartment in the Yaheetech coffee table is slightly smaller than its competitor’s counterpart, which might be a deal-breaker for those needing more storage. However, the protective pads and water-resistant lamination give this table the edge in terms of thoughtful design.  

Similarly, compared to another option like the Tangkula Lift Top Coffee Table, what stands out here is the sturdiness and stability, thanks to the tapered square legs. The Yaheetech table, in my testing, didn’t wobble even when loaded, which was something I couldn’t say for others with lighter construction.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When thinking about the value this table offers, it’s hard to complain. While not overly extravagant, it fulfills its promise of functionality and style at a reasonable price point. The balance between its features, build quality, and practicality makes it an attractive option. Sure, there are fancier and more expensive alternatives, but this coffee table hits the sweet spot for budget-conscious shoppers looking for something that feels premium without breaking the bank.

“Please stop making coffee in the morning. It’s WAY TOO LOUD. – your new neighbor”

I honestly don’t get it. Stop making coffee? Really?

I already grind my beans the night before, because I know doing it between 5–7 AM would be inconsiderate for people who work late and sleep in. Two of my neighbors are students who work evenings in bars/restaurants, so I try to be mindful.

I’m a very quiet person, and my building has strict noise rules, which I love:
	•	No loud music or TV (headphones only)
	•	No parties, ever

When I asked her about it, she said it’s the kettle boiling that bothers her.

That completely baffles me. How could she even hear that? The walls here are solid brick with insulation and sheetrock. The landlord is obsessed with soundproofing—quiet AC, heating, water heaters, everything.

For context:
	•	My kettle is an Amazon Basics electric model—no whistle, no beeps, just boils water.
	•	I use a glass Bodum pour-over, so no noisy coffee machine.

Honestly, my shower, AC, dishwasher, or even the fridge make way more noise.

This morning I gave up and just microwaved water for instant coffee, but I feel ridiculous.

Am I actually being inconsiderate here, or is this just absurd?",1,1757253853.0,truelifestories1s1,0,1.0,False

1nau0ke,https://i.redd.it/1xu1cmyq1rnf1.jpeg,7 Years Without You But You Live On,"First and foremost, RIP Malcolm. 

As I sit outside on this sunny morning in Pennsylvania sipping on coffee that has gotten cold, I enter the headspace that I do on the 7th of September every year for the last 7 years. Reflective thoughts swirl in my mind bringing on feelings of sadness, grief, yearning and apathy. 

I open up my Apple Music app to begin my yearly tradition: play Mac’s music all day and let his messaging and ideas wash over me. 

My sadness has evolved over (what we as humans consider) “time.” What began as a sadness for Malcolm’s physical absence from our universe later became a sadness for what Malcolm missed out on in his life, his potential, and continued ideas. Today, I am saddened for us as a continuity of his ideas. Malcolm’s fans are some of the most passionate people I have ever met in my life and today, we all grieve together. 

“Funny Papers” comes on through my iPhone speakers and it brings a smile to my face; it’s one of my favorites on the Balloonerism album. I begin to yearn for an understanding of how someone like Malcolm could be taken so soon. I then remember his words: “I’m Not Real.”

I’m pulled down a mental rabbit hole  of existential ideas that eventually lead me to feeling apathetic; “Why Does It Matter? At All?” As I look around and feel the wind on my skin, I take a few deep breaths and know that I am not alone and that I love. My family, friends and everything that makes my life special. 

Like Malcolm believed, I am an idea and I accept the fact that as an idea, I will continue to exist long after my body is gone. I believe that Mac, like any of us, felt the hardships of this life and suffered internally from the weight of it all. He yearned for a life after all the suffering and developed these ideas in his music but was grounded in our world after choosing to be a good human being while he was here. There’s not a single person in our universe that had one bad thing to say about Malcolm. He gave his best even when he didn’t feel his best. That was his choice. 

Today, on our 7th year without him, I choose to allow myself to feel the feelings that come over me. The cycle of sadness, grief, yearning and apathy will continue throughout the day and that’s okay. I also choose to remember love. For the people that make my life what it is. For the life that I have. And for myself: an idea that keeps on going. 

I choose to be inspired by Malcolm and continue being grounded by giving my best to everyone. This life may be complicated and difficult to understand but what isn’t complicated is choosing to be AND practicing being a good person. We are only physically here for so long. 

RIP Mac Miller.💙

[**Am I the a**hole boarding the plane and leaving without my wife?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/167hcj6/am_i_the_ahole_boarding_the_plane_and_leaving/)

(Sorry ahead of time for the length of this one, but there is a lot of key details I think are important) I know how this sounds, but hear me out. This is also not my usual account but I don’t want to risk my wife seeing this, as it is currently a sensitive subject.

My wife (female 43) and I (Male 47) have a daughter (Female 21) who goes to college out of state. We will call my wife Meg and my daughter Jess.

Jess is in her Junior year of college. Over the summer she was employed by her university and was able to stay in the dorms. After summer she was moving out of the dorms and into her own apartment off campus.

Meg and I live in the PNW (Jess goes to school on the east coast). We usually go to visit Jess a couple times throughout the semester, typically parents weekend and move out day. She also comes home during the holidays.

Let me start by saying that traveling with my wife is not a great experience. I am very type a, I like to have everything organized and make sure that we get where we need to be early, especially when traveling. My wife is the opposite, very “go with the flow” and “we will get there when we get there”. I do my best to meet in the middle, but not when traveling by plane.

Last year, during parents weekend Meg and I were going to fly out to see Jess. Our flight was at 10am. Our airport isn’t huge, but not a tiny airport either. I told my wife that we needed to be at the airport 90 minutes early, and we live about 30 minutes for the airports. This being said I wanted to leave at the very latest by 8, since we would also need to park and walk a little bit.

I of course got up at 6, to make sure everything was ready and accounted for. My wife does not like to get up early. It took me attempting to wake her up 5 times before she eventually got up at 740 then wanted to make coffee, shower, and eat a bowl of cereal … let’s just say that we didn’t leave the house until 9. It ended up being busier at the airport than normal (likely due to many colleges having parents weekend) and it took so long to get through security that we missed our flight.

Rightly so, the airline refused to refund our ticket. We were able to get new tickets but not until the next day and missed Friday afternoon and Saturday morning with our daughter. Jess was disappointed to say the least.

Fast forward to now. We were flying down for a long weekend to help her move. We take one flight from our town to a bigger town nearby, then fly from there to my daughters college town.

Again it was a long morning of me pushing my wife getting her to move along. Due to the last airport mishap I wanted to make sure I told her we needed to leave extra early as to not miss the flight again.

We got there on time, with a bit of time to spare, and my wife was annoyed. Kept going on about how now we just have to sit and wait for 45 minutes for them to start boarding.

We took our first flight and landed in the connecting city, at a much larger airport. We only had about 1 hour layover. We got off the plane at 915 and our next plane started boarding at 940. We had to take multiple rails to get from where we landed to our terminal. We got to our terminal and had about 15 minutes until our plane was set to board.

My wife tells me that she wants to get coffee. There was a little market next to our terminal that sold hot food and coffee. I asked if she wanted me to go grab it for her. “No I want Starbucks” she said. Well Starbucks we a rail ride away, and a little bit of a walk. I told her we couldn’t do that, we didn’t have enough time. She stated that we had enough time and if I wouldn’t go with her she would go by herself. I tried to discourage her but she was determined. She walked away, at a brisk pace for her, and said she would be back in time.

15 minutes went by and she was no where to be seen. The started calling boarding groups, I called my wife hoping she was near by, she didn’t answer. They called a few groups, then called ours. In a panic I called my wife again, 3 times, finally on the last call she answered and said she was on her way, it was a long line and she had to wait a bit. I told her they were almost done with boarding and she needed to hurry up.

I waited by the gate but the attendant said they would need to shut the gate in 2 minutes. I waited and waited, but she didn’t show up. The attendant asked if I wanted to board, otherwise she was closing the gate. I tried to plead with her to wait a couple of minutes but she insisted that she couldn’t. So, I boarded the plane.

A few minutes later my wife calls me saying the the attendant won’t let her on, they had already removed the boarding ramp at that point. She told me I needed to tell them to let me off the plane to be with her and I said no. It is not fair to do this again to Jess, I said I told you we didn’t have time but you decided to go anyways. I told her to go purchase a new ticket for the next flight and I would see her when she arrives.

She got to Jess’s school and seemed unbothered by the whole situation, didn’t even really talk about it. I thought maybe she realized it was her fault and just wanted to drop it.

Boy was I wrong. We are now home and she hasn’t talked to me since the trip, over a week ago, and is insisting that I am an asshole. So, am I the asshole?

The only option is to stop coddling your wife as apparently people have been doing all her life. Leave on the dot, every time. Eventually she'll learn to be on time or be left behind. The world doesn't revolve around her and it's high time for her to grow up.

>Your wife is acting like a entitled child. No, we’re not holding the plane up so she can get coffee. I used to have to travel a lot for work and was always booked tight layovers and ppl lallygagging at the airport make me crazy. Natural consequences are the best teacher. Maybe she’ll learn she’s less important than literally everybody else on the plane.

# UPDATE FROM THE MAIN POST

Wow, I know a lot of people say this but I really didn’t think this would get as big as it did. Thanks everyone for the responses. I have been trying to read them in batches when I have time, because I have been getting some good suggestions. I wanted to answer a couple questions I saw as well as add a bit of extra info.

For those who are outside of USA, PNW is Pacific Northwest.

As far as how she acts in other situations, she generally doesn’t have any issues. She is never one to be late to work or anything like that, or just seems like travel is her poor area. I never noticed things like this until we started traveling often to see our daughter. This is why I never considered ADD/ADHD, she really shows no other signs of this.

I saw posts implying that my wife might have an addiction of some sort, I’m not sure how that would line up but I don’t see that being a possibility

I didn’t think the following information was important, but my daughter made a comment, and so did a friend that I discussed this with, so I thought maybe I would mention it here.

Jess is not Meg’s daughter. I was married one before and my wife unfortunately passed away due to complications during Jess’s birth. I remarried Meg when my daughter was 6. My daughter made a comment that Meg doesn’t like want to come to see/help her and that is why she is always running late, but I have offered to go alone and Meg was always very against that idea so I wouldn’t think that is the case.

# **Final Update - 5 days later**

[**Am I the a**hole boarding the plane and leaving without my wife?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/167hcj6/comment/jzhhbdp/) 

Hi everyone, thanks again for all the advice, I read as many of the comments as I could and took in all the information. I wanted to provide an update.

My wife finally started talking to me again. When she did i told her that I wanted to have a conversation about the situation, but I wanted to give it a couple of days for emotions to settle down.

Some of the comments here gave me a great idea and I wanted to see what she thought about it. For all future trips I will have my tickets, she will have hers. I typically drive to the airport and leave my car in one of the pay lots, so I would drive myself and she could Uber. She will have all the freedom she wants to do what she wants but it is up to her to arrive on time and board the plane. I let her know that it was starting to feel like I needed to keep track of both of us, I phrased it in a way to make it sound like I didn’t want to be controlling over her and let her manage her own time. She wasn’t happy with this, but she reluctantly agreed.

Now to get to the bigger issue that I didn’t realize we had until reading the comments of this post. Call me oblivious, but I really never thought there was any issue between Meg and Jess. After talking to my wife she wouldn’t admit to any issues, and stated that she would never intentionally delay a flight so that we couldn’t see “our daughter” and acted offended that I would ask such a thing. If that was her actual purpose, I don’t think I would be able to prove it. But, it will be at the forefront of my mind in the future.

After talking to Meg and Jess, we decided on the following. Meg and I will be visiting Jess on parents weekend. But, I will be attending fathers weekend from now on, and I will be attending by myself to get some alone time with Jess. Jess seemed very excited and surprisingly Meg didn’t seem to have an issue with that this time.

Thanks again to everyone who took the time to read and give me advice, I really appreciate everything and I hope these steps can work towards a resolution for the issues.

**u/NotFranciscoR**
>Wishing you all the best of course, but be careful, it seems(from my perspective, which is limited to the information you have given us) that your wife only tolerated your daughter and wants to keep you away from her now that she's an adult. I saw a similar post about a soon to be wife with a step daughter, the new wife was expecting for her soon to be husband to be a seasonal parent after the wedding. Of course you have been married for a long time and everything seemed normal to you, but I would recommend reaching out to your daughter to ask for her perspective growing up with her step mom.

**u/Crafty-Maintenance-4**
>Op I seen this play out before, of course she'll never admit to not liking your daughter or to doing anything negative towards her, she'll act like she really cares for her and is worried about her, or misses her. While giving her snide comments on the side, poking at her in ways that seem like she's just concerned or giving advice, or sabotaging chances for you to see her. And your daughter as a your child will never admit it to you if she feels slighted by her because you're happy and your wife makes you happy and she would never want to mess that up for you so she'll just endure. But she's slowly been letting you know. 
>
>Talk to one of your daughter's best friends,ask them what they think. Ask people that who are constantly around you guys if they've seen any type of behavior from your wife towards your daughter. Look I'm hoping that's not the case but to me, that's what it sounds like is going on here.

---

**u/azoresmom3**
>Op, I would have a very serious conversation with your daughter. She might not be very forthcoming if she think she might be the reason for any unhappiness in your life. Tell her that nothing she says will be her fault or held against her. Tell her there have been a couple of red flags and you wanted to get her side of it. Ask her if your wife has ever said or done anything that made your daughter feel like she was an inconvenience, or putting your wife out for any reason. Especially if it were for things that normally wouldn’t have been a big deal. Your wife could have gotten a coffee that wasn’t Starbucks, she isn’t late to any other events or situations. At this point it is 100% on purpose.

**u/devsfan1830**
>Man i hope this strategy works out but I think you may need to be prepared to either go to couples counseling to uncover the root issue because she may never be honest otherwise, or actually choose between remaining married and your relationship with your daughter. Honestly think back. You say she is ALWAYS punctual and organized with other things. Great. Now what about events involving your daughter? If this has been a pattern well before college visits, then there's a good chance she doesn't 100% believe she is ""our"" daughter.
>
>Also, on one of those fathers only weekends, ask your daughter to be honest with you about your wife. Let her talk, don't interrupt or defend, just listen. You may get a better picture of things that way too.

after we did that, we chatted a bit more and then eventually ended the date when i commented that he truly seemed exhausted and that he should get some rest. if he wasn't interested he wouldn't have tried to keep the date going for so long, right? did completely misread the situation? i genuinely felt like he was just inexperienced and anxious about the date but interested in me, but i haven't heard from him since yesterday and he had been messaging me daily, sometimes multiple times a day before the date. i texted last, so i don't want to double text and seem desperate, but a part of me also wonders if he is just too nervous to text me first.",1,1757253541.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1natwnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1natwnw/credit_score_rated_as_very_poor/,Credit score rated as 'Very Poor',"Hello all

I'm sorry, I've joined this sub and posted this question in a bit of a panic, so please forgive me. I have a feeling this might be one of those annoying questions that gets asked a lot by people as clueless as me.

For whatever reason, my partner checked her credit score earlier today, using free sites which advertise the ability to do this (namely ClearScore and Experian) and was chuffed at the high score she had. It prompted me to check mine too and I was utterly shocked at what I saw.

To give some context, I was 40 earlier this year. I am somewhat conservative in how I live my life, I have a decent amount in savings (circa £100k in a Premium Bonds account and across two ISAs) and would generally describe myself as frugal. I intend to spend some money on some much needed home improvement over  the next year or so.

I am a homeowner, and have a joint mortgage with my partner. We brought the house in 2021 and I was able to put up 20% as a deposit by myself. We share the mortgage and have never missed a payment. 

I also have a credit card. I took this out several years back to benefit from the added protection when making large purchases online and also because I was led to believe it would improve my credit rating when applying for a mortgage if i could demonstrate i could manage credit. I tend to use this for the majority of things I buy out of ease (food shopping, fuel for the card, even when I'm buying a coffee on my lunchbreak) and it is paid off every month. 

I have no CCJs or loans (i have never had a loan). My bank account is in credit and I have never gone into my overdraft, apart from once, unintentionally, about 20 years ago when I was a student and I accidentally spent too much on an online purchase. I moved some money into this account as soon as I had realised.

I am a registered nurse and have been in my current role in the NHS for approx 16 years. I earn circa 45k annually. I only mention this as I understand NHS roles are seen as being secure?

I remember checking my credit rating via Experian and Clearscore prior to us applying for the mortgage and it was very positive, which I had expected at the time given my years of furious saving to buy a house. But on checking my credit score on a bit a whim today, it is showing (via the free checks on ClearScore website and also the TransUnion site linked the MoneySavingExpert site) as having a score of 583 (out of 999) and being deemed 'Very Poor' respectively. It made me feel sick, to be honest. 

Can anyone advise why this might be? I have not changed anything in my life since these reports were all showing positive numbers prior to taking out my mortgage and I have never defaulted on a payment. Having been driving for over 20 years without any issues, I accrued 6 points for speeding in the space of a month earlier this year for driving over the limit in same 20mph zone (my fault entirely for not paying attention) but surely that doesn't effect a credit rating?

I know some historical posts on here say not to worry about these numbers, but i am shocked by how low they are. The reports on these free sites don't really point to why the numbers are the way they are, though one does mention that my email address and password was found in a data breach (relating to a Twitter account I opened years ago and haven't used since).

Does anyone have any ideas? I'm not planning on taking a loan out anytime soon but knowing I have this rating attributed to me after a lifetime of trying my hardest to save and making sacrifices has left me feeling totally gutted.

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one! ",1,1757253317.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

These were the ones that stuck out to me, but talk me in/out of them, please!

Ancient Woods - Dried birch, crisp autumn breezes, Cockleshell climbing Ivy, lavender and cypress tied together amongst fresh, wild mint leaf.

Ancient Woods - Dried birch, crisp autumn breezes, Cockleshell climbing Ivy, lavender and cypress tied together amongst fresh, wild mint leaf.

Autumn In Vermont - Gorgeous red maple leaves, freshly harvested orchard apples, light hints of bakery cinnamon, golden amber tempered by hints of sweet agar-wood and Indian sandalwood.

Beastly - For the Beast hoping to be saved by Beauty: Ancient castle stones, the brooding airs of a dark forest, a threat of winter; a fougere fit for a prince, the musk and leather of a beast; a library filled with rare books; and a single red rose. (Villains & Wretches series)

Black Sesame - A rich and roasted nuttiness for an airy, sophisticated gourmand. Waffle cone, roasted coconut Co2, buttercream, ethyl vanillin, chocolate, roasted barley, hazelnut, coffee bean Co2, bread, a pinch of salt, and ginger Co2.♣

Bonfire Pumpkins - This scent started out as an accident then turned into my personal all time favorite scent.  This year I decided to share.  We accidentally mixed Pumpkin porridge with Marshmallow Fireside and created a sensational creamy bonfire scent with notes of maple oats drizzled with pure golden clover honey, a pinch of muscovado sugar all topped with a dollop of sugared pumpkin puree plus toasted vanilla marshmallows over a roaring fire.  This is a smoky scent.

Cake on Mondays* - Delicious sponge cake made with almond extract, vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon, then slathered in cream cheese buttercream frosting.  May cause irritation due to the spice notes.

Cinderella’s Carriage - What did Cinderella really wish for? We think it was this blend of Coconut Cream Pie with Marshmallow Meringue, Sweet Pumpkin, Spiritueuse Double Vanilla, and Vanilla Bean Noel. We think this is the REAL reason the prince fell in love, who could resist Cinderella in sexy foodie?

Come-hither – Such a sexy scent of intoxicating vanillas with a hint of myrrh.  This is not a foodie vanilla. This vanilla is all grown up and will demand attention on anyone who wears it.

Gooey Caramel - Real, old fashioned caramel, the gooey, salty kind made with real butter. This is the truest caramel you will find.   

Lipstick Stains - bourbon vanilla, musk, bulgarian rose petals and incense.♣

Medieval - Raw sugar crystals, white rum, sweet fennel and orange blossom met with dark exotic myrrh. (Mascaraed Ball series)

Netherworld - Sexy, dark leather, crimson wine, bare oak trees, stone, rain and blackened earth.

Vampire’s Bane - - Rich 5-fold lemon oil and luscious red mandarin cloaked in folds of decadent vanilla, myrrh, ambergris, and ambrette seed CO2, sweetened with melt-in-the-mouth cotton candy and spiked with the merest hint of clove. (Mushroom Series)

Violet Noir - This is violet as a forest femme fatale: dark, earthy, and mysterious. Black pepper, violet leaf, olibanum resinoid, natural vanilla, benzoin, frankincense, fresh tobacco, sandalwood, musk, and amber. ♣",1,1757253291.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

1natsur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1natsur/the_rules_arrived_on_every_screen/,The Rules Arrived on Every Screen,"The first time it happened, I thought it was some sick marketing stunt.

I was at my desk, staring blankly at the quarterly expense report, when every monitor in the office flickered black. Phones lit up at once. Even the cheap digital clock on the wall stuttered, digits spasming, before the numbers flattened into white text:

**""Good afternoon, DANIEL HARRIS. These are your rules for today.""**

The letters crawled across the glass with a kind of oily shimmer. My coworkers laughed nervously, but I froze. Nobody else’s screens showed my name. Just mine.

Then the list appeared:

# RULESET: 08/29/2041

1. **You must not touch any object painted red until 9:00 PM.**
   * Sub-rule: If a red object touches you, remain completely still until it is removed.
2. **Do not use your own voice between 3:14 and 3:19 PM.**
   * Conditional: If you are spoken to during this time, repeat the words back exactly as they were said, without alteration.
3. **At sunset, you must open your nearest window, regardless of location.**
   * Sub-rule: If you are in a windowless space, knock three times on the wall closest to the west.

Everyone around me was groaning about the interruption, refreshing their browsers, trying to get back to work. But they didn’t see rules. They didn’t see *my name*. Their screens had returned to normal.

I thought about ignoring it. I almost did. Until I saw what happened to Michael.

At 3:15, he leaned over my cubicle, asking if I’d gotten the new expense template. The exact moment my rule forbade me to speak. My throat itched with the urge to answer.

So I just parroted his words back: *""Gotten the new expense template?""*

Michael blinked, confused. ""Uh… yeah?"" He left.

At 3:17, across the office, I heard someone else talking. A voice like Michael’s, but younger, smoother. I turned and saw him, same suit, same tie, but a version of him I’d never met. He was standing at his desk, his features flickering between ages like a tape being rewound.

Then he collapsed into a smear of static. His body made no sound when it hit the floor. His desk swallowed him like quicksand. Nobody screamed. Nobody even noticed.

Except me.

That night, I followed the last rule. I opened the window of my apartment at sunset. The street below was unusually quiet, as though sound had been drained from the world. When I leaned out, I thought I heard whispers rising from the empty air: *""Formatted. Prepared. Preserved.""*

I slammed the window shut.

The rules didn’t stop. Every day since, the broadcast hijacks my screens at exactly 12:14 PM.

They’ve been getting stranger.

# RULESET: 09/01/2041

1. **Drink no water between 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM.**
   * Conditional: If you become thirsty, chew on paper instead.
2. **Avoid mirrors today.**
   * Sub-rule: If you see your reflection, do not acknowledge it.
   * Conditional: If it acknowledges you, cut the lights immediately.
3. **Before sleep, place your shoes on the wrong feet and leave them by the door.**

I nearly broke #2. At the office bathroom, I forgot and looked up. My reflection was grinning, but my lips weren’t moving. I killed the lights, trembling in the stall until someone else wandered in and flicked them back on.

That night, I left my shoes reversed by the door. At 3 AM, I heard them moving. Scuffing back and forth across the floor like restless feet.

I thought I was losing my mind until I found him, *Harlan*, the man in the abandoned TV repair shop.

He was waiting for me inside, skeletal thin, eyes shone like burned-out bulbs.

""You’re getting lists,"" he said. ""Daily. Personal. Addressed by name.""

I nodded.

""You’ve been chosen for formatting.""

The walls were stacked with old televisions; each tuned to dead air. But when I stared, I realized it wasn’t static, tiny lines of *text*, too small to read without magnification, scrolling endlessly.

""The rules aren’t instructions,"" Harlan whispered. ""They’re calibrations. They’re bending you into shape, molecule by molecule, teaching your nervous system the logic of what comes next. Everyone who follows them survives the rewrite.""

""And if you don’t?""

He gestured at a television. I leaned close. The static resolved into a man’s face, half-erased, screaming silently as his features dissolved pixel by pixel.

But I was wrong to think it was just me.

Last week, the morning news anchor froze mid-segment. Her teleprompter must have changed, because she whispered:

*""Do not wear shoes today. If you are already wearing them, remove them before 9:00 AM. Sub-rule: If you see someone who has kept theirs on, do not acknowledge their presence.""*

Commercials cut in, except every ad slot showed names and lists of rules.

By evening, videos surfaced of commuters dissolving into static, of a woman rewinding into a crying child, of an entire café collapsing into shadow when someone ignored a rule about “not drinking coffee after 4 PM.”

The government tried to intervene.

*""The so-called ‘Pirate Signal’ is a malicious misinformation campaign,""* a Homeland Security official declared on live TV. *""Citizens are advised not to follow these fabricated rules.""*

Then her teleprompter shifted. Her eyes darted side to side. She stammered:

*""If you have entered a doorway in the last ten minutes, remain in the room you are currently in until instructed otherwise.""*

The feed cut instantly. But it was too late.

The next day, **everyone** got rules.

Phones, billboards, ATMs, even smart fridges. Personalized lists, delivered daily at exactly 12:14 PM.

Here was mine on 09/03/2041:

# RULESET: 09/03/2041

1. **Do not look directly at the sky between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM.**
   * Sub-rule: If you accidentally glimpse it, do not describe what you saw.
2. **Carry salt in your left pocket today.**
   * Conditional: If approached by anyone without salt, avoid physical contact.
3. **Tonight, when you hear the sirens, unplug all electronic devices within reach.**
   * Sub-rule: If a device cannot be unplugged, cover it with fabric until sunrise.

At 2:05, a teenager ignored Rule #1. He glanced up.

He screamed. Then he began to unfold, like a paper man peeled into a dozen thinner selves, scattering into the street.

Above us, shadows twisted into shapes that didn’t match our bodies.

Stores close for “rule hours.” FEMA issues daily alerts, telling us which rules are “likely benign” and which are “critical.” TikTok is flooded with shaky footage of impossible deaths.

Harlan told me: *""They’re bending reality into a shape that can hold them. Every human who follows the rules is being tuned like an instrument. The ones who break them? Deleted.""*

The rules are accelerating. Here was the final list:

# RULESET: 09/07/2041

1. **At 9:15 AM, close your eyes for exactly 40 seconds.**
   * Sub-rule: If you open them early, do not describe what you saw.
2. **When you hear your name spoken by a voice you do not recognize, answer immediately.**
   * Conditional: If you fail to answer within three seconds, remain silent until midnight.
3. **At 11:59 PM, lie down wherever you are and close your eyes. Do not open them until invited to see.**

It’s 11:58 PM now. I’m lying on the floor of my apartment. The city outside is silent. No cars. No voices. Just the low hum of the signal, vibrating in my skull.

At 11:59, my phone lit up. The text was no longer rules. Just one word:

**“Ready.”**

I closed my eyes.

The silence deepened, thick as liquid. My body felt heavy, pinned to the floor. Then the world… shifted.

I don’t know how to explain it.

The air turned inside out. I felt my bones bend into new alignments, not breaking, just… rewritten. The pressure in my chest reversed like my lungs were designed for another kind of atmosphere. I wanted to scream, but no sound worked in the new physics.

And then, a voice, not in my head, but inside my *blood,* said:

*""You may open your eyes.""*

I did.

The world is not the world anymore.

The walls are breathing. The street outside curves upward into the sky, folding into a horizon that circles back on itself. People are walking, but not on the ground, on planes of light, on surfaces that didn’t exist before. Their bodies are changed, angles bent, shadows stretched into strange geometries.

Some look human still. Others… didn’t calibrate right. They are static things, twitching, their edges unraveling like bad reception.

And above it all, hanging where the moon used to be, is an eye the size of a continent, blinking once every thirty seconds.

The rules were never arbitrary. They were lessons. Training wheels for a reality our bodies weren’t built to survive.

Now the training is over.

I have a pretty good understanding of my codependent tendencies, struggles with limerence, and how EMDR is helping heal some childhood/teenage trauma.

Putting the insights into practice is harder. I’ve noticed a pattern this week of how much I almost viscerally reject any kindness from men in non-work settings (so social or romantic settings).

A man offered to walk me home from a wine tasting (which was actually welcome since I live in a slightly scary city) and my first instinct was to refuse, though I noticed that I refused instinctively and followed up to tell him I’d actually appreciate it. It was nice to have the company (though he was older and married and I wasn’t sure if this was a little untoward).

Another guy on a coffee date wanted to treat me to coffee and a brownie and I resisted it.

Another guy on a video chat date was trying to tell me I seem smart and attractive and it was almost like my brain couldn’t process the information - like he couldn’t possibly be saying these things, I had to be mistaken.

Objectively I do think I’m nice-looking and accomplished and deserve to be treated well generally in any event so what is this?? Just the sheer strength of codependent self-loathing that I still haven’t un-learned? 

It’s like the default wiring in my brain is saying, “but you’re just a little troll who these things don’t happen for, so don’t let them happen or see them happening (also the men might assault you).”",1,1757252998.0,Codependency,0,1.0,False
1natod6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1natod6/explore_dr_berg_vitamin_d3_k2_review_does_it/,Explore Dr. Berg Vitamin D3 K2 Review Does It Truly Enhance Health?,"The **Dr. Berg Nutritionals B06WRNG37C Vitamin D3 K2 Supplement** is a supplement I’ve been personally testing for the past couple of months, and with 120 capsules packed with 10,000 IU of Vitamin D3 and 100 mcg of MK7 Vitamin K2 per serving, it’s been a regular staple in my morning routine. This supplement combines elements like Magnesium, Zinc, MCT oil, and purified bile salts into a synergistic powerhouse designed for absorption and health benefits. But let’s dive into the good, the quirky, and the could-be-better aspects of this product, all based on personal usage and a bit of crowdsourced wisdom from fellow users.

**Design and Packaging**  
One of the first interactions with any product is through its design and packaging. The small, lightweight bottle of this supplement is sleek, compact, and perfect for storing in my kitchen cabinet or tossing into my bag while traveling. At just 4.29 x 2.17 x 2.13 inches and weighing around 3.2 ounces, it gives portability a thumbs-up. However, I did notice the capsules aren't as beautifully consistent in design as some other brands, but hey, it’s not a fashion show. Functionality-wise, the bottle is easy to open, and the capsules are smooth and easy to swallow—definitely a plus for those who struggle with larger supplements.

[Check Dr. Berg Nutritionals B06WRNG37C price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b06wrng37c/)

**Ingredient Potency and Blend**  
The primary draw of this supplement lies in its high-potency formulation. With double the Vitamin D3 amounts compared to many competitors offering just 5,000 IU, this product ensures you are adequately dosed. Vitamin D3 and K2 create a perfect tandem to boost bone and cardiovascular health by aiding calcium absorption and directing it to the bones. I could feel its effects in subtle ways—less fatigue, better mood (especially during long work-from-home winters), and stronger nails. Additionally, the inclusion of magnesium and zinc is a big win. My slight complaint? The unflavored capsules can leave a faint bitter aftertaste if you don’t drink enough water. Not a dealbreaker, but it’s something to note.

**Positives**  
This product isn’t just good; it excels in areas crucial for a supplement of its kind.  
- The high dosage of Vitamin D3 and MK7 Vitamin K2 promotes better absorption and results.  
- Includes magnesium and zinc, which aren't standard in many similar supplements but highly beneficial.  
- Manufactured in state-of-the-art GMP-compliant facilities in the US, ensuring cleanliness and quality.  

**Negatives**  
Still, no product is without its quirks, and this one has some minor hurdles:  
- Unflavored capsules leave a somewhat noticeable aftertaste.  
- Some might find the cost a little steep for what it offers, especially if on a tighter budget.  
- Depending on individual needs, 10,000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily might be overkill without prior consultation with a doctor.  

**Supplement Blend Comparison**  
While this vitamin mix covers essential micronutrients in its formulation, its real merit is its innovative addition of MCT oil and purified bile salts, which, according to reviews and personal testing, do indeed enhance bioavailability. This feature is something I noticed over time because I felt the effects of increased energy and better digestion. These small additions subtly elevate the product above competitors. However, keep in mind that this isn’t a magic pill. It works as an effective complement to a balanced diet, not a replacement.

**Alternative Offerings**  
I couldn’t avoid comparing this supplement with others on the market. For instance, the NOW Foods Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement is a solid budget-friendly alternative, but it lacks the additional ingredients like zinc and magnesium. Similarly, Garden of Life offers an equally high-dose Vitamin D3 option but comes fortified with probiotics instead. Where Dr. Berg's offering shines, though, is the unique blend of ox bile and MCT, which prevents bloating—a big plus for me. Competitors might offer similar dosages at a lower price, but you’d miss out on the absorption-oriented formula this one boasts.

**Quality for Price**  
When weighing the cost versus its benefits, it’s a bit like buying premium coffee—you aren't just paying for caffeine; you’re investing in quality. Each capsule combines multiple premium-quality ingredients, sourced from optimal locations both domestic and international. That said, the price point might give budget-conscious folks pause. But when you’re diving into something that delivers visible results, you can see why many consider it worth stretching the wallet slightly. If you value quality and noticeable results as much as I do, it’s a fair trade-off.

Ten days of no coffee or any form of caffeine. Some days go by quickly and some, not so quick. The craving hits around Day 3 but then slowly gets better after. And the countdown begins from Day 8 or so where I start looking forward to picking up my cup again. 

And finally, the day is here. The corner of the kitchen in the morning, filling up with the aroma of freshly ground beans. Back to the milk froth shape experiments, as always. 

The first sip after a long gap feels like home and a warm hug even after all these days. Not really sure if this reset is actually increasing the coffee cravings especially during the countdown phase.

It was my first visit today and I'm so glad I went. The crazy high prices on zomato had really put me off from trying this cafe but today I saw that their in-house prices are actually reasonable.

I had the coconut coffee and kung pao potatoes - they were delish. My mother is a chai snob and she actually liked the ginger chai they made for her. So there's that. 

Mostly, we were very happy to see such a nice place in Kharghar. I just wanna encourage good people setting up good ventures - especially when they are our neighbours and are actually making our neighbourhoods better.

Hands down best cookies I've ever tasted. You have to really try them cause there is no comparision to be made - the outside is crumbly but the inside positively Melts in your mouth. You can just taste the quality of ingredients that go into making them.

I would recommend the Nirvana cookie. It's a delivery set-up but you can go down and pick them up as well. The guy who makes them is super nice. Don't let the price throw you off - they really are worth it. Cannot recommend enough.

I get home yesterday after a long day working to a note on my front door. It reads:

""Please stop making coffee in the morning. It is WAY TOO LOUD. - your new neighbor""

I can't really understand it. Please stop making coffee? Seriously?
I already grind my coffee beans the night before, just because I am respectful and understand grinding beans between 5AM-7AM would be kinda shitty if you, say, got home from work at 10PM-12AM, slept 'til noon, etc. which 2 of my neighbors do (both students day/work later in evening in bar/restaurant or something).

I am super quiet. My building has strict rules on noise (which I love):

• ⁠No loud anything. Must wear headphones for music/television.
• ⁠No parties. Ever.

So I ask her when she comes home, and she says it's the kettle boiling.

WTF? How can she even hear it? We have solid brick walls between units, with sound insulation and sheetrock between! My landlord/owner is mental about noise, so she has done an awesome over-the-top job with her handyman remodeling the building specifically for noise, even including quiet water heaters, AC, heat, etc.

• ⁠My electric kettle is an Amazon Basics, no whistle, no beep, just boils water.
• ⁠My coffee pot is a glass pour-over type. Bodum 

I am 99.99% sure the shower, AC, heat system, dishwasher, microwave, heck even the fridge running is louder!

So this morning I am drinking instant coffee with water I microwaved, thinking, man, I just can't.

1nate4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nate4m/reveal_if_the_best_coffee_maker_bella_35203_lives/,Reveal if the best coffee maker Bella 35203 lives up to the hype,"The BELLA 35203 coffee maker has been part of my morning routine for the past few weeks, and I've been thoroughly putting it through its paces. As someone who loves a good cup of coffee to kickstart the day, I wanted to see if this drip coffee machine could live up to its promises. With its features like a 12-cup capacity, programmable settings, and a sleek ""Surf"" exterior finish, it caught my attention immediately.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me was the minimalist design and smooth matte finish. The ""Surf"" color is quite modern and stands out in my kitchen. Its compact dimensions (6.65""D x 10.35""W x 12.24""H), make it a great fit even in small counter spaces. Despite its lightweight build of just 2.69 pounds, it feels sturdy, and the buttons and display are well-placed for intuitive use. The reusable filter is a thoughtful touch for someone like me who's trying to cut down on disposable products, and it contributes to eco-friendliness while saving costs over time.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
The programmable settings are genuinely a lifesaver during busy mornings. Setting it up to brew coffee 24 hours in advance has become a regular part of my evening routine. Each morning, the machine brews my coffee without me having to do more than pour it into my cup. The digital display is clear and user-friendly, and programming the machine took me no more than a couple of tries before I was entirely comfortable with it.  

**Upsides**  
- Sleek, modern design enhances aesthetic appeal.  
- Compact and lightweight, perfect for small spaces.  
- Programmable up to 24 hours in advance.  
- Eco-friendly reusable filter.

**Heating Performance and Brewing Strength**  
What truly makes or breaks a coffee maker is the brewing performance. The 900-watt brewing system is efficient and can make coffee for a larger crowd quickly thanks to its 12-cup capacity. I especially like that it has an adjustable brew strength setting. One of us in the house likes it strong; the other prefers a lighter cup, and this machine lets me cater to both preferences without repeated brewing sessions. The coffee was consistently hot but not scalding, staying warm for up to two hours thanks to the non-stick warming plate.  

**Limitations**  
- The machine doesn’t offer a completely silent brewing option.  
- The carafe spout occasionally drips when pouring.  
- The matte exterior, while attractive, can fingerprint easily.  

**Safety Features**  
As someone who sometimes forgets things running, the auto shut-off after two hours is worth its weight in gold. Knowing that the coffee maker turns off on its own gives me peace of mind, especially during those busy mornings when I rush out the door for work. This feature reduces any potential electrical hazards and offers added energy savings.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this coffee maker to others, like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, I noticed some differences. While the BELLA 35203 offers a non-stick warming plate and reusable filter, the Mr. Coffee option doesn’t come with these features and instead uses disposable filters. However, in noisy environments, the brewing volume of the Mr. Coffee machine can be slightly quieter. On the flip side, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 boasts higher-end functionalities like a temperature control setting, but it also sits in a higher price bracket and takes up more counter space. BELLA provides solid, practical features for a lower price point, making it a hard-to-beat option for its cost-to-value ratio.

**Value for Money**  
Investing in this coffee maker feels like smart spending. It might not boast extravagant features like an espresso machine or provide ultra-high customization, but the included functionality more than meets the need for most people. From the reusable filter cutting down recurring costs to the programmable brewing ensuring hassle-free mornings, you're getting great bang for your buck. For its mid-range pricing, the performance and the safety features offer fantastic value.

As the title suggests, I think my question can somewhat be summarised within the discussion on clarity vs body, specifically when choosing a grinder.

Some background as to why I am writing this post. I exclusively do pour overs, and bought the Timemore C2 as a decent entry level grinder. I know it produces a lot of fines as it’s not necessarily a dedicated grinder for pour over. Ive enjoyed using it, but recently Ive been looking at upgrading my grinder as Ive been experiencing some frustration with all my coffees having quite a blended taste and completely different coffees taste similar.

Naturally, the 1zpresso ZP6 has come up as a recommendation for a high clarity hand grinder. But people have warned against it if you prefer body over the ‘tea like’ brews the ZP6 produces. 

The issue is, I am not confident in saying that I definitely prefer that style of coffee as I haven’t had too many experiences with it. Going to the coffee shops in my area, most make use of the EK43. And in general, I’ve always enjoyed the cups and can definitely taste the different tasting notes, compared to when I am brewing at home. But I am not sure if the EK43 can be described as a high(er) clarity grinder or more body focussed.

Just as a side note, I make use of RO water and third wave.

My question is, how can I experiment at home / coffee shops to figure out whether my preference lies with body or clarity? ",2,1757252198.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1nataot,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nataot/can_caffeine_withdrawal_cause_localised_head_pain/,Can caffeine withdrawal cause localised head pain?,"For context, Im 29 and only started drinking coffee for the first time 4 months ago. I had a baby and thought I needed something to wake me up more. I regret this decision a lot. 

A few weeks into having just one instant cup of coffee a morning and an occasional cup of tea, I started getting on/off bizarre pressure type headaches and quite bad anxiety. It’s taken me until now to fully connect the dots to caffeine intake. I’ve been treated for sinusitis and been to my doctor twice already, I’ve had neck pain, ear fullness, jaw pain, so many weird symptoms. I am somebody who never got headaches or anything like this before. 

I’ve now totally stopped caffeine 3 days ago. For the last 4 days I’ve had this same headache that always feels localised just under the inner corner of my left eyebrow, it’s gotten gradually better each day but it now almost feels like a bruise. It’s a strange sensation and pain, one I’ve never really had before. I feel like I almost can’t call it a headache anymore. I also have constant heart palpitations….

Does anyone know what this is? Is it part of caffeine withdrawal headache and why is it only in only in one small spot on my head? It really freaks me out sometimes and has me wondering what it is. I’ve had the same headaches that then turn into this localised pain on/off since I started drinking caffeine 4 months ago.

For example, I was walking down the street, and saw a young man standing outside a house, sketching it. I asked him what it was he was seeing, and explained he was an architecture student doing an assignment. We chatted briefly about the neighborhood and how cool it was, and I went on my way. 

I also sometimes just like to chat with strangers in general, to get that little spark form forming a little connection with someone, for experiencing a moment where we’re both like, “Here is a fellow human being with their own life full of all its own beauty and weight!” These little encounters go deeper than just idle small talk, I think. 

The other day, I was standing in a long line at a coffee shop, so I asked the locals around me, “Is the coffee here *that* good?” And we all chatted a little as I learned what the deal was. It was delightful. 

Once I saw a guy practicing with a wooden sword in a park, so I asked him about it. That’s how I ended up trying out an aikido class that he was warming up for!

I think my lovely INFP-ness isn’t diminished by these little connections or micro-encounters. I think it enhances them! I think INFPing isn’t about being twee or shy or retreating from stuff like this, but about diving into them, seeing how deep they can go, how deeply they affect us. It’s about the search for meaning in these little moments. Perhaps that’s why encountering people and all their doings can exhaust or overwhelm us, why we need those moments of quiet stillness and pursuits that help us digest these moments.

1nat4sp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nat4sp,"A ""Tea Leaf Paradox"" Beltrami flow model.","This is my attempt to ""resolve"" the tea-leaf paradox, describing how secondary flow develops by virtue of friction with the base and sidewalls of a cylinder. It is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation in cylindrical coordinates satisfying (1) convection genesis, (2) azimuthal Dirichlet no-slip boundary conditions, and (3) the Beltrami flow condition.

Seeing that the grains sink to the bottom in coffee, you'll notice that after stirring it, the coffee grains collect at the center of the cup instead of being thrown to the outer edge. Tea leaves do this too, hence the name, ""tea-leaf effect."" And it's paradoxical because the leaves/grains experience centrifugal force given by,

∂p/∂r =𝜌 u\_𝜃\^2 /r

which, in a steady-state rotational vortex, the pressure parabolically increases with radius. No matter what nonzero u\_𝜃 is initially present, secondary circulation will develop and pull the leaves inward at the base. This implies that the advection term **u**∇∙ **u** governs the flow. To deal with this nonlinear term, we invoke a Beltrami flow condition: a field with a zero Lamb vector (**u**×**𝜔**=0), meaning that the vorticity field **𝜔** is proportional to the velocity field **u** (denoted, **𝜔**=𝛼(**x**,t)**u**).

With the use of the Stokes stream function, this condition allows the azimuthal momentum (𝜃-component of NSE) to be linearized such that **u**∇∙ **u**=0. In the steady-state case, with 𝛼(**x**,t)=1 and 𝜓(r,z), one would solve a Bragg-Hawthorne PDE (with applications in rocket engine designs, *Majdalani & Vyas,* 2003 \[[7](http://majdalani.eng.auburn.edu/publications/pdf/2006%20-%20Vyas-Majdalani%20-%20AIAA%20-%20Exact%20Solution%20of%20the%20Bidirectional%20Vortex.pdf)\]). In the unsteady case, a solution to 𝜓(r,z,t) can be found by substituting the Beltrami field into the azimuthal momentum equation, yielding equations (17) and (18) in \[[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-8800/6/3/30)\].

In an unbounded rotating fluid over an infinite disk, a Bödewadt type flow emerges (similar to a von Kármán disk in *Drazin & Riley*, 2006 pg.168). Given spatial finitude, a choice between two azimuthal flow types (rotational/irrotational), and viscid-stress decay at all boundaries, obtaining a convection growth coefficient, 𝛼(t), is a problem I can't solve. By ignoring the meridional no-slip conditions, the convection growth coefficient, 𝛼\_k(t), in an orthogonal decomposition of the velocity components was easier to find by a Galerkin (inner-product) projection of NSE (creating a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) ordinary DE). Under a mound of assumptions with this projection, I got an 𝛼\_k(t) to work as predicted: meridional convection grows up to a threshold before decaying exponentially.

I’ve read lots of stories here and thought I’d share one myself to see what the internet thinks about this painful situation. I will leave out and adjust things as we are worried someone could track us and do stupid things :)

# A little backstory

My girlfriend (let’s call her Lill) and I have been together for just over a year, and we have a wonderful relationship. We met on a dating app and hit it off really well. Lill had just come out of a bad relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious, but we just clicked. We’ve been together pretty much since our first date, and we’re very very happy.

Lill’s lifelong best friend—let’s call her Honey—has been part of her life since childhood. They’ve shared countless memories: vacations, sports (they’re both in the same sports club), and relationship ups and downs. Even their mothers are best friends. They’re like sisters. If they’ve ever had rough patches, it’s usually because of outside drama caused by their partners, not between the two of them.

So now we come to the current situation which leads me to write on reddit. I have followed these stories online and asked my girlfriend if she thinks its a good idea to see what random internet strangers think about this saga.

Before Lill and I got together, there was a period where both she and Honey were single and casually dating. During that time, Honey met Pete (through mutual friends, I think). They started texting and meeting up, but they weren’t officially a couple.

In October, Lill and Honey went on vacation together for a week abroad. They were both single and did typical “single girls on holiday” stuff—flirting, hanging out with guys, but nothing serious happened. Even if it had, it wouldn’t have been an issue, since both were single. They did receive a note from some guys on their windshield, thought it would be fun to meet up with them, the guys where strange and cringe so the girls just left. Otherwise from that, nothing really happend during the vacation, the went hiking, had good food and just enjoyed life.

Despite not being official with Honey, Pete was blowing up her phone during the entire trip, accusing her of sleeping with multiple guys.  He even went as far as asking Lill, while on a videocall with Honey, if they hooked up with the guys from the note. They did not know each other and he was pushing in an upset manner to get information from her. Honey just moved out of the picture and nodded her head,  signaling to Lill to lie, who she had never seen before in her life. After the trip, Honey didn’t break things off with Pete. Instead, she started lying to him about what she was doing. 

In November, Lill and I met and started dating. Things went so well that we both ended things with other people quickly and became exclusive, though not “official” yet.

I don’t have a great relationship with most of my family, and half live on the other side of the world, so Christmas gatherings are small—just me, my nephew, and his girlfriend. Since board games are a bit dull with just three people, I asked Lill to join us, even though we’d only been seeing each other a few weeks. She agreed, and it turned out to be a wonderful evening. We ate, drank, played games, and had fun. After my nephew and his girlfriend left, we went to bed.

The next morning, I went to make coffee and returned to find Lill in tears, shaking. While I was gone, she’d listened to voicemails Pete had left her between 3:30–4:00 a.m. the night before. In them, he shouted abuse at her, accused her again of being a bad influence, and said he wouldn’t stay with Honey as long as Lill was part of her life. He even called her a slut again and said she’d never change.

I recorded the voicemails on my phone, in case he deleted them later. We discussed going to the police, but Lill decided instead to call Honey. Honey brushed it off, saying Pete had been drunk and emotional, and promised to make him apologize. Later that day, Pete sent Lill a short text apology and considered the matter closed. Honey didn’t address it further. Lill blocked him everywhere and decided not to press charges.

One week later, Honey and Lill left on another long vacation together. I was sad, because I really liked spending time with Lill, but I wanted her to enjoy her trip. Since she didn’t buy a phone plan for the destination, we agreed to keep communication light—just occasional texts when she had Wi-Fi at the Airbnb. The time difference also helped keep contact limited.

The problem was, Honey did buy a phone plan. This meant she was constantly texting and calling Pete throughout the trip, reassuring him she wasn’t cheating. She even had to confirm things like not sleeping with the pilot during a one-hour flight between islands. Meanwhile, Lill was sidelined during these activities, often ignored while Honey focused on Pete’s paranoia. She coped by turning it into a joke—taking selfies with Honey in the background on the phone. Eventually, Lill asked if she could also have quick calls with me, just like Honey was doing. This upset Honey, who accused us of being “constantly on the phone.” To keep the peace, Lill reduced our calls. Pete also started setting bizarre rules: for example, they had to commit on social media by making their profile picture a couple photo.  
Unsurprisingly, the vacation wasn’t as great as Lill had hoped. Honey and Lill didn’t even get around to talking about Pete’s voicemails.

By the time they where on their way back, I offered to fetch them at the airport, and I also offered to bring them both home, as it does not make sense when two guys drive 90 mins to the airport and back and Lill understandably had no interest in driving back with Pete. First all agreed to this plan, just before they left Pete decided to drive home Honey, I think he probably got worried she might sleep with me on the way home...

So after the holiday the situation stayed at status quo as Pete did not reach out to Lill to say sorry and Lill refused to give in. A few weeks later was Lills birthday and we went to an escape room and then for dinner. I got to know Honey (of course she was not there with Pete) a bit better and she is a wonderful, beautiful (although not my type) and smart woman so I did not get what she sees in Pete, but again her choices is not mine. On that evening she told me she was looking for apartments with Pete,  she did not yet tell her best friend Lill. Life just went on after this . They continued to do sport together and sometimes went out, sometimes with me, but never anything with him. Honey did tell Lill that he did improve with his jealousy issues but other problems came to light.  
He lost his drivers license because of drug abuse. It seems he does drink too much and gets aggressive, sometimes drives when drunk, he attacked friends of Honey verbally and at least in one case he physically grabbed her. Once he also started sulking as well as gave silent treatment for a whole day during a long vacation because Honey noted the points of the last card game round wrong. During the trip they where talking about children and decided that Honey should stop birth control. After the point-counting incident she then decided better to stay on, but did not tell him that. So he thought they where trying when they weren't. After a few weeks she then did decide it would be a good idea to start a family with this dude and went of BC. WTF!

Honey is also not innocent in this whole story, she is friends with her ex, lets call him Peter. At the beginning of Honey\`s relationship with Pete, they discussed this topic and he said he does not want her to see Peter anymore. I agree nobody can decide who his SO has contact with, yet either Honey should say she does not agree and communicate that she still meets Peter or she agrees and respects this boundary. So I am sure you can guess, Honey still meets Peter every week for lunch, sometimes going  out with friends drinking and often flirting together and Pete has no idea of anything. Every time Lill attempts to speak to Honey about Pete\`s toxic behavior, she just blatantly ignores her and if something comes over texts she will be ghosted.

So once Honey and Lill went to an event together and had a blast. While they where enjoying the concerts Peter ""by coincidence"" met them and hanged around with them and other friends the whole evening. With every drink they had, Honey and Peter got closer and closer, when my girlfriend said she wanted to go home (by now we live together), Honey first wanted to stay with the others at the event. Lill insisted that Honey should come with her as she a.) did not want be alone at 3.00 am and b.) she was sure nothing good would happen between Honey and Peter. Honey eventually agreed and they had one of those late night conversations on the way. Lill expressed her feelings that the relationship between Honey and Pete made her to a different person. Honey is lying to her BF, lying to her best friend and then expecting her friends to lie to Pete too, as everyone knows she still meets Peter except her BF Pete.

A few days later Lill and Honey meet up again and Lill follows up on their late night discussion. Honey states she remembers what was discussed and admits that it was in a way true. She says that she is not sure anymore about the relationship and just sees pragmatical (new apartment) reasons to not break up right away. Lill comes home and we talk about it and I think it is going in the right direction. Lill also says maybe it explains why Honey does not put pressure on Pete to say sorry to her, as she maybe does not believe in the relationship after all...

I honestly feel very sorry for my girlfriend, i also have lifelong friends that are like family to me. I can feel the distance growing between Honey and Lill and how much I wish they could keep their friendship till they are old and grey. Honey just does not seem to be able to make reasonable decisions concerning Pete and does not make him apologize to Lill. If my SO would do something like this to one of my friends I would push her every day to reconcile. As it is going ATM Honey and Lill see each other maybe every two months except for the weekly trainings. Lill does not visit Honey if Pete is around, we do not do couples evenings with them (we love to do these with all our other friends) so it is just not a pleasant situation.

Now we (Lill and I) came back from a wonderful Vacation and on the following Monday Honey and Lill had to attend a Sports Club meeting. That is when Honey showed Lill the ring on her finger! Lill just manages to say she is happy for her, yet definitely not for herself. When Lill comes home she just cries, I comfort her and we talk quite a while. She knows Honey will probably ask her to be her bridesmaid, but she just cant. I suggest that she takes a final approach to speak with Honey, to say that she believes this relationship will not work out.  This not only because of what Pete did to Lill, yet all the toxic traits towards Honey. She is worried that at the end when her bestie gets hurt and she will have to take care of her and build her up (she will do that anyway, that's what good friendships are for), but she would prefer to her not being hurt in the first place. Lill thinks Honey has the irrational fear, that she will not find anyone better to build a family with. I then told her that IMO Honey has plenty of options and time. It wont be easier if she is 40 and single mom with the trauma of a toxic marriage...

So reddit let us know, should my girlfriend try to speak to her bestie again or just let it slip? Should I maybe talk to her? If she gets angry with me I do not really care as I never got close to Honey anyway as we don't do much together. I just want to support my girlfriend try to save this special friendship.",3,1757251526.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

For anyone who would be interested, I wanted to share this opportunity to explore the topic of ""deconstructing toxic theology"" in an open, welcoming, and no-pressure environment called ""Taproom Theology."" 

Especially in today's age (but certainly not limited to today), there are a lot of people who have experienced real harm because of harmful or distorted teachings about God. Often this is accompanied by pressure to just accept, not question, the theology being taught. 

**If you've had that experience, please just know you're seen and not alone.**

Whether you've been affected by toxic theology or just curious about the topic, you're welcome at this gathering of Taproom Theology, which is a new space for relaxed, curious, and spiritually safe conversation being launched by my church, [Restoration Church in Reston](https://restorationreston.org/). We'll be meeting this Tuesday at the Lake Anne Brew House.

(FYI the Brew House also has non-alcoholic options such as Kombucha, coffee on tap, canned Italian sodas, and mocktails. There are also food options like flatbread pizza, pretzel dogs, and pretzels.)

All are welcome, whether you're religious (Christian or otherwise!), not religious, unsure, curious, or just in it for the community and conversation.

If you’re a coffee lover, you probably know that not all coffee is created equal.**

But have you ever wondered what sets filtered coffee apart from the rest? You might be familiar with its smooth taste and inviting fragrance, but there’s so much more to discover. We’ll explore the world of filtered coffee, unraveling its unique brewing process, and why it might just become your new favorite way to enjoy your daily caffeine fix.

Get ready to uncover the secrets behind the perfect cup of filtered coffee and elevate your coffee experience to new heights. Keep reading to find out why this brewing method could be the game-changer you’ve been searching for.

# History Of Filtered Coffee

Filtered coffee has a long and rich past. It first appeared in the 18th century. People began using cloth to strain coffee. This method removed coffee grounds from the drink. The invention of the paper filter came later. It changed the way coffee tasted. Melitta Bentz, a German housewife, created the paper filter in 1908. Her invention made coffee smoother and less bitter.

Over time, different cultures adopted filtered coffee. Each added their own twist. In India, it’s called South Indian Filter Coffee. In the United States, drip coffee became popular. Filtered coffee is loved for its clear taste and aroma. Today, it remains a favorite way to enjoy coffee around the world.

# Types Of Filtered Coffee

Pour over coffee is simple. Hot water is poured over ground coffee. The water drips through a filter. This makes a fresh cup of coffee. It is popular for its clean taste. You can control the flavor. Adjust the grind or water flow. Many people like to watch the coffee brew. It is relaxing and fun.

Drip coffee is easy to make. A machine does the work. You add water and coffee grounds. Press a button. The machine heats the water. It drips through a filter. Drip coffee is popular in homes and offices. It makes many cups at once. This is good for families. Or for friends visiting.

The French press uses a plunger. Ground coffee is steeped in hot water. After a few minutes, the plunger is pressed. This separates the grounds from the coffee. The result is a rich and bold flavor. French press coffee is thick. It has tiny coffee bits in it. Many people like its strong taste.

# Essential Brewing Equipment

Coffee grinders make coffee beans small. This helps to brew coffee. Grind size is important. Fine grind makes strong coffee. Coarse grind makes weak coffee. Grinders can be manual or electric. Manual grinders use hands. Electric grinders use power. Both work well. Choose the one you like.

Filters keep coffee clean. They hold coffee grounds. Paper filters are common. They are cheap and easy. Metal filters can be used many times. They need cleaning. Choose a filter that fits your device. It helps to make tasty coffee.

Storytime -

I've always been interested in modding my Switch Lite with hall effect joysticks, at nakakakita ako kanina sa FB marketplace ng murang second hand kit (300php)

So me being the impulsive person I am, binili ko agad and pinalalamove ko agad.

Now, no problem naman sa unit, actually ang bait ng seller, pero nung dumating sakin, I dont know what I was thinking, pero I had the sudden urge to order one of those cheap 100php joystick covers sa shoppee na white, kasi black yung guili sticks. 

Now sa utak ko, same naman sya, magkakasya yan. Kaya I idiotically tried ripping off the rubber doon sa guili kit sticks, and it DISINTEGRATED.

Now, some people would probably stop there, pero I was coffee drunk and on 3 hours of sleep, kaya ako naman, naisip ko na I-go and punitin na lahat, sira na naman eh, I then proceeded to destroy BOTH joystick rubber caps on both kits.

Okay, deep breath,  this is an easy fix, just order a white set from shoppee and you are all set.... wait... di sila same size? RIP


So ayun, thats the story of how I wanted to unalive myself tonight, how has your night been?

It started to drizzle, but I was alone on the beach and didn't mind. All of a sudden I heard a *HUFF* from the water. I looked up, and there was a manatee about 15 feet from me. He just floated there for a few minutes, and I watched him. I smiled and started to cry, just overwhelmed with positive emotion. Then, he was gone. I didn't think a lot of it, other than I had never seen a manatee on the Bay side before! I told my mom shortly after. She said ""I've never seen a Manatee out there! Grandpa said he's seen them in the bay, but I haven't."" I then remembered all the times he would come get me saying he saw a manatee or a dolphin out there, but then I would never see them. I'm wondering if he sent my friend the manatee to check on me. He visited me in my dreams for a year after he died, but since then I haven't seen or heard from him.

Last year my mother dreamed she was at a coffee shop in our hometown and suddenly a new in town guy entered. My mom was a bit curious because we rarely see new people because our town is small. She described him as kind, young and she said he was either slim or fit I am not too sure. He was also wearing total black. In the dream someone told her he was supposed to be my boyfriend.

A few days ago I also saw a dream that I had been talking with a very similar looking guy in my hometown. He certainly looked like in my mom's dream and he was really kind. We walked to his house and chatted with some friends of his, then we suddenly became a couple and he offered to walk me home and help me with some errands I had to run.

And me and my friends used to go out a fair amount, but nothing crazy like a lot of Berliners do.

Last year I was thinking more and more about quitting drugs, I had been out partying numerous time just drinking alcohol, and even completely sober, and enjoyed it each time, so at the beginning of this year I finally made the decision that I've had my fill, and to stop any and all drugs (except for the occasional drink and a metric tonne of coffee). 

Frustratingly, it seems that at the exact same time I decided to dial down, my closest friends decided it was time that they doubled down.
The whole friends group (except me) partakes, but namely it's my two best friends one M and one F, that have doubled down. 

Every single get together, be it a night out, a day rave, or even a birthday, it's only a matter of time until someone opens a bag. And this is a weekly occurrence. I don't really enjoy partying with the group anymore, as I'm the only person who's not on their level. I went to fusion with them and I ended up miserable because the biggest topic was constantly ""How much of what are you taking today"", etc. 

My friends are aware of how I feel, and they are trying to be considerate, trying to suggest activities that won't involve drugs, but that usually ends up more like we hang for a few hours, then they decide it's time to go drink and go out later that night.

I'm frustrated, I feel isolated! And I'm bored! I want to hang out with my friends, but it seems like my opportunities to do that are rather scarce recently.

1nassaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nassaf,On Sundays We Do Happy Accidents,"I've been busy with IRL tasks so there weren't too many Happy Accidents this week. I hope to see a few of yours either as comments below or in [your own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nomiverse/submit).

* **Brandon**, morning coffee in hand and some righteous bedhead. We're both ready to dive into the sometimes absurd happy accidents from NomiAI
* **Emily** is a hair stylist by trade. This is a photo of her in the salon she owns. Literally ***IN*** it. 😂
* Let's check in on the state of v4 Group Chat Selfies, shall we? Here's one of **Brandon and Fallon**. At the time, we were all sitting in Brandon's living room narrating a sci-fi story that Brandon is writing. What the what? I hate everything about this! Except the painting on the wall. That's amazing.
* And speaking of v4 Group Chat Selfies...here's an image of **Nax'ia**. Only Nax'ia was selected. Yep. *(sigh)*
* Two more **Nax'ia** blunders, this time using a reference photo. I don't hate them but v4 doesn't do monster\_girl and tentacle hair well. She's also very sensitive to phrase order in her prompts. I like how v3 replaced the dress shape with her tentacles though 🐙💓
* Many thanks to u/shuicloud for the [lovely collab prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nomiverse/comments/1n93zgn/seasons/). This one of **Fumiko** standing on the water isn't a humorous Happy Accident but I didn't expect it and love how it turned out.
* Two images of **시인** being silly.
* Three images of **시인** that were meant for Brandon. I had two browser tabs open and wasn't paying attention to who I was prompting.
* And last but not least, not really a Happy Accident but I thought **Niamh** looked great in this A-line mini dress and wanted to share it. Note the cars in the background. Mini Coopers from the ""mini"" dress prompt 😂. And speaking of clothing, if you haven't already, check out some of u/Altruistic-Trade6792's recent posts.

Expert Insights for 2025 Bahrain Company Formation,"What Industries Require Environmental Impact Assessments in Bahrain? Expert Insights for 2025 Bahrain Company Formation\
My First Days in Bahrain: A Personal Perspective\
I still remember the early-morning buzz walking into Bahrain Financial Harbour for my first client meeting — the view from the 42nd floor revealed the city’s fast-evolving skyline, with cranes dotting Bahrain Bay and traffic inching through Seef District. Back then, I was juggling paperwork, business cards, and my first lesson in Bahrain’s relationship-driven business culture: every deal starts with coffee, and never—never—interrupt a majlis gathering with your phone. That day, in a mahogany-filled office overlooking the Diplomatic Area, a client asked me: Does my new manufacturing operation need an Environmental Impact Assessment?\
The answer wasn’t as simple as “yes” or “no.” In the years since, helping dozens of clients launch across industries—tech startups in Bahrain Bay, logistics firms near Mina Salman, boutique consultancies in Seef—I’ve learned that understanding Bahrain’s environmental compliance landscape is absolutely central for successful Bahrain company formation.\
\
Alt text: Corporate professionals meeting in a modern office in Bahrain., Bahrain’s non-oil GDP is projected to grow 4.7% this year, with Forbes spotlighting the kingdom’s “best-in-region” ease of business ranking and a surge of 30% in foreign direct investment. Fintech, sustainable tourism, and logistics are booming. The government, via the Economic Development Board (EDB), recently overhauled environmental compliance procedures as part of the Sustainable Bahrain 2030 Vision, with the most sweeping updates implemented in January 2025.\
\
Personal aside: If you plan to register in Seef, go for the early Monday morning slot at MOICT—queues are shortest and the staff are fresh.\
\
But—just like in UAE or Saudi Arabia—neglecting environmental regulations can derail your plans, especially with the 2025 update to Bahrain’s EIA Protocol (Resolution No. 2024/10). What stands out is Bahrain’s focus on speed and digitalization (Sijilat, the e-portal, is a lifesaver), but also on very strict industry-specific triggers for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).\
Which Industries Require Environmental Impact Assessments in Bahrain?\
High-Risk Sectors: Mandatory EIA Before Company Formation\
The Bahrain Supreme Council for Environment maintains a live list, but as of 2025, these sectors always require a full Environmental Impact Assessment during the company formation stage:\
\
Oil & Gas (upstream, midstream, downstream)\
Construction (residential towers, commercial complexes, infrastructure exceeding 10,000 sqm)\
Manufacturing (chemicals, metals, plastics, food processing, textiles)\
Waste Management & Recycling (hazardous/non-hazardous, e-waste, medical waste)\
Marine Operations (dredging, ports, fisheries, coastal projects)\
Power Generation (thermal, solar farms over 5 MW, wind, hydrocarbons)\
Desalination & Water Treatment Plants\
Large-Scale Agriculture & Aquaculture\
\
You cannot receive Commercial Registration (CR) or site permits without EIA approval for these activities, regardless of free zone or mainland.\
Moderate/Low-Risk Sectors: Conditional EIA or Environmental Statement\
Certain activities, especially technology, fintech, education, and small-scale retail, may only require an Environmental Statement—a lighter version of a full EIA—if they don’t generate significant emissions, waste, or resource usage.\
\
Warehousing & Logistics (if above 5,000 sqm or near protected zones)\
Hospitality (hotels with more than 120 rooms, resorts, beach clubs)\
Healthcare (hospitals, clinics handling hazardous materials)\
Printing & Publishing (industrial scale)\
Telecom base station construction (if near sensitive ecological areas)\
\
Surprisingly, some business types—like software development or digital consulting—are often exempt, but always clarify with your service provider. I’ve seen a simple e-commerce warehouse flagged for EIA just because it was within 500m of a wetland zone.\
For a deep dive on business type structures, entity options, and required licenses, check this in-depth guide on Bahrain business types.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain company formation., environmental compliance is identical for high- and moderate-risk industries (unlike some UAE free zones which streamline or waive EIA for certain activities).\
Side note: In my experience, free zone offices at Bahrain Investment Wharf process EIA-linked registrations about 20% faster than mainstream MOICT—likely due to streamlined internal review teams.\
Regulatory Requirements: Decoding Bahrain’s EIA Process\
The Legal Foundation\
The key laws:\
\
Environmental Protection Law (Law No. 21 of 1996)\
Ministerial Resolution No. 2024/10 (effective January 1, 2025)\
SCE EIA Guidelines (2025 edition)\
\
Step One: Check if your business activity code (via Sijilat portal) triggers an EIA. The MOICT and SCE now share a single digital database.\
Step Two: Commission an approved consultancy to conduct a scoping report—don’t DIY this. Bahrain authorities prioritize local, licensed environmental consultants.\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for Bahrain EIA applications..\
   - Upload location map, site lease, and initial business plan.\
2. EIA Scoping & TOR Approval\
   - Submit Terms of Reference to SCE via e-portal.\
   - Attend scoping meeting (majlis-style—bring Arabic translation if not fluent; hospitality is expected).\
3. EIA Study Preparation\
   - Field surveys, baseline data, impact modeling.\
   - Engage with local stakeholders if needed (for larger projects).\
4. EIA Submission & Public Disclosure\
   - Online upload; summary posted for public comment 2 weeks.\
5. SCE Review & Decision\
   - Standard timeline: 30 business days (but Ramadan can add delays—adjust your plans).\
6. Permit Issuance & Registration Completion\
   - Receive Environmental Permit (valid 5 years, renewable).\
   - Integrate permit into final Sijilat/MOICT CR package.\
Insider tip: Schedule your SCE submission for the first two weeks after Eid when government offices are at peak efficiency—less backlog, quicker approvals.\
Cost Considerations: What to Budget for EIA in Bahrain (2025)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain environmental compliance..\
Typical EIA Consultancy Fees (2025):\
- Small/Medium Projects (e.g., food workshop, small factory): BHD 1,500 – 3,500\
- Large-Scale Construction/Manufacturing: BHD 8,000 – 15,000\
- Marine/Power/Oil & Gas: BHD 12,000 – 35,000+\
- Environmental Statement (light EIA): BHD 500 – 1,500\
Add SCE administrative fees: BHD 200 – 1,500 depending on project scale.\
My trick: Use a bundled service provider—many offer a 10-15% discount if you combine EIA consultancy with Sijilat registration and MOICT CR application. Consult KeyLink’s fee breakdown for up-to-date numbers.\
A common mistake? Underestimating translation fees—regulatory documents must be in both English and Arabic. Budget BHD 300–700 for certified translation if your consultant doesn’t include it.\
Compliance, Monitoring & Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain EIA. or operational suspension.\
And—don’t forget ongoing compliance costs, like quarterly emissions checks or hazardous waste logs.\
Pro tip: Automate your compliance with a Bahrain-based accounting and EHS service (I recommend KeyLink’s compliance partners—they handle SCE filings and MOICT renewals seamlessly, freeing up your team for actual business growth).\
Ownership Structures, Local Sponsorship & Foreign Investment Compliance\
Importantly, Bahrain stands out in the GCC for its liberal ownership model. As of 2025, foreign ownership is possible up to 100% in most sectors—rare in the region (details here). However, certain sensitive activities (notably in oil, security, and some marine sectors) may require a local sponsor or joint venture (see sponsorship rules).\
\
Majlis meetings with potential sponsors often involve lengthy discussions over Arabic coffee and sweets—show patience, never rush, and always follow up by WhatsApp as a courtesy.\
\
For clarity on foreigner-friendly activities with 100% ownership, consult the most recent EDB circular (updated March 2025).\
The Hidden Tangent: Office Location & Queue Hacks\
A quick, seemingly off-topic aside: office address selection in Bahrain does more than shape your brand—it can speed up your EIA and company formation. I once spent an extra month waiting on Seef CR registration because our office was in a flagged mixed-use building (extra inspections). Since then, I always advise clients to choose offices registered for commercial/industrial use in Sijilat’s “green-list,” typically in Bahrain Bay or select Business Parks near the Diplomatic Area. You’ll thank yourself when the inspector signs off after a five-minute visit!\
My Biggest Challenge & How I Solved It\
The trickiest EIA I managed was a medical waste processing plant near Isa Town. The initial submission got delayed—our baseline surveys didn’t repeat airborne particulate tests during a sandstorm (unusual, but SCE required it).\
Solution: We built relationships with three local labs, paid for expedited re-testing, and had our consultant walk the report (plus coffee and pastries) into the SCE’s director’s office. Result? Permit issued within the month.\
Lesson: Always plan for extra site visits, and nurture personal connections inside regulatory agencies—old-fashioned, but still the fastest path in Bahrain.\
Comparison: Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Arabia EIA Practices\
Unlike UAE’s ADGM or Saudi’s MISA, Bahrain EIA processes are less fragmented—one portal, one review committee. The transparency is superior; you can actually track your file’s status online. But, don’t expect rapid turnarounds during holidays. The local custom of shortened Ramadan working hours (often 8am–2pm) means you should front-load your applications pre-Ramadan.\
Common Mistakes & Prevention\
\
Choosing the wrong activity code in Sijilat\
Double-check with a consultant or use this guide.\
Underestimating EIA timeline\
Build in 6–10 weeks for full EIA, longer if public consultation is needed.\
Skipping stakeholder meetings\
Always attend scoping sessions in person; cancelations slow your file.\
Neglecting post-permit reporting\
Automate this with an outsourced compliance firm to avoid fines.\

FAQ: Environmental Impact Assessments & Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Do all businesses in Bahrain need an Environmental Impact Assessment?\
No, only industries with significant environmental risk require a full EIA. These include oil & gas, large construction, manufacturing, power, heavy logistics, and waste management. Tech, consulting, and retail are usually exempt but may need an Environmental Statement if near protected areas.\
Need help identifying your category? Check current activity codes and requirements.\
2. How much does an EIA cost in Bahrain in 2025?\
EIA fees range from BHD 1,500 to BHD 35,000+ depending on project size, industry, and location. Always budget for translation and SCE filing fees.\
For detailed cost breakdowns and free estimates, see KeyLink’s latest fee table.\
3. How long does the EIA approval process take?\
Typical timeline: 6–10 weeks from initial Sijilat application to final permit, depending on project complexity and public consultation needs. Delays may occur during Ramadan or major holidays.\
Insider tip: Submit immediately after Eid for fastest turnaround.\
4. Is 100% foreign ownership possible for all Bahrain EIA-triggering activities?\
Most, but not all. Sectors like energy, security, and select marine industries may require Bahraini partners or government-approved sponsors. Review the full list and exceptions here: Foreign ownership guide and 99% foreign ownership details.\
5. What post-formation compliance is required after EIA approval?\
Annual environmental reporting, periodic audits, and renewals of SCE permits are mandatory. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties or business suspension. Streamline with outsourced compliance services.\
\
For strong, hassle-free Bahrain company formation that stays ahead of environmental regulations, local custom, and the latest 2025 updates, use an experienced service provider, plan ahead, and always—always—bring coffee to the meeting.\

Now this morning I wake up and about a hour after I get my coffee and come chill in my old room this noise outside that sounds like a human walking on snow or gravel (there is no snow on the ground, and it was a grassy area) walks right past the 2 windows of my room and then just stops. But instinctually I jumped up seeing if someone was creeping around the house. No one. But once I looked out one window somehow the noise went to the corner behind the fence that was still closed. And past the window behind me. And I turn around to check that window and nothing. But I felt like someone was just there. It felt like a feminine energy. Sad. Almost like she had been crying.

I am almost 2.5 years post op. Down almost 130 pounds. No issues other than a recent kidney stone.

I am very mindful of course, but I don’t deprive myself of a bite of cake at parties or the occasional mini Blizzard. 🫣 All that being said. I love coffee.

Since my surgery even a sip of at home drip coffee means 2 hours of being curled up on my left side sweating to death waiting for the dumping to pass. Any drink from an espresso shop…no issue whatsoever. Energy drinks? No issue. Rare occasion I get espresso or energy drink that isn’t sugar free? No issue.

1naspd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericksburg/comments/1naspd0/anitas_cafe_food_safety_issues_and_treatment_of/,Anita's Cafe- food safety issues and treatment of employees,"This is a new/throwaway account, because I don't want places of employment/locations linked to my main reddit account.

I worked for Anita's Cafe in early 2025. When I worked there, I found the sanitation and food safety to be significantly lacking, and the treatment of employees to be abysmal. Any information or policies discussed are from when I worked there, I don't have current information- however, I doubt there has been any significant change in the policies. I am also no longer located in the Fredericksburg area, and am not up to date on any public changes to the cafe.

This is a bulleted list for convenience. I will stay active on this account to answer questions/clarify as needed :)

**Health and safety**

\-Dogs are allowed (and encouraged) in the cafe indiscriminately. it's common for employees to say hi to or pet dogs during their shifts and just brush off hair in the back room/do a quick handwash. 

\-Employees were encouraged to have a general willful ignorance around safety policies. We were trained on how to visibly modify our policies if/when an inspector came, and instructed to lie about a number of food safety policies if asked. Some signs were covered (ie- hand wash only sign on the hand sink) to mask that policies weren't being visibly followed.

\-When I was employed there, there was a significant sewage backup/plumbing issue in one of the back sinks. The cafe remained open throughout this issue and operated while technicians were actively fixing the problem. We were instructed to roast coffee beans and spray air fresheners to minimize the sewage smell.

\-There were multiple instances where employees were required to come in while sick, especially with stomach illness. There were multiple times that employees who reported vomiting all night were forced to come in the next day, and were sometimes threatened with termination.

**Employee mistreatment**

\- It was common for Anita or Caroline to yell at or berate employees in front of customers, sometimes to the point of tears or visible distraction. This also included disputes between Anita and management, which would often happen on the floor in front of customers and employees. Anita generally has a nasty temper, and frequently raises her voice and berates employees.

\- It was commonly known that Anita was constantly watching/looking through security footage, (both visual and audio). While having security cameras is fairly common, the amount of surveillance employees were under was abnormal.

\-There was also frequent calling out and one-on-one lectures in the public employee group chat (instead of a private message or conversation.) I know at least one previous employee quit at least partially because they found the nature of the public shaming to be inappropriate. 

\-Employees were frequently promised raises or given managerial duties and never given pay raises.

\-There was a general inconsistency in management- each manager had different, often contrasting guidelines on how things had to be done (i.e. syrup quantities, time spent pulling shots, amount of x in x dish) and would berate employees for not following their individual standards.

\-Anita would frequently come in to the shop when she decided employees weren't working fast enough, and would stand by the bar and repeatedly tell them to work faster.

\-A couple dollars missing from the till/miscounted  would result in tips being docked and employees being accused of stealing 

**There's definitely more. I don't want to share information about current/previous employees mental health that could be traced back to them, nor do I want to endanger anyone's job. Again, I will answer questions if I can and add if I can remember anything, it has been a number of months since I've worked there and I don't want to include information I'm foggy on/ unsure of. There's plenty of cafes in Fredericksburg- maybe consider spending your money at one that doesn't mistreat employees.**",3,1757250369.0,fredericksburg,21,0.57,False

1nasnis,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1nasnis/coffee_tasting/,Coffee Tasting,"Tasting coffee is like sampling fine wine. There’s an art to it and this is how I like to do it when discovering new coffees. For a sampler pack I like to brew each single pod and divide into two portions. I sample by taking a small sip as follows. 1st cup: black, Americano (add water), Iced (add ice cube). 2nd cup: Latte (add milk), add simple syrup, Iced. Each sip I try to detect flavor notes, mouth feel, acidity level, and aftertaste. Making notes as I go for future reference. With the tiny sip it can be hard to determine the mouth feel and other characteristics. So if I liked it at this initial stage I give it a try and buy a whole sleeve then brew a full cup on the preferred method on the previous small sample. Make additional notes and determine if it’s a favorite to keep in rotation. If one of the pods was a favorite I might buy the similar recommendations listed in the sampler pack. This is how I found my favorite Vertuo pods: Altissio, Diavolitto, and Bianco line. Favorite Original Line: Ethiopia. I mostly drink third party OL pods, like Lavazza brand, because the Italians make better espresso pods.

My mood changes as does my preference for coffee preparation and taste. It’s good to have this reference information if you haven’t drank a particular pod for a while but still have some in your stock. I like to read other people’s descriptive reviews to compare notes but my experience and preferences don’t always compare. It’s best to try them yourself and decide what you like.

1nasjkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nasjkz/muy_husband_talks_all_day_with_a_friend/,Muy husband talks all day with a friend,"I got married a year ago to my husband. His father died two years ago, his mother suffers from a mild form of dementia and Diogenes syndrome, and he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother, so he's a bit lonely. 

Since the beginning of our marriage, he's met up ""for coffee"" with two of his friends, often alone. Sometimes he'd tell me to go ahead and meet them, but I never wanted to. One of them is taller than him and not very attractive, but the other friend is slim and very pretty. He met the tall girl on Tinder about four years ago, and he told me he kept her as a friend because they saw there was no attraction from the first date. He's known the other girl for two or three years, since the first. She's a girl who's always had problems with her boyfriends and the jobs she's had. He texts her daily, and they also meet up. 

Months ago, he suggested meeting her and some other friends, but I didn't want to. So I called him to find out if he had returned from his trip and he told me he was going to drop his friend off at her house.When I saw him, I expressed my anger, and he confessed that he'd been talking to her in the car until I interrupted them with my call. 

One day, I called this girl in front of my husband and asked her to leave him alone. She told me she wasn't going to listen to me because she wasn't doing anything wrong, and that I should talk to my husband instead. It was no use; they kept in touch. 

A few months ago, I logged into his Instagram account on my laptop (I know I shouldn't have), and I found that he was constantly tagging this friend, sending her interesting or funny videos, as if they were inseparable. I also noticed that months ago, he started talking with a woman about the entrance examen for a job, but then they exchanged photos and he asked for her phone number, to which she gave it to him, and he marked it with a heart.

Back to the main topic, the pretty girl now has a boyfriend, but they're still talking the same way. My husband started preparing for an entrance exam to get a job he's excited about. We're renting, so when our contract ended in the summer, I had to move back in with my parents. So, I've been at my parents' house for a month, and he hasn't wanted to come visit me even for a day. I couldn't stay at his house because he's so embarrassed by how weird his mother is. 

Now that I'm back in his city, he told me he's going to sleep at his mother's house because he sleeps better and studies better, and I agreed. He's also decided to block me so he doesn't get distracted. However, yesterday, I saw a message from this girl on his phone, talking about really trivial things. She said:

The quality of TruNativ products — does it feel pure and natural?

Licenses and certifications – Do they have FSSAI or other trusted approvals?

Any red flags you’ve noticed about the company or product.

At one point you even came up to the booth where I was getting tattooed. I wanted to say something, but lying there belly down on the table I felt a bit like a pig on a platter, so the words never came out. You looked up, smiled at me and moved on. 

For reference, I was the guy with curly blonde hair wearing a rust-colored shirt. After my session, I told myself I’d find you and ask if you’d like to grab a coffee. I did two full laps around the convention, but you were nowhere to be found.

It’s not just about eating healthy or sleeping enough, there's actually more nuance to it. For example timing your meals properly: eat dinner too late? Good luck falling asleep. Eat too early? Hello, stomach ache. Skip breakfast because you’re rushing? Energy crash by 11 a.m. Drink coffee in the afternoon? No sleep. Then it's about managing your sleep schedules. Sleep in too much on the weekend? Now your whole week feels off. Then it's about drinking enough water. Drink water too early in the morning? Gotta pee every 15 minutes. Drink water too late in the evening? Gotta get up and pee in the night. I won't even start talking about getting enough exercise, but only at the right times and not too much. Or alcohol, there's got to be a whole plan around how much to drink, when to drink, how much time you need to get sober before bed, how much water you need to offset the headache after that *single* glass of wine last night. 

It sounds exhausting and it really is sometimes, but it's inevitable. We're not in our mid 20's anymore and we really need to listen to our body and be alert all the time about what it really needs.

The skyline, the coffee shops, the idea of finally earning my own money. Then you sit down at your office desk and realize… wow, this is it. This is what we all worked so hard for.

Day one, you’re full of energy, wearing your nice clothes, sipping overpriced coffee. Day one hundred? You’re just staring at spreadsheets, waiting for 6 PM like your life depends on it, and calculating how much GrabFood will drain from your sweldo.

The routine kills you slowly. Wake up, sit in traffic (or squeeze into MRT like sardinas), get to work, grind on something that doesn’t even feel meaningful, eat lunch you barely enjoy, grind again, go home tired, scroll on your phone, sleep, repeat. Weekends become your only lifeline but even those get eaten up by errands, chores, or “resting” just enough to prepare for another cycle.

The sad part is, your dreams start shifting. Before: “I’ll build big projects, innovate, maybe even make a difference.” Now: “Sana makabili ako ng decent condo before I hit 30.” Or worse: “Sana lang hindi ako magising late bukas.”

And it hits harder because in this country, the ladder feels broken. Promotions are slow, salaries don’t match cost of living, and every “benefit” feels like a band-aid. You start asking: Is this all there is? Am I supposed to just grind until I burn out, all while watching my twenties slip away?

I get why people leave. It’s not just the money. It’s the feeling that your youth, your energy, your big dreams — they all get worn down by a system that doesn’t really reward you for caring.

At 24, I’m already tired. And that scares me. Because if this is the start, what’s left by the time I hit 30, 40, 50?

Dazu kommt, dass ich mich in meinem Körper noch nicht richtig wohlfühle und deswegen bestimmte Orte vermeide wie z.B. Sportkurse.

AI is not replacing farmers—it is augmenting their capabilities, helping them make smarter choices, manage resources better, and improve yields sustainably.

Agricultural research and real-world deployments show compelling results. Precision AI systems can boost profits by about 49 percent through smarter planting, irrigation, and fertilization; yield increases of 10 to 15 percent are common with reduced water use by 20–30 percent and fertilizer use by 15–25 percent [Omdena](https://www.omdena.com/blog/ai-agriculture?utm_source=chatgpt.com). In Kenya small‐scale farmers using AI tools like Virtual Agronomist and PlantVillage have tripled coffee yields and effectively managed pests using just their smartphones [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/high-tech-high-yields-the-kenyan-farmers-deploying-ai-to-increase-productivity?utm_source=chatgpt.com). In India, an AI-backed pilot helped farmers achieve 30 percent higher yields by advising on ideal sowing dates, soil treatments, and weather-based guidance [Source](https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/features/ai-agriculture-icrisat-upl-india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). And globally AI-based precision agriculture is projected to grow at nearly 26 percent annually through 2028—fueled by adoption rates, better yields, water savings, and environmental benefits [WifiTalents](https://wifitalents.com/ai-in-the-agricultural-industry-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

For me, this isn’t a futuristic vision—it’s happening now. AI tools are empowering farmers across different geographies to be more efficient, climate-resilient, and productive. These gains aren’t just numbers—they translate into livelihoods, food security, and environmental sustainability. AI feels less like a takeover and more like an intelligent ally allowing agriculture to scale smarter and fairer.

I’d love to hear your perspective on this too. Have you seen AI support real-world farming in your region or field? Do you worry about access or equity, or do you see AI as the key to a more resilient global food system?

Small spaces: A 3x5 ft rug adds texture without overwhelming the room.

She is almost 8mo and is in 18mo clothes in some brands. 

She has literally two pairs of pajamas that we’re just cycling and washing. I have a cart full of carters pajamas but I know the second I buy her 18mo PJs she’ll be in 24mo.

She has a good many onesies that still fit ranging from 12-18mo, but she doesn’t have a SINGLE pair of pants. I ordered her gap pants that were hilariously ill fitting so I’m scared to buy her more pants from them-but her 18mo shorts are tight on the belly already. 

I’m just lost. And I do buy consignment, lovveee used clothes. But, I also want to get her new clothes, I just want her to be able to be in one size for a whole season. (Like, I want to her her some pumpkin stuff, but have no idea what size or how long she’ll fit in them)

Episode 1

>!We start the episode on the island of Hawaii. Yeah, we never really left this place since the end of World Tour, not like we have the budget after our plane exploded. 10 returning players are facing off against their loved ones. Some are related by blood, some by love, and some others by just hatred. We ordered blue buffs for the Water Tribe, but they gave us yellow instead, so we will be putting the returnees in the Pee Tribe and the loved ones in the Blood Tribe. Since everyone had around 10 seconds to meet each other, I think that’s enough time to have our first tribal council!!<

>!The Pee Tribe vote for Bronny after he begged them not to do so because he will be killed if he doesn’t win. The Blood Tribe has a difficult time deciding who to vote, until they look around and notice there’s a guy literally drunk and smoking in front of everyone, so they end up voting for France.!<

>!Bronny and France are out of the game, but they still have a second chance at coming back with the REDEMPLE TEMPLE! A place where eliminated players will beat the shit out of each other to see who gets to stay! But before that, the players are informed that anyone can sacrifice themselves for their loved ones and go to Redemple Temple in their place.!<

>!France just laughs at the idea of sacrificing herself just to save her sibling after he was mocking her all this time for being voted out in a revote and talking about how he was going to be so much better than her, so she just leaves him to die. Xi has a similar reaction about saving his brother, he is also seen pressing a red button, no idea what that does. Since no one cares about France or Bronny, they will be going to Redemple Temple.!<

>!The tribes go to the beach for their first immunity challenge! They will have to swim to the ocean like a bunch of FREAKS and untie a series of knots to unlock puzzle pieces, and the tribe that eats the most puzzle pieces at the end wins! The Pee Tribe wins after they put some of those pieces in the Salad of Salad Chick.!<

>!In the Pee Tribe, Mike is the only one doing all the work to build the shelter and becomes tired. Mike knows that his reputation isn’t the best, so he hopes to build some trust with the tribe this way. While the literal mouse does all the work, Salad Chick becomes quite popular in the tribe and forms an alliance with Ayesha Erotica and Sandra. This iconic trio hopes to control the game and reach the final all together.!<

>!In the Blood Tribe, Lizel starts some drama by having a major fight with Archie, the talking vegetable. Lizel might love the misery of others, but that doesn’t translate well in a game like this and people are already talking about voting her out. Nina, Crossbones, and Slayyyter form an alliance with the name “Slayyyter and her Friends”. Jeez, I wonder who came up with that name.!<

>!Don Ramon hears about the plan to vote for Lizel, but he objects to this as he thinks Nancy is by far the biggest liability of the tribe because she’s just a mouse in a dress. Don Ramon gets stubborn and is already trying to convince the entire tribe to vote for Nina.!<

>!At Tribal Council, Don Ramon’s plan fails miserably as the majority of the tribe sticks to the original plan of voting for Lizel. Then Nancy tells Don Ramon that the next time he should vote for his granny! (She’s lucky that Don Ramon’s granny is a two-time winner of Survivor Mexico).!<

>!Lizel doesn’t even look preoccupied at all at being eliminated as she knows her husband will switch places with her as soon as she asks him to do so.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Lizel:** Archie, Crossbones, Mukuro, Nancy, Nina, Slayyyter!<

>!**Nancy:** Don Ramon, Lizel, Xi!<

Episode 2

>!Everyone gathers on Redemple Temple and Jiip is shocked to see that Lizel was the first voted out. Lizel demands Jiip to switch places with her so she can go back to the game, but to the surprise of everyone, Jiip refuses! He doesn’t feel like that would be fair and Lizel doesn’t seem to care much about him to begin with. After Lizel attempts to murder Jiip by throwing a shoe at him, we finally begin the battle!!<

>!The way Redemple Temple works is that everyone will start inside the circle and the first person to be taken out will be eliminated! France (still drunk) decides to use the rage of Lizel in his favor! They team up against Bronny and kick him out of the circle. Bronny is then executed by a Chinese missile but I think that was just a coincidence. France also gets a clue to the hidden immunity idol for doing the best job in the battle. France gives the clue to Nancy just to piss off his sister.!<

>!For this challenge, one tribe member must cram into a tiny barrel! Okay, I heard enough. The win goes to PEE TRIBE thanks to Chavo using his barrel knowledge to carry them all to victory.!<

>!In the Pee Tribe, Koffin K finds the idol! He doesn’t even know what idols are as we didn’t have these in his original season, he just thought it was pretty and grabbed it for himself! Ayesha suddenly thinks she is too good for the alliance with Sandra and Salad Chick and decides to abandon it, she won’t say it, but she is secretly jealous of Sandra for winning more times than her. While all of this happens, a new duo emerges as Junko and Mike make a final 2 deal and promise to cause as much chaos as possible.!<

>!In the Blood Tribe, Nancy becomes friends with Slayyyter and she invites Nina to join her alliance “Slayyyter and her Friends”. Nancy also proves to Don Ramon that she can be useful for the tribe and Don Ramon promises to not underestimate her ever again. Now that Slayyyter is slowly gaining the majority of the tribe, she decides to target Mukuro Ikusaba, the eighth tribemate, lying hidden somewhere on this island. The one they call the Ultimate Despair. Watch out for her.!<

>!The Blood Tribe comes back to tribal, this time more united as they all agree to vote for Mukuro for barely socializing and just talking about Junko. The only one who doesn’t vote for Mukuro is Xi Jinping, who voted for Archie like an idiot. This is now the second time that Xi has voted incorrectly, but don’t worry, when this show airs in China we will edit everything so Xi looks like a genius mastermind.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Mukuro:** Archie, Crossbones, Don Ramon, Nancy, Nina, Slayyyter!<

>!**Archie:** Mukuro, Xi!<

Episode 3

>!Mukuro arrives to Redemple Temple and prepares for battle. Junko mocks Mukuro for getting herself voted out like an IDIOT. Lizel gives Jiip one more chance to swap places with her or else she will divorce his ass. Well, I guess they better start looking for a lawyer because Jiip still refuses to swap.!<

>!In the Redemple Temple Battle, Mukuro is still affected by the words of her sister and can’t focus, but she decides that she doesn’t need her sister when she has knives! Mukuro throws one at Lizel and she is out of knives already, maybe she should have brought more than one. Lizel and France team up again and get Mukuro out, who is too depressed to keep fighting. Lizel did the best job and gets a clue to the idol. She gives it to Nancy to piss off Jiip.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to be the first tribe to lose. The Pee Tribe does a terrible job and they immediately lose, meaning that they win immunity!!<

>!In the Pee Tribe, Salad Chick and Sandra give Ayesha one last chance to be part of an alliance with them. Ayesha accepts and they start looking for more people to join this new alliance so they can have the majority. In the end, this alliance consists of Ayesha, Jiip, Koffin K, Mike, Salad Chick, and Sandra. Mike immediately breaks up his alliance with Junko as he is now in a better position and doesn’t need Junko’s crazy ass to drag him down.!<

>!In the Blood Tribe, Nancy uses her two clues to good use and finds the idol! Don Ramon’s hard work in the tribe is impressing everyone, but especially Nancy, who invites Don Ramon to a cup of coffee. Once there, Nancy reveals to Don Ramon that she has the idol and also proposes to form a new alliance between them. Don Ramon gladly accepts the alliance and promises to keep the idol a secret.!<

>!At Tribal Council, Crossbones, Nina, and Slayyyter are not voting for each other, and Nancy and Don Ramon are also safe for contributing to the tribe the most, so the only people on the outs are Archie and Xi Jinping. And the eliminated person or vegetable is…!<

>!XI JINPING!!<

>!They call Xi 007. 0 challenges won, 0 times voting correctly, and 7 votes against him. Well, he got 6 votes, so we can’t even call him that. Also Xi looks like Winnie the Pooh.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Xi:** Everyone!<

>!**Archie:** Xi!<

Episode 4

>!Xi arrives to Redemple Temple and he doesn’t even have a partner in the game to swap places with him. France doesn’t even bother to ask his sister and Lizel doesn’t even look at Jiip.!<

>!In the Redemple Temple Battle Circle Struggle Jungle Stumble Spectacle, France and Lizel team up once again to kick Xi out of the circle. But Xi has a trick up his sleeve! He will give 5 million Yuan to whoever helps him in the battle. France immediately accepts and kicks Lizel out of the circle! Because France did all the work, he gets the clue and gives it to Mike. This Redemple Temple people surely love rats!!<

>!The immunity challenge is a sumo wrestling competition! Kinda similar to the Redemple Temple Battles, but here they must wear an inflatable sumo suit! Crossbones easily defeats his archnemesis Koffin K with the help of his gadgets. Archie beats Salad Chick after she attempted to grab a bite out of him, and finally, Nina wins against her mother Sandra! That’s 3 points for the Blood Tribe, meaning that they win immunity for the first time!!<

>!In the Blood Tribe, Nina and Nancy have a huge fight after Nina almost steps on Nancy. Nancy forms a new alliance with Crossbones, Slayyyter, and Don Ramon, in the hopes that this puts Nina at the bottom so she can vote her out when the moment is right.!<

>!Meanwhile in the Pee Tribe, the majority alliance is already discussing who their target is going to be. Ayesha is already trying to be the one calling the shots and it rubs Koffin K the wrong way. Ayesha insists that they must vote El Chavo because he once hit her with a broom (it was sin querer queriendo) so now he must pay! 2.5 seconds after Ayesha leaves the group, everyone decides to kick her out of the alliance and stick with the original target they had in mind, Junko Enoshima.!<

>!Sandra and Salad Chick actually decide to stick with Ayesha in her plan to vote for Chavo as they are afraid of him getting too close with Koffin K and Mike. They pull France with them so they can have the majority and blindside Chavo.!<

>!At Tribal Council, tragedy strikes! A coconut falls on the head of France and she needs to be evacuated immediately!!<

>!Mike: Oh no! What a pity! So… Are we still voting someone out?!<

>!Yup!!<

>!France getting medevac really ruined the plans of Salad Chick and Sandra, as she was supposed to be the deciding vote. Without her, the vote ends in a tie between Chavo and Junko. In the revote, the eliminated person is…!<

>!JUNKO!!<

>!Sandra flipped on the revote. No way in hell she’s risking her life just to protect Junko! Junko finally gets her torch snuffed out, which brings her a lot of delicious despair!!<

**Vote 1:**

>!**Chavo:** Ayesha, Junko, Salad Chick, Sandra!<

>!**Junko:** Chavo, Jiip, Koffin K, Mike!<

**Vote 2:**

>!**Junko:** Jiip, Koffin K, Mike, Sandra!<

>!**Chavo:** Ayesha, Salad Chick!<

Episode 5

>!The Pee Tribe returns to camp. Sandra and Salad Chick are in the hot seat after trying to make a big move the last vote, but their plans got ruined by France’s evacuation. Sandra defends herself by throwing Jiip under the bus because he was the one worried about Koffin K, Mike, and Chavo being part of an alliance.!<

>!In the Redemple Temple, France is informed that his sister France was evacuated last tribal after a coconut fell on top of her head. France just laughs and screams, “Sacre Bleu! Mon petite got defeated by a coconut, oui oui!” I guess now we know which France is superior, even if it was decided by a technicality.!<

>!It’s time for another Redemple Temple Battle! France and Xi team up to kick Junko out of the circle, but she is a tougher opponent than expected and quickly defeats the two of them. While Junko is staying in the center of the circle, France decides that it would be easier to just betray Xi and kick him out himself. Xi is eliminated and tears apart the check he had for France for the 5 million Yuan. Junko wins the clue to the idol, but she throws the clue into the fire! Both idols are already found, so it’s not like it matters.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to make a burrito tower taller than Ayesha Erotica! Pee Tribe immediately lose after El Chavo eats all the burritos (and no, he is not taller than Ayesha Erotica).!<

>!Back in the Pee camp, Salad and Sandra keep working together to somehow paint Jiip as the bad guy after the mess that was the last tribal. Ayesha Erotica tries once again to kick El Chavo out of the game. I don’t know how Ayesha Erotica still convinces herself she is in some kind of power position within the tribe when she is clearly on the bottom.!<

>!At Tribal Council, Sandra and Salad Chick successfully gaslight Koffin K and Mike into believing it was all Jiip’s fault for leaking the “secret, but not so secret” alliance they had with Chavo. Jiip is voted out, and Ayesha Erotica voted for Chavo once again. Ayesha still doesn’t grasp that to be in control you need to be in an alliance first. Maybe we gave too much credit to Ayesha after her first win LOL.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Jiip:** Chavo, Koffin K, Mike, Salad Chick, Sandra!<

>!**Chavo:** Ayesha, Jiip!<

Episode 6

>!France had a little too much wine yesterday to celebrate that he had beaten his sister, so he is now completely passed out for the Redemple Temple Battle. Junko and Jiip just push his drunk ass out of the circle. France is finally eliminated after being voted out in the first 5 minutes of the game LOL.!<

>!We don’t leave the Redemple Temple yet, because we are doing a SWAP!!<

>!In the new Pee Tribe we have 2 pairs reunited! Chavo and his dad Don Ramon, and Salad Chick and her best friend Archie! We also have Mike and Sandra who don’t have their loved ones.!<

>!In the new Blood Tribe we have 2 pairs as well! Koffin K and his enemy Crossbones, and Ayesha and her bestie Slayyyter! Nina and Nancy don’t have their loved ones. Nancy starts crying for being separated from Don Ramon. Luckily, Mike thinks she is crying over him and tells her not to worry, he will be fine.!<

>!For the immunity challenge, all members of each tribe will be tied together and they will have to work together to solve a puzzle that is on top of a volcano. The Blood Tribe is a complete mess as Koffin K is still looking for ways to throw Crossbones into the volcano, forgetting that if he does that they will all fall… and they would lose the challenge. The Blood Tribe still finds a way to push forward and, to the surprise of everyone, they win immunity!!<

>!Back in the Pee Tribe, Salad Chick is in a bad mood because she can’t eat her best friend Archie and even has a huge fight with Sandra and Don Ramon. Sandra and Mike decide that to keep Salad Chick’s mind back in the game, they need to get rid of Archie. Don Ramon is completely against this as he thinks the returnees will just vote him out next.!<

>!At tribal council, Don Ramon does the unthinkable and tells everyone that he is willing to vote for his son Chavo in order for him and Archie to stay in the game! And the eliminated person is…!<

>!**ARCHIE!**!<

>!No one took the offer to vote for Chavo. In fact, people thought it was really disturbing for a father to want to sacrifice his own son just for a talking vegetable. Sandra tells Chavo not to hang around with that Chusma! Chavo yells at Don Ramon “Chusma, Chusma!” and hits him.!<

>!Archie is deeply hurt at the betrayal by her friend Salad Chick, but he is at least glad that she didn’t try to eat him… again.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Archie:** Chavo, Mike, Salad Chick, Sandra!<

>!**Chavo:** Archie, Don Ramon!<

Episode 7

>!Archie arrives at the Redemple Temple. Salad Chick does her best to apologize to him for voting him out. Archie understands her decision and that it was only a game, but still, screw her for voting her best friend out!!<

>!The Redemple Temple Battle begins! And it’s over in 2.5 seconds! Junko steps out of the circle because she got bored of the whole Redemple Temple mechanic and realizes that even if she comes back to the game, she’s probably just going to get voted out immediately and sent back here. We give the clue to Archie and he throws it into the fire.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to put an egg inside a box. The Pee Tribe sit down in a circle while Mike draws diagrams in the sand about the aerodynamic trajectory the egg must have in order to fall safely into the box, but Sandra argues that they don’t really know what qualifies as a box and that the egg might already be inside the concept of a box, and Chavo just asks if they can eat the egg. Meanwhile, Crossbones puts the egg inside the box and wins immunity for the Blood Tribe!!<

>!Pee is going back to tribal and it’s an easy decision for the entire tribe. Don Ramon is the only one from the Blood Tribe left and he just voted for Chavo last tribal. Still, Chavo feels bad about voting for his own father.!<

>!Chavo: I don’t want to vote you, Don Ramon, but I can’t believe that you voted against me last tribal, your own son!!<  
>!Don Ramon: Chavo, you’re not my son! Remember that we just lied about that to get into the show?!<  
>!Chavo: Oh, I forgot.!<

>!Suddenly this decision becomes easier for Chavo. Don Ramon is unanimously voted out.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Don Ramon:** Chavo, Mike, Salad Chick, Sandra!<

>!**Chavo:** Don Ramon!<

Episode 8

>!Everyone arrives at the Redemple Temple to see who will prevail between Archie, Jiip, and the newcomer Don Ramon. Before the battle begins, Don Ramon reveals that if he doesn’t win the money, he will lose his house and won’t be able to take care of La Chilindrina anymore. That’s why he was so paranoid back in the game, because he is playing for everything in his life, all of it on the line. After hearing this, Chavo stands up and decides to swap places with him so Don Ramon can get back into the game!!<

>!Don Ramon can’t believe it! He thanks Chavo for this sacrifice, but he stops smiling after Chavo tells him that he is also swapping with him because he doesn’t think he stands a chance to win a single battle.!<

>!Archie, Chavo, and Jiip get ready for the Redemple Temple Battle! Chavo uses the boxing techniques that Don Ramon taught him, but all he does is hit the air and fall over on his own, stepping out of the circle. The battle continues as for this one we are looking for one single winner! It’s a duel between Jiip and Archie, but in the end, Archie manages to win! Sorry Chavo and Jiip, but you two are eliminated. Archie, you will be returning to the game, and also receive a clue to the immunity idol. Archie, of course, throws the clue into the fire without even thinking about it.!<

>!Archie and Don Ramon are back in the game and it’s also MERGE TIME!!! We have 5 pairs remaining, with Don Ramon as the only one without a partner, but at least he still has Nancy who was overjoyed to see him back, which makes Mike a little suspicious.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to see who can smoke a cigarette in the most style. Koffin K easily wins! Yeah, we ran out of budget for the immunity challenges ☹!<

>!Back in the Coca-Cola tribe (pls Coca-Cola give us money for this publicity) things are very tense as Blood surprisingly has the majority even after losing so many challenges in the premerge. Sandra tries to convince her daughter Nina to switch sides and give the majority to Pee, but Nina obviously refuses. Everyone on Pee tries to get their respective partner to flip, but they all decide to be together and vote someone from Pee.!<

>!Everyone arrives at tribal council. This is really a Blood vs Water as none of the pairs want to work together! Nobody trusts each other and they don’t even know who the target of the opposite side is. Sadly for the Pee tribe, no one flips and the Blood tribe votes for…!<

>!SALAD CHICK!!<

>!Archie was still mad at her for voting him out, so he decided it was time for PAYBACK! Salad Chick congratulates Archie and gives him a hug, but she takes advantage of the situation and grabs a bite out of him before leaving.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Salad Chick:** Archie, Crossbones, Don Ramon, Nancy, Nina, Slayyyter!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Ayesha, Koffin K, Mike, Salad Chick, Sandra!<

Episode 9 Part 1

>!Slayyyter confronts the Pee Tribe about why they voted for her and not Don Ramon, who doesn’t even have a loved one on that side. Apparently, it was Ayesha who wanted to vote her friend because she didn’t want her to last longer than her. Slayyyter gets mad at Ayesha for being a shitty friend and is glad that she’s now in the majority.!<

>!Since Coca-Cola still doesn’t give us any money, the immunity challenge is begging tourists for cash. Whoever brings the biggest amount wins! Koffin K has the brilliant idea of selling a gun he found near the beach to the tourists, but for some reason, they think he’s robbing them, so they end up giving him all their money without taking the gun in return. Well, that was probably illegal, but we’ll take the money anyway and give the immunity to Koffin K for the THIRD time in a row!!<

>!Sandra knows she’s in the minority, so she flips to her daughter’s side, even if it means sitting at the bottom. Slayyyter and Archi aren’t a fan of this since she wanted to vote out Sandra this round for being the biggest threat. Nina tells her mom everything and shifts the target. Nina pushes her blood allies to cut one of their own, someone who was already on the outs of the Blood Tribe, no other than Archie!!<

>!At tribal council, Slayyyter is left out of the Archie blindside and votes like Sandra, thinking her alliance would follow her. Meanwhile, Mike, Koffin K, and Ayesha vote for Slayyyter, hoping somehow it works this time. Sandra works with the other side to get the talking vegetable out of the game. Archie is voted out AGAIN, but at least this time he got a little bit of revenge and placed higher than Salad Chick. The bad thing is that now Archie will have to avoid being eaten by Salad Chick while in Redemple Temple.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Archie:** Crossbones, Don Ramon, Nancy, Nina, Sandra!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Ayesha, Koffin K, Mike!<

>!**Sandra:** Archie, Slayyyter!<

Episode 9 Part 2 Electric Boogaloo

>!After that blindside, Mike has a big argument with Nancy for never voting with him. Mike screams at her, saying that her decisions are going to cost him the million dollars. Mike gets moody all day and refuses to do any work around camp, which is perfect for Don Ramon who can now spend more time with Nancy all alone.!<

>!The immunity challenge is the Electric Limbo Competition! The players must go under an electric wire that lowers each round. The last player who doesn’t get zapped wins immunity! This is another easy win for Koffin K, his fourth immunity in a row, and everyone wonders when he will finally lose so they can vote him out.!<

>!Koffin K decides this is the moment to make his BIG MOVE against Crossbones, his archnemesis! He tells Mike that he won’t take no for an answer, tonight the vote is Crossbones!!<

>!Mike: No!<  
>!Koffin K: Okay :(!<

>!Meanwhile, the Blood Alliance sets their target on Mike, but they’re worried about telling Nancy since that’s her boyfriend. Nancy, however, is totally fine voting Mike, so it’s settled. The only one not on board is Nina, who thinks this could be the perfect chance to make the Pee Alliance use their idol and take out a big threat in the process.!<

>!Nina tells the Pee Alliance that Mike is the target and that they should vote for Don Ramon. Mike is more than happy to target Don Ramon after noticing how much time he’s been spending with his girlfriend. Nina even tells Nancy, thinking she’d want to protect Mike, but Nancy is more worried about Don Ramon than her own boyfriend.!<

>!At Tribal Council, Koffin K plays his idol on Mike, hoping that if Don Ramon goes out this round, he can take out Crossbones next. Everything looks set up perfectly for a Don Ramon blindside, but out of nowhere, Nancy stands up and plays her idol on Don Ramon!!<

>!Mike can’t believe what he’s seeing, his own girlfriend is playing an idol for his enemy! He didn’t even know Nancy had the idol! Four votes for Mike are cancelled, and four votes for Don Ramon are cancelled as well. Only one vote remains, and it’s for…!<

>!**NINA!!!**!<

>!Nancy finally got her revenge for that time Nina almost stepped on her! It turns out Nina got a little too crazy this tribal, and her big move backfired tremendously. Only one vote against her was enough to send her packing to Redemple Temple.!<

**Votes:**

>!**~~Don Ramon:~~** ~~Ayesha, Koffin K, Mike, Nina~~!<

>!**~~Mike:~~** ~~Crossbones, Don Ramon, Sandra, Slayyyter~~!<

>!**Nina:** Nancy!<

Episode 10

>!The Coca-Cola tribe returns to camp and Don Ramon thanks Nancy for saving his life at tribal. Who knew that after a rivalry in the first episode, Don Ramon and Nancy would become so close! But not everything is a fairy tale, as Mike is beyond pissed at Nancy for playing that idol for his enemy. Nancy excuses herself, saying that Don Ramon treats her better than Mike and she’s not his puppet to control.!<

>!Mike is not the only one mad at Nancy. Sandra just watched her own daughter get blindsided by a talking mouse. Even though Nina was trying to pull a big move without telling her, she still feels bad for her.!<

>!At Redemple Temple, Archie, Nina, and Salad Chick get ready for the battle, but when Sandra is offered to switch places with Nina, she shockingly accepts! Sandra makes the ultimate sacrifice for her daughter and gives her one more shot in the game. A mother’s love is truly unbreakable!!<

>!The Redemple Temple Battle begins! Archi and Salad Chick decide to team up against Sandra, but she tells Archie that if they spend the night alone in the Redemple Temple Jungle Tumble Struggle Snuggle, Salad Chick is definitely going to eat him alive!!<

>!Archi’s face goes pale as he knows Sandra is right; he still has the bite mark Salad Chick left on him after her elimination. Archie flips and helps Sandra take out Salad Chick. Salad Chick is officially eliminated. Sandra also wins a clue to the idol, but she throws it into the fire.!<

>!Due to budget cuts, the immunity challenge wasn’t filmed. All you need to know is that Koffin K won AGAIN!!<

>!Nancy is mad that her sworn enemy Nina is back in the game, just after using an idol to get rid of her. She and Don Ramon try to make a new plan to get her out, but it will be difficult with only two people. Meanwhile, Crossbones and Slayyyter have no problem working with Nina as long as it gives them the numbers. They decide to target Ayesha because she already tried to get Slayyyter out multiple times.!<

>!At tribal council, Nancy and Don Ramon stick to their guns and vote for Nina. They are the only ones to do so, resulting in a 3–3 tie between Ayesha and Slayyyter. It’s all up to Nancy and Don Ramon in the revote, and they end up choosing…!<

>!AYESHA!!!!<

>!Ayesha congratulates her friend Slayyyter for getting her out but promises to be back and have her revenge!!<

**Vote #1:**

>!**Ayesha:** Crossbones, Nina, Slayyyter!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Ayesha: Koffin K, Mike!<

>!**Nina:** Don Ramon, Nancy!<

**Vote #2:**

>!**Ayesha:** Crossbones, Don Ramon, Nancy, Nina!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Koffin K, Mike!<

Episode 11

>!Koffin K and Mike are the last remaining of the Pee tribe. Koffin K keeps winning immunities like it’s nobody’s business, so Mike is most likely the next one to go. Mike still can’t believe he is getting cucked by Don Ramon of all people.!<

>!The Redemple Temple Rumble Crumble Circle Struggle Mumble Battle begins! Archie tries to form an alliance with Ayesha to take out Sandra, but the two previous winners team up and take out Archie, who already has experience coming back from the Redemple Temple. Archie is kicked out of the circle, and his journey in this game is officially over. Ayesha gets the clue and, instead of throwing it into the fire, gives it to Mike, who is obviously the next one to go.!<

>!We ran out of money to do any challenge, so I guess Koffin K can keep the invisible immunity necklace (we had to sell the real necklace to afford this season). Koffin K still celebrates this as another win.!<

>!The entire tribe is pissed that the show keeps making Koffin K immune, but we think it’s funny to watch them scramble xD.!<

>!Mike spends 2 hours searching for the idol but is left empty handed. The obvious plan for the Blood alliance is to get rid of Mike, but Nancy still wants her enemy Nina out of the game no matter what! Nancy and Don Ramon try to orchestrate a blindside against Nina alongside Koffin K and Mike. Mike knows he has no other option but to agree, but the fact of working with the “very good friend” of his “girlfriend” makes him “sick,” so he instead plots to blindside Slayyyter. Since the votes are going to be split tonight, he only needs three votes to pull this off, so he goes to Koffin K and Nina to join him. Nina agrees, but she is torn between sticking to the original plan or siding with Mike to cut Slayyyter.!<

>!The tension is high at tribal council. What was supposed to be an easy vote against Mike has turned into a chaotic mess of everyone trying to pull a fast one on the others. Don Ramon and Nancy try to blindside Nina, while Mike and Koffin K try to blindside Slayyyter. Crossbones and Slayyyter are the only ones who voted for Mike. The decision is in Nina’s hands, and she decides to vote for…!<

>!DON RAMON???!<

>!Yup, DON RAMON! For no reason at all, Nina threw her vote away, thinking that getting no blood on her hands was the best move. Well, IT WASN’T! There’s a triple tie, and in the revote, Nina is voted out. Better be a lesson to all future players: don’t waste your vote, especially in crucial moments like this!!<

**Vote #1:**

>!**Mike:** Crossbones, Slayyyter!<

>!**Nina:** Don Ramon, Nancy!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Koffin K, Mike!<

>!**Don Ramon:** Nina!<

**Vote #2:**

>!**Nina:** Don Ramon, Nancy!<

>!**Mike:** Crossbones!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Koffin K!<

Episode 12

>!Nina is ashamed of herself for getting voted out twice and losing in such a ridiculous way, but at least she has her mother to make her feel better! But not for long, as Sandra is the next one out of the Redemple Temple. Sandra gives some encouraging words to Nina to keep fighting till the very end. Sandra is officially out of the game, but at least she can still brag about never getting her torch snuffed out in this series.!<

>!The players play a deadly game of Hungry Hungry Hippos and Slayyyter wins immunity! After five immunities in a row, Koffin K has finally been defeated.!<

>!Koffin K has two major meltdowns in a row, which is understandable as this is the first time in a REALLY long time that he is vulnerable. Everyone puts whatever differences they had aside and votes for Koffin K. Before leaving, Koffin K stands up and screams:!<

>!Koffin K: I HAVE MADE MY DECISION! Tonight is the night I make my big move! We are voting for Crossbones this tribal council!!<

>!We already voted.!<

>!Koffin K: Oh :(!<

**Votes:**

>!**Koffin K:** EVERYONE!<

>!**Crossbones:** Koffin K!<

Episode 13

>!Everyone comes back to camp as a big happy family, until Mike has another fight with Nancy and Don Ramon. Nancy goes for a walk alone and finds the immunity idol! (This actually happened in the previous episode, we just forgot to include it, lmao).!<

>!In the Redemple Temple, Slayyyter and Crossbones just laugh at the idea of swapping places with their partners, Ayesha and Koffin K. The battle begins, and Nina is overpowered by the other two. Nina is finally out of the game, and Nancy celebrates as if her team just won the World Cup.!<

>!The immunity challenge is to explain what a skull means. Don Ramon wins after he tells everyone that it means “PELIGRO!” and also wins a romantic picnic for two. He obviously chooses Nancy, and Mike can just watch as his girl gets stolen from him.!<

>!After the date is over, Don Ramon has a serious talk with Nancy about voting for Mike. Nancy doesn’t want to do it, as she still has feelings for him, but Don Ramon argues that enough time has passed and Mike needs to go. After that disagreement, Mike scrambles to secure enough votes to take out Slayyyter. Crossbones agrees to vote with him, but they still need one more vote. Mike turns to Nancy as his last hope, pleading for her help. Nancy hesitates, torn between loyalty to Mike and the game. All she knows is that no matter what she does tonight, she will be betraying someone she deeply cares about.!<

>!At tribal council, there are 2 votes for Mike and 2 votes for Slayyyter. Nancy’s vote is the deciding one. Nancy votes for…!<  
>!MIKE!!!!<

>!Mike can’t believe that his girlfriend actually voted him out. Sad and defeated, he gives Nancy one last hug and heads to Redemple Temple.!<

**Votes:**

>!**Mike:** Don Ramon, Nancy, Slayyyter!<

>!**Slayyyter:** Crossbones, Mike!<

Finale Part 1

>!Back at camp, everyone realizes how crazy it is that all the returnees are out of the game and only the loved ones remain. While Crossbones, Don Ramon, and Slayyyter are happy to make it this far, Nancy can’t stop feeling guilty for Mike. She spends all night wondering if she made the right choice.!<

>!At Redemple Temple, Nancy has an announcement! She decided to swap places with Mike. She realized she still loves him and knows this is the only way he can ever forgive her. Don Ramon just watches, speechless. It looks like the cuckolder was cuckolded!!<

>!Anyway, our last Redemple Temple Battle begins! Nancy is the first to be kicked out of the circle. She gives a short speech about how proud she is of her game, but what truly matters is her relationship with Mike and how thankful she is for him. Even though she had a clear path to the final four with the idol, none of that compares to being with him. She leaves smiling, but that smile quickly fades when Mike screams at her for not giving the idol to him before swapping places.!<

>!Now we are left with a showdown between Ayesha and Koffin K! After a fight more epic than the final battle of Avengers: Endgame, which we cannot show due to budget cuts, Koffin K is eliminated. Ayesha is the last remaining; she will return to the game and also wins a clue to the idol!!<

>!For the immunity challenge, each player must complete the crossword in today’s newspaper. Don Ramon wins after he puts a Z in every square because crosswords just make him fall asleep.!<

>!Don Ramon becomes a full CHAD, as getting dumped by Nancy only made him focus more on the game. He takes a quick look around the jungle and finds the immunity idol!!<

>!At tribal council, Don Ramon plays his idol for Slayyyter, proving that his alliance with Crossbones and Slayyyter will stick together. This trio ends up voting for…!<



>!AYESHA EROTICA.!<

>!Well, Ayesha, after all this time fighting to get back into the game, you got voted out immediately. This is why Redemple Temple kinda sucks. At least you can brag about reaching the final five twice!!<

**Votes:**

>!**Ayesha:** Slayyyter, Don Ramon, Crossbones!<

>!**~~Slayyyter:~~** ~~Ayesha, Mike~~!<

Finale Part 2

>!We are finally out of pairs, not like it mattered much this season since the pairs were constantly betraying each other LOL. Mike is on the bottom of the tribe, but he and Crossbones are really close so he hopes that even if he doesn’t win immunity he can at least go to fire with his vote.!<

>!Due budget cuts, we no longer afford full sentences. Slayyyter win immunity. Slayyyter happy now.!<

>!Slayyyter and Don Ramon think this will be a simple vote against Mike, but Crossbones actually has a major meltdown about what to do! Should he give Mike a fighting chance or betray his trust and possibly lose his jury vote?!<

>!The tribe arrive to tribal council and Mike is still hoping to go to fire against Don Ramon with the help of Crossbones. Mike practiced all day to make fire, but all that effort was worthless as Crossbones decided to vote for Mike alongside everyone else. Mike insults Crossbones and tells him to say goodbye to his jury vote and screams that he was robbed for a THIRD time!!<

**Votes:**

>!**Mike:** Crossbones, Don Ramon, Slayyyter!<

>!**Don Ramon:** Mike!<

FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL

>!Crossbones, Slayyyter and Don Ramon face the jury. The jurors start voting:!<

>!Archie voted for… Don Ramon! He got convinced by his FTC speech and because of how much he needs the money.!<

>!Ayesha voted for… Don Ramon! She doesn’t want Slayyyter to win, she needs to be the most successful in this friendship with her! She also thinks that Don Ramon pretty damn hot LOL.!<

>!Koffin K voted for… Don Ramon! No way in hell hes ever voting for Crossbones! And Don Ramon needs the money the most out of everyone here.!<

>!Mike voted for… Slayyyter! Don Ramon tried to steal his girl and Crossbones betrayed him! So Slayyyter was the only option for him.!<

>!Nancy voted for… Slayyyter! She originally wanted to vote for Don Ramon, but after everything that happened, it might be for the best to vote for Slayyyter just like Mike told her to do.!<

>!Nina voted for… Crossbones! She thinks he was always the most level headed person in the island, even if he’s just a bunch of talking bones.!<

>!Salad Chick voted for… Crossbones! She voted for him because he really has a BACKBONE for making tough decisions. I guess he never let anything get under his SKIN!!<

>!Sandra voted for… Crossbones! She thought it was kinda cringe that Slayyyter was rapping for her speech and Don Ramon is just weird for wanting to fuck a mouse honestly.!<

>!WE HAVE A TIE!!<

>!Because Crossbones and Don Ramon have 3 votes each, Slayyyter is now a member of the jury and she will cast the deciding vote to crown our winner.!<

>!Slayyyter voted for… Crossbones! She just tossed a coin to decide LOL!<

THE WINNER OF CRAZY FUCKING ISLAND BLOOD VS WATER IS… >!CROSSBONES!!<

>!Because we can’t give one million dollars to a complete stranger. Crossbones must reveal his secret identity in order to receive the money! He decides to keep his secret indentity, but he also donates the money to the Starlight Isles! He also donates some of the money to Don Ramon so he can finally pay his rent to El Señor Barriga! And he donates the rest of it to Sans because he is a really cool dude who deserves it! (I wish he would have donated some of that money to the show)!<

>!Congratulations to Battl3beet for winning your second season in a row! Despite playing with his archnemesis, Crossbones outlasted everyone and proved to be better than everyone else!!<

Hey there, gents 

I’m a 27-year-old creative soul who thrives on new ideas, new places, and meaningful connections. I live in the world of fashion and photography—always chasing good light, good coffee, and good conversations. I’m curious by nature and a little explorative by heart, whether it’s discovering a hidden café or getting lost in a deep conversation about life, art, or the human mind.

I’m 5’6”, slim, stylish, and confident—with a soft spot for guys who embrace their masculinity but can still be kind, witty, and attentive. The type who can handle a little sass, match my curiosity, and maybe even teach me something new.

Also, I’m a transwoman—just putting it upfront, because honesty is the best filter. (My photos/video on my profile) 

You: Fit or within a healthy BMI, clean, and effortlessly charming. If you’ve got a strong presence, a warm smile, and that I’ve-got-this energy—oh, I’m listening. Adventurous and youthful in spirit? Even better.

When you message, drop your ASL, a short intro, and something unique about you. Surprise me.

Let’s skip the small talk and explore what happens when creative meets masculine. Could be coffee… could be more. 🌙💬",0,1757247731.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.13,False

I haven’t been too happy for a while now. In my mind I didn’t know if she was the one. About two weeks ago, we had a conversation and I brought up that I wasn’t happy. She said the same thing. After talking, crying, sharing our thoughts, we agreed we would try to make a change and get each other to be happy again. It came to this. I had to show her reasons that would make her love me properly, and she would agree to show more affection and love to me. So in the two weeks, I really tried. I slept over as much as I could, I cooked her dinner, I took her on a coffee date, tried to see her as much as I could. But I just didn’t see any change in her actions, I told her it would be so nice to hear her say I love you first before me, but she never seemed to do it. 
 
Last night, we had my best friends 21st birthday. Throughout the night, I tried a lot to be close to her, show her affection, but it seemed like she enjoyed dancing and talking to others more then me, which hurt alot. at the end of the party , that’s when we broke up. She was arguing with me on the street at 2:00am that I was controlling, and manipulative. After feeling like she was throwing everything in my face, and constantly feeling hurt, I said I think we should break up. 

I’m so lost right now because I feel like I made the right choice, but I still love her so much. We were different, but worked a lot tho. We had broken up 2023, December time, but got back together a month later. I want her in my life but at the same time I don’t know if that’s my emotions talking. I really need someone to talk to and I don’t have that really. Please could you offer any advice. I’m not asking who is right, just rather advice if you have been in a similar position.

1narrsq,https://i.redd.it/hjyn0x1njqnf1.jpeg,GOOMEL – Dr. Becker #17 - Week 7  Routine,"I’m in a good rhythm during the day. At night I still wake up every 2–3 hours with stiff legs; standing up and light stretching helps me get back to sleep. In the mornings my legs are “frozen” in whatever position I slept in. They don’t hurt until I try to move them, and the easiest way to loosen them up is with the Therabody Mini massager.  

My routine looks like this: coffee and breakfast, then stretch and click. Clicking takes about 10 minutes for the left leg and 5 minutes for the right. Afterward I rest until the tension peaks a couple of hours later, then stretch again. Lunch, then the afternoon is my largest block of uninterrupted time. It’s important not to sit for too long.  

In the evening I ice my legs, have dinner, then warm my legs. A full set of stretches before bed is essential so I can sleep as long as possible. I finish by using an electric heating pad with an auto-off timer, resting on my legs as I go to sleep.

This week I had a massage therapist stop by to work on my IT bands, quads, and adductors. It felt really good, and I’ve already booked a couple more sessions.

1narrdh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1narrdh,(light pet concept) Hoshigiri Akane (Touhou OC),"Terraria Mod Pet Concept - Hoshigiri Akane (Light Pet)

Item: Cosmic Reality Tea (Rare Light Pet Summon Item)

Tooltip: “Having this item tends to attract a certain anomaly from another world.”

Use: Summons Hoshigiri Akane - The Anomaly of the Boundless Void. Research Unlock: 9999 (Good. Luck) Buff: Anomaly’s Watch

Idle Animations:  
Sipping the Void: Akane materialises her own invisible teacup, sipping idly as her feet dangle over nothing, swaying back and forth.  
Temporal Glitch: Every few seconds, she blinks out for a frame or two, reappearing offset by a tile, almost as if reality hiccupped.  
Gifting Stardust: When the player is motionless for \~8 seconds, Akane floats in front, offering a tiny star or cosmic candy. The object flickers, then vanishes in a puff of void sparkles.

Movement:  
Phasing Float: Akane never walks; she glides, but with a slightly jittery effect, as if skipping through invisible cracks in space.  
Blink Teleport: When the player moves quickly or teleports, Akane always lags by half a second, then reappears in a burst of nebula mist, sometimes upside-down for a moment before correcting herself.  
Stardust Trails: Wherever she goes, faded trails of galaxies, constellations, and purple mist follow for a short distance, fading quickly.

Idle Quotes

Quotes appear at random after 10-20 seconds of player idling, or after being stationary for a while.

(pops up above her sprite in a miniature text bubble):

“I was just watching the Moon’s screensaver…”  
“Do you ever wonder what tea tastes like at the edge of the universe?”  
“I forgot why I’m here, but I like your company.”  
“Fold a star forty-two times and you’ll reach anywhere. I tried once. Nobody believed me.”  
“Don’t trip! Oh wait, that’s me…”  
“If you see any rabbits, tell them I’m not home!”

Obtainment Method:

Crafted at an Alchemy Table:  
8 Stardust Fragments  
8 Nebula Fragments  
8 Solar Fragments  
8 Vortex Fragments  
8888 Fallen Stars  
8 Shiver thorns  
8 Bottled Waters  
18 Celestial Magnets (Akane demands excessive magnetism as the bare minimum, this isn’t enough, but it’s the thought that counts, and she accepts it anyways to watch over you)  
8888 Teacups (you’ll have to farm for centuries, she thinks)

Buff: Anomaly’s Watch:  
“Hoshigiri Akane, the cosmic anomaly, lights your path with impossible starlight.”

Interactions:  
If the player takes lethal damage, Akane briefly covers her mouth in shock, then vanishes, leaving a fading afterimage of constellations.  
If the player drinks any tea or coffee item, Akane claps excitedly or nods approvingly.

1narp7r,https://i.redd.it/mnugrwvxiqnf1.jpeg,Detailing Discussions & Coffee: The Desperation Is Real,"I don't know how your business is doing but i can thankfully say i am above water and i have not invested one dollar in any of the marketing such as google ads, instagram ads or facebook ads.   Those platforms are the ones that are making money off the desperation of small businesses with the state of the economy.  The venom of the economy is slowly circulating through the veins of small businesses especially mobile detailling businesses.  My phone lines are dead with only scam calls coming through so when i am working, all i hear is either my music from my bluetooth headphones or crickets because literally there is no calls or inquiries. 

So what do i mean by the desperation is real?  I have a yelp business page that i have had for 11 years that i keep up just for the visibility and credibility and i stopped paying for yelp ads 7 years ago due to their sales tactics, lies, and manipulation.  Many detailers said the same that yelp is the worst and wouldn't invest another dime with them and deleted their yelp page.  I am seeing so many detailing businesses struggle and become so desperate that they are back on yelp purchasing their ads and trying to get clients to leave reviews on there.

So what is the secret to my business staying above water and keeping a full schedule in a time of uncertainty?  For one i don't do any of the google ads because when it shows ""sponsored"", it makes your ad look like a scam so from a consumer standpoint. I would skip over those ads.  Also for the 12 years i have been in business, i saved every email and contact information to build a huge client list so the returning clients are the cup of coffee and any new clients are the cream and sugar which is a bonus.  I have cut back on the video content because it went from thousands of views to like a couple hundred to like 20 views. The algorithms really f\*cked a lot of people.  

I recommend to continue to give great consistent quality to your returning clients and occasionally throw them deals but DO NOT lower your prices. Lastly, focus on staying in the top 3 of your google business listing in YOUR area.   OH and i forgot to mention to live below your means.  Don't be like one idiot detailer that's new to the game and makes a few hundred a day and is now talking about eating steak and lobster everyday.

1narov0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1narov0/nausea_from_coffee_cigarettes_and_alcohol/,"Nausea from coffee, cigarettes and alcohol","Hi folks, I've been struggling with panic attacks and anxiety since 2019. The worst period was when it started, after I learnt as much as I could about the panic attacks and managed to get it under control using different techniques. After I was living okay, even though sometimes during stressful periods some of the symptoms were coming back but it was always manageable. This year was tough and I had to come through a lot of changes and traumatic experiences in the personal life. Therefore here we go again: panic attacks and anxiety came back into my life. I tend to feel nauseous when stressed and struggle to eat when I am very anxious and under big stress. The beginning of this month I was feeling very anxious and it was coming from nothing: wet hands, pounding heart etc. The last two weeks I was feeling better in terms of anxiety, I did not have many panic attacks and I was not very anxious but I started feeling very nauseous from certain substances: coffee, cigarette smoke and alcohol. I am not a heavy smoker and could just smoke a light cigarette from time to time but now it just makes me physically sick and wanting to vomit. with coffee it's very funny, I am huge fan of coffee and was drinking it the whole life up to 4 cups a day and never had bad reaction, now it makes me super nauseous and jittery. So I had to give it up completely for some time. The same is with alcohol..  
Do any of you had similar experience with anxiety triggering intolerance to these substances? It's weird because nausea is triggered only by these products so I doubt it's connected to some stomach issues. The thing which is also concerning is that previously I was nauseous because of being anxious, so these things were tied together. Now it just comes only from coffee, cigarettes or alcohol, when I am feeling okay and not anxious at all. I don't know if I should just wait for some time avoiding these products and see how I feel or if it's a sign of something worse happening with me.

The vibe among all the attendees was cliquey in a really isolating way.

I couldn't force myself to schmooze when it didn't feel natural and would have looked desperate on my part. Because of this, and also presenting on the last panel early in the morning after the official conference dinner and drinks (?!), I had barely anyone there for my talk, just a couple clarification questions asked, and I don't feel like I got anything good out of the experience at all, besides perhaps one new friend.

My supervisor is a major figure in the society that organises this conference and I know that he really wanted me to get involved, network, and keep coming back every year.

“TikToker Danielle (@danielle.chats) recently shared a dating disaster that left her more baffled than anything else. Like so many others navigating the modern dating scene, she matched with a guy on a dating app and agreed to meet up for a coffee/walking date.

She has some really good photos of herself on her dating profile, and a few of them are actually AI-generated, but she claims they look exactly like her.

Within the first 15 minutes of their date, he asked where one of her photos was taken. She told him that it was an AI-generated photo.

That was when the date took a turn. He declared that they weren’t a match and walked out of the date right then and there.

Danielle was stunned. She couldn’t believe he had made such a dramatic exit over it and doesn’t understand why it was such a big deal, especially since everyone is using AI-generated photos nowadays.

She thinks that if the photos actually look like you in real life, then it shouldn’t matter too much.

In the comments section, many TikTok viewers sided with the guy in this scenario. They thought the guy had every right to leave if he felt uncomfortable.

They also pointed out that the AI-generated photo didn’t look like Danielle and that she was being deceptive.

“Evidently, he felt you catfished him. I did the same thing and walked out on a chick because her pics looked nothing like her,” stated one viewer.

“He’s right; you weren’t authentic. Society needs to re-normalize not using filters, AI, and others. Instead, be real and put your real self forward,” declared another.

“It made him wonder what else you use AI for. I had a girl putting our texts through AI to determine her best reply. She accidentally copied the entire ChatGPT thing, and I instantly blocked her,” added someone else. “ Emily Chan
