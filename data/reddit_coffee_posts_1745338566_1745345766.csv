1k5db2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1k5db2b/how_to_sit_down_and_study_for_hours/,How to sit down and study for hours,"Studying is a refined skill that takes time to cultivate, I want to explore with you the common obstacles that people face and what you can do about them.

# If It’s hard to digest:

One of the following reasons may behind why it’s hard for you to go through the material:

**It’s not well explained**:

Look for other sources for the topic you’re trying to learn. There are countless videos, free courses, and AI tools that can provide alternative explanations, which might make a concept click for you.

I studied engineering in the past, and some YouTube channels taught the material better than some of my teachers, now ChatGPT can do it even better.

**You skipped the basics**:

If it feels like they’re speaking another language or you consistently go back and review previous definitions, concepts, rules, etc then you need to properly review the basics. You might think you’re saving time by skimming over things, but your brain needs a solid jumping-off point to connect the dots. Without that foundation, the material will feel like it’s slipping though your fingers.

Yes, I know, who wants to review the basics for the second, third, or fourth time, right?

**Lack of focus:**

Even the simplest concepts can be hard to understand if you’re not focused and present. You may think you’re focused, but it wouldn’t hurt to check.

How often do you get interrupted, and by what? If you can’t go a single hour without being interrupted, you need to address the cause of the disruption, try to minimize or get rid of noise, get your phone in another room.

Not being exposed to the stimulus is much easier than being exposed and resisting the impulse to give in.

You weren’t thinking about a pink elephant before reading this sentence but now try not to think about it.

# If it’s unpleasant:

Studying can sometimes feel like a lose-lose situation, you need to study for hours every day, ignore all the good and fun things around you, and barely make a dent in your grades, or you can simply play video games for 4 hours and it won’t affect your grade that much.

This is where discipline comes in. Discipline isn’t about finding some inner motivation to propel you through the pain. Let’s be honest, you probably won’t feel that motivated until the night before the test.

What you can do today is willingly expose yourself to a counterintuitive, unpleasant, unrewarding activity at small scale.

Even 10-15 minutes will do.

The only condition is to do it at least three times a week. Yes, it will feel like a lose-lose situation. The good news is you *can* do it, and your tolerance will improve over time.

# If you’re tired

Let’s go over the basics that we consistently ignore:

If you spend most of your time staring at a screen, your eyes will feel tired and strained. If you do it too much, you might feel sleepy and fatigued; Let your eyes rest by taking a nap or looking at something in the distance for 10-20 minutes.

If you feel like you lack energy, go through this checklist:

* Did you drink any water in the last hour (not coffee, tea, or an energy drink)?
* Did you have a meal (not a snack) in the last three hours?
* Do you feel sleepy? Do you need to take a nap?
* Do you take basic vitamins to cover common deficiencies (Vitamin D, B12, A, E, C, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron,)? Did you take them today?
* Did you move at all in the last hour? Did you walk for at least five minutes in the last three hours?

# If you feel defeated or conflicted

**Catching up:**

Motivation and resilience are heavily dependent on framing. How you view failure and effort can either work for you or against you.

If you’re trying to catch up because you slacked off, you may want to compensate by studying hard for the next couple of days, right?

But let’s step back for a moment, how realistic is that? The difficult decision here is to let go of the dream for the perfect grade and start from where you are.

This is a lesson best learned early.

**Conflict:**

If you’re conflicted about your major or a specific class, or if you flunked a test and think it’s unfair that you have to study for it, maybe you’re jealous of how easily others get things done, and it feels unfair.

All these thoughts generate emotions, and those emotions influence your actions. Some will push you forward; others will hold you back.

Ask yourself:

* How do you view the situation you’re in?
* How do you feel about it?
* Does this help you study more or less? Why?
* How can you update your framing to become more motivated?

# If you don’t know how to study

Most of us learn in different ways, both directly and indirectly, through friends, parents, teachers, and so on.

People usually don’t stop to consider their own learning and studying process until it is either too late or when it gets too serious, with a direct impact on their life’s trajectory.

I want you to take a moment and ask yourself: **Have you learned or studied how to learn?**

There are excellent free courses out there that can teach you how to learn and study effectively. One that was popular back when I was in university was *Learning How to Learn* by Dr. Barbara Oakley.",1,1745345683.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

Due to construction we’ve had to switch our hours to close at 12.

Yelling and cussing about how “I can’t get a coffee?” And “we just got here, you can’t close the doors in front of us!” Literally an Oscar worthy performance. So ofc our manager lets them order, we have to dirty the sandwich press and the espresso machine for their (kinda complicated) order. And THEN they have the audacity to say “so I suppose we’re not allowed to SIT either?” Just so rude. Like these are grown ass women throwing a fucking tantrum because they were told “no”. what is WRONG with people?

I get that it’s inconvenient to drive to a place only to be told they can’t serve you, but seriously? Just take the L. There’s like 3 different coffee shops within a 5 mile radius you could go to. If an employee tells you they’re closed, stop acting like it’s a personal attack on you. I’m SORRY that I want to get home on time Karen, ya should’ve left the house earlier.

Also pisses me off the complete lack of backbone our manager has. I had to turn away a bunch of other people too cause they saw those too ladies inside and assumed we were open.

Everywhere, what about crossing time zones?). You couldn't get them wet (What happens when they lick their fur?) You get the idea.

So... Doing IP, I've noticed some ""gremlin"" rules that just seem to not make a lot of sense to me.

1. All lean proteins are treated equally...BUT why?
Surely things that are very low calorie (like fish and shrimp) should let you have more volume/quantity? Wouldn't this mean I should just prioritize tasty proteins over leaner ones?

2. For every drink of coffee you must drink the same in water.
Ok, but what if my coffee is very weak as if the water were already in it? Or what if I just have a shot of cappuccino, and then just add that extra water to just make regular strength coffee?  

3. Cucumber and pickles are considered a ""select vegetable""  but Radish (Daikon in this case) has more calories & carbs and is a unlimited raw veggie that you can sort of skirt around the rules, and add spice to for a sort of ""pickle"". 

These were just the top of my head, but I might add more later.

1k5d5jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cadillac/comments/1k5d5jw/morning_roads_and_midnight_minds/,Morning Roads and Midnight Minds,"By the time I made it into the parking lot, I was already reaching for the keys to lock up and start my day. But then I turned around—just for a second—and looked back at it. Sitting there under the early light, parked way out on its own like I always do. Not because I enjoy the extra walk, but because I trust my car more than I trust other people’s doors.

It looked good. Still. Calm. Like it knew it had done its part this morning.

Truth is, I was excited when I left the house. Taking it out again felt like something special, like it might turn my morning around. But that feeling didn’t last long.

Maybe it was the hour—too early for my night owl brain to really function. Or maybe it was the F150 glued to my bumper like it was auditioning for a Fast & Furious reboot.

I wasn’t in the mood to play games. So I eased into the throttle—nothing flashy, just confident. The acceleration was so smooth I didn’t even realize how fast I was going until I caught the needle on the speedometer climbing. Looked up. The road opened up. No more truck. Just me, the car, and the kind of silence that felt earned.

Well... almost silence.

The cabin still felt incomplete without that deep, body-thumping bass. The subwoofer install is still on the horizon, and maybe once that's dialed in, the whole experience will feel different. Right now, the drives are comfy, sure. But they haven’t fully transformed into something I *feel* yet.

Still, even without the full setup, there was something satisfying about it all. The smooth pull. The early stillness. The way the world hadn’t quite caught up yet. I’m not built for mornings, but this car? It just might be.

I think that’s the part people don’t always get—this isn’t just a machine to me. It’s not just about horsepower or miles per gallon. It’s in the details. The way the seat cradles you just right when you hit a curve. The subtle vibration through the steering wheel when the road surface changes. The way the windows fog slightly on cold mornings, and how I’ve already learned the exact rhythm to wipe it away with one pass of the defroster and a swipe of my sleeve.

It’s in the way I park far out—not out of vanity, but out of protection. I’ve seen too many people swing their doors open like they’re escaping a burning building. That little walk from the edge of the lot gives me time to decompress, to transition from the road into the world. It’s not distance—it’s a buffer.

Every time I step out and lock it, I walk just a few feet and then turn around. Just for a second. Maybe it’s pride. Maybe it’s a gut check. Or maybe it's my way of saying, *thank you*—for the quiet, for the control, for the subtle thrill of speed when I needed it most.

And yeah, I know the feeling didn’t quite stick this morning. I was too foggy-headed, too focused on getting past that truck, too aware of the silence where the bass should be. But the bones are there. The potential. This car and I—we’re still figuring each other out. Still building trust.

That’s the thing with something new. It doesn’t come alive all at once. It’s not just the turn of a key or the push of a button—it’s the *moments*.



And this morning? Even half-awake and annoyed, I had one.

Sometimes, it’s the curves that remind me why I fell for it in the first place.

There’s this stretch of road on the way in—a gentle curve that most people barely register, just something to coast through while they sip coffee and check mirrors. But not me. Not in this car.

The way it took that curve this morning… effortless. Like it *knew* what was coming before I did. I didn’t have to think about steering or braking or correcting—it just flowed. Tires gripped like they had something to prove, body rolled just enough to let me feel the shift, but never enough to throw anything off. It wasn’t about speed. It was about connection.

For a second, I wasn’t just a driver—I was part of the motion. Like I wasn’t *in* the car, I *was* the car.

And that feeling? That’s the one I keep chasing. That quiet stretch of road, the one I know like muscle memory, becomes a kind of ritual. A little escape tucked inside a commute. Something real in the middle of everything routine.

It’s funny—when I talk about it, people think I’m exaggerating. Like I’m trying to romanticize a car. But they don’t get it. They haven’t felt that moment when the road curves and the car just listens. No questions, no hesitation. Just you, the machine, and the path ahead.

I think once the sub’s in and the bass hits with that same smooth confidence… it’ll all come together. But even now, it’s building. Every curve, every morning glance, every stretch of open road—this thing’s earning its place in my life.

Hey all!
This is long, so grab some coffee if you’re interested. I’ve posted here a few times about my hesitation to sleep train my almost 5-month-old, and I thought I’d share our journey now that we’re seeing real progress. A few people have asked, and since this is my third time sleep training, I figured I’d offer what’s worked for us. It’s not all luck—though temperament definitely plays a role.

Where we are now:

My little guy (20 weeks) goes down around 7/7:30 PM and sleeps until 6/6:30 AM with one feed around 2 AM. He takes 3 naps:\
-Nap 1: ~8:15 (fixed because of school drop-off)\
-Wake windows: 2 / 2.25 / 2.25 / 3 (max numbers here)\
-Nap lengths: 2 hrs / 1.5 hrs / 45 mins (max numbers here too)

We do a bedtime routine: final feed between 6:30–7, bath, vitamins, lotion, book, sleep sack, songs, then down. He usually cries a few minutes and is out. Same for naps (book, Merlin suit, down). All sleeps are in the crib in his room except the second half of the night—he’s in a pack n play in my room after my husband brings him to me for the night feed. Tonight I’m going to him instead, so he’ll stay in his room all night for the first time. Honestly, I’m a little sad—I’ll miss my tiny roommate.

What I think made a difference *for us*:

**1. Routine & consistency**

This is number 1 for a reason. From just days old, we set a day/night routine. At night, we kept it dark (dim salt lamp), quiet, and business-like. Diaper > feed (until fully asleep—about 20 min) > swaddle > back in bassinet. After 6 AM, lights on, fresh start. Naps were in our room with natural light, no blackout curtains. Always used white noise. Nighttime routine started early—bath, lotion, vitamins, songs. I even sing the same ones for superstition’s sake.

By 3 weeks, he had a clear first stretch that gradually lengthened to 6–7 hours by 5 weeks. I did the same with all three kids, despite totally different temperaments.

**2. Bassinet at night, contact naps during the day**

My husband had a great paternity leave, so for the first 10 weeks, I just embraced contact naps. I fed to sleep and held him while watching Gilmore Girls. At night, he only stayed asleep in the bassinet if I transferred 20 minutes after he stopped nursing—every time, like clockwork.

From 2–3.5 months, we shifted naps to bassinet/crib. He took short 30-minute naps at first, always fed to sleep and transferred. It was rough, but eventually those naps stretched to 45 min and even 1.5 hours. I stayed committed.

I still do contact naps sometimes (like yesterday). Flexibility matters—something I didn’t understand with my first.

**3. Wake windows matter**

They aren’t some trendy nonsense. With some flexibility, they work. Countless times, I thought “he doesn’t seem tired,” then he’d pass out in under a minute. Trust the windows.

**4. You’ll know when it’s time to sleep train**

I wasn’t ready at 4 months. Then one morning, something shifted. He knew it was nap time. I felt like it was fair to give him a chance to fall asleep on his own. He cried half-heartedly for 5 minutes, then conked out. Truly, the more consistent the routine, the less crying. Sleep training should be 80% expectation and routine, 20% learning to self-soothe.

———

**Transitioning to 3 naps**: Once naps lengthened, I committed to 3 naps (8:15, 12ish, 3:30ish). The wake windows were a little long for his age, but he adjusted quickly. It let us do a consistent 7/7:30 bedtime and fixed our early wakes almost overnight.

**4-month regression**: Hit around 3.5 months. That first long stretch dropped to 3 hours, sometimes waking every couple of hours for the pacifier. I wasn’t ready to ST, so I just did what I had to do: paci first, then feed if needed. It improved a bit, but real progress came after ST. We’re now back to one night feed.

**Controversial hack**: From ~2 weeks on, if he woke with hiccups or too early to be hungry, I’d give a tiny bit of gripe water and pop in the pacifier. The sweetness helped him suck and drift back to sleep. If he was truly hungry, it wouldn’t work, and I’d feed. I think this helped limit unnecessary night feeds.

**Gas management**: Gas can really interfere with sleep. We used gas drops at night feeds and sometimes during the day. My husband did leg pushes during diaper changes. I did tummy rubs in the bath (often led to poop), bicycle kicks, and lots of tummy time. I burped after the first boob, not the second (since he nursed to sleep). I avoided oversupply by skipping pumping early on—something I regret not knowing with my first. Those oversupply TikToks? I just picture those poor babies getting blasted by a milk cannon.

**Swaddle Transition**: We found a “sweet spot”—not too early (so we didn’t fight the startle reflex), but not too late where it overlaps with the four-month regression. We went straight to a sleep sack around 12 weeks. I was honestly shocked at how smooth it was—sleep barely skipped a beat. Timing it before the regression helped so he wasn’t adjusting to too many things at once.

Will buy you a coffee if you can help!","Hey all, around 3 months ago I bought a OMEN Transcend 14 Gaming Laptop. 14-fb0010na, Specs are: Intel Core Ultra 9 185H Processor, 1TB SSD, 32GB SDRAM, Windows 11, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 8GB.

I've had a fair few problems since then but recently it is getting worse. Things I have done to try and remedy this: Update my Nvidia Graphics, Update my Intel Graphics, Run diagnostics, Update my BIOS. Update basically everything possible.

The biggest issues are related to the graphics I think, when using photoshop it seems to be too much and either disconnects from my graphics card and reverts to the basic use, or runs incredibly slow and freezing. I can't share my screen during a zoom call for work, or even on discord with friends. If I try sharing, my photoshop will glitch out like crazy- not responding to what I try to do. Sometimes when browsing gifs on discord, they won't load and it crashes (sometimes it's fine.) When it 'crashes' the screen freezes, turns black for around 4 seconds then comes back with no issues. It's never shut down, though sometimes it does this randomly, I would say once a day- once every two days.

I'm an artist for work, and I picked this laptop as the specs were good and I wanted to work seamlessly- however it seems my 5 year old lenovo laptop can handle it better! I will say, gaming wise, it's absolutely fine for some reason? Though I have to restart my laptop after playing if I want to be sure drawing will go smoothly afterwards.

Other problems not related to graphics: My wireless mouse will frequently change speeds from way too slow, to way to fast and I have to adjust it. My microphone only sometimes has the option for using the intel smart sound technology, if I use that for discord 10% of the time I sound great, 90% of the time it produces no sound, almost like I'm muted. When I first plugged in my wired headphones and the dongle for the mouse, It felt quite tough to stick them in, and for a while was using a usb-c adapter for my headphone jack, since it felt so tight.

Is there some magical remedy for all this, has anyone delt with anything like this? Or is it time to contact HP to replace it? I was REALLY hoping not too since I am hooked up to my works server on this laptop and have lot's of files I would need to transfer over.

Thanks so much in advance, any help is appreciated- I'm at my wits end!",1,1745345248.0,HPOmen,1,1.0,False
1k5d3gz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5d3gz,"Done my very first bikepacking around the lake Constance, cannot wait for the next trip!","The weather on last Friday was not ideal, but just 5 minutes after the start, I was greeted by another bike packer to Strasbourg and cloudy feeling was immediately away! During the trip, I've turned around twice to make some pictures or videos and was asked both time whether I've lost my way. Such a heart-warming feeling!

On Saturday, no complains at all! Really enjoyed the ride and the lake view with mountains in the background. Some streets were busy but most of the car drivers had behaved respectfully. Just the camp site at the end was full, so I needed to drive home directly. Otherwise, I'd have one more night in Lindau to enjoy the sunset.

My setup: (It was my first trip as a trial, so I've intentionally packed my stuffs loosely to reduce the possible stress.)

* Pannier left: 2P tent, camping chair, chain lock, long sleeve jersey and rain jacket if off.
* Pannier right: sleeping bag, thermal mat, exchanging clothes for walking around and sleeping, self-cleaning stuffs, meds
* Above the rear rack: flip flops, solar camping light
* Saddle bag: multitool, e-pump, chain wax, TPU tube, tyre levers, tubeless plugs
* Top tube bag: snacks, batteries, camera if it rains
* Fork bag left: camping cooking stuffs, 2x dry foods, instance coffee
* Fork bag right: power bank, cables, chargers
* and 2.3L of water

What I've learned:

* Well, handling a 27kg bike is absolutely something different.
* Birds are so loud! I won't forget to bring ear plugs for a better sleep next time...
* Tent folding is more difficult than setting it up, the pack won't just be as small as it was still on the shelf.

Some pieces of advice for Topstoners:

* For the Quick-Rack, cylindrical head M5x30 will use the full length of the insert above the thru-axle.
* For the Fork-Pack, do not use the included screws! The upper and lower ones will only have about 3 or 4 useful pitches in the thread insert and they will definitely damage the thread, because both the pack bracket and the fork are not flat. Buy some countersunk M5x30 and apply some thread glue, it worked for my trip, and the thread glue a little bit too much🤣.

[<< Chapter 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1jwx2bc/i_got_a_rock_chapter_30/) | [From The Beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/ky5k5k/i_got_a_rock_chapter_1/)

Classes were done for the day!

And even though she had showered after dueling practice, Xoco didn’t see the harm in freshening up before getting coffee. And while she was at it there was no harm in picking out one of her nicer dresses.

Sure, they were all just school uniforms. Just a simple solid colored sundress with some white floral patterns. And sure, hers in particular had been tailored to have a more flattering fit but *this* dress was especially nice looking. The jungle troll didn’t usually wear black which made it more impactful when she did. And wearing black for getting coffee was just thematic.

It made *sense* Xoco thought to herself as she tried it on in the mirror…and made a mental note to see if tailoring services were available on campus at a later date. She was indeed, apparently, still growing. That wasn’t something too surprising. The Yalkab family had been notably tall and healthy since Kuxtal and Xareni. A few thousand years had only magnified those traits and now they had her taller than everyone in her family save her father and Ikal. She might even overtake *them* at this rate.

Xoco had a flash of realization that things were not going well if even her seemingly ever increasing height was reminding her of her family. And how long had she been frozen in place, staring in the mirror? If she didn’t check the time on her pocket watch then it didn’t count and it wasn’t real.

Her black dress would be fine, if fitting almost imperceptibly tighter, Xoco told herself. There was still much for her to do in order to get ready for this completely casual occasion in which she got coffee with Isak. Hair and makeup still had to be done, as did picking out some jewelry and she could not afford to be having a personal crisis at each step.

She only had four more through the whole process.

Xoco looked herself over in the mirror. The black dress with white floral patterns contrasted nicely with the gold jewelry around her neck and hung from her ears in rings. Nelli resting around her neck was the main source of additional colors in her ensemble, aside from some blood blue lipstick, and her tongue flicked out in approval as she too saw herself in the mirror. A tasteful golden hair clip held her long violet hair up in a high ponytail.

Just not the gold clip with turquoise inlays. This was a *casual* coffee date.

Meeting. Coffee meeting.

Xoco’s reflection frowned at her from the mirror. She decided to add a simple gold nose ring and her heeled boots. Both a small boost in confidence.

No.

Just enough of a boost to worry much less. If there was one good thing she got from her family, and a trait they had always possessed, it was ambition. One she could turn back against them and wield as some true confidence.

A coffee meeting, for now, and a reflection that finally smiled back.

Perhaps, if her ambition was truly great enough, she could make it more than just a meeting.

She left her dorm room and silently appreciated how tall standard door frames within The Empire were. Her efforts were noticeable as she was getting even more looks than usual. Which itself wasn’t unusual. Attention was something she was familiar with. Including how shallow that attention was on most occasions. The smile she offered back when greeted was automatic.

Polite, yet also shallow.

Perhaps she could even use this? If eyes were on her then it made her family’s unwanted observations and possible interferences much more difficult. The downside was, of course, also the upside. More eyes on her meant more difficulty in trying to establish herself as just *Xoco* before the truth inevitably came out. She was already in a race against the rumor mill churning up the truth of her actual family and making its way to the ears of her friends.

Seeing Isak waiting for her at one of the library entrances, her smile turned genuine as she flashed a mouth full of daggers to the human leaning against a wall. He was wearing his own black uniform shirt and…she couldn’t quite place it but his hair looked nicer today.

“Good to see you, Isak! How are you?”

“Haha yeah!”

Xoco tilted her head to the side and didn’t lose her smile. “...what?”

The human’s face was quickly turning red and as he stood up from leaning on the wall he stumbled a bit before attempting to regain his composure. “Oh it’s just…ha ha…you know!”

Key word being ‘attempt’. During said attempt, Nelli and Vidal exchanged glances. Despite each of their faces mostly lacking the capacity to show discernible emotion there did still exist a knowing look of resigned understanding between them.

“It is a *hot* day out aren’t you?” In his head those were two separate sentences but he was currently too distracted to properly sort them out. Isak forced a smile that was quickly burned away as he glanced away for a moment. He breathed deep, gulped, and returned to looking up to meet Xoco’s eyes. “What I meant to say was…you look really nice today…I mean you always do but especially today?”

Xoco’s attempts at suppressing a giggle were poor. “Well then perhaps–”

Oh, she knew those people who were fast approaching. And they knew her. Their families had regular business dealings with her own. And this wasn’t the first time they had tried to capture her in a conversation and attempt to worm their way into her, and by extension her family’s, good graces. This wasn’t even the first time they had been in dangerous proximity to Isak or any of her other friends who didn’t know her secret.

Luckily she had a proven method of quick escape from such unwanted social battlefields.

“-we should go and get that coffee! I am *very* thirsty and it really is a hot day!” The jungle troll announced in unintentional accuracy as she picked up Isak in one arm and power walked into the depths of the library.

Vidal wordlessly followed after the pair as they navigated to the library’s small cafe on the lower levels. Only as they were standing in line and collecting all manner of inquisitive looks did Isak finally remember how to speak. It was in a whisper but it still counted as speech. “Did uh…did you have some…*unwanted attention*?”

Xoco stared ahead at the menu board and unconsciously clenched her hand as Isak grunted. “...yes, but not the *usual* ones. They are…old rivals I do not wish to deal with if I don’t have to.”

All of which was true, even if it wasn’t the full truth. That could come later.

“W-well I do have experience in dealing with your rivals.” Isak’s voice was strained for some reason. “M-maybe I could help with these ones too?”

Completely out of the question. At least for now. There were many revelations that needed to be had first. Xoco still had to prove to her new friends that she was just a girl who both happened to be from a wealthy family and happened to have that wealthy family be immoral, cutthroat, and one of the very founders of The Empire who had long since lost their way.

Also that family was now stalking her and her new friends for likely nefarious purposes.

No. Those new friends needed to see how normal she was.

She advanced forward in the line with her eyes still glued to the menu. Not making eye contact helped her in dodging the question.

“As amusing as it was seeing you take down Tikonel in such a humiliating fashion, I must fight my own battles.” Xoco responded.

“R-right but y-you don’t *have* to do that a-alone!”

“I don’t mean to interrupt whatever is going on here but are you two ready to order?”

The cafe worker’s voice broke Xoco’s concentration on her clandestine plans, making her suddenly aware of the fact that she was still holding onto her human. She set him down as she hoped that her makeup would hide her cheeks turning dark green.

“Y-yes I’ll have an extra large dark roast with some sugar. And a bar of dark chocolate please.”

“And you sir?”

Isak rubbed at his side where an unusually strong jungle troll's claws had been digging in and held back only by a thin layer of gold. “A small light roast. Cream and sugar please.”

The pair sheepishly waited for their orders while enduring smirks and raised eyebrows all around. Only after they received them and started looking for a more secluded table within the library did Xoco break the silence.

“I…am very sorry about that…”

“It’s fine! Not even something that needs an apology!” Isak waved it off as he led them towards a spot they had discovered was usually secluded and free of traffic. Today was no exception as they took their seats. “You had to get away from yet more rivals, and you had claw caps on so I’m not even bleeding! Also they look really nice.”

“Ah, thank you! These are my favorites. They’re actually enchanted so that they won’t come off until inserted back into their holding case!”

“Huh…” Isak marvelled at the technological wonders that had literally saved his skin. “Well they’re already proving useful!”

“Indeed!” Xoco smiled brightly, then faltered for just a moment. “I should…probably stop picking you up–”

“Not once have I complained about that.” The human locked eyes with her and proved that dark brown eyes could make for an impressively serious stare. They broke off a moment later as their owner retrieved his book bag. “Plus if I was really in any danger Vidal would have intervened. Right buddy?”

“Correct, Master Isak.”

Xoco hummed and set her own book bag on the table. “Is it because you recognize me as one of Isak’s trusted friends?”

“That is the primary reason, yes.”

“What are the other reasons?”

Isak dropped a book down on the table to pull Xoco’s attention away. “I know I said I was going to have you tell me about that one series…what was it…Lion of–”

“OH! That one! Ha…we can talk about that one later!” So he *had* overheard her talking about The Lion of The Wasteland. Of everything she could never let Isak find out about, she could *most* never let him find out about that series…as much as she loved it. She encouraged the diversion between sips of coffee. “It seems you have something much more interesting?”

“Judge for yourself.” The human flipped open the book to where a slip of paper with scribbled notes lay. A quick scan told Xoco that it was a book about some semi-lost language, and below there were a number of symbols that looked vaguely familiar. “Recognize those?”

Xoco narrowed her eyes and pursed her lips. It was so *familiar* and yet she couldn’t place it. She was unable to give Isak anything but a look of bashful uncertainty. His response was to smile, tap the page to grab her attention towards one of the symbols, and then sweep his extended index finger from the page to point at Vidal.

The very same symbol sat at the front of a string of symbols upon his head.

Her eyes grew to large pink saucers and her mouth hung open. She grabbed Isak’s free arm and pulled him closer. “You found the language of Vidal’s glyphs?!?”

Isak had barely managed to grab his coffee cup out of the way to avoid a spill but still managed a smile. “I’m going to tell everyone at the meeting tonight, but I thought a certain someone might want to know of this linguistic discovery first…it’s uh…I mean you probably saw that it’s a semi-lost language–”

“You got me a lost language!?!” Her grip on his arm tightened and she pulled him even closer.

“S-Semi-lost!” The human’s smile was a guilty one. “No one actually knows the script anymore…and there’s only a few known characters from that script…but I do speak the verbal half of the language! Kind of–”

“You got me a lost language to decipher *and* you’re multilingual?!?”

“I mean, everyone is–”“It only counts if it’s more than two!”

“How many?!?”

“Well four but really I don’t speak a ton of Old Lavi–”

“Say something in one of them!”

Isak thought for a moment while Nelli flicked her tongue out towards him. His face turned serious, glanced at Xoco, and then he nodded to the feathered serpent in some kind of agreement.

“Tú verde y negro azen un dulce konfit.”

Xoco’s already wide eyes grew even larger. She recognized some of those words from ‘The Lion of the Wasteland’! “What does that mean?”

The human gulped and chewed at his lip before clearing his throat. “Well…the uh…it doesn’t really work as a *literal* translation but uhhhh...*metaphorically* I’m saying the black dress looks really good on you! Compliments your stripes and teal skin *perfectly*!”

The jungle troll blushed dark green and finally remembered that she should stop crushing her human’s arm in her talons. She needed a bit of extra breathing room. “Oh! W-well thank you! Your own black shirt goes perfectly with your hair that smells like coffee. Looks like coffee.”

Calm down Xoco, she berated herself, she got compliments all the time without falling apart. They just didn’t usually come from someone who humiliated her enemies, enjoyed wordplay jokes, and got her a once in a generation gift related to her hobbies. That he was quite exotic in looks, at least compared to what she was used to, didn’t hurt either.

This gift alone was probably him making the first move, just as human men preferred. A little bit of lite flirting back was now perfectly warranted and in no way too aggressive.

“Sorry, I believe I got sidetracked.” Xoco said as she took a long sip of coffee to calm her nerves and focus. “Tell me more about this semi-lost language?”

Isak stared at her with those deep brown eyes like chocolate for somewhere between an hour and a minute. She didn’t mind and she said nothing. There were revelations she needed to focus on.

“Yes! Language!” Isak had suddenly remembered it. “I think it’s Old Lavi! Remember that book you found that had that one symbol from Kazimir’s place? Well it got me thinking. What exactly did I know about him? Not much. I know he was originally from a different province, that the ‘Krazy’ part of his title is true, and that we’re both Lavi. So first I tried looking up languages of his home province? Nothing. The language of our religious tradition? Also nothing! Orrrr was it nothing?”

“It wasn’t!”

“Correct! It only *looked* like nothing because next to no one knew what the native script looked like! Not since the Long Eclipse several thousand years back! Artifacts have been found here and there that had some of the symbols but no one knew how to read them. And at least one of those symbols is found on Vidal.”

Isak sipped from his own coffee after the long explanation. He and Xoco both sat back and looked Vidal up and down. Streams of water coursed over and around the numerous glyphs, and if the pair really focused they could pick out a few instances of that same glyph scattered about the rock man’s rocks.

“Vidal, you have said before that you only know languages that Isak knows?” Xoco asked.

“That is correct, Miss Xoco.” The rock man said. “This also extends to written text. Master Isak has already tested this idea.”

“Then it seems Isak and I have some research to perform before we present our findings to everyone.” The jungle troll sent a smile to the human and he quickly returned it.

First, she offered him half of her chocolate bar and refused his refusals. Second, the pair set about conducting their research. Lost languages had been their focus before, but now they had further direction. That this language seemed closely tied with Isak’s culture was an even bigger aid. It was also the perfect excuse to get to know Isak better as a person.

“See this isn’t fair!” The human jokingly complained. He stood at the desk before a growing pile of books that they were going to attempt to check out all at once. “This is now a whole *quest* focused on my culture. I have *three* cultures to learn for my friends that I have to do as a sidequest.”

“Mmm perhaps we’ll have to meet up more so I can teach you about mine? In between uncovering ancient secrets of course.” Perfectly smooth, Xoco. Not too forward at all…even if there was more he needed to know about her first. Later. Much later…maybe just a bit for now. To see if he would run. “Though that *would* involve learning about my family. And they can be…difficult.”

Isak hadn’t caught Xoco’s expression faltering. He was too busy rolling his eyes. “Sounds like my family. Well, at least my mom.”

“You are…familiar with this situation?”

He pointed to Vidal. “Mom got me Vidal when he was just a rock and she had no idea he could be any more. Because it was ch–”

He paused and his eyes focused on something far off. Fists clenching and unclenching.

“She was being…economical.”

Xoco had absolutely no idea what that meant in a literal sense, but in a metaphorical sense she could easily see the distress. “So your mother is…difficult as well?”

“Kinda sounds like that’s common for moms?” Their eyes met and there was an instant understanding.

“I *wish* it was just my mother…but yes.” Xoco sipped at her third cup of coffee and thanked her considerable physique for being able to take such high amounts of caffeine and still remain calm. “She can be…exacting in her standards.”“Still sounds familiar.”

“She does have her own kindness…it’s just…well she can be overbearing.”

“Then it seems we have another shared project.” The smile Isak offered was a comforting one, and Xoco’s response was a delighted flash of sharp teeth.

“It seems you are a man of many talents, Isak.” She stood from her chair to gather up her books. “You know I would love to–”

Her chair didn’t move as she stood. Or perhaps it was shoved back into place? But there was no one around? No one around that was *visible*. These and other thoughts fought in her head as she tripped over said chair and started plummeting towards the ground. Instinct finally broke her of the daze as she tried to cast air cloak on herself before hitting the ground. Currents of air barely managed to slow her descent as she landed in Isak’s arms.

The temporarily mitigated weight of the very tall jungle troll girl was appreciated as Isak fought down onto one knee while keeping her suspended in his arms. Her face started turning dark green as she figured out what had just happened.

“W-We really should stop *falling* for each other in the library.” Isak managed a joke while still holding her up.

“Too late, it already happened.” Xoco blinked and shook her head to regain some clarity. “I–I mean it’s hard not to fall under the *weight* of knowledge!”

“In my defense there is a lot of you and a lot of that is *very* impressive muscles, which aren’t bad things at a–” Isak was also struggling with clarity as much as he was struggling with holding up a very large girl and one feathered serpent that was now staring at him. “Y-yeah we just keep dealing with such *heavy* subject matter!”

“And you are *hand*ling it very well!”

“As I’m sure you can feel, me not having claws certainly *doesn’t hurt*!”

She didn’t bother to suppress a giggle, they were always interrupted before they could go on with their awful jokes like this for so long. Even as he was straining to keep her up he still offered his own toothy smile. “Oh don’t worry, troll skin is extra durable so you would have to *bite* me really hard to break the skin!”

Both of them stared at each other blankly. Where exactly was Xoco going with that one? She herself wasn’t sure. She needed to escape though. “You are my hero for saving me Isak!”

And he had to know what had just happened. Her arms wrapped around his neck to pull him into a hug that let her whisper into his ear. “*Someone* moved that chair to trip me.”

Only she was able to feel his hands holding her up quickly flex twice. An acknowledgement, she assumed. He helped her back onto her feet. “Well *that’s* what I’m here for! But we should really get going. Don’t want to keep the others waiting. *So much* to discuss with them.”

“*Much* to discuss!” Xoco straightened out her dress as she started gathering up all of the books. “And…we should do this again sometime. You and me meeting up, I mean. I think we’ve both fallen for one another enough.”

“...yeah? Yeah, I’d like that.” Isak agreed, hefting a stack of books into his arms.

“Though I do wonder why Vidal didn’t try to intervene this time as well…”

The rock man turned to the jungle troll as he again followed after the pair. “It is to Master Isak’s benefit that I do not intervene in these specific matters.”

“What matters?”

“I think he means…” The human spoke up and caught her attention. He flexed one arm while trying to balance all of the books in the other. His grin was an unserious one. “I *totally* had that!”

Xoco covered her mouth as she chuckled.

“Yeah okay I should probably exercise more with all the peril these days…”

“Then we shall *meet up* for that as well!” She promised as they made their way out of the library. Her family had to still be watching if they had now started making more *active* moves against her.

Good.

There was still much to do but she wouldn’t let them control her any longer.

So…there’s a coffee place in town that has/allows stickers all over their drive-thru menu frame and service window.

I have applied for the diversity visa lottery and am really hoping for good news with that since I'd like to be closer to family now. 
I'm living in Ireland while I wait but I'm wondering how people make friends there and what kinds of hobbies I can get into to branch out and make my community once I settle there...? 
I don't drink (due to some family alcohol issuse) and I'm finding here in Ireland as a adult of you don't drink its difficult to make friends... 
My ultimate dream is to open a food truck since I love to bake. I am English and so I learned to bake traditional English treats as a child and have been training and doing pastry and baking courses here in Ireland and so my truck would be a mix of European bakes and coffee. 😁 
I guess I'm just manifesting being able to settle there near family, rescue a medium dog and keep exploring the beautiful state that I think maine is. 
I keep telling my dad that the day will come that I get to cross that green state line bridge and not have to go back over it 🤞🤞

It's fair to say that there is no one size fits all, however 1 rule doesn't change being CICO - in most if not all circumstances, that rule doesn't change.

I would post this in my notes but I'll be honest I never ever check them, I have many notes on there that I haven't seen for years but I log onto Reddit most days. 

This also may help those looking for advice or if people leave comments it may help others.

1. After losing some weight you may need to recalculate your TDEE to find your new maintenance/deficit. 

2. You are going to get cravings - I found what helps me is not restrict food groups cause that makes it worse at least for me. Find alternatives, for me I love savoury things so if I want crisp (UK here) I'll get a small bag of lentil crisp or popcorn to help keep the calories down and I can satisfy myself. Same goes for fizzy drinks if you really need to take the edge off opt for sugar free. Same with ice cream there is some great lower calorie options just don't go overboard. 

3. Don't get unmotivated by the scales, I weigh everyday and sometimes the scales don't move and you question everything when they go up - if you 100% sure you're in a deficit and counted absolutely everything there can be different factors such as water retention for example. I find weighing everyday and then finding the difference weekly helps me instead of kicking myself

4. DO NOT EAT BACK YOUR CALORIES FROM EXCERCISE! Alot of trackers are incorrect and I've fell victim to this in the past. Of course you may need more energy if you're doing strength training in the gym but do not go overboard if you're trying to lose weight. 

5. Losing weight also doesn't mean you can't have a social life - I know sometimes that involves eating out. You can make suggestions to your friends to do stuff that doesn't revolve round food but if that's a no go then just make sure you're looking at the better options and if it fits your macros/cals

6. I have been terrible for this but being in a deficit does not mean you have to be hungry you can really bulk your meals up with vegetables for example if you make a Bolognese you could add courgettes and/or peppers for more volume (I apologise to the Italians if they see this haha) and it isn't gunna add too many calories and will fill your plate more and this can work for a lot of meals. Vegetables don't have to be boring if you use herbs/spices

7. Keep moving - your weight loss is going to come more from your diet than exercise which is why many say ""you can't out run a bad diet"" but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do both! The health benefits alone are worth while. 

8. Stay hydrated - this one is obvious and it's also essential for healthy digestion 

9. No one is saying you can't have treats. If it's your partner's birthday have some cake but take a smaller piece or leave some room in your calories to accommodate it - moderation is key

10. You may be thirsty not hungry. Have a glass of water 

11. Don't beat yourself up if you've gone over on a meal/day. Just pick back up from where you are. If you've ate too much for lunch make sure you go back on track for dinner. Or overdone dinner just make sure breakfast is back on track. One day doesn't have to ruin the whole week/month

12. Alcohol has calories - be aware of that if you have a night out planned. This goes in hand that you can still have a social life just stay cautious.

13. There is times you might be hungry but it should never be painful hunger. If it's painful or unbearable you may wanna revisit how much you are eating, what you're eating and if the deficit is too much for you at this current time. 

14. Remove temptation - my partner has done me dirty with getting me and the kids Easter eggs but luckily for me I don't have a sweet tooth. 

15. Carbs are not evil but may increase water retention

16. My favourite one - it's a marathon not a sprint. We didn't gain this weight over night and Rome wasn't built in a day. It's going to take time and a lot of work, discipline and innovation. 

Some pointers that might be worth mentioning. I only eat twice a day as that's what works with my work/life balance it means I can eat slightly larger amounts for my calories and I've never been a big breakfast fan even when I was fit and healthy in school. I don't get that hungry until lunch time but it's not for everyone. Don't be scared of having smaller more frequent meals if it works for you. 

If you can't hold back on junk food make your own, I've made my own burgers including the buns and chips for a total calorie total of 550 calories and it was a decent portion too!

Caffeine is an appetite suppressant I use a company called sneak for my caffeine hit as I don't like tea/coffee and it's an alternative to drinking Monster. Don't drink it too late though or you might wired for the night. 

Protein and fiber help you feel fuller for longer. 

I find bulk cooking my meals helps me and has in the past stews, casserole, chilli, Bolognese etc all freeze well just don't freeze it with pasta or stuff that doesn't take long to cook as you'll be left with a bowl of disappointment as I once found out. 

These things may not work for others but these are the things that have helped me and I am in no means an expert, far from it but we are here with the same goal in mind. 
If anyone has any other tips/advice please do share them, I willing to take all the help I can get. I know I've missed a bunch of stuff as I've been writing this while being at work. 

Also if I have got anything wrong please do correct me, but please be respectful in doing so. ",1,1745344721.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

# Nespresso Lungo 2025: Best Pods & machines - Top Reviews & Comparisons!

Are you a devoted Nespresso aficionado seeking the perfect long coffee experience? Or perhaps you're just dipping your toes into the world of Nespresso and curious about what a ""lungo"" actually is? Whether you're a seasoned Nespresso machine owner or a potential buyer, this complete guide to Nespresso Lungo in 2025 will help you navigate the vast selection of pods, machines, and flavors to find your ideal cup.

[[Explore Top Rated nespresso lungo on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=nespresso lungo)
## Understanding the Nespresso Lungo: What Makes It Special?

Before diving into specific recommendations, let's clarify what “lungo coffee” means within the Nespresso universe. Simply put, a lungo is a longer espresso. In Italian, ""lungo"" translates to ""long,"" and it refers to the amount of water used to brew the coffee. While an espresso typically extracts around 25-30ml of coffee, a nespresso lungo uses approximately 110ml (3.75 oz) of water.

This longer extraction affects the taste profile. A lungo tends to be less intense and more bitter than an espresso, as the extended brewing time draws out more compounds from the coffee grounds. However,nespresso cleverly optimizes its lungo capsules to minimize bitterness and deliver a balanced,aromatic experience. Many find that this creates a wonderfully smooth beverage. With the right pod, lungo can be a great flavor experience.

## Who is the Nespresso Lungo Perfect For?

The beauty of coffee lies in its diversity, and the Nespresso lungo caters to a specific set of preferences:

*   **Nespresso Machine Owners Seeking Variety:** If you already own a Nespresso Original Line or Vertuo Line machine, exploring different lungo varieties can add a new dimension to your coffee routine. The ease of using nespresso pods makes it practical, combined with the flavorful coffee experience you can consistently produce.
*   **Coffee Drinkers Who Prefer a Milder Taste:** If you find espresso too intense or are looking for a longer, more leisurely coffee experience, the nespresso lungo provides a smoother, less concentrated flavor.
*   **Those Seeking a Convenient & Consistent Cup:** Nespresso machines are renowned for their ease of use and consistent results. The Nespresso lungo combines this convenience with a satisfying, well-rounded coffee experience.
*   **Enthusiasts Seeking Premium Coffee at Home:** Nespresso lungo offers a readily available option for those who appreciate the quality of single-origin coffee and the art of gourmet roasting, all without the intricacies of manual brewing.

## Nespresso Lungo Capsules: A Deep Dive into Flavor Profiles

One of the joys of the Nespresso system is the sheer variety it offers, especially concerning nespresso flavors. When it comes to nespresso lungo capsules,the choices are plentiful,catering to different palates and preferences.

### Nespresso Original line Lungo Capsules:

The Nespresso Original Line, with its characteristic high-pressure extraction, offers a variety of lungo capsules:

*   **Linizio Lungo:** This is often touted as a good introduction to the nespresso lungo world. It is a balanced and smooth blend of arabica coffee beans.
*   **Vivalto Lungo:** Known for its complex character, Vivalto Lungo presents a blend of roasted and floral notes.
*   **Fortissio lungo:** For those who prefer a bolder taste, Fortissio Lungo delivers an intense, richly flavored experience.*   **Envivo Lungo:** A powerful and contrasting coffee, Envivo lungo is rich in roasted notes with hints of gingerbread and caramelized toffee.
*   **Bukeela ka ethiopia:** Showcasing the floral and wild notes of ethiopian Arabica.*   **Decaffeinato Lungo:** the decaffeinated version of the lungo, still offering the same smooth longer coffee experience.When considering these options, pay attention to the nespresso intensities indicated on the packaging. Nespresso uses an intensity scale to help you gauge the strength and boldness of each blend. The nespresso lungo intensity chart typically ranges from 1 to 13,with higher numbers indicating a stronger,more intense flavor. Those interested in the caffeine content will also find that the different capsules vary.

### Nespresso Vertuo Line Lungo Capsules:

The Vertuo Line utilizes a different extraction technology called ""centrifusion,"" which spins the capsule at high speed to brew the coffee. This method generally creates a larger cup size and a generous crema. While the Vertuo line might not have as many dedicated ""lungo"" options as the Original Line, specific capsule sizes are designed to deliver a longer coffee experience similar to a lungo.The Vertuo line offers Gran Lungo options that are 5 oz in size.

*   **Gran lungo Options (5 oz):** Capsules labeled ""Gran Lungo"" are specifically designed for the Vertuo and represent the closest equivalent to the original line lungo. These are carefully considered for the caffeine content, with different blends for different levels of caffeine need.
*   **Consider the Coffee Size:** while not specifically labeled ""lungo,"" certain Vertuo capsule sizes produce a similar volume of coffee.Experiment to find your preferred brew size.

### Beyond Nespresso: Exploring Compatible Capsules

While Nespresso capsules offer a wide selection, you might be curious about exploring compatible capsules from other brands for your Nespresso Original Line machine. Many companies offer nespresso compatible lungo capsules at varying price points and flavor profiles. Exploring these can prove more sustainable, especially when combined with the use of reusable nespresso pods lungo.

While compatible capsules can sometimes be a budget-amiable option, keep in mind that the quality and taste may vary. Always read reviews and compare ingredients before purchasing.

## Choosing the Right Nespresso Machine for Lungo

Both the Original Line and Vertuo Line machines can brew lungos,but there are some factors to consider when choosing a machine specifically with lungo in mind:

*   **Nespresso Original Line:** These machines are generally smaller,more affordable,and compatible with a wider range of third-party capsules. They are the go-to choice for those who primarily want to brew espresso and lungo. if you prefer the customary extraction method and want more flexibility in choosing capsules, the Original Line is a solid choice. Ensure you are selecting the nespresso machine for lungo.
*   **Nespresso Vertuo Line:** Vertuo machines use ""centrifusion"" technology, creating a larger cup of coffee with a generous crema. If you enjoy longer drinks, such as mugs of coffee, or are interested in exploring the Gran Lungo options, the vertuo Line might be a better fit. Not all vertuoline machines are created equally though, so make sure your machine is capable of the lungo.

When choosing a machine, consider your budget, counter space, and desired features.Some machines offer automatic milk frothers for creating lattes and cappuccinos, while others have programmable cup sizes.

## Mastering the Art of Nespresso Lungo: Brewing Tips & Recipes

Brewing a perfect nespresso lungo is relatively straightforward, but here are a few tips to elevate your experience:

*   **use Filtered Water:** The quality of your water considerably impacts the taste of your coffee. Using filtered water will help remove impurities and enhance the flavor profile of your lungo.

*   **Adjust the Grind (if using reusable capsules):** If you're using refillable capsules,experimenting with grind size can alter the intensity.

1k5cs8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k5cs8y/my_20m_best_friend_24f_wants_to_get_coffee_with/,My (20M) best friend (24F) wants to get coffee with one of my abusers who also groomed a 16 year old. AIO for wanting to go no contact?,"TL;DR is that I was sexually harassed, reported it and got bullied, falsely accused of a lot of very bad things, and kicked out of a trans group for speaking up.

The 16 year old in question called out the admins for abusing their power by attacking me and was bullied so badly that she had multiple mental breakdowns, and this individual was one of the people involved. I consider it a form of grooming because they're trying to condition her to ignore sexual harassment by showing how badly it will go for her if she stands up for survivors.

For some reason, my best friend decided to contact said abuser, and initially didn't put up with any of their bullshit. She did ask me first, but I felt like she would think I was controlling if I said no, and wanted her to see how bad my abuser was in their own words.

The abuser had accused me of being anti-sex and thinking consent doesn't exist, lying about being abused in childhood, lying about being sexually harassed and also being a conservative who hates trans people, that's just in the few screenshots she shared with me. Despite all of this, she still wants to meet up with this person. The part that I want to go NC over is the last screenshot she sent me, where she also claims I was never sexually harassed and blamed my autism and trauma for why I thought I was harassed. 

This is a complete 180 for her, just two days ago she literally wanted to set up the people who were harassing me so we had hard proof on them, and now she's denying I was even harassed just to appease some random person she barely knows. She is a people pleaser (she said this herself) so this isn't really out of character for her. She isn't responding to me anymore but she did say she wanted a break from the conversation. I honestly think this is the last straw for me, she accused me of spreading rumors about me a few days ago because of what this abuser said about me. I feel like I can't always be on the defensive and have to relive my trauma just to defend myself against false allegations.",1,1745344448.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1k5cq3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/1k5cq3z/women_of_sf_how_often_do_you_get_approached_irl/,Women of SF - how often do you get approached IRL?,"Lots of posts here recently about being frustrated with apps. Tbf I can see that - it's unnatural af and most of the times conversation is tedious. 

But then that begs the question - do you actually get approached and hit on IRL? If so, how often? 

Anecdotally, as somebody that spends a lot of time in coffee shops I never actually see other people do it...

Edit: if you are getting approached, what types of guys are doing the approaching?

1k5cp0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1k5cp0t/marathon_morning_hydration/,Marathon morning hydration,"I cannot go 5k without needing a wee when I long run (usually 7/8am starts having been awake since 6ish). I’m 34/F 

My fluid intake is usually a 220ml coffee and 250ml water/squash. I started out with more and reduced it. 

Whilst I’ve been doing long runs I’ve taken 500ml for 21k plus and I can usually make it to the end without another stop but I can’t get past needing to pee within the first half hour. 

Marathon is 4 weeks away so still got time to practice but if I drink enough the day before can I just have a sip of water before I head out? 

How do I hydrate enough but not need to pee whilst out? ",2,1745344236.0,Marathon_Training,7,1.0,False

1k5co81,https://i.redd.it/s8va0k20bfwe1.jpeg,When Life Feels Too Expensive to Enjoy,"There’s nothing quite like the creeping anxiety of knowing you work hard every day but still feel the weight of unpaid bills looming over you. You’ve stopped saying yes to small joys, like grabbing a coffee or eating out with friends, because guilt lingers over every dollar spent. Even necessities like groceries suddenly feel like luxuries. You wake up tired, go to bed worrying, and live somewhere in between in survival mode. If this feels familiar, you’re not alone.

The rising cost of living has gone far beyond impacting wallets — it’s affecting hearts, minds, and spirits. It forces many of us to live in a constant state of tension, where every decision feels heavier than the last. This article isn’t about savings hacks or working harder; it’s about honoring how this relentless pressure makes you feel and reminding you that peace, joy, and rest don’t demand a price tag.

1k5cn5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1k5cn5y/spring_in_winter/,spring in winter,"(6.16.23)

you make me feel like it's spring during winter, the warmth of sunshine in this stiff chill. just the day before, i was lamenting about how my emotions have been numbed and yet today i was bursting with euphoria just at the thought of seeing you.

 i constantly feel a pull towards you, like a satellite enslaved by your gravitational pull. i could spend hours explaining how orbits are designed or how much fuel a rocket needs to get to god knows where but i stumble over the same six simple words every morning  'flat white and almond croissant, please' i tell you every morning at 10 am. you ask me if i want it heated, although you already know. and i answer you, dragging out the only conversation we ever have. 

my day feels incomplete without your smile, like an addiction you're the vice in which i drown my sorrows away. greedily i drink in your light, intoxicated with the shy glances we exchange- intentional on my part but accidental on yours, after all i know you're just doing your job. haphazardly i inhale the melody of your charming voice and exhale silent fantasies of hearing you say my name teasingly. this limirent insanity keeps me from sinking to the bottom of this dark pit i fell into. 

i know i dont stand a chance but i dont want to leave it like this. but if i were to fall for you, i'd want it to be for who you are and not what you seem like to me. hell, i dont even your name. not yet. i want my infatuation to be real and not a projection of my delusions. you have become the only positive consistent constant in my chaos. my life is falling apart and your coffee and crush on you is quite the only thing keeping me together. where does this leave me?

it's silly because my friends say im stupid to think so but you are too good for me, way out of my league. i dare not even look at you from afar and instead content myself to just bask in your peripheral presence. i like to think im not superficial but you're extremely pleasant to look at while i struggle to even face myself in the mirror. i fear to let my infatuation show on my face lest you get grossed out. so i pretend that you're not the only reason i get up in the morning. 

this attraction terrifies me because i know i dont deserve to feel this way towards you who is just innocently living your life while i disgustingly use you as a my daily dopamine dose. but still i want to see you smile, laugh and maybe feel the tiniest touch of those hardworking hands, run my fingers through that temperately tousled hair and see what color your eyes are in the sunlight. 

this all sounds so pathetic but let me delude myself a little longer. when i think of you, all my worries melt away. you make me want to be better, see some good in myself and for a moment, want to wake up and get out of bed so i can have your gaze land on me for all but 5 seconds.  you'll never see this letter because i'd be crazy stupid to send it because we dont even know each other's names. perhaps i didnt want to know who you were because that would make this all feel more real. and these two months i routinely sought out your figurative warmth felt like a fever dream.

addendum (4.22.25): i still think of you sometimes and hope that one day i'll feel this way about someone again

1k5cmnn,https://i.redd.it/gblhimhaafwe1.jpeg,Zach returns to Twitch with a lazy rebrand.  TWITCH UPDATES.,"The stream starts off with this new loading screen that is so low effort it's not even funny.  He's also replaced the waiting music with the Pink Fairy song by Adam Barta.  It was previously the “you can come and watch me drink my morning coffee” song that Amberlynn used to use, so he really is trying to rebrand and separate himself from her.  

He starts the stream off muted.  You’d think a professional twitch streamer would have this shit figured out by now.  When he finally unmutes himself, he freaks out and says that he wasted an hour and a half of his time earlier because he must have recorded a whole video while muted.

He also has a new subscription alert tone that is freaking annoying.  His viewers even asked him to stop playing that music and he explained that it’s his new alert and he’s just getting a ton of resubscriptions.  Of course he soon gets annoyed and starts complaining about how many subscriptions are coming through. His chat says the new sound is overwhelming and he interrogates them about why they feel that way.  He says they’ll have to just wait and see if they still feel that way after a few days.

Someone in the chat asked if he’s rebranding and he said “not necessarily, but I’m not not rebranding.”  Someone asked if a subscriber made his new layout and Zach said he used his own photoshop and design skills.

Someone asks him to “address the eyebrows,” and Zach said that when his stylist agreed to dye his hair he said that Zach needed eyebrows too.  Zach told the stylist if it looks bad it’s okay because he’s taking a long break from the internet.  So we have confirmation that the subscriber basement hair stylist is indeed the one who created that abomination of hair color and waxed and dyed those unfortunate, uneven eyebrows.  

Someone says his new YouTube profile picture looks like a mugshot and he said “good.”  He said that he actually took that picture for his passport renewal.

He talks about Lady Gaga and how he hasn’t watched her Coachella performance because he’s too mad that he wasn’t able to get tickets to go see her.  He then reminds everyone that he’s going to see Beyonce and a few K-pop groups next month though.  Don’t forget to keep sending him money to financially support him going to concerts, twitchies!

He talks about his main YouTube channel and says he’s not swearing off covering Amberlynn and Foodie Beauty ever again, but he currently doesn’t feel “inspired” to cover Amber.  I bet he'll be back to it by next week, lmao. 

He also admits he put his Darlene videos on the main channel as a way to spite Amberlynn because she thought his discord post was about her.  He’s trying so hard to act unbothered by Amberlynn, but it’s clear that a month later he’s still indeed very bothered.

He says he spent most of his break watching tv and playing some game on his Nintendo Switch.  He then goes on a weird mini rant about people complaining about Nintendo raising prices and says that if people can’t afford it, they just shouldn’t play it, and that Nintendo needs to make money.

He then talks about his figure drawing class and he says that it’s more difficult to draw real people than it is to draw vases.  Uh, no shit.  I guess that’s why he hasn’t posted any drawings from the class, though he says he might in the future.  He emphasizes there are rules about taking photos in the classroom because there are nude models.  Uh, again, no shit.  The chat then asks how many wieners he has drawn. 🤢 Honestly, Zachary Michael is the last person who should be in a classroom drawing live nude models.  I’m sure he’s harassing them to some extent. 

He says the teacher is more direct than he would like, and that she’s “more of an artist than she is a teacher.”  He says his previous male teacher was a lot more encouraging and skilled because he’s a “real teacher.”  He says the new teacher’s critiques about his work are very harsh and he doesn’t like that.  So he really just wants to go to art class to be told how amazing he is, not to actually improve.  And of course he has an issue with the woman teacher. 🙄 

He talks about a few more random things, and he also majorly shades a friend of his who is moving back to her hometown area and he says “that’s crazy, but live your truth, diva, I guess, I don’t know, couldn’t be me personally.”  He says she’s moving “for a partner, if you can believe it.”  Sounds like someone is bitter about losing another couch rotting friend and free access to a streaming subscription.  Oh, and still bitter about being dumped. 

He also explains his new life philosophy to the twitch chat, saying “One thing I’m trying to do moving forward in my life is not to put pressure on myself to do anything.”  Because I’m sure that will work out so great for him.  So ambitious!  ",18,1745344083.0,ZacharyMichaelSnark,4,1.0,False

I've discovered that if I use different flavor additions for the same things, I get a variety.  Like you would if you add pineapple to a basic carrot cake. You know what I mean.   Recently I was given several bottles of the Javvy coffee concentrate you see all the ads for.  Creme Brulee, Salted Caramel, Cookies & Cream and I think one other I can't remember.  Anyway, I've been adding a tablespoon of different ones to my baking and OMG it's changing my cookies and muffins flavor and I'm loving it. I even made a fudge and put in just a tsp of salted caramel concentrate into my vanilla fudge (just your standard 5-min fudge made with condensed milk) and it made it this really nice caramel coffee kind of flavor.  My husband is laughing because I just told him I'm typing this to tell the world.  Maybe this isn't a really new concept but it is to me. ",2,1745344069.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

1k5cl3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1k5cl3q/great_moments_in_parenting_the_first_job_the/,"Great Moments in Parenting: The First Job, The First Firing","You always think things are going to slow down, but in truth, there just is never any ""turning off."" If you do not have wild toddlers nearly ramming their heads on the 90-degree corners of coffee tables, guess what, you now have kindergartners crying while trying to read Biscuit Goes to School or, god help you, the Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Chores.

So, when my oldest had decided to end her taekwondo career we agreed that she would need another activity, and that activity would be a job, since summer was coming fast. She was a good driver (and wow, talking about Dad needing to be ""on"" to get to that point), and we trusted her to be able to drive to school and a job 15 to 30 min away.

But wow. Finding a 16-yr-old their first job is not easy. If you don't know people, you are at the mercy of the online job submission process, something akin to filling out a form and watching your name, address, and over exaggerated bulleted ""experience"" text flush down into the corporate website's black hole, never to be heard from again. Whole Foods had like a, and this is no exaggeration, 25-page form, asking all sorts of questions about work philosophy, school interests, leadership experience, grades, pronouns you've never heard of... on and on. It nearly broke us.

And the poor girl had to craft a resume from nothing - stitching together church volunteer work, summer camps, babysitting and school group projects. And no, she was not actually the one doing the stitching.

One application was also pretty long, but it was different, because it asked lots of hypotheticals:

""If an coworker puts the wrong price on an item do you: A) Politely alert them B) Check with a team leader and make sure it is corrected or C) Correct it for them, they are probably in a rush""

All the questions had this kind of bend of either you be assertive or you confirm with authority. I decided they wanted you to be assertive and not nag authority. It was a gamble, but we answered every question with that in mind.

And lo and behold, a week later, she got an interview! Dozens and dozens of applications to coffee shops, pizza places, grocery stores... nothing. But this department store right around the corner? YES. And she got the job! We couldn't believe it!

And we were very hopeful this would be good for her, because she had lots of anxiety and social issues. She was in therapy, on medication, and partially on the spectrum. This was a huge win. And the job was good. Though there were not many people her age working there, it was mostly older adults, everyone was very nice. Actually kind of good - you never know what riff raff your kids can get mixed up with at a weird job! One bad thing was that management really pushed credit card signups on the cashiers, and well, our quiet polite girl was not one to be pushy, and was constantly in last place at winning signups, so more and more often would get moved to restocking. But, it was still a good job.

Until one day, she came home in tears, and revealed that she was fired.

We couldn't believe it. This poor nervous girl, who had never called in sick, who was 10 minutes early Every Day, who loved going to work, was told that she aided another employee stealing merchandise. Apparently, they had it on video: a coworker was buying some things at her register and snuck through $30 worth of items without paying. Well, we could picture our daughter being tricked, sure. But colluding and collaborating? They even made her sign a form admitting guilt! The poor girl had no idea what was happening. And then, a week later, we got a letter demanding a check for the $30 worth of merchandise!!

We were crushed. Livid. Furious. Emails were written. Phone calls made. We didn't want that job back (and wow would it be hard to not shop there anymore out of principle - last minute easter clothes 5 minutes away is a helluva drug!), but damned if we were going to pay the $30. We got more info. Apparently corporate brought in a security expert and they put cameras in registers. She had a ""nervous and guilty look"" when the incident happened. That is her resting face! We never saw the alleged video, but after a lot of fighting and time and energy - no lawyers woohoo - they wrote back absolving her of the $30. Honestly, I kind of felt half silly burning that much time and energy, but who knows how much it might have escalated. Last thing our daughter needed was a bad credit report!

But now we had to get another job. We taught our rule-following daughter the value of Not Revealing Everything (not quite lying!) and she put on her applications that she was still employed (okay, lying), so she wouldn't have to provide references from her manager. She asked a friend who worked there to be a reference, and can you believe, she said No!, because SHE didn't want to risk lying. Or, just really believed that she stole, who knows. That friendship died :(

But, even with no reference, it worked out. She got a better job, paying more money, with better hours, and working with coworkers her age. And, best yet, she was able to get all her siblings following behind her this same job. Talk about a time saver.

Getting that first job out of the way is always the hardest, but what a real lesson too... losing a job, losing anything, can so often open the door for something better. Also, corporate authority sucks.",3,1745343980.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False

Although of course there is still FOMO, the freedom *from* toxicity and the freedom *to* appreciate what's in the real world made me nostalgic for the years when people related to each other more in person than online.

And so, I'd like to take my chance and find a buddy (strictly SFW) here who I can go out with for coffee and chika, or silent reading/study sessions, or even road trips. I would really love that this buddy has been a consistent gym goer for years with something to show for it (as I am), and we can talk about a lot regarding nutrition and workouts, understands nerdy stuff like calorie counting, or PRs, proper form, or RPE. 

Here's what I have to offer:
- 5’9” muscular and fit
- Been called handsome, pogi, and cute by fellow redditors both guys and girls, but you be the judge
- Wears glasses
- Consummate gym rat for 11 years. I track my food and workouts religiously. I can share a thing or two about workout and nutrition programming.
- Works in communications
- Writes a blog of Japanese film reviews (very niche I know!)
- Does photography as a hobby (such a meditative activity)
- Aspires to teach about cinema someday
- Former museum worker who also knows a thing or two about art appreciation
- Plays instruments and sings
- Drives and has a car
- Has been complimented for being a good listener both at work and among friends
- Pasig

Please be:
- 24-32 years old
- Also a fitness and gym buff with something to show for it. Let’s compare notes on our nutrition and workouts!
- Would love to regularly meet kahit for coffee and presence and chikahan 
- Would appreciate what I bring to the table and would also have something to share, preferably similar in terms of interest 
- Single or taken, basta alam ng jowa mo about me (ayoko maging third party huhu)
- Within Metro Manila

I might be too particular but I guess there’s no harm in trying :) Hit me up if you think we can be buds! ☺️",1,1745343908.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

(cycling, explanations, insights...)","https://preview.redd.it/f7f921k4bfwe1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e82d4e328efae13f461005c3d90f4137b7b7f8e

A few weeks ago, I shared an app here that I originally built for myself. It automatically generates an **optimal schedule for your supplements**, taking into account the ideal **timing**, your **meals**, potential negative **interactions**, and **synergies** between supplements.

Your response has been absolutely incredible! **Over 2000 of you have downloaded the app**, and I’ve received **99% positive feedback**, along with hundreds of recommendations and suggestions. Honestly, this meant a lot to me and greatly motivated me to go further.

I've taken your suggestions and recently added some highly requested features:

**✅ Cycling Mode**  
This feature allows you to automatically cycle your supplements to avoid tolerance buildup. You can set cycles like 2 weeks on / 1 week off, or taking supplements every other day, etc. It’s still in beta, so please let me know if you spot any bugs!

**✅ Insights Page**  
This new page gives you a comprehensive, detailed history of your supplement intake. You can visualize how often you've taken each supplement, your adherence rate, and the total quantity taken over time. Personally, I find it a bit of a gimmick—but a cool one.

**✅ Schedule Explanations**  
The app now clearly explains why each supplement is placed at this time. The goal is to understand exactly why each recommendation is made.

Your enthusiasm makes me want to keep going and dedicate even more of my time to this project. So if you have ideas or features you'd love to see—even if they seem complicated—please let me know

# What's Coming Next:

➡️ **Android version**:  
This is by far the most requested one. I know many of you are eagerly waiting for it, and I’m sorry it’s not publicly available yet. Dozens of you have already joined the Android beta, which needs to run for two full weeks before I can post it publicly. So if everything goes well, it should be available in about a week.  
If you’re really impatient, feel free to DM me your email and I’ll add you to the beta!

➡️ **Interactions with coffee ☕️**  
➡️ **Even more supplements**: You've suggested more than 1000 times, I’ll add the most asked.  
💡 **Another idea: An intelligent questionnaire to spot potential nutritional deficiencie**s based on your lifestyle (diet, activity, outdoor time, gender, etc.). Obviously, this doesn’t replace actual blood tests—which are often costly and uncommon—but it’s an accessible first step to help you ask the right questions.

I just wanted to share the updated version—I think it's even cooler. Your incredible support has been really motivating, and I’m genuinely excited to continue improving it together.

Thank you again for all your help, feedback, and enthusiasm—it means a lot!",1,1745343804.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

I moved back to the area after over a decade away and I’m having trouble finding my community. Anyone else in the same boat?

I’m hoping for some child-free folx to go thrifting, gentle hiking, catch a cocktail/coffee, or even just take our dogs for a play date. I’d love it if they were grounded, funny, compassionate, and smart. Up for adventures, but capable of comfortable silence or stillness. Double dates are fun. If you voted for trump or are anti-vaccine, please move on; we are morally incompatible. 

Me: 41, happily married, drama-free. Atheist. Into science, travel, beers in the sun, interesting conversions, and big laughs. I’m a yoga teacher sans the pseudoscientific nonsense that usually comes along with that. I’m playful/bouncy, but I pay my bills and handle my shit.",5,1745343771.0,PuyallupWA,2,0.73,False

1k5cge3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k5cge3/how_to_survive_withdrawal/,How to survive withdrawal???,"Hey guys, So I have been lurking on this sub for a while. Rn I only drink 1 Celsius per day. It’s 200mg. I’m sure that might sound like a lot to some people but I’ve done 2 a day in the past or 1 plus a latte or pre-workout. 

I guess that’s already a taper of sorts. I want to just quick cold turkey. I don’t have the patience for more tapering. I don’t want to jack around with making tea or coffee or only drinking half the Celsius and either tossing the other half or drinking it flat the next day. I’d rather just quit.

HOWEVER, Jesus Christ, am I useless as FUCK when I don’t drink caffeine. I barely have motivation to get out of bed and I’m extremely cranky and just not nice to me or anyone around me. How do people survive the initial phase? Like I have a job and a family and responsibilities. I feel like I would have to just legit warn everyone that I will be useless and depressed for several weeks. And I would just have to hope it would get better and not drag on longer than that. 

Also like…how do you do bare minimum self care tasks like prepare food to eat, wash laundry, personal hygiene tasks, etc??? 

And so you just take some L’s at work? Cuz I can’t imagine keeping up with everything. I am barely keeping up now. 

Thank you for your consideration! ",3,1745343659.0,decaf,5,1.0,False

1k5cfue,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k5cfue/should_you_buy_the_elite_gourmet_4cup_coffee/,Should You Buy the Elite Gourmet 4-Cup Coffee Maker Review for Your Home?,"Waking up to the intoxicating aroma of freshly brewed coffee is one of life’s simple pleasures. For the past month, I’ve been using the *Elite Gourmet EHC4128 Automatic 4-Cup Brew & Drip Coffee Maker*, and let me tell you, it’s been an interesting ride. Compact, sleek, and touted as one of the go-to drip coffee machines for small spaces, this coffee maker certainly brings its personality to the kitchen. I tested it in my tiny apartment, my cousin borrowed it for their dorm (yes, they didn’t want to give it back), and even an RV-bound friend gave it a spin. Spoiler alert: it's not without fault, but there’s plenty to talk about here.

**The Design That Fits Anywhere**

This coffee maker is small but mighty. Measuring just 8 inches deep, 9 inches wide, and 6 inches high, it hugs my countertop without gobbling up precious space. Its minimalist black finish complements almost any kitchen decor while maintaining a modern, slightly futuristic vibe. I also found it pleasing that this machine is light—just over 2 pounds—which makes moving it around or storing it a breeze for those with limited kitchen real estate.

[View Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0czqctd4k/)

**Ease of Use and Daily Brewing**

Operating this coffee maker couldn’t be simpler. With its fully automatic mode and intuitive on/off switch, even someone half-asleep in the morning can handle it. The semi-transparent water reservoir with a built-in level indicator is an absolute gem for avoiding overfills. During one particularly groggy morning, I came dangerously close to flooding the machine—thankfully, the clear markings saved me from disaster. And brewing just the right amount? This delightfully includes a 4-cup carafe, which makes it versatile whether I want a solo coffee binge or need to share with my roommate.

**The “Pause N Serve” Feature Is a Game Changer**

Here’s where this machine feels like it’s reading my mind. The Pause N Serve function lets me sneak a quick pour even before the brewing cycle is complete. I can’t count the number of mornings I’ve found myself anxiously hovering over machines in the past, waiting for that last drop. This feature obliterates all waiting anxiety. Although it’s super convenient, it isn’t exactly mess-proof. I had a drip here and there if I wasn’t quick enough, so speed is of the essence when using this.

**Strengths**

- Space-saving design perfect for dorms, apartments, or RVs.  
- The intuitive “Pause N Serve” feature lets you sneak a cup mid-brew.  
- Reusable filter reduces waste and headaches over buying paper filters.  
- Keep Warm function keeps coffee drinkable for longer while awaiting my laziness to end.  

**The Reusable Filter and Eco-Friendliness**

I’m not really one for disposable paper filters, so the included reusable filter was a major plus for me. It feels great knowing I’m making an environmentally-friendly choice every morning. Cleaning it isn’t a Herculean task either—just a quick rinse, pop it back into place, and you’re ready for the next use. That said, if you’re the type that’s hard on your coffee equipment, the filter feels a little delicate, so proceed with care.  

**Negatives**

- The reusable filter, while convenient, feels slightly fragile—handle gently.  
- Not ideal for bigger coffee-drinking groups (maxes out at 4 cups).  

**Competing Options**

One thing that struck me as I tested this machine was how much it stood out compared to similar drip coffee makers in its league. Machines like the *Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Mini Brew* and the *Hamilton Beach 4-Cup Coffee Maker* are fair alternatives. However, what gives this one the edge is its Pause N Serve feature. I noticed others lacked this or didn’t execute it quite as neatly. On the flip side, the drip control on those models felt somewhat better executed than here. Comparing overall costs and the inclusion of reusable filters swayed me towards this device, but your choice might differ if quick brewing for larger families is your priority.

**Affordable Quality**

While pricing fluctuates, this machine feels like a solid investment for its convenience, eco-friendliness, and ability to fit inside compact spaces. You won’t find extravagant bells and whistles, nor should you expect it to compete with commercial-grade brewers. But for what it offers—easy setup, reliable performance, and a modern design—it delivers excellent value overall. For someone pinching pennies or who just doesn’t want an overcomplicated gadget dominating their routine, it's worth exploring.

* Saint Frank. Unfortunately, they use Kalita-style brewers with automatic drip machines. No barista involvement.
* Ritual. They have V60s, but my pourover was very mediocre.
* Verve (in Palo Alto, but I assume similar in SF). Also Kalita-style brewers with automatic drip machines.

I'm aware of Coffee Movement, HI NRG, and Golden Goat — do they use actual V60s or automated Kalitas like the above?

My entire life any time I had one no matter what I did that feeling would hang around for minimum like 30 minutes. It freaked me out. Now don't get me wrong, quitting had me basically in a straight jacket of panic for about a week, and since then it's been depression. But that moment restressed why I quit to begin with: long term anxiety relief. It may not be that easy again or it may who knows. But something to consider for people who use nicotine out there. I feel like this constant deprsssion from quitting is my body getting used to discomfort and not having that as a ""rescue"" (which it didn't help THAT much when I panicked but it did a little) anyways, just wanted to share that.

About three weeks ago, I started adding **fermented carrots** to my meals — just a few spoonfuls a day. I fermented them myself with sea salt and water. Honestly, I expected nothing. I just figured it was a cheap way to support gut health.

What actually happened surprised me.

By the end of the first week, I noticed I was way more mentally “on.” I could sit down and work without zoning out or needing breaks every 20 minutes. Normally I bounce between tasks or feel cloudy most of the day — but this felt different. Sharper. Calmer.

Even more surprising:

* My skin, especially around my nose and chin, looked clearer and less inflamed.
* My scalp (usually dry and itchy) completely chilled out.
* My energy stayed steady all day, even if I didn’t eat super clean.

The weird part? I’ve tried probiotics, yogurt, kefir, all that stuff — and never had any noticeable effects. But this basic little jar of fermented carrots seems to be doing something.

No other major diet changes. Still drinking coffee, still snacking occasionally.

Anyone else had results like this from homemade ferments?

1k5cblx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k5cblx/aitah_for_calling_out_a_parasite_and_after/,AITAH for calling out a parasite and after laughing at their personal family drama,"Back in college me and some the friends I met had a mutual friend who was kinda cool for the most part but was a complete mooch, parasite, or tagalong. 

She would bum off weed from our friends whenever they'd go to toke somewhere just in it bc hey doesn't have any money or what she did have she'd use in the most cheapskate way. I didn't smoke too often but did so every so often with our friends and at least bring some snacks to share. 

Occasionally she'd ask any of us for change so they could use the vending machine and on other occasions from what my friends told me they'd lend her money she'd borrow and never paid back bc I think she dropped out of our university after a few semesters and went to a community college afterwards.  

Another thing I knew was she'd trade things for weed and other random things from her part time like coffee just what she had, I think she worked as a barista for a time but not sure and when ur a college student bartering works I guess. One thing I should mention which was just hypocritical was she was a feminist in name only so you can imagine how that was if you've met those type in modern times. 

She also had a drug problem bc she would be doing oxi and talking about like it was nothing, probably stole random things from our friends. I remember one specific time I wasn't there at our usual hangouts and one of our friend told me he had caught her stealing a bottle of fucking barbeque sauce of all things she tried strategically putting in her purse from his fridge.

She'd talk a lotta of shit on other people over small things or if they said things to her that weren't even offensive but she'd take it that way. Dated some fuck boi who fit the description and was just overall demanding when they had no business doing so. 

I think one the funniest moments two of my friends told me was running into her somewhere walking near our college campus (at this point she'd already dropped out and was just working I think) and before she even said hi one of them said to her, I don't have any drugs or money. She stood dumbfounded and they just kept walking.

So later on through the sister of one of my other friends I'd learn that she was just working some retail job and telling quite a few people not even in confidence that her mom who also worked some retail job was cheating on her terminally I'll husband. Now picture that being told to you by someone who regularly uses oxi. 

Anyway my friend posted that on some social media app, I think it was yik yak. Sometime days after she must of found out from one of her no good friends bc she told her and then said my friend was attacking her and he had no right to to have done so.

The rest of our mutual friends had a laugh and were also in disbelief and me just being an observer just said well we know where she gets it from.

My comment made it back to her bc it was made into bigger drama than it actually was and I simply said go fuck yourself you mooch. I always wondered if she told her fuck boi boyfriend but he wasn't going to do shit bc he was a pussy. 

Anyway, posted this bc I thought it was simply a taste of their own medicine and was reminded of that period after recently learning they now live in the pnw and it makes total sense giving the scene in most cities there.

Turmeric Curcumin (naturewise)
Potassium (Nature Bounty) 
Omega 3 Fish Oils 630mg EPA + DHA (Wiley’s Finest) 
& 
gut feelings probiotics + good to glow (Love wellness) 

I also eat exotic fruit such as dragon fruit, coconut water, mamey, cinnamon apples

along with a primary Mediterranean diet. 

I’m looking into a more plan based keto diet later because I used to be vegetarian and would like to go back to my roots on this.

I’m on Lamitrogine 200mg for BP1 with Psychotic Features (3 episodes: diagnosed in 2014, 7 year eemission off meds! Then after abusing prescription weed and coffee had two episodes very close to each other in 2022 & 2025 off meds), so it feels like I have been recovering for 3 years from an episode because from the latest ones.

Therefore, I have mixed feelings about meds because had it not been the substance abuse I was abuse I was able to go almost a decade without them if not longer have I’d refrain from using high levels of weed and coffee that have the opposite mechanisms. 

I want to stay away from long term use of AP’s. Currently on Latuda as an adjunct mainly for bipolar depression. It seems most of the newer meds only target this and not Mania. 

So, I use Seroquel PRN (as needed) when I begin to show signs. Even though, I have fully tested this out yet. I just know other people have similar emergency interventions with these sedating AP’s and don’t take them everyday. 

I’m praying that due to cutting out these substances that I will not have to be hospitalized for any future episodes and that I can primarily use Lamitrogine as a monotherapy maintanence for my condition to keep it in remission with minor flair ups where I can intervene with adjunct meds as necessary. 

I stay in close communication with my psychiatrist and have a therapist who has been diagnosed with BP1 also and she takes Lamitrogine 300mg with Zyprexa PRN (as needed) also so I might consider increasing my dose to that once I get off of Latuda since I seem be recovering from my depressive cycle just on 20mg of it.

Lastly, I take Clonazepam 0.5mg as needed for anxiety & panic attacks. Although, I am concerned about relying on this due to its addictive potential and despite it being prescribed don’t want it to show up in an employee drug test for benzos even though I believe they test for different ones at higher dosages.

1k5cahz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k5cahz/my_ex_cheated_with_me_and_is_continuing_to_lie/,My ex cheated with me and is continuing to lie,"My ex (25m) and I (22F) dated from 2022-2024. We broke up but remained friends with benefits until September 2024, when he got a girlfriend. I was quite upset, since he claimed I was everything he could wish for, he just needed to grow and couldn’t be with me. 

We would catch up over text every few months, but I still wasn’t over him fully, so we couldn’t be real friends. We agreed long ago that we would always be there for each other no matter what, wherever we are, but that didn’t help my heart. 

Some time in February 2025, he opened up to me about his troubles in his relationship, suggesting he would break up with her soon. We flirted a little, but I really tried hard to keep it platonic, as I didn’t want to be caught up in him again. 

I had a surgery and got sedated on a thursday early March, and needed someone to pick me up, and only he was available. We ended up cuddling and having sex twice that day. I asked him if he regretted it, and he said no. He said he only did it because it was me. He told me he was going to tell his girlfriend what he did, and “whatever happens, happens”

I felt bad for being a homewrecker, but I am not the one that cheated on anyone. (I don’t know the girl)
We agreed to meet up on the sunday (3 days later) over coffee and talk about it, as well as life and any troubles, but he blocked my number. I honestly just assumed he regretted it and accepted it. I checked his instagram and saw he spent the weekend with his girlfriend (so he didn’t tell her).

He calls me later that day, telling me he only blocked me to avoid any drama with her seeing a message from me. I found it weird since he was planning to tell her, but ignored it. We were meant to have dinner instead but didn’t answer my messages. The next day he said he’d call me, but didn’t. At this point, I was fed up, and sent a message, unappreciative of him wasting my time. I didn’t like the blocking unblocking and basically left it at that. I blocked him.

I would occasionally check his social media, to see that they were still together so I was considering telling the girlfriend what happened, but I decided their relationship was none of my business and maybe he was planning to tell her later on. 
He calls me a couple weeks later on another phone number, upset that I had blocked him. He said that he told her and that they broke up, and she blocked him on everything. He said he enjoyed having sex with me, and I suggested that we could have casual sex since he was single now. 

I checked his social media, only to see that they were in fact still together. I gathered he maybe lied to me to keep me quiet.

He called me a week later to talk to me about something, but I was busy. 

My messages wouldn’t deliver over the next 20 days, so I told him I was moving far away, and to never contact me ever again unless its an emergency that he needs help. The message didn’t deliver of course. 
He booty calls me today (9 days later) asking to have sex. I say no. I say that I think he lied to me and that he never told her, and that they are still together. He gets mad, asking how I know. Who told me. He rants about spies and about me being dishonest with him. He brings up how he was always there for me, like picking me up from my surgery, which he says he shouldnt have done. 

He claims he did tell her, but they got back together (which I don’t believe since they still followed each other and posted each other on stories during this whole time, being lovey dovey). I don’t tell him I know hes lying, but i ask why hes called me today then if they are together now. He doesn’t answer my question. He says he wants to talk to me, and asks me questions about me moving away. I try to be understanding and listen. This conversation ends in him being super mad about the “spies” and that we will never speak to each other again. We delete each others numbers. 

I have wanted to message his girlfriend this whole time, but NOW I feel so much more inclined to do it, as hes continuing to lie. 

My question for you guys is, should I tell her everything. I don’t think my intention is good. I am not really doing it to save her, I would be doing it to teach him a lesson. To make him suffer for what he did. I believe this is not something I can do with a clean conscience, but my friends are telling me to do it. Should I tell her.

* Drop in product ideas, landing page drafts, tweets, pricing models, basically anything you want feedback on
* Simulate 80+ diverse user groups: marketers, Gen Z, boomers, founders, whoever
* Pull insights across AI models like OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, Diffbot, etc.
* Get a ranked list of the best options, with sentiment analysis, demographic breakdowns, and even new ideas

I used it to test social media posts. Worked like a charm.

But this overall template could be used for much more. From testing new features before building, comparing product ideas, customer research without cold emailing and validating value props or startup pitches

And because it’s no-code: you can tweak the prompt, change the audience, or connect the results to a dashboard in Bolt or Framer without writing a line of code.

In Season 4, in ""The Weight"" episode, during the end where Furio and Silvio are ordered to confront the speeding maniac corvette driver, Dominic, Tony begins to light up a superb looking Vegas Robaina ""Don Alejandro,"" which is regarded as a top notch smoke in the cigar world. It's a prominente vitola, which is a very large cigar, especially by Cuban standards, a vitola reserved only for the finest tobacco and rollers Cuba has to offer. The prominente is slightly larger and wider than a ""Churchill"" vitola. It is perhaps my favorite style of the larger cigars, though typically I prefer something with a smaller ring gauge. The most famous example of a prominente is probably the Partagas Lusitania, which is a legendary stick, considered by many to be one of, if not, the finest cigar ever made. This is Michael Jordan's favorite cigar and the one he is pictured with most often. I'm quite sure Tony/James puffs some of these too, especially in early seasons (I may report back later if I can definitively snipe one). 

It's kind of a hard thing to do because the bands have changed greatly since the era of the show. Subsequently, the faking of Cuban cigars has become so rampant that the more humble (and better imo), understated bands have been replaced by flashier logos with more gold and sometime even holographic printing, which make faking a much less profitable and successful venture, especially to those selling to people who know their shit. Fortunately, I have full on cigar autism so I can recognize some of these older bands, which you can research on Cuban Cigar Website if you're so inclined. 

Another thing that makes it difficult to tell is that Tony/James often removes the band before smoking, which is actually a really classy move. Many consider this the most respectful way to appreciate a cigar, while others could make a solid argument for leaving it on to pay tribute to the brand. I often do a mix of both where I start with it on and remove it about halfway through (I'd have to anyways as, if I get a good stick, I smoke it until it's burning my fingertips). 

I have a pretty good idea of what he's smoking even still as I'm such a nut I can kind of tell the cigar just by the wrapper. Interestingly enough, they each have pretty unique shades with their own fluctuations (Cuban cigars are notoriously inconsistent, it's one of the unfortunate prices you pay for the good ones). For instance, Cuban Romeo Y Julietas often use a rosado wrapper with a light, cherry-red sheen to them. Montecristo's are famous for an often dark, Colorado Maduro on most of their vitolas. Cohibas have a golden shine to them and the Vegas Robaina like Tony/James is smoking in this scene have a tan, cream coffee type color. Not all these cigars always look like this, but it's widely considered that when these brands have these looking wrappers, they are the best they have to offer. 

I'd say off the top of my head that the most common Cuban smokes by Tony/James on the show are Cohiba Esplendidos (a good example of a true Churchill size btw), Montecristo no. 2s (these are gifted to ""Cooze"" in season 1 as well and are arguably the most famous Cuban smoke of all time), Partagas Lusitanias, Ramone Allones Gigantes, and Vegas Robaina Don Alejandros. James/Tony had REALLY fine taste in Cubans as these are all some of the finest cigars ever conceived and I'm totally jealous of his ability to break them out casually. Serious flex. 

Vegas Robaina Don Alejandros and Ramone Allones Gigantes are really interesting choices because these are far less famous than the other ones above. The Montecristos, Partagas, and Cohibas, are considered flagship brands which Cuba exceedingly manufactures and prominently distributes worldwide, but few are aware of brands like Vegas Robaina and Ramone Allones as these marcas are mostly produced for Cuban nationals and are, low-key, as good as the international brands. They're a good get if you can find them as they're often cheaper despite no quality difference. This indicates that James/Tony either really knew his shit or had a really good cigar dealer. 

Interestingly enough, by the time of this episode, the Cuban decline was definitely starting to become noticeable and James/Tony and the show seemed to jump the gun on this and switch to NIcarguan/Dominican marcas on the early side which is actually a very realistic and wise choice for the time. Legitimate brand dealership was definitely part of that decision too. Though this is during an era where Cubans began noticeably declining, it's highly possible that what James/Tony is smoking is not one out of a current box for the time, which could be a complete gamble to try and enjoy. It's more than likely he's smoking an ""ager"" from his humidor. Cuban cigars need to be aged anyways so thankfully, even though Cubans had hit a rough spot, a lot of guys were probably smart enough to save some sticks in their humidors for years to come.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HaRm4pBXPR): **April 13, 2025**

So for some background my ex husband and I ended things over twenty years ago. When our son was two he stepped out. At the time I was a a stay at home mom and going to nursing school full time. He was paying for my schooling. After he left I asked him if he would keep paying for my school so I could finish with no debt. He agreed saying it was the least he could do. A few months after that he got his affair partner pregnant.

Once she got pregnant she demanded he stop paying for my schooling. It was 1/5 of their income and she said that money needed to go towards their new baby. He refused and kept paying for the remaining year and a half I had left.

Over the years I continued my education and now I’m a nurse practitioner. I do well for myself and I never remarried.

Onto the problem. My son called me and told me he and his wife are expecting. I was ecstatic. I asked if I could come over sometime during the weekend by and give them some things (his favorite stuffy as a child, a check, and some other small sentimental things). He said yes so I went over earlier today.

I came by and gave him everything including a check for a few thousand dollars. (For baby stuff, co-pays, the nursery, or anything else they may want). My son and his wife thanked me and told me the money would be very helpful.

My ex-husband and his wife came over and little while later (they surprised them with dinner and didn’t know i’d be there) and saw the check on the counter. My ex’s wife asked about it and I said “Oh well I wanted to help out where I could, everything’s so expensive nowadays!” I was really just trying to be polite but i don’t think this is any of her business. This woman had the audacity to say “Well maybe since you have all this money now you can finally pay us back all that money you took when you went to college.” I was dumbfounded. My ex has literally never brought up me paying him back. He’s always said it was the least he could do for both me and our son.

My ex has done very well for himself in his career. I didn’t see how or why they’d need the money so I asked them “Do you guys need the money or something?” and my ex said no and she said “Of course not, it’s about principle.” I told her I will absolutely not be paying them back for college tuition from over twenty years ago especially when she ended up in our marital home while I was living in a small apartment barely making ends meet for years after I initially finished school. I’ve never been bitter or mean, I’ve always been civil since our kids are siblings but my blood was boiling. I left shortly after that.

According to my son this has been a point of contention in their marriage. She’s brought it up a few times over the years in front of him. And she’s insisting to him that he needs to convince me to finally “pay back what they’re owed”. The biggest issue is now that the whole damn family is involved. I got calls from three separate family members saying I need to get over myself and just pay it back. So AITA here?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA - He created a mess. Did he pay alimony? Did he take it off his taxes?

> **OOP:** We didn’t have any court ordered alimony or child support while I was in school. He just paid for the school since it was so expensive. I’m not sure if he took it off his taxes he just gave me the money every month. Once the divorce was finalized shortly after i finished school we made arrangements for child support but no alimony.

**Commenter 2:** Tell her it was the adultery tax or that her husband was ensuring that his son would have a good life with either parent. NTA

> **OOP:** This is exactly what my ex said. He wanted to make sure we could both afford things for our son. It was in a way a good investment for him because we went half on basically every activity he was in, his first car, and his college tuition. We definitely couldn’t have done that if I only had a high school education.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. You could be petty by donating the amount (in installments) to a charity that helps people earn their nursing degrees (and/or the general medical field) in her name.

> **OOP:** This is a really good idea actually

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/D2hT3Ofb6Y): **April 15, 2025 (two days later)**

So first I want to clarify some things. Yes it was OUR marital home, we bought it after getting married. I didn’t fight so hard for it in the divorce for a few reasons, mostly that she was borderline harassing me about how they needed the house for their “growing family”. I also didn’t want to deal with a longer and more drawn out divorce and it would’ve been if I fought for the house. Yes he bought me out of the house however it really wasn’t much as it was late 2007. Most of it went towards credit card debt anyway. Another thing, when he was paying for my schooling we were still legally married. The divorce didn’t finalize until after i graduated. There was no child support until after I graduated. There was never any alimony. I did live in the house while I was in school and they lived in an apartment. He paid all those bills including hers after she got pregnant. So his finances were tight at the time. The “family” that called weren’t MY relatives. They were my ex’s and his wives relatives. I thought they were family, they’ve since been blocked.

Onto the update. I got off work yesterday to find a few missed calls from my son. When I called him back he tells me that his stepmom has now asked for the money from the check since it was “almost the same amount” they spent on my college. She said it was obvious Id never “pay my debts” and that i would “just give him (my son) more money anyways” I’m stunned. I’m pissed. I don’t know what has possessed her to think to ask my son for money intended for his family. I tell my son to ignore her and i’ll handle it.

So next I call my ex. It goes straight to voicemail. I try again a few minutes later and it’s the same thing. So I reluctantly call my ex’s wife and she answers immediately. I tell her the three of us (my ex, her, and me) need to meet first thing in the morning to discuss the “debt”. Im thinking this needs to happen in person with all three of us so there’s no confusion. She agrees.

This morning we met at a coffee shop near my ex’s work. As soon as they sit down I say, “So [ex’s wife] want to tell me why you think it’s appropriate to ask my son for money?” My ex looks at her and says, “You asked [our son] for money?”

She starts, on about how she was only asking for the money they’re “owed” and she didn’t ask for more than was on the check. Then she says “For years we struggled due to paying for your school. For years we couldn’t afford a new car, a new house, or a nanny. My kids had to share a room.” She goes on about her “struggles” I started to tune her out because I keep thinking there’s no way she’s this deluded.

It may have been inappropriate but I laughed. I literally took out thousands in credit card debt to keep me and my son afloat while my at the time husband was shacking up with her and PAYING HER BILLS. My ex looks at her and says “What the hell Sarah.”

I added “It’s laughable you think you’re owed anything from while you were a mistress. We were MARRIED when he paid for my schooling, it’s quite literally none of your business how he chose to spend money. You had zero entitlement to his money until you said ‘I do’ and from what I recall that wasn’t until years after the divorce was even finalized. Do not contact me or my son about this money again. You will NEVER see a dime from me.”

She rolls her eyes and gets up to leave. My ex tells her he’s going to stay for a minute. After she’s gone he asks why I didn’t just call him and tell him about what was going on, said he would’ve handled it and that it didn’t have to go this far. I say I did call him, twice actually and this is how we figured out she blocked my number from his phone. So those of you who said she’s just very insecure, you were absolutely correct.

I tell him that she involved his sister, cousin, and his sister in law. That I got several calls and texts from them telling me I should just pay back my “debt” finally. I tell him that she involved the family and then asked our son for money intended for his baby. She’s crossed too many lines. He apologizes and says he’ll make sure she doesn’t bother me about it again. We both leave after that.

My son told me he blocked her number and doesn’t want her at his house until she apologizes. That’s pretty much it for now.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Wow, your ex's wife needs a reality check! Maybe she should start a GoFundMe for her 'struggles' instead of asking for money from your son.

> **OOP:** What’s weird about this is that my ex makes significantly more than I do. They’re anything but struggling financially.

**Commenter 2:** This seems like a weird power trip from her

> **OOP:** You’re probably right

**Commenter 3:** She is a very insecure person. She is jealous of you. She took your man, he is trash she can have him but you are thriving and she is jealous because you did what you had to do and are thriving. Her being his mistress didn't destroy you so she is just holding on to this money thing. Good for you. Remember to always be petty. It's good for the soul. Glad you had the chat and I hope this annoyance is over for your and congrats on becoming a grandma.

> **OOP:** “Always be petty. It’s good for the soul”

**Commenter 4:** I hope ex and mistress get divorced. They find deserve a “happily ever after” and more importantly your son doesn’t deserve to have that psycho around him.

> **OOP:** Yeah honestly the person I feel the worst for here is my son. He grew up with a woman who hated his mom for no good reason and apparently always held a grudge over me getting an education. I can’t imagine after what she did recently he’d want her super involved as a grandma. I don’t think that’ll go down well.

**Downvoted Commenter:** Yes, you’re the asshole. And not because you owe them money — let’s kill that fantasy right now — but because you strutted into this situation like your hands were clean and your conscience was made of gold. Spoiler alert: it’s not. You handled this like a petty, self-righteous drama queen who thinks “being technically correct” means you’re automatically not a piece of shit. Hate to break it to you — it doesn’t.

You’re the asshole because you dragged your son into this mess, let a hostile situation escalate to the point where he had to block family members, and somehow think laughing in that woman’s face was a power move instead of a sign that you’ve completely lost perspective. You’re not the bigger person. You’re just louder.

Yes, she’s delusional. Yes, she’s entitled. Yes, she’s a homewrecker with a victim complex. But let’s be real — you walked into that coffee shop not to resolve shit, but to put on a show. You wanted the last word. You wanted the applause. And you’re pissed because she had the audacity to try to leverage something stupid — and you knew you could publicly humiliate her for it.

And congratulations. You did. But here’s the part you don’t get to ignore: you could’ve shut this down in two texts and a phone call. You wanted the confrontation. You wanted to win. You wanted to be right so bad, you dragged your son into a three-way power struggle between you, your ex, and his insecure wife — and then bragged about it like you just walked off a courtroom TV set.

You don’t owe her money. But don’t act like you handled this with grace. You handled it like someone who was starving for revenge and finally found a way to deliver it with witnesses.

So yes, you’re the asshole. Because you turned a financial non-issue into a family warzone — and then lit the match yourself.

> **OOP:** I tried contacting my ex to get him to handle this. She blocked my number from his phone. SHE brought the family into this. SHE contacted my son and asked him for money. All I did was call her out. I admit, I snapped. I already told her I wasn’t giving her money. I don’t know how much more graceful I could’ve handled this.

(ADHD Edition),"I want to start by saying thanks to all on this sub who offered words of encouragement and tips, it was great to have a place to go when I was spiraling. Hopefully some of this will help those out there who are still working toward it. I went in SURE I was going to fail and planning (even during the exam) for what I would do ""next time."" Thankfully, there doesn't have to be a next time!

Here's what I did:

* 35 hour PMP course on Udemy with Sabri C.
   * I took it kind of slow, it took me about 9 months to complete it after some stops and starts. Half hour a day while I ate my lunch. 
* PMI Study Hall
   * I started PMI Study hall 7 months ago. I went through the Learning Plan content pretty fast but in spurts. Some of it didn't seem relevant, but I think overall it helped.
   * Just keep taking test questions.
      * I took all of the full-length exams on weekend days
      * I took the 15 question quizzes as often as I could find the motivation to do it
      * My average practice exam score was 68% and my average score on practice was about 75% the day before I took the exam.

 

* Test day:
   * I went to test in-person. Having a room to force my focus was absolutely necessary.
   * You can change your screen colors (a nice surprise) I took about 99% of the test using white text on black, but I did have a matching question where the options didn't show, so I had to switch back to black on white for that.
   * The two 10-minute breaks come after question 60 and question 120. This happens automatically and a proctor will come and get you and escort you out of the room.
   * You can comment on the exam questions and that will go back to PMI, so just be aware of that.
   * The testing center I went to (Seattle) did not have any kind of vending machine or anything, but they did allow you to access your locker for food and drinks. My lesson learned is to bring my coffee and water with me if I ever take another exam!
   * The results didn't show on the screen for me, they gave me a sheet of paper as I checked out that gave me my provisional pass info. 

When answering questions

* Think about the FIRST step you would do as a PM, some of the questions will have answers for things you should do in the future, but think of it first
* I didn't get any questions where I had to do calculations, just asking either which calculation I need to provide (but only one of those). It helped me more to remind myself going in that SPI and CPI less than one bad and greater than one is good.

 Post-test: 

* It took almost exactly 24 hours to get my final results. 
* The results are kind of useless, but I know I was about 2/3 above target and 1/3 at target.

Sorry it's a long post, but I hope it helps some folks!

The cold iron gates of the prison in Hoverdale creaked open.    
  
Sunlight fell on Lauren Bennett's gaunt, sallow face.    
  
The clothes she had worn when she was incarcerated now hung loosely on her frail frame.    
  
She had endured five dark, endless years in prison. Today, she was finally free.  
  
Dragging her legs, Lauren hobbled out of the prison, step by slow step.    
  
She moved sluggishly, not because she didn't want to walk faster, but because she simply couldn't.    
  
A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's deep-set, brooding face.    
  
His gaze swept over her injured leg. He let out a cold scoff, the mockery in his eyes blatant. ""After five years in prison, you're still putting on an act.""    
  
Lauren's heart clenched unexpectedly, and a sour sting rose in her eyes.    
  
Elliot Bennett was her biological brother.    
  
Ever since she had been brought back to the Bennett family from the orphanage at fifteen, she had done everything she could to please him.    
  
Yet for the sake of an adopted sister who wasn't even related to him by blood, he had personally falsified evidence to convict her of attempted murder.    
  
Five years had passed, and he was still as sharp-tongued and as disgusted with her as ever.    
  
Lauren swallowed the bitterness, pretending not to see Elliot as she limped forward.    
  
Elliot's face stiffened.    
  
She had ignored him.    
  
In his memory, Lauren had always clung to him, eager to please.    
  
When he came home, she would bring him his slippers.    
  
When he was tired, she would massage his shoulders.    
  
When he had trouble sleeping, she would bring him chamomile tea every night.    
  
When work kept him too busy to come home for dinner, she would wait outside his office with a thermos, undeterred by rain or shine.  
  
During the three years she had been in their home, his chronic stomach issues had eased. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in the middle of the night from the pain.    
  
Today, he had actually felt a hint of joy when he heard she was being released. He had even postponed an international meeting to pick her up.    
  
He had expected her to be overjoyed at seeing him, had even prepared himself for her to break down and complain about the suffering she had endured.    
  
He had never imagined she would greet him with nothing but silence and indifference.    
  
The admiration in her eyes was long gone. All that remained was distance.    
  
A strange, hollow feeling rose in his chest, irritating him. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, veins bulging on the back of his hand.    
  
His voice came out harsher than he intended. ""Get in the car.""    
  
The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them. With a frown, he forced himself to soften his tone. ""Dad and Mom know you're out today. They've prepared a welcome-home dinner for you.""    
  
*Dad and Mom. Such familiar yet foreign words.*    
  
In the orphanage, she had dreamed of having parents who would love her, who would spoil her like a princess.    
  
She had waited and longed for it for fifteen years.    
  
Fifteen years later, her wish had finally come true.    
  
She had parents now, even a tall, handsome, and capable brother.  
  
But the beloved daughter of the family wasn't her. It was the adopted daughter they had raised since childhood, Willow Bennett.    
  
Those people weren't her parents. They were Elliot and Willow's parents.    
  
Lauren scoffed at herself.    
  
During those three years in that family, she had endured endless cold shoulders and humiliation. She had always known she was unwanted. There was no reason to go back and subject herself to it again.   
  
Though she walked slowly, she never stopped.    
  
Her indifference, her stubborn retreat, stung Elliot's eyes and ignited a nameless fury in his chest.    
  
He pushed open the car door and strode after her, his long legs easily closing the distance. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. ""Have you had enough of this act?""    
  
Thrown off balance, Lauren crashed to the ground. Pain shot through her injured leg, her face turning deathly pale.    
  
Elliot's anger flared. ""Still playing weak? Is this your new trick?""    
  
""Don't forget, you were the one who pushed Elaine down the stairs five years ago and left her in a coma. You even tried to frame Willow for it. Five years in prison, and you still haven't learned your lesson? Looks like it wasn't enough to reform you.""  
  
With that, he grabbed her and hauled her up without an ounce of care. His voice was laced with disgust. ""Don't think your sentence erases your sins. As long as Elaine remains unconscious, your crime will never be absolved. And you still owe Willow an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""    
  
Lauren only found it laughable.    
  
She had explained before. Elaine Gray wasn't pushed by her. It was Willow.    
  
But no one had believed her. They had all chosen Willow's side.    
  
She was the biological daughter of the Bennett family, yet everyone had placed their trust in Willow's words instead.    
  
She was guilty, indeed. Guilty of ever returning. Guilty of ever hoping for a love that was never hers.    
  
She had learned her lesson. She would change.    
  
She would leave, far away, and never again fight for the affection of a family that didn't want her.    
  
*Why is Elliot so displeased?*    
  
She calmly pulled her hand from his grip and took a step back, putting distance between them.    
  
Her deliberate withdrawal made Elliot's chest tighten with frustration. His mind flashed with images of the old Lauren, the girl who had once followed him around, desperately trying to win his favor.    
  
Suppressing his anger, he tried to soften his voice. ""Come home with me.""    
  
Lauren lowered her eyes, her expression blank, as if she couldn't even be bothered to look at him.    
  
Her lifeless demeanor made Elliot's rage boil over.    
  
Five years in prison, and if she had learned anything, it was how to grow a temper.    
  
Just as he was about to snap, a warm, gentle voice interrupted.    
  
""Laurie.""    
  
Lauren's body tensed. Her heart, which had been numb for so long, clenched in an instant.    
  
Even after five years, she recognized that voice immediately.    
  
It was Lucas Reed, her childhood friend.    
  
She saw a pair of polished leather shoes enter her line of sight. A deep, magnetic voice spoke above her.    
  
""Laurie, congratulations on your freedom.""    
  
If anyone else had said that, she would have politely replied, ""Thank you.""    
  
But coming from Lucas, the words grated on her ears.    
  
Her most trusted childhood friend, Lucas, had taken on his first case after graduation as Willow's defense attorney, the one who had put her behind bars.    
  
Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Laurie, Willow has never suffered before. She wouldn't survive in prison. Can you take the blame for her?""    
  
*Willow couldn't suffer, but I could?*  
  
Just because she was used to hardship, she deserved to take the fall for a crime she didn't commit.  
  
Sending the real Bennett daughter to prison had made Lucas famous overnight in Hoverdale.    
  
Five years ago, he had still been a fresh graduate, a little green around the edges.    
  
Five years later, he had become one of the city's most renowned attorneys, exuding power and confidence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, closer than real siblings.    
  
When other kids bullied her, he had always defended her, swearing, ""As long as I'm here, no one will ever hurt you.""    
  
He had promised that when he became a lawyer, he would put anyone who hurt her behind bars.    
  
But later, when Willow had hurt her time and time again, he had dismissed her pain with a casual, ""Laurie, you're too sensitive. Willow isn't like that.""    
  
In the end, it was he, of all people, who had protected the one who hurt her and personally sent her to prison.    
  
...  
  
The air grew heavy with silence.    
  
Lucas' smile slowly stiffened, but he forced himself to extend a hand toward her. ""Laurie, I came to pick you up...""    
  
Before he could finish, Lauren suddenly turned to Elliot. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""

**Chapter 2 Why Didn't They Come?**



Lauren knew she couldn't escape.    
  
Lucas had once been the person she trusted and relied on the most. Now, he was the one she loathed and least wanted to face.    
  
Rather than confronting Lucas, she chose the next best option—going with Elliot.  
  
At least, from beginning to end, Elliot had always despised her.    
  
The first day she went back to the Bennett Residence, Elliot had warned her, ""Even if we share the same blood, in my heart, I only have one sister, and that's Willow. You'd better behave yourself. If I ever catch you bullying Willow, I won't let you off.""    
  
He never gave her hope, so she never had too much disappointment. In front of Elliot, the psychological wounds she suffered could at least be minimized.    
  
It was better than being utterly destroyed by the one closest to her.    
  
Prison had taught her a lesson.    
  
When lacking power, status, or support, survival depended on minimizing harm by any means possible.  
  
So, when her cellmates toyed with her and made her choose between disfigurement and a slap, she chose the slap.    
  
When they made her choose between being beaten and kneeling, she chose to kneel.    
  
When they made her choose between drinking toilet water and barking like a dog, she chose to bark.    
  
She had fought back desperately before, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she threw away her dignity and let herself be used.    
  
Even when thrown among the most vicious criminals, she had still managed to survive, barely hanging on, by knowing when to avoid harm.    
  
Lauren walked toward Elliot's black Bentley.    
  
As she brushed past Lucas, her expression remained indifferent. She didn't even spare him a glance.    
  
The loose T-shirt skimmed past Lucas's fingertips. The emptiness of the touch didn't feel like fabric draping over a person. It was more like cloth hanging on a lifeless mannequin.    
  
Lucas' hand froze midair. In that instant, it felt like the air around him had solidified, leaving only that cold, hollow sensation at his fingertips.    
  
Pain and desolation flashed through his eyes, and his heart felt as if an invisible hand had clenched it tight, every beat throbbing with dull agony.    
  
Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, supporting each other. Whenever he called her name, she would always smile and answer, ""Luca, I'm here.""    
  
But now, time had changed everything.    
  
She looked right through him, as if he didn't exist, unwilling to even meet his eyes.    
  
Lucas' lips trembled slightly. He wanted to speak, but his throat felt blocked, unable to make a sound.    
  
Lauren got into the car and sat in the back seat. Everything in sight bore traces of another woman.    
  
The passenger seat had a fluffy pink cushion. The dashboard was lined with an entire row of adorable bear figurines. In the rearview mirror, the woman's reflection looked more mature than five years ago, more alluring.    
  
She was beaming, the kind of smile that only someone raised in comfort and luxury could have.    
  
That happiness on her face was like a silent taunt, mocking Lauren as the fake heiress.    
  
She had thought she could face all this indifferently. But seeing it with her own eyes still left a bitter sting in her chest.    
  
Lauren withdrew her gaze, but her eyes inadvertently landed on the handbag beside her.    
  
Inside was a pristine white gown. Even without seeing the whole dress, the intricate feather embellishments hinted at its elegance.    
  
Her fingers unconsciously rubbed against the rough denim of her jeans.    
  
Every detail inside the car reminded her that she didn't belong here.    
  
From head to toe, she wasn't even worth as much as the gown in that handbag.    
  
She turned to look out the window. The scenery blurred past in a rapid retreat.    
  
Elliot, still driving, didn't forget to warn her, ""Mom and Dad have missed you so much these past five years. They cried over you every day, their hair turning gray with worry. When you get home, keep your temper in check. I don't want to see you scheming against Willow again, making things difficult for them. As long as you behave, the Bennett family won't treat you unfairly.""    
  
Silence followed his words.    
  
Hearing no response, Elliot frowned in displeasure and glanced at her through the rearview mirror.    
  
""Lauren, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?""    
  
Lauren finally looked up at him and spoke the longest sentence she had since leaving prison.    
  
""According to Article 48 of the Prison Law, inmates are allowed visits from family or guardians once a month, for thirty minutes to an hour. I was imprisoned for five years; that will be sixty months. If I had one visit per month, I could have seen them sixty times. But I never saw them once. You say your parents missed me. Then why didn't they come? Were they so busy that they couldn't spare even thirty minutes a month?""    
  
Her voice was calm, but every word was a blade, slicing through his lie without mercy.    
  
Guilt and panic flickered across Elliot's eyes. The reprimand he had prepared was caught in his throat, unable to come out.    
  
Avoiding her steady yet piercing gaze, his fingers instinctively tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the pressure.    
  
""It... It's because you were too hard to discipline. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on correcting your bad behavior. They did it for your own good.""    
  
*For my own good? Letting me take the fall for Willow, making me suffer in prison... So, that's their idea for my own good. What a joke.*    
  
Lauren felt drained, utterly uninterested in arguing anymore. She turned her gaze back to the window.    
  
Before long, the car pulled into the Bennett Residence garage.    
  
Elliot seemed pleased. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and hurried off.    
  
A few steps away, he suddenly remembered Lauren. His body stiffened, and when he turned back, there was still a trace of awkwardness on his face.    
  
""Go change into a proper gown and head to the banquet hall.""    
  
With that, he left without looking back.    
  
After five years, this house was still as unfamiliar to Lauren as ever.    
  
She had never felt an ounce of warmth here.    
  
This place wasn't even as good as the orphanage.    
  
At the orphanage, she hadn't had a private room, but at least she had shared a sunlit dorm.    
  
When the sun rose, light would pour through the windows, filling the room with warmth.    
  
Back then, she loved the scent of blankets basked in sunlight. It made her feel like she had a home.    
  
But after returning here, she realized that her so-called home wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets.    
  
It was the damp, musty stench of a place the sun never reached.    
  
She pushed open the door.    
  
The room was small, windowless, and packed with clutter.    
  
The only two pieces of furniture were a single folding cot and an old desk.    
  
This was the storage room that served as her bedroom for three years.    
  
Elliot had told her to wear a proper gown.    
  
But she had never owned one.  
  
For years, she had only had one set of her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she was wearing now had been bought with money she earned from a holiday job on Amazon, for five bucks total.    
  
She still remembered the day she had happily put them on and asked Elliot how she looked.    
  
His brows had furrowed in disgust.    
  
""What the hell are you wearing? Can't you learn to dress elegantly and properly like Willow? Take it off and get rid of it! Don't embarrass our family.""



**Chapter 3 Canceled Her Allowance**



Willow's poise and elegance had been built with money and resources.    
  
In contrast, Lauren had nothing.    
  
The Bennett family neither gave her much love nor much money, yet they still blamed her for not being poised and elegant enough.    
  
Even now, she didn't understand why they had brought her back.    
  
Her only purpose in this family was to make Willow, the adopted daughter, seem more beloved.    
  
There was a saying, ""Those who are unloved are the outsiders."" It fit her unexpectedly well.    
  
Back then, their unfairness had made her sad. Now, she no longer cared.    
  
She scanned the storage room. The only clothing she had to change into was her old blue-and-white high school uniform.    
  
Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from Northcrest University, the top institution in Corwynale.    
  
Yet, the Bennett family had only thrown a grand celebration for Willow's college entrance.    
  
That banquet had gathered every elite figure in Hoverdale.    
  
Eighteen-year-old Willow had stood in the center of it all, draped in a custom-made gown worth millions, wearing a diamond-studded crown, basking in the spotlight like a princess between her adoptive parents.  
  
Meanwhile, Lauren had looked shabby and out of place, an ugly duckling among swans. Under the gaze of the entire crowd, she had been taken away by the police, spending the next five years in prison, losing the college life that should have been hers.    
  
...  
  
Five minutes later, dressed in her uniform, Lauren headed toward the banquet hall of the Bennett Residence.    
  
On the way, passing servants cast curious glances at her.    
  
""Who's that? Why is she here in a high school uniform?""    
  
""She's probably one of the hotel staff brought in for the event. Looks like a student working a summer job.""    
  
""Mr. David and Madam Alice treat Ms. Willow so well. They even invited the top chef from Lavette Grand Hotel just for her celebration.""    
  
""Exactly.""    
  
As one servant walked past Lauren, they didn't forget to remind her, ""The banquet is about to begin. Go change into the standard uniform. You must be careful while serving. Tonight's guests are all important figures in Hoverdale.""    
  
With that, the servant left.    
  
Lauren stood there, suddenly losing the desire to go to the banquet hall.    
  
Elliot had told her that her parents had prepared a welcome banquet for her. But he hadn't mentioned that they had invited outsiders.    
  
Being released from prison was nothing to celebrate.   
  
*Did they really need to make such a spectacle out of it?*    
  
Five years ago, she had been taken away in handcuffs in front of all of Hoverdale's elites.    
  
Now, they wanted to gather those same people and publicly celebrate the return of a convict.    
  
To her, this wasn't a welcome. It was a public humiliation, stripping away every last shred of dignity she had left.    
  
A mix of bitterness and anger surged within her. She didn't want to stay here any longer.    
  
She turned to leave.    
  
But just then, Elliot appeared, his expression darkening the moment he saw what she was wearing.    
  
He strode toward her, his voice sharp with irritation. ""Didn't I tell you to change into a gown? Why did you come dressed like this? Do you have any idea what kind of occasion this is?""    
  
Lauren opened her mouth to explain, but Elliot cut her off mercilessly.    
  
""You looked like a mess when you got out of prison, and now that you're back, you want to put on a pitiful act in front of everyone? Do you want people to think the Bennett family has mistreated you? Lauren, your manipulative tricks are just as disgusting as ever. You're beyond saving.""    
  
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her, still cursing under his breath. ""Go change. Stop embarrassing yourself!""    
  
Lauren sidestepped him.    
  
Elliot's hand caught nothing but air. His anger flared. ""How dare you dodge me?""    
  
Lauren lifted her gaze to meet his. He looked at her as if she were his worst enemy.    
  
That look—disgusted, impatient, filled with contempt—she had endured it for three years in the Bennett family.    
  
Every time their eyes met, it felt like invisible hands were tearing her heart apart. The tears she had once held back had only ever earned her a sneer of ""stop acting.""    
  
Maybe she had gotten used to it.    
  
Or maybe five years in prison had crushed her self-worth.    
  
Now, even as she faced his deep-seated hatred, she felt nothing.    
  
His opinions no longer had the power to affect her.    
  
Lauren's expression remained calm, distant, unyielding. ""I don't have a gown.""    
  
Elliot's fury grew. ""If you don't have one, then buy one!""    
  
Lauren took a deep breath. Elliot was too biased against her. No matter what she said, he wouldn't believe her.    
  
She had tried explaining in the past.    
  
But the more she explained, the more he accused her of lying. He had slandered her without restraint.    
  
It was exhausting. She didn't want to explain anymore.    
  
So she simply said, ""I have no money.""    
  
Elliot's brows knitted together, his rage burning hotter. ""For three years, you lived here without worrying about food or clothing. The company transfers 70,000 dollars to your account every month. Over three years, that totaled 2.5 million dollars. And you're telling me you couldn't afford a decent dress? You're doing this on purpose, trying to make people think our family mistreated you! Lauren, you can't be this selfish. We've already compensated you. Enough is enough. If you keep acting like this, it's just pathetic!""    
  
Lauren had expected this. No matter what she said, she would never be believed.    
  
She stared at him, unblinking.    
  
For some reason, under her steady gaze, Elliot felt a brief pang of unease.    
  
""What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything wrong.""    
  
*He isn't wrong?*    
  
Lauren let out a cold, silent laugh.    
  
She hadn't wanted to make a scene.    
  
But Elliot's aggressive accusations stirred something dark in her.    
  
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed people approaching.    
  
Since they wanted a commotion, she would give them one.    
  
She had already lost her dignity. She had nothing left to lose.    
  
But Elliot, who cared so much about his reputation, couldn't handle being humiliated in public.   
  
""I never received a single cent from your company. Not 70,000 dollars. Not even seven bucks. Mr. Elliot, if you want to accuse me, at least come up with a more believable lie.""    
  
Elliot's eyes darkened with even more disgust.    
  
""You just won't give up, will you? Fine. Don't blame me for exposing you.""    
  
He pulled out his phone and called the company's finance department, putting the call on speaker.    
  
""Check how much money the finance department has transferred to Lauren's account every month.""    
  
The person on the other end hesitated. ""Lauren? You mean Ms. Bennett?""    
  
""Yes.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, if you're referring to Ms. Bennett, there's no need to check.""    
  
Elliot frowned. ""What do you mean?""    
  
""Well, we never transferred any money to Ms. Bennett's account.""    
  
Elliot froze.    
  
""That's impossible,"" he said sharply.    
  
*Lauren may not be well-liked, but she's still the daughter of the Bennett family. How could she not have an allowance?*  
  
The night she was brought home, he had discussed it with his parents. To be fair, they had decided to give Lauren the same monthly allowance as Willow.    
  
There was no way he had remembered it wrong.    
  
""I personally gave the order.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, you might not know this, but Madam Alice said that Ms. Bennett came from an orphanage and had poor judgment. She was afraid Ms. Bennett would fall in with the wrong crowd if she suddenly had that much money. Since Ms. Bennett was a high school student back then and had no major expenses, Madam Alice canceled her allowance.""    
  
Elliot's mind buzzed.    
  
*No allowance... That means Lauren hasn't received a single penny in the entire three years she's lived with us.*  
  
""Oh, and Madam Alice doubled Ms. Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars a month. She was worried Ms. Willow would feel neglected, so the extra 70,000 dollars was meant to comfort her. You knew about that, right, Mr. Elliot?""    
  
Elliot felt like someone had strangled him.    
  
He had not known.



**Chapter 4 You Have No Idea**



As the crowd grew, more and more people gathered around, all having heard the voice coming from the telephone receiver.    
  
Everyone present was stunned.    
  
The Bennett family wasn't the richest in Hoverdale, but it was still a prominent aristocratic household.    
  
For children of wealthy families, having a monthly allowance of 14,000 dollars was perfectly normal.    
  
They had never heard of a wealthy heiress who didn't even get a single cent in allowance.    
  
The Bennett family was the first.    
  
No wonder Lauren dressed so poorly, without even a decent gown to wear to a banquet.    
  
Even if she hadn't been raised by their side, she was still the real daughter of the Bennett family. Yet they gave her nothing while showering their adopted daughter with 140,000 dollars a month.    
  
For the Bennett family to allow such an outrageous situation to happen, they must have been utterly blind.    
  
The guests whispered among themselves. Elliot felt a chill down his spine, his face flushing with shame and anger.    
  
He refused to believe something so humiliating could happen to the Bennett family.    
  
Their family was wealthy and powerful. There was no way they would be too stingy to give their own flesh and blood a mere allowance.    
  
Elliot immediately questioned Lauren in a cold voice, ""Even if the finance department didn't transfer the money, Mom and Dad must have given you an allowance, right?""    
  
Lauren's lips curled in mockery. She glanced at David Bennett and Alice Pierce in the crowd and said lightly, ""Why don't you ask Mr. David and Madam Alice whether they gave me an allowance or not, Mr. Elliot? After all, you don't believe me, but you'd believe your parents, wouldn't you?""    
  
David and Alice stiffened instantly, too ashamed to meet her eyes.    
  
""Dad, Mom, you must have given her an allowance, right?"" Elliot looked at them seriously.    
  
David avoided his gaze. ""I thought you guys would give it to her, so I...""    
  
Alice's face was filled with guilt, tears welling in her eyes. She said painfully, ""I thought you guys would... Laurie, why didn't you say something sooner? If you had told me earlier, I would have given you money. It's my fault. I didn't realize it in time, and you suffered for it. But you have to believe that I treat you and Willow the same.""    
  
Lauren looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Alice lowered her eyes awkwardly.    
  
Only today did Lauren find out that it was her own birth mother who had ordered the finance department not to send her money. Not only that, but she had also raised Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars, afraid that her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.    
  
With such blatant favoritism, Alice still had the audacity to claim she treated them equally.    
  
As the esteemed wife of a wealthy family, Alice wore only the finest clothes, with even her socks costing dozens of dollars. There was no way she couldn't tell that her own daughter was wearing an outfit that cost less than 14 bucks in total.  
  
Of course, she knew. She just didn't care.    
  
This apology was nothing more than an act for the public.    
  
Fortunately, Lauren had long seen through the ugliness of this family. Her heart had been hardened, immune to their poison. Without expectations, she remained unshaken.    
  
Seeing Lauren ignore her mother's apology, humiliating the Bennett family in front of everyone, Elliot's fleeting guilt instantly vanished.    
  
He scolded coldly, ""You have a mouth, don't you? Why didn't you just say something? We're not mind readers; how were we supposed to know what you were thinking? If you had spoken up earlier, do you think we wouldn't have given you money?""    
  
""I did."" Lauren's voice was soft but laced with coldness. ""You just didn't take it seriously.""    
  
Elliot frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly surfaced in his mind.    
  
It was an afternoon long ago. Their family of four sat on the couch, chatting and laughing.    
  
Lauren walked over hesitantly, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she even spoke, her face flushed bright red.    
  
She struggled for a long time before finally whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me the tuition fee of 700...""    
  
*Bang!*    
  
Elliot slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Lauren. ""Money, money, money! Is that all you care about? Did you come back to this family just to ask for money? If the Bennett family had no money, would you have even bothered to return? I don't know why Mom and Dad insisted on bringing you back. If you have nothing better to do, go study. Willow ranked tenth in the whole school in her first monthly exam. What about you?""    
  
""I... I got first place....""    
  
""Enough. You mean dead last, right? And you still have the nerve to bring it up?""    
  
He had already arranged for the finance department to deposit 70,000 dollars into her card every month, yet she dared to open her mouth and ask for money.    
  
Even Willow didn't receive that much, so she had no reason to think she deserved it.  
  
Lauren's tears fell instantly, as if she had suffered a great injustice.    
  
Elliot only felt irritated, even losing the mood to read his financial newspaper.    
  
Luckily, Willow was understanding. She tugged on his arm and pouted. ""Elliot, I ranked tenth this time. Do I get a reward?""    
  
He couldn't resist his sweet little sister acting cute. Instantly, all his annoyance from Lauren disappeared. Pinching Willow's cheek, he doted on her. ""Willow, what do you want?""    
  
""I saw a handbag worth 14,000 dollars. Elliot, will you buy it for me?""    
  
""Of course. If you like it, I'd even buy one for 140,000 dollars.""    
  
After spoiling Willow, he turned back to Lauren with a scowl. ""Why are you still standing here? Go back to your room and study.""    
  
Lauren bit back her grievances and ran away.    
  
David and Alice sighed at the same time. ""If only Laurie were half as sensible as Willow.""    
  
...  
  
""Mr. Elliot, have you remembered?""    
  
Lauren's voice pulled him back to the present. His heart twisted painfully at the way she addressed him—Mr. Elliot.    
  
He was her biological brother, not some stranger.    
  
But ever since she was released from prison, she hadn't called him by his name even once.    
  
His expression darkened, his voice laced with frustration. ""It was because you were terrible at studying. Coming in dead last, how did you have the nerve to ask for money? Even I was embarrassed for you.""    
  
Hearing this, Lauren's gaze turned even colder. Being stared at with such icy indifference, Elliot felt an inexplicable sense of guilt. He clenched his jaw and snapped, ""You don't accept criticism?""    
  
""For all three years of high school, I ranked first in my grade every year. How did I suddenly become in last place in your version of the story?""    
  
Seeing Elliot's expression of utter disbelief, Lauren smirked coldly. A sense of vindictive satisfaction rose within her. ""Then again, it's understandable. Mr. Elliot, you don't even know which school I attended. Naturally, you wouldn't know my grades.""    
  
Elliot felt like he had been struck by lightning, frozen in place.    
  
It was as if he had just heard something absurd. His voice trembled slightly, betraying a hint of hoarseness. ""You weren't attending Brightvale High School?""    
  
Brightvale High School was the most prestigious school in Hoverdale. Willow had graduated from there, and all the wealthy and powerful families in the city sent their children there.    
  
Elliot had simply assumed Lauren was studying there as well.    
  
His gaze snapped to David and Alice, his voice shaking uncontrollably. ""Dad, Mom, when Lauren came back, did you transfer her school records over?""    
  
Silence.    
  
David's face turned red, his lips moving soundlessly like a man who had lost his backbone. All his past authority vanished.    
  
Alice's lips quivered. Panic and guilt filled her eyes, her perfectly applied makeup unable to conceal her embarrassment.    
  
The two stood there, frozen, as if the air around them had solidified.    
  
Elliot's face turned pale, inch by inch. His previous perception of Lauren crumbled like a collapsing tower. All the disdain and condescension he had once felt now twisted into sharp blades, cutting into his own heart.    
  
His throat tightened painfully, his voice barely audible. ""Laurie, where did you go to school for those three years?""



**Chapter 5 Her Birthday Party**



Lauren's life had already been ruined, and only then did Elliot remember to care about her academics. How ironic.    
  
She had spent ten years studying desperately, hoping to change her fate. Just as her efforts were about to bear fruit, she found that they were ultimately no match for power.    
  
With a single, offhand remark, the Bennett family sealed her fate, effortlessly casting her into the deepest depths of hell.    
  
She could have had a bright future.    
  
From childhood to adulthood, she never had the advantage of a powerful family background. The only thing she could rely on was her extraordinary dedication to her studies.    
  
Her dream was to get into Northcrest University, then pursue a master's degree and a doctorate. She wanted to become a professor, to stand at the podium and use her knowledge to change the fate of those who, like her, worked tirelessly to succeed.    
  
But reality had slapped her in the face.    
  
She did not become the person she had wanted to be. Instead, she became a despised criminal, forever marked by a stain on her record.    
  
A stain that would affect three generations.    
  
Thinking of this, Lauren clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt nothing.    
  
""Hoverdale First High School."" Lauren's voice was soft, almost gentle.    
  
Yet the four words, ""Hoverdale First High School,"" weighed like a thousand-pound boulder, making David, Alice, and Elliot feel as though they could hardly breathe.    
  
Because Hoverdale First High School had the highest admission standards in all of Hoverdale.    
  
Unlike Brightvale High School, a prestigious private school where admission was secured with money, Hoverdale First High School only recognized scores, not wealth.    
  
Even among top students, she had consistently ranked first in her grade year after year. With her grades, getting into Northcrest University had been a certainty.    
  
""That's impossible. You're lying."" Elliot's emotions were on edge. ""Hoverdale First High School is in the suburbs, more than 20 miles from home. Back then, you rode that old bike every day...""  
  
Mid-sentence, Elliot suddenly realized something. The rest of his words got stuck in his throat.    
  
Watching the color drain from Elliot's face, Lauren's lips curled in mockery. ""I'd rather ride a bike than go to school with Willow. We never even attended the same school. I never ate breakfast with you because morning classes at Hoverdale First High School started at six. I had to wake up at four to bike for two hours just to get there. I never came home for lunch because there wasn't enough time to bike back. I didn't have money for food, so I just drank more water to hold on until evening. By the time I finally got home, you had already eaten. All that was left for me was cold leftovers, and even then, you mocked me, saying I had a lowly fate, that I preferred eating scraps over hot food, that I devoured leftovers like a starving ghost...""    
  
""Laurie, I'm sorry."" Alice's tears fell like broken pearls, her sobs heart-wrenching. ""I didn't know you suffered so much. It's all my fault.""    
  
""There's nothing for you to apologize for."" Lauren looked at Alice's tear-streaked face, her heart as calm as still water. ""I wasn't raised by you. It's understandable that you feel nothing for me. I've long been used to this. A little more suffering wouldn't have made a difference. Don't you agree, Madam Alice?""    
  
Alice's sobs hitched.    
  
*Laurie, I'm begging you. You're stronger than Willow; you can endure hardship. You took care of yourself just fine in the orphanage, so I believe you'll manage in prison too. Please, take the fall for Willow.*    
  
A five-year-old memory came surging back. Alice looked stricken, clutching her chest as if she were about to faint.

So this is a story about my sister's friend and her husband. We'll call them Arya and Raj .  
Both Arya and Raj , used to work fm morning 9 am till evening 6 pm and mostly used to party or go on outings later on (enthu couple I must say). They used to live in a small house, with a single room and a kitchen (as they barely used to be at home) and in an area which ws surrounded by trees, more like a small jungle. Even their househelp used to come in the afternoon, clean up n leave.

Once, after a long day at work n a bit of partying later on, both Arya and Raj came home very tired n wanted to rest. They dimmed the lights, and Arya quickly climbed onto the bed to sleep, while Raj was about to the same, when he realized he kept his car keys inside his pockets. Lazily , his half sleepy self kept his keys on the small coffee table beside him, but the keys fell down.

Even thou he ws very tired ,Raj ws someone who needed his things in place. He woke up, picked his keys ..and said to Arya ""Honey, lets go have some icecream shall we??""....""Are u kidding me Raj? We just arrived!"", Arya said a bit frustrated. ""But babe , i realllyyy want some icecream, pleasee???""...""God, fine""..Arya says finally agreeing.  
  
They got up, got out of the house , locked it and went into their car. Like I said, they lived in a remote area, so places were a bit far away. You needed to take a left for the icecream parlour....  
but...Raj took a left..""Babe, the icecream is on the left i think u missed a turn""...Arya said.  
""Yes, i know"" Raj said firmly...Arya stayed confused but didnt question much as she ws already too tired.  
  
But as a few minutes went by...they reached a police station..  
""What? y r we here?"" Arya asked confused...""Just trust me"" Raj said.. He went inside , talked w the cops n took them with him to their house...(poor arya was clueless about everything happening).

Once they reach the house, the police went inside...Raj told Arya **""Dont freak out, but while I was picking my keys up...I saw a guy under our bed""..**.and befpre Arya could register what Raj said ,you wont believe...**THE POLICE ARRESTED A GUY!!!** Turns out , that guy was living under their bed...for absolute 1.5 months...  
Now u might say how did they both never notice that...but that guy..knew their schedules (including the househelp) and studied them for 1 month. After which he used to enter their house once Arya and Raj went onto their work, stay...leave before the househelp entered...and while he was out..that monster used to rape and torture women, and the worst part... On the next night of his arrest...**Arya was about to be his next victim.**

I would just like to take a second to appreciate Raj's situational quotient..his calm and composure was the only reason they both were alive.  
  
So guys ,like I said **calm and composure...could end up saving your life.**

1k5bzxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k5bzxq/i_work_overnight_at_a_tow_company_there_are_rules/,I WORK OVERNIGHT AT A TOW COMPANY. THERE ARE RULES YOU NEED TO FOLLOW.,"Working the night shift wasn’t exactly part of my master plan.

But after a nervous breakdown at my last job, I needed something quiet.

Something far away from screaming bosses, impossible deadlines, and the kind of stress that turns your bones to dust.

So here I am. Working overnights at a tow company with a car loan at 26% interest, a binder labeled ""New Tuna"" that contains everything I need to know about my job.

The system we use is called PulsePoint.

It tracks trucks via GPS, lets me assign calls, upload videos, and stream live footage from the field. Each truck is equipped with three cameras: a front-facing dashcam that shows the road, a cabin cam mounted inside to monitor the driver (oh, trust me the LOVE that), and a rear camera bolted to the back of the truck. Supposedly for ""safety."" The official reason is to protect us during accidents or disputes.

Unofficially?

I think Henry, or whoever is really running this operation, uses it to make sure wheel lift drivers aren’t driving with their booms down.

My job’s pretty simple.

A call comes in, I log the info, assign it to a driver, and monitor their progress.

That’s it.

No customers. No pressure.

Just me, the screen, and whatever snacks I remember to bring, but I don't think you guys care much about that...and I really need to tell you about what happened this past shift.

The night was going pretty normally. I had Tyler working on heavy duty, Mike on personal property impounds, and Damon on call just in case we got a police call. I went to my email and made sure there was  nothing important.

I stared at the list, each rule sounding more bizarre than the last. Carl was known for his strange sense of humor, and part of me wondered if he’d made this up just to mess with me. But the mention of Rule 1 brought a chill that I couldn’t shake; the memory of last night’s call echoed in my mind. Rule 2 was just as unsettling. I glanced over my shoulder at the dark window, the quiet dispatch room making me feel more alone than ever.

I shrugged it off. It was just Carl’s way of saying goodbye, right?

It was just after 3:00 a.m. when the phone rang. The sound cut through the silence like a jackknife. The caller ID... blank. Numbers were scrambled in a way that didn’t look accidental. I stared for a second too long before answering.

""Thank you for calling Henry's Runners and Wreckers. How can I help you?""

A woman’s voice came through. She was breathless, frantic.

“Please. There’s been an accident. Route 19 just past Wells Hollow. My husband’s unconscious. He won’t wake up.”

Now this was already odd for me because I am not a police dispatcher. The police are the ones who call *me,* but I was told during my training that it is not unheard of when people are in accidents, they sometimes call us after they call the police, if the accident is not that bad. I slipped into routine. Got the location, exact coordinates, and entered it into PulsePoint. Assigned the job to Tyler, one of our newer guys, since he was the closest (4 minutes out). We hadn’t met in person, but he seemed solid. Friendly, too. I liked him.

I tried to keep her talking. “Is he breathing? Are you hurt? Do you need help contacting the police?”

“I already called them. They said they’re on the way. But someone needs to get the car out of her. Its not safe,” she said.

It made no sense but I did not argue.

“There was something in the road. He swerved. We hit the guardrail.”

Her voice started to fade. The line went quiet, but I still heard faint breathing. Or something that sounded like breathing.

“Ma’am?”

Click.

I stared at the phone and then at the screen. Tyler’s icon was moving down the highway, closing in on the location. I was just about to call the police to make sure they got a call from her and it wasnt some prank but the dispatch phone rang. It was Tyler.

“Hey, Rach? I’m here. There’s nothing. No car, no wreck, no people. Just road.”

I pulled up the front-facing dashcam. His headlights stretched ahead into the dark. Just pavement and trees.

I switched to the rear camera.

That’s when I saw it.

Something was there.

Tall. Upright. Just beyond the glow of the taillights.

It wasn’t moving. Not even a little. Not the kind of stillness you expect from a person or an animal caught in headlights. This was different. Intentional. Like it had settled into place long before Tyler ever pulled up.

Like it had been waiting.

The dark clung to it in a strange way. Not like a shadow. More like the world around it didn’t recognize it. As if the light knew something was wrong and chose to pass it by. Not avoiding. Just forgetting.

No features. No face. No eyes.  
Just a shape. Still. Watching.

But it didn’t feel like it was watching the truck.

It felt like it was watching the camera.

Watching me.

Like it knew I was there. Like it had been aware of me long before I noticed it.

And for a second, I wasn’t sure who was really looking in on whom.

I swallowed. “Tyler...don't get out, can you check behind your truck? Put the truck in reverse do you see anything?”

“Okay?” he asked, unsure why I wanted him to, but doing it anyway.

“It’s just trees back there. Why?” he asked.

I flipped to the cabin cam to make sure he was looking. He was.

I switched back to the rear cam.

The figure was gone.

Before I could react, the phone rang again. Same scrambled number. I picked up.

“Dispatch.”

“It’s me,” the woman said. Her voice was softer now. Distant. Detached. “Are they coming?...Are you coming?”

I steadied my voice and tried to maintain my composure. “Our driver is already there,” I said. “But he can’t find you.”

“I see you,” she whispered. “He just doesn’t see us.”

I gripped the receiver tighter, uneasy with her choice of words. “Stay on the line. I’ll have him check again.”

I switched back to Tyler.

“Can you drive up and down that stretch one more time? She swears she sees you.”

“Sure,” he sighed almost as though he has accepted the fact that this was some prank but I wouldn't. “But there’s still nothing. It’s just empty.”

I watched his headlights scan the road. Nothing. No wreck. No body. No trace.

Before I could speak, the woman’s voice returned. Like she had waited until I came back.

“He’s here with me now,” she whispered.

Quiet.

Too quiet.

“But he’s not breathing.”

My mouth went dry. “Ma’am, who’s with you?”

She hesitated.

“I didn’t make it.”

Then the line went dead.

I stared at the screen. My hands hovered over the keyboard, useless. I switched back to Tyler.

“I’ve looped around twice. Still nothing. Want me to keep looking?”

“No,” I said. “You’re clear. Head back in.”

“Copy that.”

I checked the CRM for that scrambled number. Buried in the history was a note. All it said was:

DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL AFTER 3 A.M.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That morning, when the sky finally started to bleed gray and the weight of night began to lift, I found Carl out in the shop.

Carl was supposed to be retired. At least, that’s what the company email said. But there he was, leaning against the side of his former flatbed, coffee in one hand, cigarette in the other, staring at the concrete like he expected it to crack open beneath him.

I stepped in the shop slowly, still shaken from the night.

“You’re not gone yet?” I asked.

He didn’t look up. “Came to grab my last paycheck,” he muttered. “Left a couple of things in the toolbox.”

He took a sip of coffee, then added, almost like it hurt to say it, “Guys like me don’t really retire. We just fade out.”

I hovered there in the doorway, unsure if I should bring it up. But the silence between us was too loud, too expectant. So I did.

“I got an email the other day...” I began, not knowing how on earth to begin to explain it.

Carl finally looked at me, eyes unreadable. “You read it? All of it?”

“Yeah, what's the deal with that?” I asked.

Instead, he took another drag of his cigarette and stared toward the dispatch office, and chuckled to himself.

“What the hell is going on, Carl I need direct answers. None of this cryptic shit.” It was a demand, but it came out as a plea. He just stared at me. His eyes were sizing me up. Almost as though he was trying to see if I were ready to hear what he had to say.

“Fuck this. You guys are messing with me.” I said and turned on my heels, and started to head out.

“You spoke to her?” he asked.

The question caused me to freeze in my tracks. I slowly turned around. When our eyes met, he didn't need to elaborate on who it was.

We both knew.

I nodded.

“I’ve heard that voice before,” he said after a long moment.

“It was years ago, maybe 39 years or so. I was new. First year on flatbed. My dad was retiring so he was showing me the ropes.” He lit another cigarette, hands steady, but his voice had gone low.

Empty.

“Call came in from PD. Said a car had swerved off Rt. 19 near Hollow. They wanted a flatbed because it was too mangled for a wheel lift.”

He looked up at me for a second, then away again.

“I remember pulling up. It was still dark. Police were already on scene, lights spinning through the trees. But there was no one in the car.”

He took a long drag and exhaled slowly. “There was blood. A lot of it. Driver’s side. Passenger side. Smeared across the windshield. But no bodies. No footprints. No drag marks. Just a warm car and empty seats.”

I stayed quiet. My throat felt tight.

“We waited,” he said. “Watched the cops comb the woods for what seemed like a lifetime before they told us to get the car out of there.”

He glanced at the far wall, like the memory was still playing out there in the shadows.

“They never found anyone. Not that night. Not ever. But that’s not the part that sticks with you.”

I waited.

“The part that sticks,” he said, flicking ash onto the floor, “is that the calls never stopped. Always the same time. Always a number that doesn’t look right. Always the same woman.”

He turned and looked at me again, and I could see it in his eyes now. The fear he’d been trying not to show.

“She cries. Says her husband isn’t breathing. Begs for help.” Carl crushed his cigarette under his boot.

“She doesn’t know she’s dead,” he said. “She still thinks someone can save her. Like the crash is still happening.”

I could barely get the question out.

“Why didn’t you...someone tell me?”

Carl laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Because once you answer, it’s too late. That’s how she finds you. Not through the wreck. Through the phone. Through the ones who pick up.”

He stood slowly, brushing ash off his jeans. “You think ignoring it will help. That you’ll forget her voice. That the sound of the line cutting out won’t crawl into your dreams. But it doesn’t work like that.”

He looked toward the dispatch office.

The monitors were glowing behind the blinds, casting faint white light across the floor. “She knows who hears her,” he said. “And she remembers every single one.”

I slowly took a step towards him. My breath shaking and eyes searching for an answer, I did not want to know the answer to.

“When did you hear her first?”  
He didn’t answer.  
I swallowed.  
“When did you hear her last?”  
A pause. Too long.  
That’s when Tom walked in.

“Carl,” he said. “Your check.”

Carl stood slowly and took it with a nod.

Tom turned to me next.“You should probably be heading home,” he said. His eyes never quite met mine.

1k5bwrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1k5bwrk/not_sure_if_i_screwed_up_with_a_girl/,Not sure if I screwed up with a girl...,"So there's this girl in university who I attend a specific class with. Whenever we are in class, we have a lot of chemistry - I think, anyway... - . We've talked about very private stuff and made jokes about each other and really had a connection, I would argue. We have a WhatsApp group for class stuff where it's her, another guy and I. She opened my DMs to ask me in two different occasions whether I was gonna come to class. I thought that was weird since we had the class group and so it felt natural to ask me that through that since it would be a class-related inquiry, but she used DMs for it twice. She also added me to contacts before DMing me - which I know because I could suddenly see her profile picture when I couldn't before - .

The first time she asked me, she had a rather normal profile picture, but the second time she asked she had changed her PFP to a much attractive one where she could be seen with a tight dress, her naked back and her covering her mouth in a rather suggestive manner, it was a very artistic photo in a way, I quite liked it.

So anyway... I got an internship last month which means I won't be able to attend class anymore. I told her and then we had a conversation where I told her that tomorrow would be the last time I'd attend class and she made sure to let me know she'd attend. That last day she appeared more ""dressed-up"" than normal, which I noticed, and by the end of class I asked her whether she'd be interested in hanging out with me someday and she said yes, something to the effect of ""Sure, we could get some coffee"".

That same day but later I asked her through WhatsApp whether next week could be a good time for her to hang out, and she took 3 hours to respond - not that I think that's any relevant, but I might as well add as much info as I can - and told me (I'm translating to English here):

**Yeah I think so though I don't have a lot of time due to the horses and so on 😅** (she rides horses)

**But I could look to see whether I can make room even if it's only for a little moment or so**

Now, I took that as a polite rejection, so I kind of panicked and replied:

**Of course, I understand**  
  
**If you ever have some free time and you feel like it, let me know; and if you don't, that's okay too**

My reply was at around 12AM and then she replied ""Okaay"" literally 14 hours later when before she had been rather fast to reply.

Anyway since then she's been reading my class-related messages in the group chat super fast but then not replying. *Ever*. Like, she is fully ghosting me in the group chat. And it's only 3 people there: me, her friend and her. The first time I sent a message to the group chat after asking her out, she read it instantly, never replied and then posted a story 2 hours later. And now she sees my stories instantly, like in less than a minute.

I wasn't planning on asking since I simply thought she isn't interested in me, but some of my female friends seem to think she actually *was* interested in hanging out with me and she expected me to simply reply to her messages ""Great, then what day next week do you think you'll have some free time?"" and when I didn't she got frustrated with me and now she's trying to make me pursue her. Full disclosure: I do NOT subscribe to this theory, I'm just curious to see what y'all might think.",1,1745342360.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I know this is probably just going to be a Incoherent ramble, but it's hard to put into words.
I'll refer to my ex as (B) and my current partner (kindof) as (S)

first off i feel kindof dickish having to compare these two people. they both have had a serious impact on my life and are both wonderful people.
first, my ex
so, B and I were together around two years, moved in the second year, went great until the end, when things kindof took a nose dive. neither of us were doing great mentally, her, with untreated bpd and I having alot of stress from work and family problems. it wasn't a messy break up, but it got a little worse afterwards, I think we were both just trying to find reasons to hate each other, make the process simpler at least. we broke contact for around 8 or so months, which is when I met S.

So i kindof rushed into a relationship with S, I'll admit that, I was very hurt and I needed someone to turn to, and she was that. simple, easy, she's so understanding and one of the kindest people I've ever met. I've talked to her about still being hung up on B, and she's been very understanding about the whole thing, even telling me to text her for some closure that I still hadn't gotten. In almost every way S is perfect. I love her. I love her very much.

cut to this month, where me and S are going through alot independently, and decided it would be a good time for a shortish break in our relationship while we get everything figured out, not a bad thing for me or her. 

I finally texted B, it felt less bad to do it while single, and it went.. really well, we caught up, cleared the air on alot, and really put me at ease. what didn't go so well however is we started talking about missing each other. I don't know why I did, I wish I could have just shut up and kept pushing forward, keeping those feeling away, I still love her, I really do. but, we met up, had coffee, and I think she's made alot of changes for the better. I've kept up with her on socials but she really has fixed alot. which is a problem for me because there's now no excuse not to want her back, which I do, but I would also really hate to throw away the closest I have ever had to a perfect relationship with S.
please god help me.

oh! add on, this is not super relevant but part of my issue going back with her is this stupid face I've put on of hating her, I've said alot to family and friends i regret, to kindof push farther away, to make not being with her easier, to convince myself that I'm better off, etc.

TLDR: i am a person in a perfect, loving relationship, struggling with the possibility of going back with my ex, who i still have very alive feelings for.",0,1745341923.0,relationship_advice,10,0.4,False

I'd put a little post together marking my progress on this behemoth of a project, as I have gotten to 333 albums and because I am doing it in quite a different way to most people here.

I am trying to go through all 1001 albums in one year - crazy, but I'm well on track! I only realised the generator website (and this accompanying subreddit) existed at the end of February, when I was well in the middle of it. As much as I would appreciate doing 1 a day for almost 3 years like the rest of you, I quite like that I am doing this in such a neat timeframe !

I started my 1001 albums journey on the 1st Jan, having made this a new years resolution for me to go outside my comfort zone and listen to more music beyond my normal habits. I have owned the 2017 edition for about 6/7 years, carrying it around with me as I moved from place to place as a coffee table book but only really dipping in to see what it had to say about the albums I was already familiar with.  I've been keeping track of my listening habits through a big spreadsheet which I update with my ratings from 1-5 stars- I've also been adding a tab to each album in the physical book so that I know when I've listened to it and have a Spotify playlist that I add my favourite song from each album to.

Thankfully my job is fully remote with quite low client contact so I find it very easy to get my listening in - although I do schedule less albums for when I'm visiting friends & family or have to travel for work.

Randomizing albums has been a bit of a challenge compared to when you have a website that does the work for you, but I have figured out some sort of system. Firstly, I like to listen to artists when it is their birthday - this creates a nice little tie between the album I'm listening to and reading up on their contribbution to music (ie. yesterday was Iggy Pop's and Robert Smith's birthday, so I listened to The Idiot and Seventeen Seconds respectively). I may *eventually* run out of birthdays but for now this is a fun way of doing it. In addition, when listening to artists with multiple albums on the list, I am trying to listen to them in chronological order so that I track their progression over time - this is difficult for artists with solo & band work ie. Elvis Costello (lol) but for the most part pretty fun way of doing it.

Anyway, my favourites and least favourites. Overall I am averaging 3.37 on my rankings, so I think I have been pretty fair and have heard stuff from the full spectrum of great and not great. Here are my **5 star albums** so far (I am quite stingy with 5 stars and I need to love almost *every single track* to give it 5):

* Stan Getz & João Gilberto- Getz/Gilberto- Magical - the sound of saxophone is so serene here. I think the main discovery for me  so far is that I love a lot of Brazilian music...
* Fleet Foxes- Fleet Foxes- This album conjures the campfire experience like few others, and it is really transportative.
* Massive Attack- Blue Lines- 'Trip hop' is one of my favourite genres, so I knew this album going in and was impressed as much as I was the first time.
* Janis Joplin - Pearl - I was not familiar with Joplin but was blown away by her raw vocal power as well as the work from the Full Tilt Boogie Band
* Sepultura- Roots- Another Brazilian artist? You bet! I listened to Arise but found this really infectious and energetic. Made me want to tear a wall down
* Metallica - Master of Puppets - A classic of the genre. I knew some songs here but was impressed by how much I enjoyed all of the deeper cuts.
* LCD Soundsystem -The Sound of Silver - I enjoy how this sounds so anxious yet is so danceable. Has held up super well 20 years on.
* Brian Eno - David Byrne -My Life in the Bush of Ghosts - Another album that has held up really well, even though it's a bit more experimental than most of Byrne's other work at the time I still find a great groove to it.
* Daft Punk -Homework - Probably my favourite band of all time, of course it was getting a 5 from me even though it's not my favourite from them.
* Carole King- Tapestry -Phenomenal songwriting that had me captivated from the first to the last minute.
* The Stone Roses -The Stone Roses -I enjoyed this any more than I had any right to, knowing the main singles from it. Maybe boosted because I listened to it whilst I was in Manchester and things clicked.
* Cocteau Twins -Treasure- More familiar with their other album on the list, but this surprised me with how dark it was compared to what I know. HOLV *will* be on this list when I get round to it...
* David Bowie- Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars- Bowie is a super good storyteller, even if I don't know what he's going on about half of the time I am still going to hang on his every word.
* Portishead- Dummy- 'Trip hop' classic! I've listened to this before and will listen many, many more times.
* Milton Nascimento and Lo Borges- Clube da Esquina - Brazil makes another appearance on my 5 star list. I don't really understand much of the context around this album but the production is phenomenal.

And my **1 star albums** (all the ones I would actively dissuade people from listening to. I'm not writing comments up for these, a lot of them speak for themselves):

* Beastie Boys - Licensed to Ill
* Buck Owens and his Buckaroos - I've Got A Tiger By The Tail
* The Louvin Brothers - Tragic Songs of Life
* Sugar - Copper Blue
* Waylon Jennings - Honky Tonk Heroes
* Aerosmith - Toys in the Attic
* John Zorn - Spy vs. Spy: The Music of Ornette Coleman
* The Black Crowes - Shake Your Money Maker
* The Beach Boys - The Beach Boys Today!
* Throbbing Gristle - D.O.A. Third And Final Report
* Barry Adamson - Moss Side Story
* The Fall - Live at the Witch Trials
* Pink Floyd - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
* The Monkees - Headquarters
* The Verve - A Northern Soul
* Neneh Cherry - Raw Like Sushi
* The Rolling Stones- Aftermath
* Digital Underground- Sex Packets

first off i feel kindof dickish having to compare these two people. they both have had a serious impact on my life and are both wonderful people.
first, my ex
so, B and I were together around two years, moved in the second year, went great until the end, when things kindof took a nose dive. neither of us were doing great mentally, her, with untreated bpd and I having alot of stress from work and family problems. it wasn't a messy break up, but it got a little worse afterwards, I think we were both just trying to find reasons to hate each other, make the process simpler at least. we broke contact for around 8 or so months, which is when I met S.

So i kindof rushed into a relationship with S, I'll admit that, I was very hurt and I needed someone to turn to, and she was that. simple, easy, she's so understanding and one of the kindest people I've ever met. I've talked to her about still being hung up on B, and she's been very understanding about the whole thing, even telling me to text her for some closure that I still hadn't gotten. In almost every way S is perfect. I love her. I love her very much.

cut to this month, where me and S are going through alot independently, and decided it would be a good time for a shortish break in our relationship while we get everything figured out, not a bad thing for me or her. 

I finally texted B, it felt less bad to do it while single, and it went.. really well, we caught up, cleared the air on alot, and really put me at ease. what didn't go so well however is we started talking about missing each other. I don't know why I did, I wish I could have just shut up and kept pushing forward, keeping those feeling away, I still love her, I really do. but, we met up, had coffee, and I think she's made alot of changes for the better. I've kept up with her on socials but she really has fixed alot. which is a problem for me because there's now no excuse not to want her back, which I do, but I would also really hate to throw away the closest I have ever had to a perfect relationship with S.
please god help me.

oh! add on, this is not super relevant but part of my issue going back with her is this stupid face I've put on of hating her, I've said alot to family and friends i regret, to kindof push farther away, to make not being with her easier, to convince myself that I'm better off, etc.

TLDR: i am a person in a perfect, loving relationship, struggling with the possibility of going back with my ex, who i still have very alive feelings for.",0,1745341769.0,Advice,2,0.33,False

1k5bmoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bondha_diaries/comments/1k5bmoj/favourite_season/,Favourite season,"Growing up I liked rainy season, cause it rains on my birthday, every year. Such a simple reason right? And I met you. You come from a place where it's always raining, rain doesn't excite you anymore. You always felt depressed at the sight of rain, but when I pulled you out to have a cup of black tea (for you) and black coffee (for me), you always came, with your very large umbrella. Where both of us could comfortably walk without brushing shoulders. I hate brushing shoulders. But on days the umbrella was small, I remember you making sure I won't get drenched in the rain all the while you got. I still like rainy season a lot, but I like sharing an umbrella with you even more.

I also like winter, I come from a place of scroching heat - always. But one day it was snowing and I thought I would die. I knocked your door at 0200 AM and asked to help me. You were half awake but you found a way to boil water and fill in a bottle to keep me warm that night. And proceeded for the rest of the winters carefully wrapping my scarf around my neck so I wouldn't catch cold. You used to sit close to me cause I said 'conduction', and you rubbed your hands before placing on my cheeks everytime I shivered in that 1°C nights. Since then every winter I think of the warmth I recieved from your hands, and your words. I still like winter, but I like how you held my hands to keep them warmer.

I never experienced spring until we met. The trees in the place I lived shed leaves and regrew them, but I was too young to notice. It is only after meeting you I saw what spring does to the nature, of the mother Earth's and ours. We used to walk all around, holding hands, wearing the thinnest sweaters and clicking pictures of every flower. 'Stand here, you look so pretty' I'd say while clicking your picture, 'okay now you stand' words would follow out of your mouth as if we're programmed to admire eachother. Spring brings a new breath to the world. Half cool, half warm, almost like your hug, comfortable. And it was because of our long spring walks, now everytime I see beautiful flowers I click pictures and tell my self you'd like them.

Summer was a season of going to my grandparents' house waiting for the mobile icecream shop bell to ring. My summers have been monotonous, all my childhood. They were spent on day dreaming and mangoes. But remember that one summer we spent together? We both spent time day dreaming, eating icecreams and cooking together. Well you cooked and I just stood by you. You never complained how sweaty you got rather you said 'tonight you'll have dinner with me', and you said that so often, and we ate together so often, my parents no longer needed to ask me if I ate, and with who I ate. I wasn't fond of summers except for the icecreams and mangoes and then I met you, and even in the scorching 48°C, I remember us stepping into the shades of the trees one after the other and laugh how the global warming is happening and we will have no future all the while working for the same.

I thought I liked rainy, I still do, but after meeting you, I liked seeking shelter with you under a thunderstorm more.

I thought I loved winter, I still do, but I find myself seeking your warmth on the coldest nights.

I never experienced spring, but with you I saw the beauty of it. The beauty of us.

I never loved summers for more than the vacation, but with you I found them bearable, despite us both ending up like dry fish.

Perhaps it's not a season that I like, anymore. It's your company that comes along. 

Perhaps you are my favourite season. 

Yes, you are my favourite season. 

You always have been.

-----------------------

This is an ode to all the beautiful friendships I had in life so far. Some just a text away, and the other many memories away. They all made me who I am, an adorable black kitten with golden retriever energy. With that being said, I'll see you guys soon. Maybe in a month, or a ten. If you miss me, write me lov letters.

As the post title says, my partner and I will be travelling to France next month and are looking for some recommendations.

We're planning to spend a day or two in Paris, but we're trying to figure out where to go for the remaining time (about 5 days).

We're both very interested in old architecture, stonework, books/libraries, markets... That sort of thing.

Ideally we're thinking of staying in one place for the 5 or so days, trying new coffee shops in the morning, going out to see nearby sights, experiencing the food and culture, etc., then going to Paris for ~2 days.

We looked at Nîmes, but we're a bit concerned that there was more there than we could realistically see in the time (we also don't want to rush about.)

Does anyone have any recommendations for cities to stay in or specific sites to see? We're really looking forward to it, but it's difficult to decide between so many wonderful places to visit.

Or a design budget. Or weeks to test 3 versions of a landing page.

But I just ran an AI-powered focus group with 800 simulated participants, and it cost less than a coffee...lol

I built this using Bolt and [BuildShip](https://buildship.com/templates/focus...) (a no-code backend builder). This workflow lets you:

* Drop in product ideas, landing page drafts, tweets, pricing models, basically anything you want feedback on
* Simulate 80+ diverse user groups: marketers, Gen Z, boomers, founders, whoever
* Pull insights across AI models like OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, Diffbot, etc.
* Get a ranked list of the best options, with sentiment analysis, demographic breakdowns, and even new ideas

I used it to test social media posts. Worked like a charm. 

  
But this overall template could be used for much more.  From testing new features before building, comparing product ideas, customer research without cold emailing and validating value props or startup pitches

And because it’s no-code: you can tweak the prompt, change the audience, or connect the results to a dashboard in Bolt or Framer without writing a line of code.

This is the kind of thing that used to be locked behind teams, tools, and funding. Now you can run it solo, in minutes.

Please excuse  my grammer as english is not my first language. I never thought I'll  post in here but I had to create  this account to cough out what's bothering me and maybe get advice.

 I 30(F) was engaged to (28)M let's call him 'Taylor'. Taylor and I met beginning  of 2020. We started dating since then . Earlier 2024, Taylor  asked me to marry him. Of course I agreed he was the man of my dreams and we started wedding  planning. I took a 200k ($10 000) loan to prepare for our wedding because i had a better credit score than him and ex fiance promised that he'd repay it monthly. 

On the day of our wedding he decided he doesn't want to get married anymore. I was heartbroken  I don't  want to lie. I think I cried for a whole week if not more.

 He left and he didn't explain anything to me nor my family.  He just said ""I thought i was ready but I'm not""  and when I tried to stop him but didn't  want to listen. He went Ghost on me. Even his family  had no clue why he took that decision.

 I tried reaching  out so we can talk things through maybe he had cold feet  or to figure out a reason why he didn't want to marry me any more. But he didn't  return  any of my calls& texts. I went to his apartment and found  it empty. He left the province and moved some places else.( No, we didn't  live together he had his place and I had mine.) So I felt blindsided by his decision.

Few months later, He started posting pictures of him and a young girl on a vacation. I have never been so devastated. I couldn't  believe  he moved on so quickly  and forgot about  me or our child. It was hard hearing our son asking where his dad is.

I didn't  get closure or anything but i decided so soldier on and try to forget about him because i knew then that he is not coming back.

 Few days ago his friend  reached out. We met for coffee.He told me that Taylor  told him why he left and i know the reason why he chose to leave.

 The thing is I cheated on him three  years ago and had a baby with another guy. We spoke and prayed about it. We even attended relationship counselling together. We both agreed satan used me and we defeated him by sticking together. Every thing  started  to be great  in our relationship he seemed happy and we seemed stronger than ever. He even stepped  in as a father figure to my son. So him telling his friend  that he left because  I cheated on him was surprising when I thought we've moved on from it.

 I have a feeling he faked the forgiveness. That's why he decided to humiliate me in front of my family, friends and colleagues. I will never forgive him. Now I'm left with a financial burden that I have to pay back when he said he'll repay it himself

So will I be AH if I take him to court ?",0,1745341100.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,11,0.33,False

1k5baqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HappilyEvaAnnoying/comments/1k5baqs/date_twins_kinda/,Date Twins! Kinda,"She and I are practically date twins! I wanted to share my breast reduction experience thus far if by chance folks are detered by.....whatever is going on in Westport.

I am 8 days post op from my reductuon. Hoping to have gone from a G to C cup. No lipo or drains following the removal of 600 grams from each immaculate bewb.

 My insurance paid for it  besides the copay and deductible. I had an amazing plastic surgeon at a world renowned hospital and got my pre auth with no hoop jumping!

I was able to sip from my Stanely day one! 💪
But I work out a lot.

I have slept pretty well with my  wedge/neck pillow combo, showering is fine, and  I can reach high enough for a coffee mug with ease. I was able to blow dry my hair since day 2. Sans round brush, but this is acceptable to me. I drove yesterday and short walks are grand. 

I easily fatigued and swollen, but this experience has been easier than expected. Though,  it doesn't appear to be nearly as easy as Eva's! Good for her; she definitely wins at breast reduction.",1,1745340890.0,HappilyEvaAnnoying,0,0.6,False
1k5b96g,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1k5b96g/just_finished_season_2/,Just finished season 2,"Okay so I know a lot of the common theories as I’ve been reading through now that I’m finished the second season but here’s some questions/thoughts I have :

- first of all I don’t think it was Helena at the end with Gemma going to the stairwell, it makes no sense to Helena’s character. The last time we see her she’s miserable that she still has to be doing this and her dad is a total weirdo like hey eat those eggs raw. She’s not like “yes papa” she’s like ugh my life sucksssss. Also with Jame visiting Helly it was very telling that him and his daughter don’t actually have a great relationship so why would she have shifted into this gear so last minute out of no where to go do this. It’s a little chaotic lots of holes. 

-speaking of Helena it shows that she watched footage of her and mark kissing at the end of the first season. Again it kind of showed Helena wasn’t watching it for planning but more reminiscent of something she’s never had it seemed like. But if she can watch the footage (and so can Drummond, her dad, etc) and they can see them working on the file, how is no one catching wind of the plan? I almost assumed that it was part of the plan that mark found out and went to save her. Is that just a hole in the plot or is it more evidence that Helena always knew the plan and just kept her mouth shut because she secretly started despising her families work once she became severed as well. 

- I love the Ricken is a goat theory 😂 but I gotta be honest I don’t know what to do with that information. What would that even mean that Lumon is doing if he is a goat? Lol it doesn’t really make any sense but I’d love for someone to give me that plot that makes that make sense. 

-the birth cabin thing is also interesting to me because you’d think if Lumon was testing this theory of severance for child birth they’d only allow folks who were in testing to deliver but Devon has her baby there. Any thoughts on why that is? A company who is so top secret you’d think would be more mindful of that. Especially considering the whole what if mark got coffee thought. Would he have become his innie? Like how was that not something that was managed. 

-you’re telling me they have chips in their head and don’t have tracking on these folks? They definitely do, Lumons security team leaves me with a lot of questions. 😂 did I miss something? Because mark is in the woods with cobel and it’s like why wouldn’t they see where he is lol like I know he has to finish file so baby gloves to get him in the office but idk seems sketch. 

Okay that’s all thanks for any input from the hive.

1k5b6pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1k5b6pc/what_does_audhd_look_like_for_you/,What does AuDHD look like for you?,"I know there are hundreds of posts here with people describing their experience, but I also know that sometimes it's helpful to just have a place to share our experiences and perhaps seem them reflected in other's descriptions. I think that's what I'm looking for as well. I have known I had ADHD for 30 years (I'm 38) but having two toddlers while working full-time has led to a deeper burnout than I've ever experienced before and led to recognizing that I am almost certainly autistic too.   
  
For the most part, this discovery over the past month has been fascinating and liberating. When I've shared my discovery with close friends and loved ones, they've all said they could see it. My mental health team are not experts in ASD, but they agreed that they could see the possibility. I've taken the AQ (30/50), the RASD (117), the Cat-Q (142), and the Aspie quiz (124). My numbers aren't off the charts, but they are all firmly in the strong possibility of autism range. I've got a consult next week to pursue a formal dx. In the meantime, I'm just stuck in that cycle of feeling like things about me that have never made sense before finally do, and then second-guessing everything and thinking maybe I'm not autistic after all. It's maddening. I just thought maybe I could write out some of what I experience as someone with \[potentially\] AuDHD and see how others' experiences compare.   
  
I'd love anyone who feels up for sharing to do so too. Feel free to skim mine because I know it's long - I just can't shut up. 

Note: I was formally dx'ed with ADHD at age 8, and with Social Anxiety, OCD, depression, and general anxiety in high school. I don't know how all of that fits in here - whether they're all also true or some of them were misdiagnoses because I was a highly verbal teen girl. 

My experience of AuDHD:

\- As a child I struggled hugely with emotional regulation, focus, organization, and follow-through. I was obsessed with fantasy worlds - with proving they were real. I read all the classic fantasy books obsessively. I worried massively about other people in the world hurting, esp my loved ones, and even inanimate objects like my stuffed animals, who I was very attached to. I talked A LOT and was advanced in terms of communication and intellectual skills, but notably behind socially. I tended to have one or two close friends to whom I was extremely attached, but generally felt better talking to adults. These are the things that led to my ADHD dx (ADD at the time), though I don't think in 1993 I ever would have been dx'ed as autistic.

\- As a teen, I had extremely close best friendships (I eventually came out as bi, which is another layer here), and eventually became the ""queen bee"" of my own little social circle of nerds. We had our own parties and adventures, and it was very important to me to be in control of all the dynamics. Otherwise, I felt overwhelmed and at risk of exclusion.

\- I was always too intense, too talkative, too loud, too-oversharing, too obsessed, too self-absorbed for everyone else. I always said and did the wrong thing or the awkward thing or the hurtful thing without meaning too. I became obsessed with analyzing social dynamics to figure out how to ""do them right."" 

\- I used to sit on the floor in the hallway before school (I like cannot sit in a chair with my feet on the floor - it just feels wrong??) and sometimes kept toys on my desk. Even as an adult, I often worked while wrapped up in blankets. I've constantly been surprised to discover that these things are weird. 

\- I also grew up in a white, Southern fairly affluent family where ""image"" and ""proper manners"" held a lot of weight. i can still hear my mother's voice assessing me in my head all the time. 

\- I told my parents I didn't want to take ADHD meds anymore in 7th grade and they told me I didn't have to as long as I performed at the level they expected. So I did whatever I had to to achieve that.

\- I managed to be fairly successful both academically and career-wise largely by calculating exactly how much effort I had to expend in which ways in order to meet various standards. I impressed people with my writing and my ability to capture and express emotion creatively in said writing. 

\- I went to seminary and became ordained, but found parish ministry challenging because there wasn't enough external structure and I found the social dynamics extremely overwhelming. I always thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. 

\- I do not struggle as much with taking things too literally - I actually love metaphors. But I hate practical jokes or any situation where I'm supposed to just sus out the dynamics without knowing the explicit parameters and expectations. 

\- I need schedules, agendas, attendees etc. I need details so I have something to hold onto. 

\- I have always had some big sensory issues: the biggest one is fingers/fingernails on rough fabrics. Even just seeing or hearing someone else do it makes me scream involuntarily and curl up in the fetal position. I also really struggle with loud, sharp, or competing noises - I can't track a conversation or focus at all when these things are present. I can't deal with the feeling of cold air on my skin so I have to turn air vents away from me and I pretty much always wear long pants and keep a jacket with me. On the other hand, I LOVE heat and tend to keep my heated seats and fireplace on year round. These days, with 2 toddlers - i am literally constantly overstimulated and it feels like I may actually just stop being able to function.

\- I care very deeply for the people in my life but I'm not great at showing it or keeping up with them when they aren't present. And for some reason, even though I know my people love me, it's like I struggle to actually \*feel\* their love? It's frustrating and scary. 

\- I'm actually very good at describing my emotions in very articulate detail, but I find it basically impossible to actually access difficult or intense emotions in front of other people. Like literally a main character died in my favorite show last week and I was watching with my spouse and I couldn't rewatch alone until today - so today I finally broke down and sobbed and before this I've been in a state of pseudo-emotional constipation and panic about it. 

\- I get obsessed with certain things and it's all I can think about. I'll watch the same show dozens of times, learn everything there is to know about it, the writers, directors, all the actors. Read all the interviews, explore the fandoms. Write my own fanfic. It's not just that I'm into it - it's like it becomes a part of my identity. The Flash is like a key component of my love story with my husband - a big part of how we got together because when I was freaking out with anxiety and feeling tempted to run away when we first got together because I was overwhelmed, I would just watched The Flash over and over again to occupy my thoughts and keep me grounded. Eventually, i invited him to watch it with me - which was a BIG deal. I do also have shorter term hyper-fixations, but these deeper obsessions last for years and have a huge emotional component for me. Sometimes, i feel more connected to these imaginary things than the real world. 

\- Sometimes i just can't stop thinking about or focusing on something I'm obsessed with to get other things done (see: writing this post while I'm on deadline for work). It's like I cannot get my brain to disengage. 

\- Sometimes, I feel disconnected from my own life and the world? Like I'm watching it happen. It usually only happens for short stretches at a time, but it's really disconcerting. 

\- I really struggle with body awareness. Like I can't really tell when I'm hungry or tired unless it's really bad. Or when a therapist asks me ""how does that feel in your body?"" like wtf does that even mean?? What am I supposed to be feeling??

\- I crave novelty, but I also find it really overwhelming. I try to know as much as I can about a new situation before hand (ie. I read the plots of shows and movies before I watch them, I memorize menus and even look at photos before I go to a new restaurant, etc)

\- I find social situations very overwhelming mostly because I feel like I have to be ""on"" the whole time. Constantly aware, analyzing, performing. 

\- I thought I was good at reading people, but I'm starting to think maybe I just always assume people are upset with me... 

\- I am mostly really disorganized and struggle to keep up with basic life stuff, but then I have these routines that keep me sane. I eat the same food every time I go to a restaurant, or at home I eat the same thing for lunch every day (and breakfast, and dinner). I have the routes I always drive to and from familiar places. And a pattern for how I make coffee. 

\- I'm always noticing and identifying connections between things - noting patterns etc. The most obvious example of this I can think of is every time I see a numbers sequence, I immediately identify the relationships between them. Eg. my home phone number as a kid was all multiples of 3 etc. 

\- Ever since I was a little kid, every couple of years I go through these ""episodes"" where for 2-3 weeks at time I get fixated on thoughts about death, eternity, infinity etc. The stuff our brains can't really understand. It causes panic-like sensations but I can't turn it off. It's like my brain keeps trying to understand what it can't and time collapses in on itself like it isn't real and nothing has meaning. During these episodes my only relief is sleep, but I can't really sleep or eat or function at all. it's gotten easier as I've gotten older, but as a kid they tortured me and I couldn't even tell anyone about them without triggering them again. 

\- I really, really struggle with not knowing answers. I need certainty whenever there is certainty to be had. And I also really struggle with withholding information (about myself). It's like painful for me not to be radically transparent, which sometimes gets me in trouble, as you might imagine. 

\- I'm sure there are other things but this feels too long already. 

I'm in burnout right now I think, and I just feel like an exposed nerve all the time. i'm taking naps twice a day despite not having time, everything takes so much energy, the brain fog is awful - i forget things like basic math and how to put a car in park, I am overloaded and struggling to figure out a way out - but I'm hopeful that identifying the autism element is a start. 

\---

I'm not asking for a diagnosis from any of y'all - but does anyone relate to any of this? i guess I'm afraid all of these things could be true and not be autism. I don't know why that scares me except that it's like I finally have an answer that makes sense and I don't want to lose it.

1k5b50t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k5b50t/landlord_has_been_getting_on_my_nerves/,Landlord has been getting on my nerves,"FYI we are in a long-term air bnb instead of short term home lease - we have 3 pets and it was difficult to find short term home rentals that allow that. We're only here for 6 months and once we're out we're going somewhere else. I really can't trust this lady at all anymore. There's the homeowner, and this lady who works independently to manage his properties. They have 4 that I know of on this street, all townhouses in a city alley. The front units have garages and the back units don't.   


**1. The Lease Issue:** She called us as we were still driving to the house for the first time to give us some more details. She then offered to possibly take us off the air bnb lease and set us up with an actual one without the 3rd party. I immediately had red flags pinging but spouse told her to let us know the price. She confidently said both her and us will save money doing it this way.  I told spouse in private that it seems shady to me, and we'd be without the protection of the 3rd party among other things. He said well let's see, if she saves us a ton of money in the long run it might be worth it. She and I coordinate the current pricing, she talks to the homeowner and comes back to us with the EXACT SAME price we're already paying, plus asking for a security deposit on top of that. Bitch, do you realize that if we take your offer we're actually losing money in the long run?! On top of being without the protection of the 3rd party. We were offended, frankly, and it still blows my mind that she'd present the offer like that in the first place. I just said, ""no thanks, we'll stick with air bnb"" and she didn't even counter offer. Your loss! We aren't that stupid, lady.



**2. The Parking Issue:** *Hereeee we go, get ready for this one.* When we first arrived she told us that visitors could park in the lot next door or in the alley right in front of our garage. At first no one was parking in the alley but over time more and more people parked there. At one point she calls me to say the neighbor just left and someone is parked in front of their garage, can I please go get a license plate photo so she can have the car moved? Okay sure, I send it and the car is gone in a couple hours. A couple months later there's almost always cars parked in front of both garages. These are very slim one-car garages, even without a car blocking us I have trouble getting in (thank god for side sensors and cameras). One day I am trying to park and just can't get it lined up because of the car parked in the alley. I send the landlord photos of my current position: an inch away from the alley car and not at all lined up for the garage. I ask, ""Is there any way we can get people to stop parking here?"" Oops. If I had known what was coming I would have stayed quiet. 

* ""I don't know how to get people to stop parking there. I'm calling the cops."" I tell her no, please don't it's okay. We can deal with it, I'd rather not cause issues or conflict.  Her next message is ""I called the cops, they're asking for the license plates."" Wtf lady. My spouse gets the car parked while I send license plate photos. I hoped that was the end of it. 
* About 40 minutes later I go out to check the mail and the across-the-street neighbor is outside. I never opened the locked gate, just grabbed the mail and turned around when he says, ""HEY. Did you call the cops on a car parked here? Is there a problem?"" Shit. I say, ""It was my landlord that did it, but yes it is causing issues when anyone parks there. We can't get into our garage safely."" He says, ""You didn't need to get the cops involved! You have a garage, we don't!""  ""If you have an issue please call the landlord or the cops, this was not my decision and it's out of my hands"" He tries to respond but my heartrate is already up so I turn around and go inside while he's still trying to talk to me. 
* When I get inside I tell my spouse what happened. He is livid. He goes outside to talk to the guy and told him ""don't get aggressive with my wife!"" I don't know the rest of the conversation but he comes back in. 15 minutes later that car is gone and there's a different car in the same spot. Landlord apparently knows somehow and texts me, ""Can you send me the plates of the other car too?"" I can't get the plate photos from my balcony so I go back out into the alley and take photos of the new car. 
* As soon as I snap photos, the window of the house across the street opens. It's a young lady in her mid 20's and she's SHOUTING at me. ""I SEE YOU! I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I SEE YOU!! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT!"" I'm bewildered but happy to explain the reason. I'm willing to have a conversation about it at least, get everyone on the same page even if I am upsetting them. I try to say something and she slams her window shut. Okay lady, I tried. 
* Go back inside and call the landlord, explaining what just happened and that the neighbor was shouting at me. Spouse overhears and says ""oh hell no"" and goes back outside. At this point there are 4 people in the middle of the alley shouting at each other, mainly because the female neighbor will NOT calm down and have a normal conversation. Spouse is defensive about her behavior towards me, the male neighbor and I are both trying to keep things civil. That's when she shouts, ""and your wife needs to get on a treadmill!"" Ah shit. Spouse sees red, I am convinced if she were a guy he would have punched them for saying that. All this while a car is trying to get through the alley so we had to step away from each other to make room. I think this calmed things down a bit because we all came back inside shortly after. 
* Landlord calls me back. I tell her about the argument that just happened and she laughs hard that ""the Jerry Springer show is on our street today!!"" She then tells me that cops are on their way for the second car, and that she told them we have a small child and that makes parking difficult for us. WAIT. Yep, she LIED to the POLICE on my behalf, without asking me, saying that we have a small child. Fuck that shit. I immediately decide I am done with her shit, done with goading her on since I finally realize she's getting a sick enjoyment from all of this, and I am NOT corroborating your lie if the police speak to me.
* In the end, cars very rarely park there and I have refused to communicate anything about them to her now. She called the cops when I asked her not to and LIED to them without even asking if I'm okay with that, and now we also have had a feud with our neighbors. This was all handled in such a stellar way - /s. And you know what? Turns out it's actually illegal to park in alleys AT ALL. She also explained that one of her previous tenants actually did hit a car that was parked there before. She told me this after the conflict. She said if a firetruck needs to get down there they need space. So not only did all of this happen, but her telling us visitors can park there is a lie - and she KNEW it. She said she is asking the city for an official 'no parking' sign now.



**3. The Coffee Machine:** One day she calls to say a new tenant will be in the other property that shares the yard with us. She asks if our unit has an extra coffee machine. I look around and tell her there's a keurig in the closet we aren't using. She asks me to put it out for her (and I was happy to) but it shows a lack of planning and now we don't have a keurig (but yes we still have a regular drip machine, nbd)



**4. The Dog Issue:** She then tells me that the new tenant will have ""4 service chihuahuas"" and they are all elderly dogs. She says ""I'm worried about the shared yard... would it be okay if your dog doesn't use the yard anymore? It's a liability with that many dogs and I don't want anyone getting hurt"" Uhh.. my dog still needs to potty outside. I remind her that he had leg surgery so using the fake grass potty mat she suggested putting on the 4th floor roof is NOT going to work for us. She suggests ""just go out the garage and use the front"". There's no grass on our street except for other people's yards. So her solution was to kick the existing tenant's dog out of the yard and have us walk around the corner every time he has to potty. Wtf. 



**5. The Parking Issue, Revisited:** My parents are visiting starting tomorrow. I asked her in February where they can park when they get here. Back then she mentioned parking in the alley in front of our garage (LOL) or using the permit lot next door. I ask her about a permit and she texted exactly this - ""I would offer you a permit but we are waiting for our new ones to come in"" I say ""No problem, they're coming in April so let me know if you do get them."" and she responds ""Oh we will definitely have it by then :)"" Great! So I waited until April 10th to ask her again about getting a permit for my parents while they're here. She says, ""We only have one and it's for the other guest since you have a garage and they don't. I don't recall stating I could get you one. Did I say that?"" I send her a screenshot of the texts and she responds ""Ahh I see where the confusion comes from. We only get one permit, sorry"" OKAAYYY. So now my parents don't have anywhere to park at all. I ask ""Do you have any alternatives for us? Since at this point parking in the alley won't work"" and she doesn't respond all day. She called me in the morning to address it and was repeating the same things with no solution. INSTEAD my parents ended up calling the city to see where they could park. Apparently you have to have a permit to park on the street too. City told my parents about a free lot about a 6 minute walk away. This will be GREAT for my mom's knee surgery she had earlier this year. 



**6. Random Visits:** She also will call and say ""hey are you home? I'm outside"". She's done this a few times. I totally get you have a property to manage, but I'm not used to the landlord randomly showing up. Luckily she doesn't come inside and of all things on this list, it's not a huge deal. But I was telling all of the above to a friend on the phone and she calls during that conversation to ask me to open the garage door so she can adjust the sprinklers. I go help and call my friend back - ""That was actually her right now!"" 

I really can't with this lady anymore. At this point you've lied to the police in my name, my dog can't use the yard anymore, and my parents have nowhere to park. Frankly I'm most irritated by her kicking my dog out of the yard as that one has long term effects I actually have to deal with. Every time she calls now I wonder what else is going to go wrong. 3 months left and we're out of here! 

**tl;dr:** I can't trust my landlord because she always changes what she says and I'm irritated

Alongside me is 6 other bridesmaids. The bride is paying for my hair and makeup but other than that she is expecting the bridesmaids to pay for their own hair and makeup (which they are required to at least do 1 of the 2) and also their dresses. The bride has also required everyone to buy certain outfits for pictures at the bachelorette trip. On top of this, she is also having a bridal shower which she has a wish list for on top of a wish list for the actual wedding.

Even though the bride is my friend, this wedding planning situation has also just rubbed me the wrong way for a few different reasons. For example, she has hinted to me how she wants this $300 coffee maker in her registry. I would playfully say maybe (knowing I probably won’t get it). But what rubs me the wrong way is how her and her finance has taken multiple trips this year which I’m roughly estimation to cost more than $1,000 each trip. But she’s over here asking me to get her a $300 gift? Maybe I’m being cheap but this just doesn’t seem right to me.

My question is, why is this even a thing? This is my fourth wedding I’m attending in the past 3 years and the common theme seems to be how the couple getting married are always expecting gifts and for the wedding party to fork out money for a day that they decided to have. I’m not sure if this is just in America or other countries as well. To me, it seems very selfish to expect people to spend over a few hundred dollars and expect gifts from them just because you’re getting married. Again, this is a day that YOU decided to have. Just wanted to get some thoughts on this as maybe I’m looking at it the wrong way.

1k5axjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/typeme/comments/1k5axjx/type_me_please/,type me please,"I am female, 24 years old (born in 2001), born in December, and my zodiac sign is Sagittarius.

I am currently working as an assistant in the Trade Marketing department. I don’t particularly enjoy my current job because I feel that I’m not suited for working with numbers. I realized this when I observed my manager—she is incredibly sharp with numbers, can immediately spot inconsistencies in data, and can predict market trends based on those figures. Meanwhile, I feel completely clueless. I have no interest in numbers and no curiosity about how they relate to the market.
However, there are certain aspects that make me stay. Most of my current tasks are system-related, and I enjoy understanding the logic behind how systems work and finding ways to optimize time and results.

Regarding my childhood, it was probably similar to most people’s, but from a young age, I was under a lot of pressure regarding grades and peers because of my father’s frequent saying: “If others can do it, you must be able to do it too.” When I got a B, he would be disappointed. This put a lot of pressure on me, making me strive for perfection, always aiming for high scores without any mistakes. So, whenever I scored low, I’d get scared and cry immediately.
This pressure made me anxious and emotionally suppressed because my father would never believe what I said and always wanted me to behave according to what he believed was right. Due to this emotional repression, I would burst into tears if anyone mentioned it.

Psychologically, I think I suffer from severe overthinking. Even a tiny mistake will spiral into a huge worry for me, making me feel like it will negatively affect not only myself but also those around me. When this happens, I just want to escape from reality to avoid facing it. I hate bothering others and prefer doing everything by myself. I’m not used to asking for help or borrowing things, so I always carry a lot with me, thinking, “If I don’t need it, maybe someone else will.” As a result, my bag is always heavy, and people often come to me to borrow things—which I don’t mind.
I also can’t socialize the way others around me do. If I feel uncomfortable, my expression shows it immediately, which might make people think I’m impulsive. But I can’t hide my feelings. I constantly seek recognition, but I don’t brag about what I know or can do because I don’t want others to have high expectations and end up disappointed.
I always want to be the first person mentioned in a subject or field, but I’ve never felt truly satisfied about it, as I always seem to be the second or third choice in people’s minds. I’m easily emotionally triggered, and it’s hard to control my emotions, which makes people think I’m overly sensitive and cry too easily. I often feel insecure, fearing that my knowledge isn’t enough and worrying about how I’ll be perceived when I share it.

If I have to spend the weekend alone, I might feel a bit bored since my family usually gathers at my house on Sundays. Without them, something feels missing. However, I still feel more comfortable being at home alone than going out. It gives me a proper weekend where I can do everything on my own schedule, without having to follow others’ expectations.

I don’t like sports much, and I dislike going out. If I do go out, it’s usually riding around the city with my boyfriend or hanging out with close friends at our usual coffee spot. Whenever I go out, I constantly worry, “Is this okay?” “Is my outfit acceptable?”—these questions always linger in my head because I care about how others perceive me.
When it comes to travel, I enjoy it—but only if I’m the one planning the trip. I like to prepare thoroughly and spend a lot of time at one place to fully experience its atmosphere and surroundings.

My curiosity depends on how much I care about the topic. If I’m not interested, I can completely ignore it and not follow any updates. But if I do care, I’ll spend hours researching until I’ve gathered enough information.
I have a lot of ideas for myself but also a lot of fears and worries before I start. Things like, “Can I do it well?” “What if I fail?” “What will people think of me?”… I’m often curious about psychology, why people think differently, why they act a certain way in specific situations, and topics like MBTI, cognitive functions, Enneagram—as tools to understand myself better.
My ideas usually revolve around these areas, and I often wonder if learning a new skill would suit me and whether I could do well in it.

Back in school, I was often chosen to be the leader or class monitor because people saw me as responsible and observant. At that time, I didn’t feel entirely suited for the role, but I accepted it because I liked being able to organize things my way.
My leadership style leans toward listening and observing the team, assigning tasks I know they can do well, while I focus on the groundwork and overseeing everything. That said, I tend to prefer being in the background cheering people on rather than leading from the front.
That’s probably my weakness as a leader. But I never let anyone affect my team or its members; when needed, I’ll be the first to stand up and protect them. I want to bring the best for my team, not just for my own benefit, but for everyone’s.
I’m a perfectionist, so I expect team members to complete their tasks to my satisfaction. If they can’t or won’t, I’ll take it on myself.

I don’t think I have much artistic talent, but I value art and always want to appreciate it deeply. That’s why I studied music theory, learned to play the ukulele, explored color theory in painting, and learned a bit about music in general.
I love art, especially music and painting, because I’m easily drawn to sounds and colors. Most of my notebooks are color-coded and carefully decorated, each color having a purpose.
Music is how I relax—I immerse myself in it completely. I care more about how a song is composed than its popularity, since many famous songs are just trendy but structurally unremarkable. So, my taste in music may differ from others’.

I’m a very nostalgic person. I often think about the past and can still vividly feel the familiarity when talking about it. In the present, I try my best to live well and complete my work. I don’t follow a strict to-do list; I keep things in my head and act accordingly. I constantly learn to improve myself and gain more knowledge about what truly interests me.
As for the future, I often come up with many scenarios but never feel completely certain—because who knows what tomorrow brings? So I focus on living well in the present and becoming a better version of myself.
I keep growing, but I’m also always grateful for my past because without it, I wouldn’t be who I am today.

Whether I help someone or not depends on how I perceive their need and whether I’m capable of helping them as they expect. But in most cases, I won’t say no.
I’m always enthusiastic toward people, and some say that’s my weakness. But if I don’t help, I’ll feel guilty and blame myself. I’m especially scared of homeless people—especially children and the elderly—because I often can’t help them, which makes me feel very guilty and deeply disturbed.

I’m not a very logical person, but maybe due to my father’s influence, I always want things around me to follow a flow that I’ve determined to be right and effective.
Efficiency and productivity are very important to me. If I’ve decided to start something, it means I’ve agreed to spend my time on it—so my time and effort must be used wisely and produce meaningful results.

I usually don’t care how others do things, but for those I care about—especially my boyfriend—I want him to act and do things in the order and way I think is most effective. If he doesn’t, I’ll get irritated and lash out at him.

My hobby is makeup. I enjoy the meticulousness it requires and the way it combines skin, color, technique, and tools to create a satisfying look. It boosts my confidence.

My learning style emphasizes logic. I can remember and apply something best when I understand it thoroughly and can logically connect it to real-life contexts or prior knowledge.
The most challenging learning environment for me is one that’s too crowded, as it distracts and overwhelms me.
In class, I tend to sit in the front to stay focused and engage with the lecturer. I enjoy studying in cafes, but only quiet, low-key ones.
I love note-taking and color-code everything according to my own system. My notebooks are detailed and logical, and many teachers appreciated them.
I enjoy language, art, and music classes because I can fully focus and feel passionate about them.

I’m not very confident in my strategic planning skills. My strategies usually focus on bringing benefits to both myself and the people around me. I observe and understand people’s strengths and weaknesses, then assign tasks I’m sure they can do well, aiming for a cohesive, expected outcome. I’m good at breaking down projects into manageable tasks and always prepare for unexpected situations. I can adapt when needed.

To me, finding something that meets two criteria—something I love and something I can understand deeply—is crucial. I’ve always struggled with not knowing what I love or excel at, so I constantly seek it to grow in the most suitable direction.

My wish is to remain who I am now—someone who is always aware of and working toward becoming a better version of myself.

I have many fears—fear of not being recognized, of negativity, of losing something, of being misunderstood…
I don’t feel comfortable in corporate environments because of the number of people. I always have to keep a good attitude and engage in small talk, even though I constantly feel like they’re judging me, even if they’re not.
I hate feeling left out because it makes me feel like I’m always the last one and unimportant.

To me, “highs” mean waking up each day without feeling like life is hell—whether that’s from living in a family I’m not comfortable with or doing a job I don’t enjoy but have to do to survive.
An ideal life is one where I can do what I want, buy what I like, and feel at peace.

On the other hand, “lows” are the opposite of that.

I’m quite realistic. I can look at reality and make decisions, even if they’re blunt. But sometimes, I daydream—I get lost in my thoughts and theories and tune out everything around me.

If I found myself in an empty, silent void with no one around, I’d be extremely panicked and pray that it was just a dream.

I tend to make impulsive decisions like “I want it, I got it,” and usually don’t overthink. If something makes me hesitate for over a day, then it’s not that important and I’ll put it aside.
I’ve never regretted my decisions—right or wrong, they’ve led me to where I am now, still striving for the life I want and to become better.

I often can’t control my emotions, so I express them openly. I deeply value emotions—mine and others’. I believe everyone is a unique individual, but I also can’t help but wonder why people feel the way they do and whether I can empathize with them.

I’m the kind of person who easily nods in agreement during conversations, just to let people know I’m listening and trying to empathize with their story. I don’t want to interrupt because I value that they chose to share it with me.

I tend to compromise with myself. I don’t want to push myself too hard, so I often can’t follow certain personal rules. But in a group setting, I always follow rules because I don’t want to cause trouble or inconvenience others.

To me, an ideal life is one where I feel truly comfortable and can immerse myself in all the beautiful things it has to offer.",1,1745340007.0,typeme,1,1.0,False
1k5ax0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1k5ax0l/i_am_appalled_by_the_way_ive_been_treated_my/,I am appalled by the way I’ve been treated my DreamWorks Animation Recruiting,"As a college junior, I’ve applied to ~50 internship applications since November and haven’t heard back from anything yet. 

I applied to a few positions for DreamWorks when they opened back in March, and was able to have 2 coffee chats (including 1 recruiter for the role I was interested in) with people who worked at the company. I got in contact with them via a friend who knew someone who worked at the company.


Let’s call my friend’s connection to DreamWorks Person A. I was originally going to reach out to my friend’s connection, but because she wasn’t available at the time, Person A kindly gave me the contacts of 2 of her colleagues I could reach out to for coffee chats. She mentioned she let her coworkers know I’d be reaching out to them. Let’s call these 2 colleagues Person B and Person C. 

I reach out to Person B and C with the contacts I was given and I had the coffee chats with them, which went pretty well in my opinion. Especially considering Person B was a recruiter for the internship I had applied for, I thought this would increase my chances of getting the position or at least an interview. 

About a week after initially meeting with Person B and C, I send a thank you message to both of them thanking them for their time and about how much I learned. I also mentioned that if they were comfortable and able to, I inquired about a potential referral. However, I always made it clear there was no pressure or expectation to do so. I sent this on March 10th. 

About 3 weeks to a month go by, I don’t hear anything. I feel it’s appropriate to send another follow-up especially since it’s almost been a month at this point. Still nothing, which doesn’t bother me, maybe it was in the spam folder or got buried by other things ? 

I send another follow up about a week and half after (4/10), then my final one about week after that (last week 4/17). All of the messages I sent were spaced out to be about a week apart (with the exception of the 1st one which was sent a month after).  I had basically moved on at this point and wasn't expecting anything. Until....

I recently had a call with my friend who connected me to catch up with him and he told me he had recieved a messaage from Person A regarding my application.  Person A said that I had ""sent too many follow-up messages to her co-worker, Person B the recruiter, to where it crossed a line and made her uncomfortable"".  She also mentioned that this situation ""reflected badly on her and was embarrasing.""  

What confused me the most is that I had recieved no communication whatsoever from Person B or Person C about not wanting to be contacted or any discomfort.  I was only hearing this via word of mouth from my friend. I never saw the harm in sending a few follow-ups, especially if they weren't the one responding. I always made sure to make it abundantly clear I was not expecting a referral from anyone, but simply just asking if it was possible.  I would've stopped asking had Person B maybe sent me an email directly.  

What's even MORE crazy is that Person B is in the Early Careers/Recruiting Department! I'm upset that Person B decided to NOT let me know she didn't want to be contacted, and that it was PERSON A who sent a message to MY FRIEND (who only connected everyone, nothing more) letting him know about her discomfort... instead of Person B just sending an email to me.  It got way too overcomplicated. 

The more I think about this, the more stupid I think it is. Recruiters (including Person B) will always tell you to be persistent and find ways to stand out in the application process, but a college student sending you a follow-up or two about a meeting YOU never followed up on is ""uncomfortable?"" Maybe if you're not comofrtable with that social interaction of talking to someone you don't know, maybe you shouldn't be in recruiting and doing outreach to college students for them! 

The whole thing really soured my experience because is this the way they are talking about other applicants who are trying to simply meet people from the company to learn more about how they function? I was quite literally doing everything right (cold emailing, coffee chats, following up letting them know I'm thankful they met with me, etc...) but I suppose it doesn't matter.  

To be clear, I am not upset Person B didn't give me a referral, but rather instead of directly reaching out to me to say she wasn't interested, Person A ended up being the one reaching out to reprimand my friend who had little to do with it all. Crazy how there's a double standard-- if I worked for this company and didn't respond to them about an email that was sent over a month ago, I'd totally be reprimanded. However, it's completely okay for recruiters to do this while giving you the false advice of ""standing out"".  It totally doesn't make sense because in trying to stand out I was ""doing too much."" 

I would much rather have recruiters be honest with me, whether it be about they think I'm not fit, they've found someone else, AND that a lot of success in the job market these days is just pure luck! I'd much prefer honesty and transparency before they even bother to waste my time with a coffee chat. I was very clear with my intentions in my messages and the meetings. But I guess that's too much to ask for. 

*sigh* 

Not really looking for a solution, just wanted to share my experience! I am not letting this get me down :), just wanted to express my feelings.

1k5av0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1k5av0h/so_frustrated_with_my_husband/,So frustrated with my 'husband',"It's in quotes because we are starting our separation but are still living together and still married on paper. 

I've commented here before about how my partner drives me insane. Well it finally happened, he went to his doctor after trying to get out of depression and said 'Hey, I think I might had ADHD.' I had to see a psychologist over multiple visits to get my diagnosis. Him? The doctor had him fill out a questionnaire, said yep looks like it and put him on Vyvanse. 

Now it has pretty much confirmed that he has ADHD, that's not my frustration. He got his diagnosis so easily and is now experiencing a better mood and is no longer 'depressed'...

However he is driving me insane by telling me to increase my meds because 'You will feel better.' Bitch don't tell me how I'm going to feel. I'm happy and functional on my 20 mg and I still get to enjoy my morning caffeine hit of coffee or tea which brings me joy. 

He also got made at me this morning because I expressed concern about how quickly he is losing weight (just not eating which I know is a side effect) without him going to the gym or exercising and his response was 'Aren't you a fucking ray of sunshine'. 

We both work physically demanding jobs and have to pass a yearly physical test to ensure we meet standards. He won't be able to if he loses all his muscle. But w/e I haven't been trying to lost weight for the past 5 years so I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about... Ugh... 

Last rant I promise, he made a comment to me last week that just reminded me why we are separating. Because we have a child together and not a lot of time to seek out other 'friends for company' if you get my meaning, we have been enjoying friends with benefits status. Well because now he's doing better mentally he wants to 'experiment' and see if he can experience a full orgasm again, not just the physical release. And it just made me feel like a tool or a test subject and I'm not into that at all. So now I have no desire to be friends with benefits and I don't know how to bring it up because I still have to live with him for now and I don't want to hear his narcissistic defense whenever I tell him something he doesn't want to hear.

Confront or bury?,"TL,DR: I found messages on my bfs phone with a girl which are weird and messages with his mother, where he only complains about me. 

We are together since 4 years, im his first partner in all regards, hes not my first at all. the first 2 years were really good, i chose him because he seemed very kind, loyal and trustworthy and of course i like him as a person. the last two years have been extremely difficult, we fight a lot and i have some underlying mental health struggles and a physical disability. i find him to be very cold, when we fight and very unempathetic. and i at some point just get very insulting and blame him a lot, coming from a lot of childhood trauma, which i know is bad. we fight very dirty. and it doesnt seem to get better.

in 2023 i went through his phone the first time, because we had some problems. i know i shouldnt have. 
then i noticed he was writing with a girl we know (a friend from a male friend of his, she was at university with us) and they wrote back an forth, not outright flirting but definitely in a grey area. they met up for coffee and he didnt tell me about it. i confronted him and he git really angry that i snooped which i understand. he kind of apologized but not really. and then he put it like i want to forbid him to see her, like im that girl. but it was really hurting me how they write to each other. 
now after 1.5 years i looked again and theyre writing again more, and he asked her to meet again but it didnt happen so fsr, but he also didnt tell me again. 
and also i found some very disturbing content. they were making fun of non binary people and how those people are mentally ill…like a completely different side hes showing at home with me. i know he has difficulty understanding but never talking this badly about it. 
i also noticed that when he writes to his mother about me hes only complaining and telling her the bad stuff about me, never what nice thongs i do. which im very limited to right now because im doing really bad, but that really deeply made me sad. 

what would you do? we had this talk before and he promised me to be honest, but again hes lying to me. how can i even trust him? i really dont want to leave him

**Job:** ER Nurse (walk between 7000-14000 steps, 3 days a week)

**Days off:** I will do a 3-4 mile walk, 3-4 days out of the week (Burn 400-500 calories per walk)

**Diet:** 5 out of 7 days

**-Calories:** 1400-1700

**-Protein**:120 grams

**-Carbs**: 150-200 grams/day

**-Fat**: 50-60 grams

\-**Alcohol:** 1-2 seltzers 3-4 days out of the week.

\-**Binge Eating:** 1-2 days out of the week. Usually after a work day, because my job is extremely mentally and physically taxing. It doesn't make it right, but this is where I'm at. It can be anywhere from 3000-4000 calories/day.

These are the simple facts of life. I know the binge eating is my biggest problem. It's always been an issue, and most days, weeks, I'm eating a normal, non-binge diet. My BMI is 31-32 currently, and I was already denied a wegovy prescription by my health insurance. So, that's out for me. Now I know that I have to rely solely on my own diet and weight loss. I thought it could have been my thyroid or cortisol levels, but all of my blood work looks fine.

I'm at a loss for how to get the rest of this weight off of myself. I'm being very honest and vulnerable saying all of this, but I don't know how else to lose weight without going into extreme calorie deficit. The binge eating comes from me not being able to eat during my work day. Like, I'd say I get one lunch break out of my 3 work days because we're always so busy at work, and then when I get home, I'm completely ravenous.

The only thing that seems to work lately is low carb (100g-120g per day), High protein (120g), and keeping my calorie intake 1400-1600 on my days off, trying to burn 700+ calories during exercise, and using coffee to suppress my appetite. I'm trying really hard with work to avoid post-work binges, but it's easier said than done. It's the ""food noise"" thing people talk about.",1,1745339636.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

# Expansion Plans Position ADM Endeavors for Revenue Surge in 2025

  
Expansion Plans Position ADM Endeavors for Revenue Surge in 2025

ADM Endeavors is strategically positioned for significant revenue growth in 2025 through facility expansion and market opportunity capture. Key developments include:

**1. New 100,000 sq. ft. Facility**  
The $13 million facility (expanded from 80,000 sq. ft.) enhances production capacity, operational efficiency, and product diversification. Expected to be operational by Q1 2025, it consolidates manufacturing, fulfillment, and retail operations, enabling up to **5x revenue capacity growth**[2](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-industry-110000935.html)[4](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ADMQ/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-and-industry-a5oumw3rija9.html).

**2. Market Share Expansion**  
With competitor Dennis Uniforms exiting the market, ADM targets **50 schools in Dallas-Fort Worth** needing new uniform suppliers. The company is actively negotiating contracts with former Dennis clients and has strengthened its sales team, including adding industry veteran Ashley Hester[4](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ADMQ/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-and-industry-a5oumw3rija9.html).

**3. Projected Revenue Growth**  
ADM aims to **double or triple school uniform revenue by 2025** from its 2023 baseline of $1.4 million. This growth is driven by expanded capacity, new customer acquisition, and contract renewals with public-sector entities like schools and government agencies[2](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-industry-110000935.html)[4](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ADMQ/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-and-industry-a5oumw3rija9.html).

**4. Asset Value Appreciation**  
The facility’s appraised value ($13 million) and adjacent land ($3.7 million) have significantly increased since 2021, bolstering shareholder equity and financial stability[4](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ADMQ/adm-endeavors-provides-corporate-and-industry-a5oumw3rija9.html).

These initiatives, combined with a focus on organic growth and strategic partnerships, position ADM Endeavors for a substantial revenue surge in 2025.

ADM Endeavors Reports Fiscal 2024 Financial ResultsPress Release | 04/01/2025

***Full Year Revenues Increased 11% to $5.7 million***

***Net Income Increased 136% to $324 thousand***

***New Facility in Final Stages of Construction Appraised at $13 million***

Fort Worth, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - April 1, 2025) - Just Right Products Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of ADM Endeavors (OTCQB: ADMQ) (""ADM"" or the ""Company""), announces its financial results for the 12-months ended December 31, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars.

The Company's Annual Report (Form 10-K) can be found on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR), which can be accessed at [www.sec.gov](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/arWjjtw5Wv).

**Financial Highlights for the year ending December 31, 2024**

* Total Revenue of $5,760,459, an 11% increase over $5,188,930 in 2023
* School Uniform Sales of $1,555,366, compared with $1,402,784 in 2023
* Promotional Sales of $4,205,093, compared with $3,786,146 in 2023
* Gross Margin of 35%, an increase over 29% in 2023
* Net Income of $324,311, a 136% increase over $137,468
* At December 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $412,449 and accounts receivable of $366,689

""Our year-end performance reflects the success of our strategic pivot toward the government sector, which was the primary driver of our revenue growth. Gross margins also expanded by 600 basis points to 35%, highlighting the strength of our business model,"" said ADM Endeavors CEO Marc Johnson. ""With demand continuing to grow, our focus remains on increasing operational capacity. Construction of our new 100,000+ sq. ft. facility is nearly complete, and we expect it to open this summer, adding up to five times our current production capacity. This expansion will allow us to better serve existing customers while also capturing new business, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where a major competitor's exit has created additional opportunities.""

""An appraisal in October 2024 valued our new facility at $13 million, with an additional $3.7 million for the adjacent land, which is substantially higher than its carrying value. Yet, this asset value remains unrecognized in our market valuation,"" Mr. Johnson continued. ""Our dual strategy of organic growth and strategic acquisitions has positioned ADM to drive continued top-line growth while improving operational efficiencies. As we move into 2025, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate expansion, strengthen our market leadership in promotional products and school uniforms, and unlock long-term value for our shareholders.""

(Intro) (single strummed calm)
do you know how hard it is to be aware in this world
sometimes i stare at the celling and wish that i
was born as a bike or something 
but since there's nothing i can do
ill sit and ill wait
wait till the coffee gets cold
or for some good to come my way 

(Verse 1)
it's like im sitting in a ballroom in an earthquake 
as the walls come tumbling down.
the rooms filling up with water and im drowning 
but im tied to the staircase helpless and in pain 

(Pre chrous)
D Em
when you're just a girl,  but you're hyper aware
G A
it feels like everybody else is being so purposefully ignorant
as your future changes, right before your eyes
its as if we are somehow devolving through the time
Em G
its like we're going back to the 1900s
D A Em G A
it seeems like carelessness is in abundance !!!

(Chorus)
Em G
So do something, do something 
Break the silence - light the fire
Say something, feel something 
call them out and take it higher
the weeiight of the world, can't, crush, us all
but at the rate things are going, we won't see 2030

(D A EM G, D A)

Em G
okay bare with me now

(Verse 2) single strummed
D A
imagine if we were all born as bikes
Em G
no more worrrrying issues or sleepless nights
your future couldn't be tainted by, old men in suits
free to roll away from chaos, and all disputes 

(Bridge)
I see the cracks, form in the streets
Ill watch the world come crumbling down
Echos of what could've been sound through the chaos
History we built on for years
Collapses! to the ground
and we'll say, oh! well you shouldve 


(Chorus)
Em G
DONE SOMETHING. JUST DO SOMETHING 
Break the silence light the fire
Do something do something
call them out and break the wire
the weight of the world can't crush us all
cause at the rate we're going we won't see 2030



(Outro) (single strummed calm)
i wonder if we're too far gone
maybe the weight of the world has finally frushed us all
is society too deeply infected for what us to say to  make a difference 
if i was a bike id ride away
no systems no suits, just endless days
and leave before the coffee gets cold 

(end on A to tie back to intro)

After surgery I would notice in the mornings that after breakfast I would need to run to the bathroom. I thought it was my morning coffee, as it never happened throughout the day just in the mornings. Over this past winter (nearly four years post op) things took a turn.  I had pain in my right side, severe nausea which then caused all sorts of other symptoms by setting off my anxiety. I wasn't sleeping through the night waking up in a panic. I was subsisting off of apple slices and oatmeal. 

I introduced Metamucil into my diet which seemed to help, I went to a GI and they suggested I may have BAM and to keep on the Metamucil. Well it stopped helping after a few weeks and I got a prescription for these horse pills from heaven known as Colestipol. For the most part I now have no urgency and the consistency is much better too. I must've had BAM all this time. I'm prescribed one pill twice a day but sometimes I forget the morning one.

1k5ag93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1k5ag93/the_rules_of_cafe_lugubre/,The Rules of Cafe Lugubre,"The night was gloomy and the rain was beating heavily against the windows of the deserted street. I was walking along the muddy sidewalks, with the hood of my jacket pulled up over my head to protect me from the biting wind. I didn't know exactly where I was going, but tiredness and the cold forced me to continue. The city seemed to have disappeared around there, shrouded in a thick, constant fog.

Suddenly, a neon sign flashed through the gloom, and I saw it. ""Cafe Lúgubre"". The letters, worn and faded, flickered as if they were trying to draw me in, like a beacon in the darkness. The name of the place sounded like a veiled invitation, something deeply mysterious and, at the same time, unsettling.

At first, I hesitated. The wind was rising and the streets were empty, as if the entire world had retired to rest. But as the rain increased, the need for something warm and cozy spoke louder. I needed a shelter. The glass entrance door was slightly open, allowing the comforting aroma of fresh coffee to escape from within, mixed with the sweet smell of aged wood. As if an invisible hand had called me, I entered.

The door creaked softly, but the sound seemed to echo more than expected. The inside of the cafe was even stranger than the outside. The environment was lifeless, but at the same time, it seemed to carry a deep, invisible energy. The lights were low, casting long shadows on the dark wooden walls, which made it feel like the place was stuck in time. A shelf of aged books stretched along one wall, their yellowed and worn spines indicating that they had been read many times. The wooden floor creaked softly with each step, as if trying to remember something far away.

I looked around. There was no one. But from the back of the counter, a figure slowly emerged, with a discreet smile and eyes that seemed to hide more than they could reveal. He was the attendant — or, perhaps, the only occupant of that place. His gaze assessed me for a moment, and then he approached with a calm, almost predetermined movement.

""Welcome to the Lurid Café. Calm down. Come in, sit down. I'll prepare something special for you,"" he said in a low, gentle voice, as if his words were destined to be lost in the air.

I hesitated, but my body seemed to move on its own, heading to one of the tables in the corner of the room. The attendant walked away silently, heading to the back of the counter, where an antique coffee maker was waiting. For a moment, I was alone, observing the contours of the room and trying to adjust to the dense atmosphere that enveloped the room.

It was then that the attendant came back and placed a small piece of paper on the table, folded to perfection. He didn't say a word, just made a gentle gesture with his hand, indicating that I should open it and read it.

Confused, I took the paper and unfolded it. The words were written in careful, flowing handwriting, as if someone with a lot of time and patience had dedicated themselves to writing them. At the top of the page were the words ""Dismal Café Rules.""

I looked at the attendant, who was just watching me with his enigmatic smile. Without understanding it very well, I started reading.

1. ""No one should drink more than one cup.""

The first rule seemed simple, almost banal. But there was something about her that made me hesitate. Coffee seemed to be a promise, something comforting, a break from the world outside. I was tired, exhausted even, but the words of the rule lingered in my mind. Not ""more than one"". This sounded like something more than a simple ban. As if the act of consuming more than one cup was something that altered the course of the place itself, as if it were a silent but dangerous violation.

The attendant watched me closely as I drank the first cup. The taste was divine, deep and bitter, but with a hint of sweetness that filled all the senses. I didn't know what made the coffee there so special, but a feeling of pure pleasure began to spread through my body. I looked at him again. He was waiting. But I didn't dare ask anything.

2. ""Don't look at the clock while you're here.""

It was strange, but around me, the only thing that seemed to be moving was the sound of coffee being poured and the ticking of an antique clock on the wall, just behind the counter. When I read the second rule, my instinct was to look at the clock — something that would never occur to me anywhere else. But inexplicably, my hand faltered, as if an invisible force had prevented me from turning my head. I focused on what was in front of me, the empty cup, the silent surroundings, the feeling that something was about to happen.

The attendant didn't seem to care about the time. The room was in no rush. The clock, in the background, continued to mark the passage of time in an almost arrogant way, as if mocking my doubts about the rules.

3. ""Be silent while you're inside.""

The third rule gave me pause. I was used to talking, talking, filling the silence with words. But as I looked around, a strange feeling that any word spoken there would be a violation of space came over me. The atmosphere seemed to deepen with every second I spent in silence. The sound of coffee being stirred, the subtle sound of footsteps on wooden boards, everything was amplified by the stillness. My every movement seemed to make the place come to life, or at least, become more present.

I couldn't form words anymore. It was as if the silence had become natural, more comfortable than any sentence I could utter.

4. ""Never leave your cup empty.""

I looked at my cup. It was empty now. The attendant, who had been watching silently, approached and, without a word, filled it again. The coffee was always perfect, as if the drink was endless. But the rule was clear: never leave the cup empty. Something inside me said that the absence of coffee, the lack of contact with what was served there, would be like a violation of the very essence of the place.

With each sip, with each feeling of warmth that took over me, I felt more and more immersed in that environment. Time seemed to slow down, the world outside seemed to no longer exist. All I needed was the coffee, that feeling of being away from the real world.

5. ""Only get up when the last customer leaves.""

It was the last rule, and a strange feeling came over me. The cafe was empty besides me and the server, but a part of me knew there were more there, more people. Although the place seemed deserted, a sense that others were there, invisible to my eyes, made me feel like I was in silent vigil. Get up before everyone else? Impossible. The rule was clear, and somehow, it had an irresistible force.

Hours passed without me noticing. I looked around, but the shadows seemed longer now. The soft light seemed dimmer, and the coffee was slowly starting to cool. The atmosphere was enveloped in an aura of eerie calm, something I had never experienced before.

It was then that the door behind the counter opened. I saw, for a moment, a figure. She was tall, wrapped in a dark cloak. He didn't say anything, but his presence was heavier than anything I had ever felt. She approached and, in one slow movement, took the empty cup from my hands.

""You've been following the rules,"" the attendant said, his voice now deeper, as if there was something more behind it. ""Are you ready to understand.""

But before I could ask what he meant, the door opened, and the figure disappeared into the mist of the street. The attendant gave a silent wave, and when I looked at the clock again, I saw that time had stretched out. I didn't know how much time had passed, but what was real now seemed more a matter of perception.

“Come back when you need to,” said the attendant. ""But remember: here, time does not exist for those who know the rules.""

I left Café Lúgubre, feeling the gentle rain on my face. But the world outside was different. The streets, the lights, the people — everything seemed to be a reflection of what had happened inside the café. I didn't know if the cafe was a refuge or a trap, but what I did know was that, somehow, it would call me back.",1,1745338841.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

1k5afqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1k5afqw/idea_for_a_light_hearted_fun_silver_age_inspired/,"Idea for a light hearted fun Silver age inspired Batman, Wonder Woman Superman Team up.","Here me out on this, 

My idea for a story takes inspiration from the Silver Age and reimagines it with today's storytelling styles. The story features a classic team-up of Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman. 

It begins with The Daily Planet venturing into online news, such as YouTube, Reddit, Bluesky, etc etc ad nauseam. Wayne Tech is investing in this initiative, which brings Bruce Wayne to Metropolis for the major rollout. While he is spending time with Clark Kent, Wonder Woman arrives and explains that she needs Batman and Superman's help to deal with Cersei, who is at a loss for what to do. In response, Bruce and Clark get away and quickly change into their superhero identities: Batman and Superman.

Wonder Woman explains that Cersei plans to turn the world into a Dionysian utopia, also transforming Superman into a leader reminiscent of Dionysus. Unknown to the superheroes, Cersei has infiltrated The Daily Planet and spiked a cup of coffee that she believes to belong to Clark Kent with a potion intended to induce the transformation. However, the coffee actually belongs to Jimmy Olsen. As a result, poor Jimmy slowly transforms into a 2025 version of a Dionysus-like figure, consumed by wine, festivity, and ecstasy. This transformation makes him a sex symbol, irresistible to most humans. Superman takes Lois Lane and Selena Kyle to the Fortress of Solitude for protection. Returning to Metropolis.

The B-storyline explores what happens when a top-notch reporter and a high-level reformed cat burglar are left alone to roam freely around the Fortress of Solitude without supervision.

In Metropolis, Wonder Woman is confronting Cersei, Superman is trying to keep Jimmy Olsen at a distance without harming him, and Batman is working on a cure for Olsen.

In the story's resolution, Wonder Woman uses her lasso to capture Cersei and discovers how to reverse the spell. Meanwhile, Batman gathers the ingredients needed to create the potion. The potion is administered to Jimmy, and just before it takes effect, Wonder Woman is seduced by Jimmy, resulting in a phenomenal erotic kiss. Batman and Superman pretend that this incident never happened.

  After Superman has retrieved Lois and Selena from the Fortress of Solitude. The heroes are getting ready to part ways, Wonder Woman makes a comment about what the women of Metropolis are missing out on by not dating Jimmy Olsen. Leveing Batman and Superman in shock.

 ☕ Encourage reusable coffee cups & water bottles

 💻 Offer hybrid or remote work options to reduce commuting emissions

 🧘‍♀️ Organize wellness walks or green team activities

She goes on this small rant while they're in the coffee shop about how all they do is talk about men and they're all successful, intelligent women with thoughts and wants and ideals of their own outside of men.

I realize that this focus is because it's the basis of the entire show, but just damn, Miranda really calling them all out. I kind of hate how it got brushed off and completely disregarded in the same episode. She was right but it got written off in favor of ""I was hurt and just forgot I was hurt"" or something.",18,1745338582.0,sexandthecity,9,0.95,False
