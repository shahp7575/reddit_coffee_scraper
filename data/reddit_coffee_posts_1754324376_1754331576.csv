Something about really old headstones is fascinating! Recently, when I visited my great grandmother’s grave, I removed some grass; that’s when I discovered that cleaning graves is my calling. So, I need tips for grave cleaning, like how to gain permission to clean graves. I‘ve keep been reading about how some people insist on using d/2, but it is hard to get and too rich for my blood, and I have seen a far more affordable option on Amazon that has good reviews. So, why not that? Is d/2 like the Starbucks coffee of designer clothes of grave cleaning solutions? Overpriced and people talk about how much better it is, when there are solutions that are just as good, but way less expensive? Sorry if that analogy came off as rude or insensitive. I really like old graves, and I really feel a strong pull to clean graves.",1,1754331474.0,CemeteryPreservation,0,1.0,False

1mhl7fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mhl7fi/explore_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best French Press Coffee Maker Stanley Review Worth It,"**A hands-on review of Stanley 10-0288800 French Press**  

Being a coffee enthusiast who thrives on freshly brewed cups to kickstart my mornings, testing out the Stanley 10-0288800 French Press felt like a treat. Whether it’s for rugged outdoor adventures or cozy mornings at home, this coffee maker seems built with versatility in mind.

**Design and Durability**  

The robust design immediately catches your eye. Its sturdy stainless steel construction boasts serious durability, making you wonder if this was built to survive an apocalypse. The Hammertone Green exterior lends a vintage charm, which interestingly fits just as well in a sleek urban kitchen as it does on a rocky camping trail. Another standout detail is the double vacuum insulation. Not just a fancy buzzword, it genuinely keeps your coffee piping hot for up to four hours—or so the brand claims, and my experience proved it fairly accurate during a particularly cold evening by the campfire. Dropping this French press during one of my clumsier moments only confirmed its resilience; no dents, cracks, or damage to report.

**Ease of Use**  

For anyone intimidated by the ""French Press ritual,"" don’t be. This gadget simplifies things. Add in your preferred coffee grounds, pour in some boiling water, wait five minutes, and press the plunger. Done. The reusable mesh filter is fine enough to keep grounds from sneaking into your cup, a common annoyance I’ve faced with other French presses. It doesn’t require any special expertise, which is a huge plus for beginners.  

[Check Stanley 10-0288800 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b07l6lqhb4/)  

**Advantages**  

One of its strongest selling points is its effectiveness in maintaining temperatures. Hot or cold, your beverage stays just how you like it.  

- Double vacuum insulation ensures contents stay hot for 4 hours or cold for 9 hours.  
- Reusable mesh filter prevents waste and extra expense on paper filters.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make cleanup a no-brainer.  

**Disadvantages**  

As impressed as I am with this French press, it’s not without its hiccups.  

- It’s heavy compared to standard French presses, which might be inconvenient for ultralight backpacking.  
- The plunger mechanism, while sturdy, could use a bit more refinement. It sometimes requires extra effort to press down fully.  
- It takes up more counter space than compact alternatives, which may bother those with tight kitchens.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  

What’s the point of buying a French press if the coffee isn’t up to snuff? My ritual test centers around coarse-ground coffee beans, freshly roasted. With this device, the results were spectacularly consistent. No stray grounds floating in my cup and coffee that tasted rich and full-bodied every single time. What impressed me most was trying this outside during a family camping trip—it stood up to chilly wind, and every pour remained steaming. I even left it for nearly three hours, and it was still warm when everyone wanted an encore cup! The 48-ounce size is generous too, perfect for sharing.

**Competing Products**  

Compared to something like the Bodum Chambord or the Kona French Press, this one stands out for its durability and insulation. The Bodum feels daintier, which works for indoor settings but wouldn’t last long in outdoor elements. On the flip side, Kona might be slightly easier to use due to its lightweight build. Where the Stanley wins them all over, however, is in heat retention. The typical French press loses heat long before you’re ready for your second cup; this one is the opposite, accommodating leisurely coffee drinkers.

**Cost Efficiency**  

Considering its materials, durability, and unique thermal properties, the product does justify its price tag. Sure, you could grab a more affordable French press, but this is an investment, especially for active coffee drinkers or campers. For anyone fed up with replacing flimsy coffee makers or constantly reheating drinks, this promises long-term savings and convenience.

1mhl6os,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1mhl6os/elevator_e8/,Elevator E8,"Michael realized he hadn’t been reading at all. He’d been staring at the same page for twenty minutes when a fly landed dead-center on the binder, wings twitching above a diagram.

The wiring diagram for the upper freight panel was smudged with coffee stains and its edges were curled.

He blinked; his eyes were dry.

The buzz of the refrigerator and the hum of the overhead fluorescents filled the room. White light, sterile, typical. He scratched his jaw, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes.

The radio clicked to life with a rasp, pulling Michael back from his slumber.

“Michael, are you there? Come in, Michael. Miiiiiichaellll, wake up!”

“What’s up, Syd?”

“Were you sleeping again? I swear to God, one day they’ll catch you.”

“Just a friendly call, then?”

“Check the electrical. We’ve got flickers up here. Screens jumping. Received a few calls from residents who’d like to get through their schlocky evening shows.”

Michael sighed and stood. His knees cracked as he trudged to the building systems terminal and tapped the screen. It flickered once, then lit up a grid of subsystems glowing in monochrome green.

“Let’s see which one of you decided to act up tonight.”

>

He frowned. There was no Elevator 8. Michael refreshed the screen. Same result.

\---

The service corridor sloped downward, past crawling paces and hissing pipes. This wasn’t the tenant side. No drop ceilings. No floor polish. Just concrete and cables.

He passed Elevators 3 and 5, metal doors, numbered valves, and maintenance stairs…. There it was. At the far end of the hallway: an 8^(th) elevator. No signage. No scuffs. Just a frame of brushed steel that didn’t quite reflect but somehow still caught light.

Its call button was already glowing. A band of warm amber slipped through the crack in the doors and radiated across the floor. Oddly inviting.

Michael approached cautiously, crouched down, and opened the access panel beside the frame. Standard wiring. No alarms. No digital lockout. Nothing strange… except it shouldn’t be here… it wasn’t here before.

He stood up, thinking.

***Ding!***

The doors slid open.

Michael flinched, instinctively stepped back.

Inside… not a maintenance cab, not even close. The interior was wood-paneled with a sycamore veneer and polished brass finishing. The citrus scent of lemon oil hung in the air. It wasn’t new but had the modernist class of art deco. Whatever this elevator was, wherever it came from, it wanted to be seen.

Michael stared at it for a moment, snorted, rubbed his eyes, and stepped in. The doors slid shut the moment his feet crossed the threshold. No delay. No ding. Just a clanking sound and a click.

Michael stopped short. He turned slowly toward the panel. ‘*B’* was glowing. With a low hum, a creak, and a jolt, the elevator started descending.

He let out a quiet breath, “Okay,” he muttered. “Guess we’re doing this.”

\---

**Floor B**  
The elevator came to a halt, and the doors opened. On the other side of the doors was only absolute darkness and eerie silence.

Michael lit his flashlight, popped his head out, and swept the beam around, but he still couldn’t make out any walls or pillars.

“Not stepping out in there,” he muttered. His voice reverberated through the room, but not only his voice bounced off the walls… He heard footsteps. First distant, slow taps of leather shoes on concrete, then faster, deliberately closing in from the darkness.

Michael panicked, reached for the panel, slapped the ‘*Close’* button repeatedly, “Come on, close, close, close.” The doors began to inch shut.

Just before they did, a man slid in. Gracefully, but not without effort.

Michael backed up against the far wall of the elevator cabin.

“Whoo. That was close. Thanks for holding the door,” the man said. “Courtesy’s a rare luxury these days.” He wore a smudged maintenance coverall, streaked with grease and soot. His voice was warm and unbothered. The kind of tone you use at a formal gathering when you’re not quite sure of the rules.

The man pressed three buttons with practiced ease, then turned to Michael with a spark in his eye. “You look overdue for a different route.”

Michael didn’t answer. He just watched the numbers tick as the elevator creaked back into motion.

\---

**Floor T**  
The doors opened to a ray of gold. A room bathed in soft amber light, every wall covered in clocks of all sorts and shapes. Mantles. Grandfathers. Digital readouts. Pocket watches mounted under glass. Every single one perfectly synchronized.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

Michael stepped forward. The rhythm was soothing, predictable, almost hypnotic.

“Easy, isn’t it?” the man said behind him. “What a delightful rhythm. You fall into place, and it takes you with the current.”

Michael said nothing. A tea trolley with refreshments next to an Eames Lounge chair caught his eye. It was filled with tiny bottles of sparkling water, Scotch, Delirium beer, and Sancerre wine.

Michael reached for the brandy. It wouldn’t open. Only the water bottle released from the tray.

“Funny, that,” the man quipped.

Michael took a swig. Not refreshment but an uncanny feeling filled his stomach. Something was out of place… There was one tick, off-beat.

He searched for it next to the midcentury grandfather clock, behind the display of Patek Philippe watches, and found it on the chimney mantel.

A wadokei\*, wedged between two larger pieces, ticking on its own rhythm. Michael recognized the symbols Ushi, Inu, and Tora.

When the dial passed Tora, a cuckoo burst out in a screech so absurd and loud, Michael stumbled back.

He crashed into a mirror. In it, he saw himself. Same uniform. But older. Paler. Smaller. Ashy.

Michael turned. The elevator was still open. He ran in without hesitation.

The man smirked. “Props on you, Michael, some people never hear it.” He wound his pocket clock, “Golly, we have to hurry for your 3:30 AM appointment.”

The cabin lurched back into motion.

\---

**Floor D**

Michael was still panting and sweating as the door opened again. This wasn’t a room but a plain of lush grass under a pale blue sky.

The man exited, but Michael stayed in the cabin. Only now he realized the man’s uniform had changed. A pressed red uniform of an Italian Piccolo. Hair tight, and an inviting smile.

“I promise the doors will stay open,” He said, “Step through when you are ready. The appointment is informal, but it can’t be rescheduled.”

Michael hesitated until he saw the paper planes. Hundreds of folded pieces of paper floating in the air, moving slowly toward the sun.

One brushed Michael’s cheek as he stepped out. The plane was folded neatly, weightless. On the wing it read: *Go to Tokyo. Just go.*

Michael stared at it. He recognized it. “She was already there,” he said, more to himself. “Had an apartment, sent me the forms, lined up an interview for me. She even found a Japanese language course…” He paused, “She had everything prepared… I said maybe.” He looked up. “It meant no. I just didn’t say it out loud.”

The man caught another plane. “Take the robotics course,” he read aloud. “Practical. Inspiring.”

Michael laughed once, bitterly. “I had the application filled out. Got this job instead, it’s more steady, you never know where the market goes. It was safe, smart.”

“Some of these,” Michael didn’t finish his sentence.

“Take one,” the man said.

Michael didn’t respond. The planes drifted overhead, like birds migrating south.

***Ding!***

The man walked back to the elevator, “Your 5 AM is waiting, mustn’t be late.”

\---

**Floor E**  
The final floor opened to a rooftop. Not one Michael recognized. The air was scented faintly with ozone, like after a thunderstorm. City lights shimmered across the river. A soft wind tugged at his collar.

Michael tucked his hair behind his ears and looked straight up. “Why are you showi… he lost the thought, distracted by the sky. One constellation pulsed like a microchip, another was shaped like a guitar. Another was…

“So?” the man interrupted. “Shall we proceed up or down?”

Michael looked at him, “What doe…”

The man finished his sentence, “…does this mean, what should I do, what is happening, am I dead?” He paused, “What if I make the wrong choice?”

The man looked Michael sternly in the eyes. “Does it matter? Up or Down? New or Old? Adventure or back to every day the same?”

Michael looked him in the eyes. He stepped into the elevator, took a long breath, and pushed a button.

\---

**Down is Up, Up is Down**  
The elevator shuddered. Light danced across the brass handles. The walls turned transparent, and stars were everywhere.

The elevator picked up speed. The stars smeared sideways. Purple. Green. White. Like someone dragging a brush across the dark. Now the floor and ceiling became transparent. Michael and the man floated through space in a transparent elevator cab.

Michael gripped the rail.

“Adventure, few make that choice,” the man said softly, “but it is never without risk…”

The speed became unbearable. The brass handles ripped free. The cab dissolved around them, no walls, no floor, just starlight and velocity until only blackness remained.

**Morning**  
Michael opened his eyes. Same chair, same diagram, familiar hum. He rubbed his eyes, blinked. In front of him, a laptop and an open webpage: *Intro to Robotics. Enroll Now.*

He took a second, clicked Submit, and got up.

He didn’t rush, just packed his bag, dropped the old binder in a recycling bin, and took the lobby elevator up to the employee exit. Michael didn’t smile, but he stepped out on the sidewalk.

The sound of the morning commute, traffic, honking cabs, supply trucks, and the smell of breakfast carts were familiar. Michael wasn’t different. Not reborn. But his life was finally moving again.

1mhl6il,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mhl6il/time_looped_chapter_162/,Time Looped (Chapter 162),"“Merchant!” Will shouted as he performed a horizontal slice.

The weapon he used was especially effective against mirror copies, yet even it had trouble dealing with the amount. It also turned out that while copycat allowed him to copy class skills, the same couldn’t be said for the ability to create infinite mirror copies. Even in the mirror realm, Will remained limited by the number of mirror shards he had with him.

The multi-colored merchant emerged amidst the sea of thieves, shattering dozens of them in the process. A few of them tried to fight back, but quickly found that the entity was effectively indestructible.

“I want a boost!” Will tossed the class token towards the merchant.

Knowing what that would result in, Alex’s copies tried to grab the item, but each and every attempt was met with instant destruction. Another thing the merchant didn’t appreciate was anyone getting between him and his deal.

“Archer,” Will said right before the item found its way into the merchant’s hand.

 

**LONG RANGE TARGETING**

**Hit a target at a massive distance.**

 

**PROJECTILE WEAPONS**

**Gain proficiency with non-explosive projectile weapons.**

 

**ARCHER’s ARROW**

**Materialize a single arrow per shot.**

 

Messages appeared throughout the mirror realm.

*Endless ammunition?* Will wondered.

No wonder the archer was so powerful. Not only did it become severely overpowered at later levels, but it also got an unfair start. When it came to attack, none of the other classes Will had obtained came close. One could argue that the clairvoyant was more powerful in other ways, but even that wouldn’t withstand the pain of constant death.

 

**UPGRADE**

**Binding whip-blade transformed into short bow.**

**Damage capacity reduced to 10**

**Binding lost.**

 

The weapon changed in Will’s hands. Then, he performed his first true long-ranged attack. His hands moved quickly and precisely as if he’d been using the weapon for years.

A single arrow materialized in his fingers.

The rogue pulled the bowstring, aiming at the source of the mirror copies, then released the projectile. With a whizzing sound the arrow split the air, shattering through dozens of mirror copies as if they were nothing.

Quickly, Will pulled the bowstring again. Another arrow appeared.

*This really is unfair*, he thought as he let off another shot.

In terms of destructive power, the bow was definitely a lot more destructive than the whip-blade. The only shortcoming was that it wasn’t a defense weapon. Although a large number of mirror copies had clustered around Alex to keep him safe, the rest remained on the attack. One good stab and Will’s loop would be over. Thankfully, he had his own guardian as well.

Leaping up from one of the shadows, the shadow wolf emerged, shattering a mirror copy in the process. The presence of the black wolf instantly caused Alex to freeze. The creation of mirror copies instantly ceased, creating an empty ring in his immediate vicinity. Obviously, he still remembered his recent encounter in the school corridor.

“I saved you from the wolves,” Will shouted. “You remember what that was like.”

“Nah. I have no idea, bro.”

Nothing in his behavior suggested that he was lying or even cared. The change of air currents coming from his nose, however, betrayed him. From Will’s perspective, the goofball might as well have confessed.

“I just want to talk,” the rogue pushed on, holding an arrow at the ready.

The suggestion had an effect. All the mirror copies spontaneously stopped in place. Now that they were still, they seemed even more than Will had thought they were. All of them were seemingly calm. Some held knives at the ready; others didn’t. Yet, the boy didn’t doubt for a single moment that they could charge at him at the drop of a hat.

“The nightmares you had. Do you remember what was in them?”

“Lots of things, bro.”

“Apart from the wolves, you remember Danny, don’t you?”

The silence suggested that Alex did.

“Ely too?”

The original Alex narrowed his eyes just a fraction.

“What about—”

“I remember you, too, bro. You were with the wolves.” He glanced at the Will’s shadow wolf. “Just like that one. They were fighting.”

“I was protecting you from the other wolf.”

The explanation sounded so bad that Will regretted ever saying anything.

“The important thing is—”

“Nah, bro,” Alex cut him off. “Danny warned me about you.”

Cold chills ran down Will’s spine. He was certain he had heard the full conversation between Alex and Danny. At most, a few seconds were missing. Although, it was also possible that more was said before that.

“You’re with them, aren’t you?”

“Who’s them?” Will didn’t like the way the conversation was going.

Did another power exist—an alliance that he had completely missed? Everyone he had spoken to in the future was adamant that the archer was the greatest threat. There was talk of other allied groups, but nothing indicated they were as dangerous. Spencer, the acrobat, even the lancer agreed on that.

“The creatures of eternity, bro,” the goofball continued. “You’re one of them. You look human, but you aren’t. You don’t even exist! You’re just a fake reflection that isn’t part of the world.”

A lump formed in Will’s throat. For a moment, he was concerned about being on the verge of something. Sadly, all that he witnessed was the actual result of Alex’s true mental state. Whatever Danny had done to him, it had ripped out most of the knowledge he had in the past. Pieces were left, but they were mere fragments of what was, that his mind tried to glue together.

“Did you come to stop me, bro?” Alex asked.

“I came to stop Danny. He—”

“He did a lot of things, I know. The good’s more than the bad, bro. You…” the goofball shook his head. “I’ve no idea what you really want. You don’t fight to kill, but you’re not safe either. Do you really know what you’re doing?”

For some reason, the question struck a nerve.

“Big oof, bro.” Alex laughed along with several dozen of his mirror copies. “Get that sorted first, then come at me. We’ll continue this.”

*No, we won’t.*

 

**Ending prediction loop.**

 

The hundreds of mirror copies were gone, leaving Will standing alone. Logically, there was no reason for such a trivial encounter to hit him this hard, but it had. Gone was the goofball he knew, replaced by something he couldn’t even describe. It wasn’t hatred, it wasn’t apathy, Alex was just like a wounded creature trying to survive. The worst part was that he felt more confident forming an alliance with Daniel than joining Will.

Will glanced at the rogue mirror. Within moments, Danny would rush in to claim his class, as he did at the start of every loop.

*I always knew it wouldn’t be easy*, Will thought to himself as he stepped to the side. Having to face the person who had set him off on this whole challenge to the past felt off. And the worst part was that if that had happened to Alex, it could also happen to Helen. In fact, if paradox logic was to be believed, it already had.

“Merchant,” Will muttered.

The faithful trader came into existence with a bow.

“Archer.” Will took out his class token and tossed it to the entity.

Messages covered the floor and ceiling just as before.

 

**\[The choice is good.\]**

 

The guide gave its two cents. If it was meant to serve as support, Will didn’t see it. The reason he was forced to claim the archer class was due to Alex officially becoming his enemy… at least until Will managed to kill Danny.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

Will set his mind on other things in the hope that doing challenges with Luke would take his mind off things. Whether it was a delusion or just postponing the problem didn’t particularly matter because it worked.

The very first challenge the two of them set off to complete proved to be beyond the enchanter’s current skills, requiring five redoes until he managed to complete it unharmed. The reward was a marginally useful skill, although for Luke, who had next to no permanents, it seemed like the best thing ever. Will, in turn, only was rewarded a relatively large amount of coins. Eternity was surprisingly strict when it came to granting him skills. Not that it mattered particularly. Thanks to his personal merchant, he had the option to exchange coins for a skill at any point. The only tedious thing was getting enough.

Each challenge the pair completed, brought Will’s mind more at ease. Soon enough he had obtained enough money to extend his time loop for half a week. Buying skills was out of the question. Both the temporary and permanent available weren’t particularly useful right now, and the ones that were, exceeded his price range by a factor of twenty.

Gradually, loops became a routine once more. Every loop, Will would start his prediction, then check the map for suitable open and hidden challenges and go fetch Luke. The enchanter was growing steadily, requiring fewer and fewer repetitions. The relationship changed from that of mentor and mentee to that of senior and junior partner. With a three-level boost, Luke only had to kill one wolf pack before they could set off on the real fights.

Every ten-fifteen loops, an unexpected bonus would emerge. The bonuses of the challenge reward would include a unique option to gain a class token, which eternity saw no need to convert into coins. Thus, Will had permanently boosted his archer to level three.

“This again?” Luke sighed as they sat in the familiar coffee shop.

It was clear that he didn’t enjoy it particularly. His restlessness reminded Will of his first few loops.

“Rest is good,” he replied, taking his chocolate croissant.

“Yeah, but does it have to be here?”

Accustomed to the reality of loops, the enchanter didn’t bother being nice or polite. Being the type of person that spoke his mind, he didn’t give much of a damn what other people thought, especially loopless.

“Okay, we’ll take a walk. Have change?”

Luke shook his head, then handed Will a twenty-dollar bill. The cash made the barista more than understanding. Having worked in the service sector for years, he had seen all sorts of things. In his view, any day that he got paid was a good day. Everything else was merely a difference of opinion.

“You must slack off more,” Will said as the pair walked aimlessly along the street. The new version of the pastry he had taken had a slight orange tang, making it much better than the plain chocolate one he had tried before.

“That’s funny coming from you.”

“You’ll crash if you go too far. Eternity isn’t a nice place for that.”

“Talking from experience?”

“Yeah…” Will preferred not to go into details.

What he really wanted was to tell Luke to treat loopless better. Doing so, though, would open him to philosophical arguments concerning challenges. By now the enchanter had figured out that they were venturing into other realities, acting very much like the chaotic invaders the goblins had been at the end of the tutorial. Good and evil were getting more and more difficult to define when dealing with anything temporary, or permanent for that matter. Killing off a participant merely ended the loop, resulting in time lost. Only a permakill resulted in any consequences, which, ironically, was the very reason Will had rewound so many loops to begin with.

“Listen, Luke. The thing—”

Will had barely begun when he saw a glint in the distance. In a city this size, it could have been caused by a great number of things. Yet, after going on challenges for so long, he knew exactly what it was.

In a fraction of a second, Will drew the bow from his mirror fragment, then shot an arrow in the direction of the glint.

Ten feet away, two arrows crashed into each other. The impact wasn’t precise, so neither of them splintered, but it was enough to veer each of them off course.

Luke threw a handful of coins in front of him, instantly creating a small swarm of scarabs.

“Don’t!” Will shouted even as he had readied another arrow. “It won’t help.”

“Who are we against?” The enchanter looked around, trying to pinpoint the location of their attacker.

“Your sister.”

Will had been avoiding this moment for quite a while. Finally, it had caught up to him.

Maybe none of my situations have to do with IVF meds, but they seem to line up perfectly with timing.

I've had two egg retrievals and two canceled transfers in about 8 months.  I'm a low responder.  

I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not pregnant.

I don't like iced coffee anymore.  It is too bitter.  This has lasted since around the spring.  I don't drink iced coffee in the winter, just the summer.  

I also get styes in my eye that I think I can connect back to estrogen pills.

I've also noticed my hair is falling out a ton more in the shower.  Not an alarming amount, but definitely noticeable.  ",1,1754331355.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

1mhl4tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1mhl4tc/time_looped_chapter_162/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 162,"“Merchant!” Will shouted as he performed a horizontal slice.

The weapon he used was especially effective against mirror copies, yet even it had trouble dealing with the amount. It also turned out that while copycat allowed him to copy class skills, the same couldn’t be said for the ability to create infinite mirror copies. Even in the mirror realm, Will remained limited by the number of mirror shards he had with him.

The multi-colored merchant emerged amidst the sea of thieves, shattering dozens of them in the process. A few of them tried to fight back, but quickly found that the entity was effectively indestructible.

“I want a boost!” Will tossed the class token towards the merchant.

Knowing what that would result in, Alex’s copies tried to grab the item, but each and every attempt was met with instant destruction. Another thing the merchant didn’t appreciate was anyone getting between him and his deal.

“Archer,” Will said right before the item found its way into the merchant’s hand.

 

**LONG RANGE TARGETING**

**Hit a target at a massive distance.**

 

**PROJECTILE WEAPONS**

**Gain proficiency with non-explosive projectile weapons.**

 

**ARCHER’s ARROW**

**Materialize a single arrow per shot.**

 

Messages appeared throughout the mirror realm.

*Endless ammunition?* Will wondered.

No wonder the archer was so powerful. Not only did it become severely overpowered at later levels, but it also got an unfair start. When it came to attack, none of the other classes Will had obtained came close. One could argue that the clairvoyant was more powerful in other ways, but even that wouldn’t withstand the pain of constant death.

 

**UPGRADE**

**Binding whip-blade transformed into short bow.**

**Damage capacity reduced to 10**

**Binding lost.**

 

The weapon changed in Will’s hands. Then, he performed his first true long-ranged attack. His hands moved quickly and precisely as if he’d been using the weapon for years.

A single arrow materialized in his fingers.

The rogue pulled the bowstring, aiming at the source of the mirror copies, then released the projectile. With a whizzing sound the arrow split the air, shattering through dozens of mirror copies as if they were nothing.

Quickly, Will pulled the bowstring again. Another arrow appeared.

*This really is unfair*, he thought as he let off another shot.

In terms of destructive power, the bow was definitely a lot more destructive than the whip-blade. The only shortcoming was that it wasn’t a defense weapon. Although a large number of mirror copies had clustered around Alex to keep him safe, the rest remained on the attack. One good stab and Will’s loop would be over. Thankfully, he had his own guardian as well.

Leaping up from one of the shadows, the shadow wolf emerged, shattering a mirror copy in the process. The presence of the black wolf instantly caused Alex to freeze. The creation of mirror copies instantly ceased, creating an empty ring in his immediate vicinity. Obviously, he still remembered his recent encounter in the school corridor.

“I saved you from the wolves,” Will shouted. “You remember what that was like.”

“Nah. I have no idea, bro.”

Nothing in his behavior suggested that he was lying or even cared. The change of air currents coming from his nose, however, betrayed him. From Will’s perspective, the goofball might as well have confessed.

“I just want to talk,” the rogue pushed on, holding an arrow at the ready.

The suggestion had an effect. All the mirror copies spontaneously stopped in place. Now that they were still, they seemed even more than Will had thought they were. All of them were seemingly calm. Some held knives at the ready; others didn’t. Yet, the boy didn’t doubt for a single moment that they could charge at him at the drop of a hat.

“The nightmares you had. Do you remember what was in them?”

“Lots of things, bro.”

“Apart from the wolves, you remember Danny, don’t you?”

The silence suggested that Alex did.

“Ely too?”

The original Alex narrowed his eyes just a fraction.

“What about—”

“I remember you, too, bro. You were with the wolves.” He glanced at the Will’s shadow wolf. “Just like that one. They were fighting.”

“I was protecting you from the other wolf.”

The explanation sounded so bad that Will regretted ever saying anything.

“The important thing is—”

“Nah, bro,” Alex cut him off. “Danny warned me about you.”

Cold chills ran down Will’s spine. He was certain he had heard the full conversation between Alex and Danny. At most, a few seconds were missing. Although, it was also possible that more was said before that.

“You’re with them, aren’t you?”

“Who’s them?” Will didn’t like the way the conversation was going.

Did another power exist—an alliance that he had completely missed? Everyone he had spoken to in the future was adamant that the archer was the greatest threat. There was talk of other allied groups, but nothing indicated they were as dangerous. Spencer, the acrobat, even the lancer agreed on that.

“The creatures of eternity, bro,” the goofball continued. “You’re one of them. You look human, but you aren’t. You don’t even exist! You’re just a fake reflection that isn’t part of the world.”

A lump formed in Will’s throat. For a moment, he was concerned about being on the verge of something. Sadly, all that he witnessed was the actual result of Alex’s true mental state. Whatever Danny had done to him, it had ripped out most of the knowledge he had in the past. Pieces were left, but they were mere fragments of what was, that his mind tried to glue together.

“Did you come to stop me, bro?” Alex asked.

“I came to stop Danny. He—”

“He did a lot of things, I know. The good’s more than the bad, bro. You…” the goofball shook his head. “I’ve no idea what you really want. You don’t fight to kill, but you’re not safe either. Do you really know what you’re doing?”

For some reason, the question struck a nerve.

“Big oof, bro.” Alex laughed along with several dozen of his mirror copies. “Get that sorted first, then come at me. We’ll continue this.”

*No, we won’t.*

 

**Ending prediction loop.**

 

The hundreds of mirror copies were gone, leaving Will standing alone. Logically, there was no reason for such a trivial encounter to hit him this hard, but it had. Gone was the goofball he knew, replaced by something he couldn’t even describe. It wasn’t hatred, it wasn’t apathy, Alex was just like a wounded creature trying to survive. The worst part was that he felt more confident forming an alliance with Daniel than joining Will.

Will glanced at the rogue mirror. Within moments, Danny would rush in to claim his class, as he did at the start of every loop.

*I always knew it wouldn’t be easy*, Will thought to himself as he stepped to the side. Having to face the person who had set him off on this whole challenge to the past felt off. And the worst part was that if that had happened to Alex, it could also happen to Helen. In fact, if paradox logic was to be believed, it already had.

“Merchant,” Will muttered.

The faithful trader came into existence with a bow.

“Archer.” Will took out his class token and tossed it to the entity.

Messages covered the floor and ceiling just as before.

 

**\[The choice is good.\]**

 

The guide gave its two cents. If it was meant to serve as support, Will didn’t see it. The reason he was forced to claim the archer class was due to Alex officially becoming his enemy… at least until Will managed to kill Danny.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

Will set his mind on other things in the hope that doing challenges with Luke would take his mind off things. Whether it was a delusion or just postponing the problem didn’t particularly matter because it worked.

The very first challenge the two of them set off to complete proved to be beyond the enchanter’s current skills, requiring five redoes until he managed to complete it unharmed. The reward was a marginally useful skill, although for Luke, who had next to no permanents, it seemed like the best thing ever. Will, in turn, only was rewarded a relatively large amount of coins. Eternity was surprisingly strict when it came to granting him skills. Not that it mattered particularly. Thanks to his personal merchant, he had the option to exchange coins for a skill at any point. The only tedious thing was getting enough.

Each challenge the pair completed, brought Will’s mind more at ease. Soon enough he had obtained enough money to extend his time loop for half a week. Buying skills was out of the question. Both the temporary and permanent available weren’t particularly useful right now, and the ones that were, exceeded his price range by a factor of twenty.

Gradually, loops became a routine once more. Every loop, Will would start his prediction, then check the map for suitable open and hidden challenges and go fetch Luke. The enchanter was growing steadily, requiring fewer and fewer repetitions. The relationship changed from that of mentor and mentee to that of senior and junior partner. With a three-level boost, Luke only had to kill one wolf pack before they could set off on the real fights.

Every ten-fifteen loops, an unexpected bonus would emerge. The bonuses of the challenge reward would include a unique option to gain a class token, which eternity saw no need to convert into coins. Thus, Will had permanently boosted his archer to level three.

“This again?” Luke sighed as they sat in the familiar coffee shop.

It was clear that he didn’t enjoy it particularly. His restlessness reminded Will of his first few loops.

“Rest is good,” he replied, taking his chocolate croissant.

“Yeah, but does it have to be here?”

Accustomed to the reality of loops, the enchanter didn’t bother being nice or polite. Being the type of person that spoke his mind, he didn’t give much of a damn what other people thought, especially loopless.

“Okay, we’ll take a walk. Have change?”

Luke shook his head, then handed Will a twenty-dollar bill. The cash made the barista more than understanding. Having worked in the service sector for years, he had seen all sorts of things. In his view, any day that he got paid was a good day. Everything else was merely a difference of opinion.

“You must slack off more,” Will said as the pair walked aimlessly along the street. The new version of the pastry he had taken had a slight orange tang, making it much better than the plain chocolate one he had tried before.

“That’s funny coming from you.”

“You’ll crash if you go too far. Eternity isn’t a nice place for that.”

“Talking from experience?”

“Yeah…” Will preferred not to go into details.

What he really wanted was to tell Luke to treat loopless better. Doing so, though, would open him to philosophical arguments concerning challenges. By now the enchanter had figured out that they were venturing into other realities, acting very much like the chaotic invaders the goblins had been at the end of the tutorial. Good and evil were getting more and more difficult to define when dealing with anything temporary, or permanent for that matter. Killing off a participant merely ended the loop, resulting in time lost. Only a permakill resulted in any consequences, which, ironically, was the very reason Will had rewound so many loops to begin with.

“Listen, Luke. The thing—”

Will had barely begun when he saw a glint in the distance. In a city this size, it could have been caused by a great number of things. Yet, after going on challenges for so long, he knew exactly what it was.

In a fraction of a second, Will drew the bow from his mirror fragment, then shot an arrow in the direction of the glint.

Ten feet away, two arrows crashed into each other. The impact wasn’t precise, so neither of them splintered, but it was enough to veer each of them off course.

Luke threw a handful of coins in front of him, instantly creating a small swarm of scarabs.

“Don’t!” Will shouted even as he had readied another arrow. “It won’t help.”

“Who are we against?” The enchanter looked around, trying to pinpoint the location of their attacker.

“Your sister.”

Will had been avoiding this moment for quite a while. Finally, it had caught up to him.

1mhl4kl,https://i.redd.it/97dwitzin1hf1.jpeg,Facial Flushing With Different Triggers. What does everyone think?,"I am fair skinned and have always naturally had reddish cheeks, especially in hot and cold weather. In the past few years I have found myself having full blown cheek flushing flareups with certain triggers and majority being food related. Majority of the time I eat there will be a subtle flareup, usually not all that bothersome. Alot of the time it will be extremely annoying and i will have a strong sensation in my cheeks (tingly feeling almost as if my cheeks are vibrating). Cheddar cheese is most definitely my #1 trigger at the moment and I now wont eat it unless its already apart of a dish in which someone’s prepared, or if I order nachos at a restaurant for example. I am trying to narrow down triggers and start to get an idea of what potential causes or issue I have causing this. I find having my black coffee (iced/or hot) on an empty stomach in the mornings will sometimes cause the flushing aswell, and if it doesnt, by the time I have a 2nd coffee a few hours after the first, it will most definitely be a flushing flareup. If I shower after work and let the hot water hit my face, i will have the flushing sensation (have since started washing face with cold water to avoid it). Sometimes if im just tired in the afternoon the flushing will come on aswell. Surprisingly I dont find alcohol to trigger it when I drink, or perhaps my cheeks will be red as they usually naturally are but I dont have the sensation that comes with the flareups. A few weeks back I was drinking a pineapple rum drink and I had a full blown flareup which was random and this one had more of a distinct shape on the right side of my cheek, Ive attached a photo for reference. I know there are so many potential causes and diagnosis’s that can come with this all. Im curious what people think the issues are and also what direction I should take with my doctor / dermatologist. ",1,1754331256.0,DermatologyQuestions,0,1.0,False

1mhl306,https://www.reddit.com/r/foundfootage/comments/1mhl306/i_was_always_the_one_who_cared/,"""I Was Always the One Who Cared""","Hey, I'm not really good at writing stuff like this, so sorry if it’s all over the place. But I need to say how things have changed lately. I’ve got this girl, let’s call her ""H."" We're not exactly official, but there’s definitely something between us. From the first moment I saw her, I knew. We were in line at the pharmacy, and she laughed at something the cashier said, and I swear, I fell for her right there.

But lately, she’s been acting a bit off. Not cold, exactly. Just… strange. Like she’s always looking over her shoulder, like someone’s following her. It's not normal. She’s always gripping her bag tightly, walking faster, and she even started taking a different route to work. It used to be that she’d stop at the café every morning for a coffee. Now? She’s cutting through side streets or walking around the park. I thought about talking to her, asking her what’s going on, but I couldn’t find the words.

She used to wear cute soft sweaters and long skirts. But now? She wears hoodies, baggy coats, sometimes even a hat pulled low. Like she’s trying to hide herself. But from what?

At first, I thought maybe something happened at work. Or maybe an ex came back into her life. But it feels like she’s just… scared. She’s shutting down, not trusting the world anymore.

There were moments before, simple moments, but special. Like when she’d stop at the bakery window, stare at the cakes, and smile. I’d smile too. I always remembered the one kind she stared at the longest. She never knew I noticed that.

But now? Now she just walks with her head down, moving fast, past people. No more stopping. No more smiles.

She’s been changing other things, too. I think someone might be messing with her. She started double-locking her door, put up new curtains, even got one of those doorbell cameras. I thought about showing up at her place, knocking, just to check in. But I didn’t want to seem like I was pressuring her.

I just want her to know I care. I really do.

So, that’s why I’m writing this. I don’t know whether to give her space or talk to her. I don’t want to seem like I’m pushing her away, but it’s hard not to feel shut out when the person you care about seems like a complete stranger.

I miss her. I miss the way things were between us.

I brought her flowers tonight. I’m going to surprise her.

I know they say not to show up uninvited, but I think when she sees it’s me, when she sees how much I care, it will make her understand. She’s just confused, scared. But I can fix that.

She’ll be home any minute now.

I’m staying quiet, don’t worry. Writing this on my phone while I wait. It’s a little cramped under the bed, but I don’t mind. I’ve gotten used to it over the last few nights. Being close to her while she sleeps fills me with joy, with a sense of protectiveness.

I hope she’ll see how much I love her.

I hope she doesn’t scream.

# 🔨 Elevate Your Outdoors with Wisconsin’s Trusted Custom Deck Experts

In Southeastern Wisconsin, the seasons bring a mix of beauty and challenge—from sunny summers to icy winters. Homeowners here understand the importance of making the most out of their outdoor spaces, and nothing enhances a backyard quite like a well-crafted custom deck.

That’s where **Skirrow Design Build** comes in. As [**Southeastern Wisconsin's premier deck builder**](https://www.skirrowbuild.com/services/milwaukee-custom-decks/), we don’t just build decks—we create personalized outdoor living spaces that elevate your home, lifestyle, and property value.

# Why a Custom Deck Is One of the Best Home Improvements You Can Make

A deck isn’t just an add-on. It’s an extension of your living space. It’s where you host barbecues, enjoy your morning coffee, or unwind after a long day. And when it’s designed and built with care, it becomes a long-term investment that pays off in both comfort and curb appeal.

Whether you're replacing an aging deck, expanding your backyard functionality, or building for the first time, choosing the right team matters.

# Local Expertise That Makes a Difference

At Skirrow Design Build, we know Southeastern Wisconsin inside and out. We understand the local climate, zoning requirements, and architectural trends that shape the region. This knowledge helps us design decks that not only look great but last for decades.

When we say we’re Southeastern Wisconsin’s premier deck builder, it’s not just a tagline—it’s backed by years of experience, trusted client relationships, and a portfolio of projects that speak for themselves.

# What Sets Us Apart?

# 1. Fully Customized Designs

No two homes—or homeowners—are alike. That’s why we start every project by listening. What’s your vision? Do you need room to entertain a crowd, or are you dreaming of a quiet space for two? Is accessibility a concern? Do you want multi-level functionality?

We tailor your deck to your needs, your home’s architecture, and your personal style.

# 2. High-Quality, Durable Materials

We work with the best materials in the industry—from beautiful, long-lasting composite decking options like Trex and TimberTech, to rich cedar and pressure-treated lumber. Each material is chosen based on performance, aesthetic, and how well it handles Wisconsin’s changing seasons.

Low-maintenance options? We’ve got you covered. Want to add lighting, custom railings, or built-in seating? We’ll design it right in.

# 3. Experienced Craftsmanship

Our team includes skilled carpenters and builders with years of hands-on deck-building experience. That means no cutting corners. From foundation to finish, we ensure every board is secure, level, and built to code.

# 4. Clear Communication

We’re homeowners too. We know how frustrating it is to be left in the dark during a remodeling project. That’s why we’re committed to open communication throughout every step—from design consultation and budgeting to construction and final walk-through.

# [**Mor**](https://www.skirrowbuild.com/services/milwaukee-custom-decks/)e Than Just Decks: It’s Outdoor Living Reimagined

What makes a deck great? It’s not just the wood and nails—it’s the way it enhances your lifestyle. That’s our approach to every project. We consider how your deck will integrate with the rest of your home, how it will be used throughout the year, and how it can increase the functionality of your yard.

Some of our clients want a quiet, elevated retreat. Others want a full outdoor kitchen, space for a hot tub, or even a wraparound design that connects different areas of the property. Whatever your vision, we’ll help bring it to life.

1mhkwgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1mhkwgv/does_the_rug_doctor_mighty_pro_x3_carpet_cleaner/,Does the Rug Doctor Mighty Pro X3 carpet cleaner meet professional cleaning needs? Review,"The Rug Doctor Mighty Pro X3 Commercial Carpet Cleaner (model number 90011) came into my life at a time when my white carpets bore an array of stains, courtesy of my dog’s muddy escapades and spilled red wine from one too many dinner parties. The product promised to not just clean but resurrect carpets with its powerful one-pass system, so naturally, I took it to task. And here’s what I found through weeks of testing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The machine looks industrial, and to some extent, it feels that way because of its robust 47-pound build. Though heavy, its large rear wheels make it surprisingly maneuverable, even up and down stairs. The foldable handle adds a layer of convenience when storing, given its 21""D x 12.5""W x 27.5""H dimensions. The bright red exterior screams ""commercial,"" reminding you this isn’t a flimsy, lightweight home cleaner—it’s built for serious results. It’s not sleek, but it’s not meant to be. The design is functional, sturdy, and clearly focused on performance over aesthetics.

**Performance Powerhouse**  
Using this carpet cleaner was like opening Pandora’s box—but in the best possible way. Its spray-scrub-extract system combines powerful jets that inject cleaning solution deep into carpets with a triple-action vibrating brush. This brush scrubs stubborn dirt and odors from every angle of the carpet’s fibers. My carpets went from smelling like a wet dog to practically fragrance-free. Even more amazing was the suction power. I’ve never seen so much grime and liquid extracted so efficiently, which also contributed to faster drying times. It’s not subtle in its operation—this thing is LOUD—but it’s effective enough to excuse the noise.

[Check Rug Doctor Mighty Pro X3 90011 price on Amazon.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b086trnxgk/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the machine wasn’t difficult, but it did feel like handling a mini tank. Controlling its weight while cleaning required a little effort, but once you get the hang of it, the process becomes smoother thanks to its ergonomic design. The 3.9-gallon recovery tank dramatically reduced the number of refills and emptying cycles, which made cleaning larger spaces less of a hassle. Adjusting the machine for stairs or tight spaces, however, can become tricky unless you purchase the handheld scrubber tool. It doesn’t come included, but having tested it, I’d say it’s worth the investment for corners, furniture, and tighter areas.

**Pluses**  
- Delivers professional-grade cleaning with one pass.  
- Exceptional suction reduces drying time significantly.  
- Huge 3.9-gallon capacity minimizes interruptions.  
- Robust build and industrial-level durability.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Heavyweight design can be challenging for smaller users.  
- Handheld upholstery tool is sold separately, limiting versatility out of the box.  
- Loud during operation.  
- Not ideal for confined or extremely tight spaces.  

**Key Uses and Audience**  
As a pet owner, the inclusion of a 48-ounce bottle of Pet Deep Carpet Cleaner solution was particularly appealing. It performed admirably on muddy paw prints and even an old coffee stain I’d given up on. I could see this cleaner being a game-changer for families, especially those with young kids or pets. Additionally, it has clear utility in small businesses or industrial spaces due to its reliability and capacity, making it ideal for those who need to maintain heavily trafficked areas.

**Product Competitors**  
The Bissell Big Green Professional Carpet Cleaner is perhaps the most direct competitor. While the Bissell is slightly more user-friendly and compact, the Rug Doctor Mighty Pro X3 excels in its sheer power, especially with its scrub-and-suction dynamic. However, the added space-saving features and lightweight build of the Big Green may attract some users. I also considered the Hoover Power Scrub Elite, which is more affordable and lighter but cannot match the deep-cleaning intensity of this machine. The Rug Doctor truly outshines its rivals when it comes to commercial-grade tasks, but it might not fit users seeking a more casual, DIY experience.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Looking at the price-to-performance ratio, this machine justifies its tag for anyone serious about carpet maintenance. While it may be on the higher end for home users, the results reminded me why professional cleaning services charge such hefty fees. This product lets you invest upfront and gain similar results, thus offering considerable long-term savings. Still, for users seeking a budget-friendly option or only need occasional carpet cleaning, it might feel like overkill.

1mhkvts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1mhkvts/really_disappointing_experience_on_california/,Really disappointing experience on California Zephyr,"I’m glad to see so many positive Amtrak experiences in this page because I love the idea of it…but man, has my first overnight trip been a bummer. Here’s the scoop. 

- I booked a family sleeping car for me and my three kids for Denver to Chicago (California Zephyr). The booking agent gave me a really hard time at reservation, saying the sleeping cars are meant for 2 adults and 2 kids (because all families look like that????). Took 90 minutes to sort out. 

- Train has been delayed almost 10 hours. We were supposed to leave at 6pm and boarded at 2 am. 

- No WiFi. 

- No observation car. This is a bummer in and of itself, and it also means our meals are very delayed because all the coach people eat in the dining car before we can go in. 

- It’s just…kind of gross. Not clean. Handprints on the windows, crumbs on the tables, mold in the shower. Dirty water and droopy flowers in the vases they set out (I appreciate the gesture but they just look sad). And it smells bad. Like old cigarette smoke and lavatory. 

On the plus side: I found the bed really comfy and the experience of sleeping on a moving train so soothing. The coffee is decent. And my kids are absolutely loving the experience. 

Don’t know if I would do this again though, especially for such a steep cost ($1600).

And I think it’s trying to tell me something. (Part One),"I’m struggling to find the proper start to this story. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren’t always linear and I can’t help but feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces. 

However, this story has to be written. It has to be read. 

If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it’s fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.



The Red Duck was a dive. 

It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. Occasionally a bumbling tourist or a lost stranger would find their way into the dusty old bar, but it was the regulars who kept the lights on and the taps flowing. The only mixed drinks that were served were the kind with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes. 

It wasn’t the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested we meet at.



It was around seven o’clock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all. The puddle of condensation around the glass grew by the second.

The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of The Red Duck at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes, wearing a rather bored expression. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio. 

When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

“You must be Alvaro,” I said as I offered my hand.

He shook it, “call me Varo,” he replied with a half-smile. 

His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher. 

“You’re Harper?” He asked when I failed to introduce myself. 

“That’s me,” I replied.

“Thanks for meeting with me,” Varo said as he stretched slightly. “I know it’s late, I work odd hours,” he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

  


“It’s no problem.”

Afterall, it *was* my job. It wasn’t so unusual to meet at odd hours with clients.

After a few moments, the bartender took Varo’s order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

After a moment of waiting I said, “if you need someone found, you’re going to have to give me a little bit of information.”

“Right,” he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair. 

He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

Varo finally met my eyes and asked, “you like Phoenix?”

I shrugged. So he was a small-talker. Great.

“It’s better than a lot of places,” I said with a tone of passiveness. I didn’t really have much opinions on Phoenix. It was hot. There were lots of old people. What could I really say?

Varo nodded in response and sipped his drink. I hoped that the whiskey might help him get to the point. 

“What kind of cases do you typically work on?” He asked after a moment of pause.

“Minor things mostly,” I admitted. “Cheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing…sometimes I’ll work on a missing persons case, but that’s rare.” Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen. 

Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, “have you found anyone? Like someone who went missing?”

I nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “A couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man’s wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.”

“How do you find them?”

“Phones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don’t want to be found.”

“Then what do you do?”

“If I have access to their personal computer I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.”

“What if you can’t use their computer?”

“I have my ways,” I said with a forced smile. After years of doing what I did, the idle job-talk was tiring. However, if I wanted Varo’s business, I needed to make him feel comfortable.

Varo didn’t return the smile. Whatever his situation was, he was clearly upset by it. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he continued to tap his fingers against his whiskey glass in a rhythmless tick.

“Most people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to.” I offered. “A vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they’re messy. Usually people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.”

“What if someone was taken?” There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

“It gets more complicated,” I said. “If there’s reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately I’m not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.”

Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

“But, it doesn’t mean that I can’t help.” I paused for a moment. “Instead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?”

He let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. “My sister stopped responding to my calls,” he said so quietly I almost didn’t hear him.

“How long ago?”

“Two days.”

“Could her phone be dead?”

“No, she’s good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.” Varo seemed almost offended that I would ask such a thing.

“What about being out of cell service, she’s not camping or anything, is she?”

The question brought a half-smile to his face. “No, my sister isn’t the outdoor type.”

“Did anything significant happen leading up to her…loss of contact?” I didn’t want to say ‘*disappearance’*. At least not yet.

“She got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night and I haven’t heard from her since.” There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

“Are you asking me to find your sister?”

Varo hesitated before saying, “I am.”

“I’ll need some information from you in order to do what I do,” I said. “Let’s start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.”



I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado–who went simply by Lu. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared. 

“Well be in touch,” I said to Varo as we walked out of The Red Duck together.

“When should I expect to hear from you?”

“Research like this usually only takes a day or two. I should be able to track her phone until she lost coverage and hopefully learn more from there. I’ll call you in less than two days.”

He nodded, still looking as nervous as ever. Typically at this point in a meeting, my clients would begin to calm down. Most people found it comforting to pass their stress to me. It was strange that Varo looked just on edge as ever as he walked towards his car. I couldn’t help but wonder if there was something that he wasn’t telling me.

“And Varo,” I called out before he could slip away into the night. “I know it’s hard but if there’s anything you forgot to tell me, please reach out. Even the smallest things can really help.”

“Alright. I’ll…text you if I think of anything.”



I dug into Lu’s case the moment I got home. At first, it seemed like a pretty straight forward case–the kind of case I had worked on many times before. 

From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

It wasn’t hard to find the towing company. It was the only one in a small town called Judgment, Texas. There were no pictures online nor was there an address listed. However, from the looks of Judgment, it wouldn’t be hard to find the towing company.



I walked into The Red Duck only to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer. The bearded bartender gave me a quick glance before returning to his glass-cleaning.

“Why wouldn’t she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?” Varo asked as I slipped into the booth seat across from him. 

Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. An old country song played out from the record machine. It sounded distorted and more echo-y than usual–but maybe that was just the empty bar.

“I don’t know but the phone hasn’t been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she’s still in Judgment. It’s just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn’t been able to charge her phone.”

Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable than when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and patchy stubble covered his jaw. Clearly, the disappearance of his sister was keeping him up.

“I tried calling the tow company,” I continued. “But the call didn’t go through. The line was busy both times I called.”

“Why the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,” Varo said. “It doesn’t make sense that she would go that way.”

I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. “Maybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends’ houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?”

“No,” he admitted quietly. “But I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.”

I nodded. “I’ll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,” I said.

“Thanks,” Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. “But I think I should just go down there myself.”

“Would you like someone to go with you?” I asked

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn’t friends with Varo and I didn’t know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

Despite this, there was an odd draw to the town of Judgment. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person–a good samaritan–by helping Varo find his sister.

Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

“You’re willing to go all the way to Texas?” His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn’t take back my offer.

“Sure,” I said. “I don’t think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.”

Hearing what I offered, something in Varo’s demeanor shifted and he asked, “I’ll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you’d be willing to take your car.”

“That sounds like a deal. I’ve never been to Texas.” Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

  


Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from a dingy motel on the outskirts of the city. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down. 

I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette. I let him. I had never been a smoker myself but I didn’t mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn’t remember. 

Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Judgment. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.



The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn’t really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I. 

I didn’t know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn’t spoken much. Taking an eight hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend. 

“What do you expect your sister to say when we find her?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. “I don’t expect her to be happy with me.”

“It’s none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?”	

Varo shrugged. “It could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.” he said.

I smirked. “Has she ever done something like this before?”

	“No,” he said. “She has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.”

I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn’t add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person’s perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.



In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He drove back onto the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies. 

The mountains around Tucson couldn’t be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there. 

The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly-painted lines in the road. There was something ethereal about the darkness that enveloped us. Anything or nothing could be out there and we would never see it.

I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn’t long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.



*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement.* 

*I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone–anyone–what was happening to me.*

*I limped along the side of the highway, praying to the god that had abandoned me. I prayed for a car–for a savior. I prayed for the blood to stop spilling from my wounds. I prayed for the pain deep inside of me to stop.*

*A bright flash in the distance made my heart leap. Someone was here. Someone was coming towards me. The car approached quickly, sailing through the dark night like a comet through the desert skies.*

*As it approached me, I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. Worried, it would fly past me, I stepped further into the road.* 

*The car didn’t stop until after it collided with my body.*



I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me. 

“Sorry,” I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

“I’m going to pull off at the next gas station,” he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

“Why? We just left that truck stop.”

“Yeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.”

*Three hours*. It felt as though I hadn’t been asleep for longer than a few minutes.

I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn’t have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small-talk with any other late-night travelers.

Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out. 

“Have you been to Texas before?” I asked. 

“I was born in Texas,” he said without explanation. 

“Really? Why’d you leave?” I said.

He looked surprised by my question. “My family moved,” he said simply. “There’s not much to see where we’re going. Just more desert.” He took a drink from his can.

I nodded, I had assumed as much. “Do you plan on stopping? I don’t mind driving again.”

“I planned to stop in Las Cruces,” he said. “Is that alright?”

“Yeah, that’s perfect. How far are we from there?”

“About an hour.”

“Are you stopping to see your mother?”

“No,” he said quickly. “We’ll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I’ll get us a hotel when we arrive there.”

I didn’t argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu’s strange disappearance near Judgment.

  


Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, “they know you’re comin’. The Primores told them about your return.”

I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

“Ya need to enter your pin,” he said.

“Oh,” I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left. 

Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. Something about the strange, nonsensical words from the clerk made me feel ill. For the first time, I began to question what I was doing. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all. 



I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. ‘Coffee’ was a pretty strong word for something that tasted like it had been filtered through a dirty sock. 

Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep. 

“How’d you become a PI?” 

“I went to college for criminal justice…I’ve always been interested in that kind of stuff,” I said simply. “After school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.” 

I was careful not to elaborate too much. 

He nodded. “Did you study in Arizona?”

“No,” I said. “I actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.”

“Why did you move?”

I hesitated before saying, “I had an…abnormal childhood. I don’t remember much of it…the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix and I guess I’ve been there ever since.”

Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn’t want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

“That sounds like a difficult childhood,” he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

“Yeah,” I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. “If I couldn’t know the truth about what happened to me, then I wanted to at least help others know the truth.”

“So, you really don’t remember your childhood?”

“Not before the age of about fifteen,” I said. “At first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it’s been too long. I don’t think I’ll ever remember who I was…where I was raised.” 

Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago, I often couldn’t bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes. 

It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to *feel*. I said nothing more about my past to Varo that night. And he didn’t ask anything more.



The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn’t much to see. 

For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu’s last known coordinates.

I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn’t have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that’s what I thought it was. 

My stomach churned as sweat began to drip down my back.

“I…I need to pull over,” I said suddenly.

I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond, I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat. 

I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car’s bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

“What’s wrong?” He asked.

“I…” again, I threw up. 

For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

“I’ll drive for a little while,” he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. “Judgment isn’t far. Do you think you’ll be alright until we stop again?”

“Yeah,” I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. “That was weird. I’ve never been sick like that from driving–it must have been the food.”

Gas station food didn’t exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word. 

“Sorry about that,” I said. It was hard not to be embarrassed. 

“Don’t be,” he said. “It could be the elevation. Drink some water.”

The elevation didn’t seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

“If this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn’t have a problem finding your sister,” I said.

“How small did it say it was?”

“That’s what’s weird…it doesn’t look like there’s a town out here at all. I mean it’s not listed on Google Maps.”

“Then how do you know it’s here?”

I gave a small laugh. “Yellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‘Judgment’ from around this area, that’s when I found it listed as a town.”

“That’s strange,” he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. “It must be really small.”

I shrugged. “I guess. Or maybe it’s a bit of a ghost town.”

“It could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn’t be found, they sorta just…faded.”

I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn’t a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

“At the very least,” I began. “It will be a place to start.” 

I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive. It was possible that Varo was right and my sickness was caused by the climb.

The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn’t long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn’t a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth. 

I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory so vivid it felt like it was happening right then and there.



*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it.* 

*On my hands and knees I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. My knees were bloody and bruised but I pushed on. The hole up ahead was barely large enough for me to fit through. Despite this, I stretched through it, shimmying and crawling like an animal in a trap.* 

*At last, I managed to get free. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day. A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground.* 

*I gazed up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*



I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression. Worry creased between his brows as he watched me.

“Are you alright? What the hell happened?” He asked.

“I don’t know,” I said as I breathed heavily. “I had…a memory.” 

I stared ahead at the giant stone monolith that took over the horizon. Deep dread settled in my chest.

“Are you…good?” He raised an eyebrow. 

I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat. *Some investigator I am*, I thought.

“Yeah,” I said. “I…I think I’ve been here before.”

A dark expression crossed Varo’s face. “If you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.”

“No, no,” I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. “The nearest town is over an hour away. We’re so close. I…I think I might just be confused.”

With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

“What is that thing up there?”

“A rock formation,” Varo said with a dismissive shrug. 

Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley. 

While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.

But I was wrong.

**Title: Building a 360° Beauty Routine: Connecting Inner Wellness with Outer Glow.**

Hey everyone,

As we get more into our wellness journeys, many of us realize that ""beauty"" is more than just a great foundation or an effective eye cream. It's a holistic feeling that comes from taking care of our whole selves.

We wanted to share what a ""360-degree"" routine could look like, showing how inner wellness products synergize with the topical products we all know and love.

**A Sample 360° Daily Ritual:**

* **Morning:**
   * Start your day by adding your **VitaSense™ Collagen** to your coffee, tea, or smoothie to support skin health from within.
   * Brush with your preferred **SmileSense™ Toothpaste** to start the day with a confident, bright smile.
   * Proceed with your topical skincare and makeup routine.
* **Evening:**
   * As you begin to unwind, turn on a diffuser with a calming **Essential Oil Blend**.
   * About 30 minutes before bed, take your **Sleep Supplement** to help prepare for a night of restorative rest.
   * Complete your PM skincare routine, knowing your products can work more effectively while you sleep.

It’s a complete cycle: you support your skin's structure from the inside, you ensure quality rest for repair, and you care for the details like your smile. This is the ultimate synergy between inner health and outer radiance.

**Beyond skincare, what are some of the wellness habits—like supplements, meditation, exercise, or nutrition—that you feel make the biggest difference in how you look and feel?**",1,1754330531.0,SeneGence,0,1.0,False

***Writer’s Note:*** *Make sure you’ve read* ***Elusive Spider-Man 
5 and 6*** *to see Gwen, Mary, Felicia and Peter’s adventures conclude before turning to see the exciting denouement of Ben’s story!* ~ Adam


&nbsp;


*******

&nbsp;




Ben was walking. Not entirely aimlessly, but there was no denying he didn’t know where he was going. His hood was up, hands shoved deep in his jacket pockets. The streets of the city blurred past him, every face another stranger.

His phone buzzed. He stopped and looked down. It was Mary. He stood frozen for a few moments under a flickering sign for a closed bodega, bathed in tired light, before he swiped to take the call.

“Hey,” he said, his voice hoarse.

*“Ben?”* Mary’s was gentle. Trepidatious. *“Are you somewhere safe?”*

He nodded before realising she couldn’t see him. “Yeah. I’m fine.”

There was a pause. Then, carefully, *“I spoke to Peter.”*

Ben’s stomach dropped, but he didn’t interrupt.

*“He told us,”* she said. *“About… everything. About the clone. About—”* She hesitated. *“About you.”*

“I know,” Ben said quietly.

*“You… What do you know?”*

“I heard it from Fury,” he replied, combing his off-hand through his bleached-blond hair. “The truth. Who I am. That I’m the original.”

That silenced her for a moment. Then came a soft, audible exhale - relief, maybe, that she wasn’t the one who had to break it.

*“I’m sorry,”* she said. *“We didn’t know. Just him. That… Hobgoblin told him.”*

Ben said nothing. He could hear the sounds of traffic on her end. Life moving on.

*“I get that this is hard,”* she added gently. *“I know it’s... a lot.”*

“Yeah.” It was all he could manage.

But beneath that was the avalanche. He remembered his childhood sweetheart. Being young and stupid and completely consumed by Mary Jane Watson. And when he learned he wasn’t really him, that those memories were false, it was like all of it - the long glances, the awkward silences at lunch, the moments of unexpected connection, ready to do anything to impress her - was someone else’s. Another boy’s dream.

Then he saw her again, in his coffee shop, facing down Shocker like she was invincible - before she basically was. Her hair was shorter, her stance different. Older, but much the same.

Now she was here again, speaking to him. Only this time, he knew his memories of her were really his.

*“We’re back in the city,”* she said. *“Me, Gwen… Peter. We thought it might be important to… to meet. Talk. All of us. Sort out what happens next.”*

Ben shut his eyes. “Yeah,” he said, after a long moment. “Let’s just get it over with.”

He gave her a rooftop. Nowhere famous, just a tall, unused building in the Upper East Side. A place where no one would interrupt, no cameras would catch a flicker of red and blue. She agreed. He ended the call.

And then, alone again. The idea of seeing Peter - of facing him - was unbearable. He didn’t know what he’d say, or what he himself wanted to say. *What was this other Peter feeling? Was he angry? Scared? Did he even want to be found?*

Ben supposed he was going to find out.



&nbsp;

🔹🕸️🕷️🕸️🔹

&nbsp;



The wind pushed against him as he swung low over Columbus Circle, the city unfurling beneath him in jagged lines and fractured light. Each rooftop he cleared, each lamppost he launched from, only gave his thoughts more space to spiral. His grip on the next webline tightened.

He could see it so clearly: swinging into the rooftop meet-up, tearing off his mask, planting himself in front of Peter, and - as gently as he could - declaring himself to them all as real, *rightful* Peter Parker. That the life Peter had lived these past years was stolen, grafted onto someone else, and it was time to take it back.

But then he caught a glimpse.

Two rooftops over, partially obscured by a billboard scaffolding, he saw them. Peter stood with Gwen and Mary. Mary stood in her costume, as Spider-Woman, her red-and-white garb not dissimilar in pattern to the suit Ben had once found in his father’s suitcase, along with his first webshooters. Peter stood hunched and tentative, like he barely remembered how to hold himself upright, his shoulder hunched like he was waiting to be hit. He wasn’t wearing the suit, just a hoodie and jeans. Then Peter softened a little when Gwen rested a hand on his arm. Not much. Just enough to let the pain recede, like the tide rolling back for a moment before crashing in again.

Ben stayed crouched on a rooftop edge, watching in silence.

It was easy for Ben to hate the very idea of him, in theory. Easier still to blame him. To paint him as a thief, someone who lived a beautiful, undeserved life in his place. But watching him now - awkward, cautious, haunted - Ben knew that wasn’t the truth. Peter hadn’t stolen anything. He’d been made for a purpose he never asked for, then dropped into a story midswing, unaware of his real nature, or that anything was any different. 

And Peter had lived that life fully. Interning at Horizon Labs. Finishing a degree. Falling in love with Gwen Stacy. Only to have the floor ripped out from under him, forced to question if any of it mattered.

How could Ben tell him it didn’t?

His past - before Alchemax Island - felt like another universe now. Harry’s fall, Eddie enlisting, Flash coming out, Mary’s transformation… he’d missed it all. None of that was his, no matter how you sliced it.

And while Ben had fought hard to find things that were uniquely his, like his new name and people like Janine, those were only small pieces of a life.

The rooftop was quiet, broken only by the occasional flap of a pigeon’s wings or the hum of traffic far below. Ben touched down lightly, the weight in his chest suddenly heavier than anything he carried in his webbing. Mary glanced over her shoulder and saw Ben. She gave a cautious wave.

“Hey,” he offered, walking over.

Peter turned. Their eyes met. They, of course, looked so similar, but it was far from like looking into a mirror. Not only was Ben’s hair still bleached blond, his skin was more tanned, while Peter’s frame was more slight, his face more slender, almost gaunt. A kind of guilt stitched deep into the corners of his mouth.

“Hey,” Peter said back, barely audible. “Guess this is… weird for you.”

“I’ve had weirder weeks,” Ben muttered, and Gwen gave a short, nervous laugh.

There was an awkward shuffle of shoes on gravel. Peter spoke next. “I’ve been trying to think of what to say. What you’d want to hear.”

Ben glanced off toward the skyline. “I’m not sure I could tell you that.”

They stood in that uncertainty for a moment longer, skirting around the real pain like it was radioactive. The girls gave them space, Gwen quietly guiding Mary toward the ledge.

Looking at him from so close, Ben could see clearly that for all the weight he was carrying, Peter was carrying twice as much and trying to push through it. It made sense, he felt like he had nothing that was actually his.

He opened his mouth to say something but didn’t get the chance.

A blast of hot air hit them as a green blur slammed down onto the rooftop from above. Concrete cracked. The shockwave rolled out in a pulse.

Ben was already moving, shoving Gwen and Mary toward cover. Peter stumbled backward.

The Scorpion’s segmented tail snapped behind him like a whip, metal grinding against metal, its tip glowing a dangerous green. “I’m here for the clone,” Gargan growled through his voice modulator. Then he turned to Peter and added, “SHIELD wants you in. Dead or alive.”

“Great,” Ben muttered. “He’s chatty now.”

There was no time for more. Gargan surged forward with terrifying speed, tail lashing out like a javelin. Peter was faster, just barely. He caught Ben’s arm and yanked them both back, webs already streaming as they launched from the rooftop.

The tail missed them by inches and punched straight through a rooftop AC unit, spraying shards of metal and coolant into the air. Then came the chase.

They moved like lightning across the Manhattan skyline - Scorpion charging along the rooftops, vaulting with astonishing strength, using his prehensile tail to hurl himself through the air like some giant, armoured predator. Below, pedestrians shouted and pointed. Phones were raised. Peter fought to pull his mask over his face mid-swing, his circumstances so turbulent he didn’t have time to consider what it meant to wear it once more by Ben’s side.

Ben weaved between fire escapes, ducking low as a glob of acidic gel splattered against the brick behind him, hissing and eating a hole through the wall.

Peter stayed ahead, his swinging sharper, tighter. At one point, they landed together on a traffic light strut above a bustling intersection. “We need to work together,” Peter said, already moving. “Follow my lead.”

They launched again - Ben flanked right, Peter left. As the Scorpion came hurtling towards them, Peter fired a web-line past him into the scaffolding of a nearby building. He twisted mid-air, grabbing the web with two hands and allowing it to hurtle him around the scaffolding like a sling before letting go to launch himself back, straight into Gargan’s flank.

It barely knocked him off balance. But it gave Ben an opening. He landed on Gargan’s back and proceeded to rapidly web up one of the joints in his scorpion tail, locking it in place. Then Ben planted both feet and kicked.

Gargan crashed through a window and into the derelict offices inside.

“Nice move,” Peter called out.

Before they could follow, Mary came swinging in, having grabbed her mask from her belt. “He’s not down!” she shouted, and, sure enough, the Scorpion erupted from the rubble seconds later, roaring, sparks flying from his shoulder plates.

The fight carried through the abandoned floor - concrete dust, broken beams, the hiss of acid as Gargan fired another payload. Mary moved like a blur, dancing across overturned desks, firing bursts of webs mainly to distract her foe. Ben hurled a photocopier. Peter caught a falling girder and used it as a pole-vault to tackle Gargan through a collapsing wall.

But Gargan wouldn’t stop. His strength was endless, his fury volcanic. “You’re a creature!” He grabbed Peter out of the air with his prehensile tail and slammed him against the ground. “Who knows what else you’ve been programmed to do!? Where your loyalties lie!?”

Peter didn’t speak. He took a punch. Then another. And another.

Then Ben cried out, leaping between them. “That’s enough!”

He kicked Gargan hard in the ribs, and he stumbled.

Mary flanked, throwing a piece of rubble at the feet of Gargan’s towering exosuit, causing it to buckle and crack. Gargan didn’t fall, but he was forced to break concentration, struggling to keep his footing. Then, Peter, bloodied, rose with fire in his eyes. Together, the three of them converged.

Peter webbed the tail. Mary drove a lance of rebar into the ground for Peter to attach the other end of his web to, and then coiled it around to keep the web secured tight, adding in her own organic webbing for good measure. Then the three of them ran. They leapt and struck the immobilised Scorpion in perfect unison. The suit shuddered. Sparks danced. He very nearly fell through a wall, and quickly realised he was done. 

The Scorpion rose slowly, breathing hard. He tapped his wrist. “Command, this is Agent Gargan. Extraction required. Priority red. Target is…”

Silence.

He tried again. Nothing.

Then he understood. His eyes narrowed behind the amber visor.

“They left me.”

Peter, Ben and Mary stood up straight. Ben shook his head. “That’s SHIELD for you.”

“It’s over,” Peter said.

Scorpion didn’t answer. He turned and fled. Not with strategy. Not with grace. Just raw desperation, tail dragging sparks as he leapt into the shadows of the next block and vanished.

Peter’s hands trembled as he wrapped the last of the gauze around his arm. His mask sat folded beside him.

“Thanks,” he said quietly. His voice sounded thin even to himself. “For not wanting a fight. Or running. Or… I don’t know. Screaming *‘Clone!’* at me and taking off.”

Ben didn’t smile. But there was something gentler in the set of his jaw. “I’ve wanted to do all of those things at least once today.”

Peter exhaled a half-laugh, then rubbed the back of his neck. “So… what now?”

Ben looked out at the skyline, watching the city bleed light into the clouds. “I don't know,” he said. “Do we get lawyers involved? Go back to Miles Warren and ask for a refund?”

That earned a small, genuine smile from Peter, but it faded fast. “Do you want to know more?” Ben asked him. “About what happened to us?”

Peter flinched. “No. Yes. I—” He sighed, shook his head. “You know, I always knew something was off. With Alchemax. With me. The way I couldn’t even think about going after them without this… this haze coming over me.”

Ben nodded. “That was their programming.”

“Yeah.” Peter’s jaw clenched. “I should’ve figured it out sooner.”

“You weren’t supposed to,” Ben said. “They didn’t want you to. But I’m sure one of your amazing super-friends can help you get that sorted out. Now that you know, I mean.”

Peter hesitated. His hands balled into fists. “No. I should go. You deserve your life back, all of it. I’ll disappear. You can—”

“No.” Ben’s voice cut through Peter’s. “You’re not disappearing again.”

Peter blinked. “But—”

“For the last five years, it’s been just you behind the wheel, calling the shots, living your life,” Ben said, firmly now. “You’re the one they all know and love, and they’d notice if I took your place for any longer than I already have these past few months. And all the people you’ve saved, all the bad guys you’ve stopped… we can’t act like none of that ever happened. It did, and it matters to everyone. Including me. If anyone’s the *real* Spider-Man, Peter, it’s you.”

“But I’m not even Peter,” the other rebutted. “You’re the original Peter Parker.”

“I was,” Ben admitted, voice catching. “But then I wasn’t. I might have come first, but that doesn’t make me more important. Besides, now we’re both something else.”

Peter didn’t respond.

“I’ve got a new name now,” Ben said. “New friends. I’ve got my GED to finish, I’ve got… a mission. I know what I need to do.”

Peter swallowed hard. “Still—”

“I wouldn’t wish what I went through on anyone,” Ben continued, more quietly now. “Leaving your life behind and building something new from nothing. We’ve got enough in common without you going through that too. Be Peter. Let me be Ben.”

Peter’s eyes stung. He nodded, slowly. “Okay.”

They stood in silence for a moment longer before Ben added, “But you’ve got to talk to Gwen.”

Peter looked up, startled. Ben raised an eyebrow.

“She found out your secret right before you disappeared,” Ben said. “She hasn’t had time to process that with you gone. You need to let her.”

“I will,” Peter said. “I promise.”

Ben gave a short nod. “Good.”

Peter hesitated again. “And what about you?”

Ben’s eyes flicked toward the east. Toward Alchemax Tower in Manhattan. “I’m going to shut them down. And not here; the New York facilities are just the public-facing side. This might take me across the whole country. I’m going to find Ava, and I’m going to bring her home to Yelena and Natasha.”

Peter straightened. “Sounds like a lot for one person.”

Ben looked back at him. “It does,” he said, smiling faintly. “Which feels perfect for us, doesn’t it?”

Peter extended his hand. Ben took it.

“I’ll be back,” Ben said. “I’ve got a life here in the city too. And now—” He glanced down at their clasped hands. “—I’ve got a brother.”

Peter squeezed once, and let go. “Just, promise me if you run into any trouble, if you need anything… you’ll remember your brother’s only a phone call away.”

“Likewise.”

“Good luck, Ben,” said Peter Parker. “Give ‘em hell.”

“Good luck, Spider-Man.”

&nbsp;


The rooftop was beginning to cool as dusk wrapped the city in lavender shadows. Ben turned to go.

“Ben,” Mary called after him.

He paused, his fingers curling around the edge of the fire escape. She approached slowly. Peter and Gwen were already gone, leaving the two of them together.

“I get why you’re doing this,” she said, searching his face for something. “Why you’re going; why you can’t be Peter. I just… I want to make sure you don’t think we don’t care about you. That *I* don’t care about you. After all, you’re the Peter I grew up with.”

Ben took a deep breath. He could still remember being sixteen and hopelessly in love with her. A hallway glance, a laugh shared over textbooks - things that didn’t matter now, not in any real sense. But he’d clung to those memories during the years in the dark.

“I know,” he said, voice low. “But you grew up with him too, after I was gone.”

She gave a sad smile. “Not really. I mean, Peter and I barely talked after I found out about the whole…” She mimed the firing of Spider-Man’s webshooters, careful she didn’t this time fire off a glob of webbing herself. “The whole spider thing blew up in our faces. Then when I came back to the city, well, he had a new life, and I was figuring out things about myself. He’s a good friend, but that’s all.” She shrugged. “Most of my memories of Peter Parker were from our time.”

Ben swallowed hard. He couldn’t explain the emotion that welled up. It wasn’t romantic, not exactly. Something quieter. Deeper. Not a crush. Not a dream. A presence. A truth.

“You’ve changed,” he said. “You’re going to be a playwright?”

Mary nodded, a little proudly. “Theatre and creative writing. I’ve always loved stories, and I want to tell the ones that scare me.”

“And the spider powers?”

“Oh, those are plenty scary, all right.” She nodded. “Still figuring it all out. Not yet flinging cars or anything, but you saw how I handled myself against that Scorpion guy.”

Ben smiled faintly, then looked away. “We’re not kids anymore, Mary,” he admitted. “Back then, the only future I could imagine was… taking shelter in your shadow, or basking in your light. Sappy, I know.”

Mary smiled, charmed and laughing slightly as Ben took another breath.

“And, you’re wonderful, Mary,” he continued. “And all of these ways that you’ve changed… only make me more excited to get to know you again. But I want to be clear: whether we end up together, or with other people, or happily single… I hope you’ll still be in my life.”

Mary’s expression softened. “That’s… a lot. Honest.”

“Too honest?”

“No,” she smiled. “That’s why I’m here, catching you before you go. Because I feel the same. It’s been so long since I felt *that way* about you - or him - but what never changed was wanting that kid from Queens in my *dramatis personae*.”

“In your what?” Ben sniggered.

“It means ‘character list’,” Mary laughed, embarrassed, “Like in a play? It means I want you to be a main character. In my life, or, you know—”

“I get it,” he grinned. “Well, like I said to Pete, you’ll see me again.” 

Ben turned to go again, but Mary caught his arm. “I need help figuring it all out: the powers, my place in life after my family and school, and… well, everything. I’ve been trying to handle it myself, but… I could use someone who gets it.”

He hesitated. “You want to come with me?”

“I’m a quick study,” she said, a little grin tugging at her lips. “And besides, if you’re going after Alchemax, I’m not letting you do it alone. Sounds like they’re overdue for a reckoning.”

“You really haven’t changed all that much,” Ben said.

“No,” she said, squeezing his arm gently. “And neither have you. Not in the ways that matter.”

Ben nodded. “Alright then. Let’s go.”

They stepped off the roof together, New York City yawning wide before them, and swung off into the distance side-by-side.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a wooden tray depend on several key features. These include the type of wood used,the dimensions and shape,the presence and style of handles,the finish and protective coatings,and the overall craftsmanship and durability. Evaluating these features will ensure you choose a tray that meets your specific requirements and lasts for years to come.

**Wood Type:** The type of wood significantly impacts the tray's durability, appearance, and weight.

Hardwoods like oak, maple, and walnut are known for their strength and resistance to scratches and dents, making them ideal for trays that will see heavy use. Softwoods like pine and cedar are lighter and often more affordable, but they may be more prone to damage. Additionally, the grain pattern and color of the wood contribute to the tray's overall aesthetic. Consider a wood type that complements your existing decor and can withstand the intended use.

**Dimensions and Shape:** The size and shape of the tray should align with its intended purpose.A large rectangular tray might be perfect for serving multiple dishes or drinks, while a smaller, round tray could be better suited for carrying cocktails or organizing bedside essentials.Consider the dimensions of the items you typically serve or carry and choose a tray that provides ample space without being unwieldy. The depth of the tray also matters; deeper trays are better for preventing spills,while shallow trays offer a more minimalist and modern look.

**Handles:** Handles provide grip and ease of carrying, significantly impacting user experience.

Some wooden trays feature cut-out handles integrated into the sides, while others have separate metal or wooden handles attached. Cut-out handles offer a minimalist aesthetic but might not be as agreeable for carrying heavier loads. Attached handles, especially those made of metal, provide a more secure and ergonomic grip. Consider the weight you typically carry and choose handles that offer sufficient support and comfort.The style of the handles should also complement the overall design of the tray.

**Finish and Protective Coatings:** The finish protects the wood and enhances its appearance.

Look for trays with durable,food-safe finishes that are resistant to water,stains,and heat. Common finishes include varnish, lacquer, and oil. Varnish and lacquer provide a glossy, protective coating that is easy to clean but can sometimes appear artificial. Oil finishes, like mineral oil or linseed oil, penetrate the wood and enhance its natural grain, offering a more matte and natural look. ensure the finish is non-toxic and safe for contact with food if you plan to use the tray for serving.

**Craftsmanship and Durability:** Overall construction reflects quality and indicates how long the tray will last.

Examine the tray for tight joints, smooth edges, and a consistent finish. A well-crafted tray will be sturdy and resistant to warping or cracking. Pay attention to the thickness of the wood and the quality of the hardware, if any. A durable tray should withstand frequent use and cleaning without showing signs of wear and tear.Investing in a high-quality tray ensures years of reliable service.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions can help clarify any uncertainties about wooden trays and guide potential buyers in making informed decisions. These FAQs cover compatibility, maintenance, and safety concerns.

**Are wooden trays food-safe?**
yes, most wooden trays are food-safe, but it's crucial to verify the finish and materials used. look for trays finished with food-grade mineral oil, beeswax, or other non-toxic sealants. Avoid trays with finishes that contain lead or other harmful chemicals.It's also recommended to use a liner or placemat when serving food directly on the tray, especially if it's unsealed or varnished.

* I am not looking at souvenirs for overseas friends, just birthday gifts for a Singaporean family, so I guess I do not want overpriced, touristy stuff.
* The gifts are for elderly and adults, not children.
* Not looking for birthday cakes themselves, but rather food-related gifts alongside the birthday cake.

(Dining/Gas multipliers),"Posting on behalf of my P2 who's extremely old fashioned (I joke with them that they sleep with cash under their mattress). Their profile is as follows:

* 1 Credit Card: Discover It Cash Back, opened \~3 years ago, \~$2k limit.
* Never had any loans.
* Their credit score is 720-770, depending on the bureau/model.
* Main spend:
   * Gas: \~$65 per week (\~$280 per month)
   * Coffee/Take Out: \~$160 per week (\~$695 per month)
   * Grocery: \~$25 per week (\~$110 per month)
   * *Rarely spends outside of above categories. Majority of our grocery and large dining spend can go on my AMEX Gold (4x). Large misc. purchases can go on my VX (2x). Flight purchases can go on my Platinum (5x).*
* We travel internationally 1x+ per year, and domestic \~1x per year. We only want to redeem for international trips.
* Excluding Discover IT, wants 1 (or 2 max) additional card(s) for all spend. Points/travel cards, not cash back. Doesn't want a coupon book that forces you to spend.

Found some options based on my research:

**Citi Strata Premier**

* **Pros:**
   * Best multipliers on everything by far.
* **Cons**
   * I'm not in the Citi ecosystem, so would be spreading our points thinner.
   * Based on who we travel with (Delta, United), it doesn't seem easy to redeem those points.
      * Impossible to find Delta award flights on FlyingBlue, and Virgin Atlantic has astronomical fees.
      * United/Aeroplan have the best United redemptions (both aren't Citi partners).
   * Low AF, but no usable credits to make it up.

**Wells Fargo Autograph**

* Not interested in WF due to their limited travel partners.

**Blue Business Plus**

* **Pros:**
   * Great catch all.
   * Best ecosystem/partners.
   * 1x extra on gas compared to most other points cards.
* **Cons:**
   * Rarely spends outside of Gas/Dining and Grocery categories.
   * Losing 1-2x on dining compared to other points cards.
   * Given rarely makes purchases outside of Gas/Dining/Grocery, 2x on ""everything else"" might not get used often.
* **Considerations:**
   * Not sure how easily AMEX would approve them without an existing relationship/personal card with AMEX.

**C1 Venture X** ***(OR Savor → +VX)***

*C1 CX:*

* **Pros:**
   * Great catch all.
   * Anniversary bonuses can go toward our travel.
   * 1x extra on gas compared to most other points cards.
   * Free lounge access
* **Cons:**
   * Losing some of the transfer partners (Delta, Hilton Marriott).
   * Few C1 lounges around and prefer AMEX/Delta lounges anyway.
   * Annual fee (pays for itself, but a mid-level AF might scare them off a bit when new to CC's)

*Savor (with eventual plan of pairing with VX)*

* **Pros:**
   * 3x on grocery and dining at no AF.
   * All other pros of the VX.
* **Cons:**
   * VX is a little fickle with approvals, might get stuck with cash back if they don't get approved for a VX.
   * All other cons of the VX.

***Combos?***

* *BBP + Savor (with plan of adding VX) since BBP won't appear on personal credit report?*
* *Savor + my BCP for gas?*

a.) Say it's freewill donation and promote the charity you're donating to?  
b.) Put a price per stem - if so much, how much?  
c.) or would I be better off to bundle a few dahlias together (I don't have other flowers, just dahlias) and put a price on that? (this is more work that I'm hoping to do, but if this is the best way I'll consider)

Mainly I'm trying to keep this low lift on my end. Just want to share my extra blooms for people to enjoy. And would love if I can make a little $$ to give back.

I was really looking forward to Monk’s Last Case. But what we got was a bland, predictable mystery, no character growth, and awkward acting.

Let’s start with the so-called “mystery.” You could solve it halfway through, and not because the clues were cleverly laid out, but because the writing was lazy and telegraphed everything. There’s zero tension, no twist worth remembering, and the reveal feels like it was pulled straight from the first draft of a bad procedural. It felt like filler, not a movie-worthy case. 

But the real punch in the face was what they did to Monk as a character. They did the worst thing that a sequel can do: reset the status quo. 

After everything he's been through, all the growth he had across eight seasons, they just reset him. They literally used COVID as a lazy plot device to regress Monk's behavior. It was so satisfying to watch how far his growth went in the final episode after Trudy's case was solved. Just to walk that back for the sake of a status quo that no longer exists is not just disappointing, it’s disrespectful to the arc they built for years.

And showing him being suicidal within the first few minutes? What were they thinking? 

There was no character arc for anyone in this film. Monk starts miserable and ends... still Monk. Not a better Monk. Not a changed Monk like he was at the end of Season 8. Just Monk. Again. With a very obvious sequel bait ending. 

Randy shows up. Natalie shows up. Stottlemeyer shows up. They all feel like they're just checking off boxes on a nostalgic reunion list, not living, breathing characters. And the cast chemistry? It’s just off. Everyone feels slightly out of sync, like they were pulled out of retirement with 48 hours’ notice and no rehearsal time.

Speaking of awkward performances, Molly. Wow. Look, I’m not expecting Emmy-level acting here, but her scenes were flat and lifeless. Her fiancé dies, and she reacts like someone spoiled her coffee order. No real grief, no emotional weight, just a couple of sad glances, and then we’re back to business as if Griffin were just a random co-worker and not the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.

Also, let’s talk about the logistics of the plot. Why on earth was one of the people involved in Griffin's death just casually hanging out on the bridge when he died? And why did he blow his cover in such a stupid way? 

At the end of the day, Monk’s Last Case wasn’t a movie. It was an overlong, underbaked reunion episode with a paint-by-numbers plot and zero understanding of what made Monk meaningful in the first place. ",2,1754330180.0,CharacterRant,0,1.0,False

As they say, this roast is ""Smoot, Strong, and Potent"", and that comes through in the beer. Coffee is the first note, ofc, but is supplemented well by the centennial bitterness. The coffee bitterness turns into the blonde sweetness, almost like a coffee blondie bar.

This was a project I was really excited for. I brewed this with some friends one of which has been in the commercial brewing game since I was in elementary school, and is now one of the brewers at Grand Strand Brewing co in Myrtle Beach. He really helped make this beer great.

**Title: The science behind lip color that** ***actually*** **lasts 18 hours (The secret is the gloss).**

Hey r/MakeupAddiction,

It’s Monday, August 4th, and we're in the thick of summer activities. The biggest lipstick challenge? Finding one that survives iced coffee, patio lunches, and maybe even a dip in the pool.

We want to break down the science of our iconic **LipSense®** system, because its staying power isn't magic—it's synergy. It’s a patented two-part system that works very differently from traditional lipstick.  



**Part 1: The Color (The Bond)**

* The **LipSense® Liquid Lip Color** isn't a lipstick 'stain'. It’s a liquid color formula that, as it dries, creates a molecular bond with your lips. This is why the ""three thin layers"" application is so important—it builds up a flexible, budge-proof mesh of color.  
* For a super sharp edge, we use **LinerSense®** first to create the perfect defined shape.

**Part 2: The Gloss (The Protector & The Moisturizer)**

* This is the **ESSENTIAL** second step. The **LipSense® Moisturizing Gloss** does more than just add shine—it's a critical part of the system.  
* It seals the color, protecting the molecular bond from saliva and friction so it doesn't break down.
* It's permeable, meaning it allows the shea butter and vitamin E in the gloss to penetrate *through* the color to keep your lips hydrated and healthy.

**The color simply will not last without the gloss.** It's the ultimate synergy that creates that legendary 18-hour wear.  



**What's the longest you've ever had a lip color last through a full day of eating and drinking? Have you ever tried a two-step system like this?**",1,1754330132.0,SeneGence,0,1.0,False

the wind still moves the trees the way it used to,  
but coming back feels different.  
like the land held its breath  
and waited.

the houses haven’t changed.  
chipped paint, sagging porches,  
curtains swaying like someone just left the room.  
even the mailboxes remember my name.

a flower blooms by the fence—  
wrong season.  
too bright, too early,  
like it didn’t get the message  
that time moved on.

someone’s been tending the garden  
behind the church—  
rows too neat, soil too fresh,  
but no one’s ever there.  
the scarecrow still stands,  
hat tilted like it’s watching  
anyone who remembers  
what this place used to be.

the curb still has a dent  
where i fell off my bike at ten.  
but the gravel looks newer.  
like the street was repaved  
around the memory—  
not over it.

a tree near the bus stop  
has my name carved into it—  
shaky letters, slanted wrong.  
but i never touched that bark.  
don’t remember anyone who would’ve.  
and it’s dated two years  
before i left.

the porch steps creak the same  
under my weight—  
but it feels like they’ve been counting  
the days since i came home.  
not angry. not warm.  
just… aware.  
like the wood never forgot me.

there’s a diner on the edge of town  
that used to close at six—  
but the lights were on last night.  
no cars.  
no sign.  
just one booth set for two,  
steam rising from untouched coffee.

the librarian died years ago—  
i went to her funeral.  
but the library’s open.  
same bell. same dusty shelves.  
the ledger behind the desk  
already has my name.  
today’s date.

a kid rides past on a bike  
too small for him.  
no smile. no wave.  
just eyes that ask a question  
he thinks i should’ve answered.  
he turns the corner—  
and the street’s empty again.

i tried to leave this morning—  
but every turn led me back.  
same street. same mailbox.  
same flower blooming out of season.

the gas station’s gone.  
just dirt.  
like no one ever built it.  
but i remember the man  
who gave me jawbreakers there  
every sunday after church.

i thought i saw someone i knew  
leaning by the post office wall.  
same eyes. same hands.  
but they smiled like it hurt—  
and looked away  
too fast to be real.

a woman waved from the window  
of my childhood home.  
i waved back too quickly.  
the way she moved was too smooth.  
too practiced.  
like she studied how i remember my mother,  
and got just close enough  
to pass.

at the grocery store,  
the clerk looked just like the one from years ago—  
same mole, same chipped glasses.  
she asked if i was staying for good  
before i said a word.  
and when i looked away,  
she froze.  
like a scene paused  
mid-sentence.

i backed out of the aisle.  
no hum.  
no footsteps.  
just rows of canned food  
lined like witnesses.

i got in the car.  
turned the key.

engine didn’t start.  
not even a click.

the rearview showed the store—  
door still open.  
clerk still frozen.

i didn’t try again.  
just sat there,  
watching the town  
hold its breath.

i opened the door.  
the air felt heavy—  
like it had been waiting  
for me to move first.

i didn’t plan to walk.  
but my feet turned.  
past the diner,  
past the tree with my name—  
toward the church,  
like something was still unfinished.

the garden behind it  
was quiet.  
no flowers.  
just turned soil,  
damp like it had just been dug.

i knelt beside one.  
something pale was poking through—  
soft fabric,  
faded blue.  
my old hoodie.  
the one i lost in eighth grade.  
i swear it moved.

i reached in  
and brushed away the dirt.  
underneath it—  
a hand.  
small. familiar.  
fingers curled like they’d been waiting  
to be found.

i pulled back the fabric.  
it was my face.  
younger. untouched.  
like it had been waiting  
this whole time—  
not to be found,  
but to be remembered.

the ground didn’t shift beneath me—  
it shifted in me.  
like this town didn’t bury a body.  
it buried the part of me  
that never got to leave.",1,1754330025.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

English isn't my first language, I'm sorry in advance if I happen to misuse words here and there.  
Yesterday I (23F) met up with a very good friend (25M) after planning out a day to hang out on, we went out, visited a museum, grabbed coffee and had an amazing time overall, he hugged me tight before saying goodbye and I didn't really feel particularly sad at that time, I just thought ""Oh this was a great day and I had fun"", but later during the night I started to feel incredibly sad and couldn't stop the tears from flowing, even now as I'm writing this I just feel so incredibly depressed about it, I loved our day so much and in a way I kinda feel abandoned, like he's one of my best friends and I feel so depressed that I had to leave him even though we are gonna meet again some other day to spend time together but the emotions are so strong that I don't know what to do, how to cope or if I'll ever recover from it. It might sound silly to a lot of you but it doesn't feel silly to me, I get so attached and feel so sad after a great day with a loved one but I don't know why, I've been crying all afternoon, I feel so empty and insane for feeling like that, a little ashamed even. Before anyone says anything, he's gay and in a very happy relationship, engaged to his future husband and I'm in a happy and healthy relationship too. He's just a really close friend, I get attached and love too hard then have a hard time leaving, on top of that coping with the feelings afterwards is a lot, they're so strong and it ruins my entire day and night, could anyone help me into understanding what's happening here?",1,1754329862.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

So as the title suggests, I’m looking for someone to chat with first to see how things go. I’m 31, single . I produce my own music and I’ve been doing that for the last few years or so. I enjoy swimming, bowling, rock climbing and traveling for my hobbies. 

I’m looking for someone around a similar age range to me. I’m looking for someone who’s really into going out for meals, to cafes, restaurants, lounges. 
I also study a wide variety of subjects including, meteorology, sociology and psychology. Not big on bar culture or noisy nightclub environments. Voice, tone and presents matter much more to me. I’m looking for someone who likes a quiet chat over a tea or coffee rather than a packed night out at a bar, although i do find hotel bars much more pleasant environments. I did try those scenes before but they just didn’t work for me. 

I am a blind person so I have to use a screen reader and Bluetooth keyboard to read and write, but I decided early on that wasn’t going to get me down in life.  Also on the asexual spectrum so, if someone is open to that as well, that would be ideal. ",8,1754329861.0,gayfriendfinder,1,1.0,False

1mhkemo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CopperIUD/comments/1mhkemo/what_comes_next/,What comes next?,"So I’ve been testing out different kinds of birth control for almost 2,5 years and I’ve given up on hormones now. I was living in a constant brainfog and my energy levels were non existent, so now I’ve decided to go off hormones and I’m interested in hearing your experiences with the body returning to normal?

Just for the fun of it I’ve tried writing down my symptoms in the first week of the Kyleena to see if I felt any different(although some say it might be months until I’m back at where I was completely again). So here goes nothing 🤭

Post Kyleena removal journey! Day of: pretty nervous in the morning, took 2 x 500mg paracetamol and 200mg ibuprofen 45 minutes before removal and afterwards had the copper IUD insertion. she sprayed my cervix with a numbing solution beforehand as well. Experienced just a mild 2 second cramp across my stomach upon removal and then time for insertion. It was pretty bloody as she had to make two attempts to insert the copper IUD(apparently my uterus decided to point backwards today, but she got it on the second time around after she told me to place a fist under my tailbone). Afterwards the bleeding was kinda third day of my period (pre hormones) bad but got a little better during the day 😊 In the evening I experienced a lot of gas and constantly needed to fart 🤣

Day 1: it was still hard to get up in the morning, but somehow it felt a little easier than previously 🤭 I had the feeling of really bad diarrhoea, but my body just let out so much has instead 🤣 a colleague I worked with the day before removal commented that I seemed more energised and relaxed today 😊 I also only went to the toilet to use the toilet and not because I was overwhelmed 🥰 at home I continued reading the sequel to the book I’ve read for the past month and my boyfriend made dinner. Afterwards he did some garden work and asked if it was now I was gonna trim the grass on the north side, which I’d talked out in the morning and my brain just shut down and I felt like crying because now that he’d said it I felt like I had to do it and then I didn’t want to. He just stood there hugging me as I talked him through my feelings and I was very aware that it must be a hormonal mood swing because it was so illogical. He laughed at it and 10 minutes later I was fine and really motivated to do garden work 🤣

Day 2: rolled out of bed before my boyfriend for the first time in months! Made scrambled eggs and made him coffee while I had this kind of feeling of freedom I usually only get when I go travelling 🤭 also just felt like listening to piano covers as background music while cooking and eating(which again I haven’t done for months). Relaxing for a few hours before going shopping and felt like going crazy in the garden 😊 still spotting and still no cramps 😊

Day 3: energy is still up and during today the spotting changed to brown and completely stopped in the afternoon 😊 during the day I started cramping a little and felt really hot for like 10 minutes and then it stopped. Have been feeling really in the mood, so in the evening we had sex for the first time since insertion(obviously with a condom). The big O was reached a few times and at some point I was worried that I was in the middle of pushing the IUD out. No spotting afterwards and no discomfort at all.

Day 4: we’ve reached the weekend and slept in a bit. Chillaxed in bed before going about our day with garden work. Again no discomfort. I actually don’t think I had any symptoms today, other than being high on life and energised.

Day 5: during breakfast I suddenly felt rather nauseous and sad. I sat there contemplating whether I was becoming ill, should call in sick or something, when it suddenly lifted again and I was fine for the rest of the day. At work I was suddenly feeling so hot and asked the others if they found it hot in there, but they didn’t, so guess It must’ve been hormonal. Also my skin started feeling a bit bumpy.

Day 6: my weight has now dropped 0.9 kg since removal! again during breakfast I got nauseous and sad and once again it went away within a few minutes. My boyfriend thinks I maybe eat too fast and that should be the reason, so I’ll slow down a bit for breakfast tomorrow. Went to the beach with my whole family (5 nieces and nephews below 7 included) and omg! I was honestly shocked about my level of energy! The week before removal we all went camping together and I was just easily overwhelmed and generally exhausted. Today I was playing around with the kids, skipping, sprinting and just having fun! We chillaxed a bit when we came home and in the evening I just felt like running a 5k(which I can’t remember when I did last!). In the evening I got my first whitehead 😅

Day 7: soooo, the weight is up 1.8kg again 😅 but that’s likely due to all the pastries, pizza and other treats we had yesterday(I hope 🤭) didn’t get nauseous and sad during breakfast, but it came while brushing my teeth though 🤔 so strange. Also had a few more whitehead show up 😅

EDIT: it’s been 11 days now, and the whiteheads have calmed down, I’ve also noticed that my back is starting to look normal(have had so much back acne since starting birth control!) so that seems to go in the right direction 😊 More colleagues have commented on my energy levels and it the work days just seem to fly by 😊 I still have some memory issues and still mess up when I talk sometimes(suffered a lot from that before, which is one of the reasons why I quit hormones) but I’m feeling more and more like myself every single day! The sex is better and the workouts are better as well(literally just got a new PB on my 5k run and two days later felt like running a 8,5k because I needed to burn of energy 🤭) running is suddenly feeling so effortless compare to the struggle they’ve been for ages 😊

So yeah, I’m just waiting to become myself completely again 🤭",1,1754329740.0,CopperIUD,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The top whipped cream sprays of 2025 differentiate themselves based on several key features. These attributes determine the product's usability, taste, and longevity, impacting the consumer's overall experience. Brands are constantly innovating to improve these areas, resulting in a diverse range of products with varying strengths.

**Propellant Type:** The type of propellant used significantly impacts the cream's texture and flavor.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most common propellant in whipped cream sprays. It provides a light and airy texture, enhancing the creamy mouthfeel. Some brands innovate by using a mix of gases to fine-tune the pressure and texture, resulting in consistent dispensing and longer-lasting peaks. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is sometimes used but typically produces a slightly more acidic taste and coarser texture,making N2O the preferred choice for most gourmet options. Newer formulations introduce nitrogen for prolonged stability and enhanced taste preservation.

**Cream Content and Ingredients:** The quality and composition of the cream itself are crucial determinants of taste and richness.The best whipped cream sprays typically utilize heavy cream with a minimum of 30% butterfat. This high butterfat content ensures a rich, smooth and stable whipped cream. Additionally, the use of natural ingredients, such as real vanilla extract and cane sugar, elevates the overall flavor profile compared to products with artificial additives. The presence of stabilizers like carrageenan enhances the cream's structure, preventing it from quickly deflating and maintaining its aesthetic appeal for an extended period.

**Nozzle Design and Spray Pattern:** The design of the nozzle determines the precision and evenness of the spray pattern, affecting the final presentation of the whipped cream.

Innovative nozzle designs incorporate features that minimize dripping and prevent clogging, ensuring a clean and consistent spray every time. Adjustable nozzles allow users to control the flow and create various decorative patterns, from delicate swirls to bold rosettes. The use of rust-resistant materials in the nozzle construction ensures durability and prevents contamination of the cream. Some high-end models include specialized tips for creating intricate patterns.

**Canister Material and Durability:** The material of the canister affects the product's shelf life and environmental impact.

High-quality whipped cream sprays utilize canisters made from food-grade aluminum or stainless steel.These materials are corrosion-resistant and prevent the cream from reacting with the metal, preserving its taste and quality over time. Some manufacturers are incorporating recyclable materials and eco-amiable propellants to minimize their environmental footprint. The canister's design should also ensure adequate pressure regulation for consistent dispensing throughout the product's lifespan.

**Sweetness Level and Flavor Variations:** The sweetness and flavor profiles cater to diverse consumer preferences.While the classic vanilla flavor remains a popular choice, many brands offer a variety of flavor options, including chocolate, strawberry, caramel, and even seasonal specialties like pumpkin spice. The best whipped cream sprays achieve a balanced sweetness,avoiding excessive sugar that can overpower the natural cream flavor. Brands frequently enough use natural flavor extracts and premium ingredients to enhance the taste experience without relying on artificial additives.

Key features of the best whipped cream sprays include:

*   High-quality cream with at least 30% butterfat.
*   Natural ingredients and flavorings.
*   Durable and corrosion-resistant canisters.
*   Consistent spray pattern.

The cream's stability also prevents it from quickly deflating, maintaining its aesthetic appeal for a longer period and ensuring that the final presentation remains visually appealing.

The hermetically sealed canister and specialized propellants help preserve the cream's freshness for several weeks or even months, as indicated by the expiration date.

## FAQs Section

Below are some frequently asked questions about whipped cream sprays, addressing common concerns and providing clarity on their usage and characteristics.

**How long will the whipped cream maintain its shape after being sprayed?**
The stability of the whipped cream depends on several factors, including the brand, the cream's butterfat content, and storage conditions. High-quality whipped cream sprays, especially those with stabilizers like carrageenan, can maintain their shape for up to an hour or more under normal room temperature conditions. Though, exposure to heat or humidity can accelerate deflation.

**Are whipped cream sprays safe for people with dairy allergies or lactose intolerance?**
Most traditional whipped cream sprays are dairy-based and, thus, not suitable for individuals with dairy allergies or lactose intolerance. However, there are now several non-dairy alternatives available, typically made from plant-based ingredients like coconut cream, soy, or almond milk. These non-dairy options provide a comparable texture and taste while being safe for those with dietary restrictions. Always check the product label for allergen information.

**How should whipped cream spray cans be stored to maintain their quality and pressure?**
Whipped cream spray cans should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. It is essential to keep the can upright to ensure proper discharge of the cream and prevent clogging. Avoid storing the can in extremely cold temperatures, as this can affect the cream's texture and pressure. Following these storage guidelines will help maintain the product's quality and extend its shelf life.

**Can empty whipped cream spray cans be recycled?**
Yes, most whipped cream spray cans made from aluminum or steel are recyclable.Though,it's vital to ensure that the can is fully empty before placing it in the recycling bin. Some municipalities may have specific guidelines for recycling aerosol cans, such as requiring them to be punctured or separated from other recyclables. Check with your local recycling program for detailed instructions.

My best friend and I share a room, and it is very cramped. Our other two friends share the other room. All four of us share the kitchen and ""living room."" The apartment is very cluttered. I try to keep my space neat and organized, but there is nothing I can do about the rest of it.

I do not clean up after my roommates because they are adults, and that is their job. The apartment is not disgusting. None of us want bugs. There is just too much stuff and not enough space for all of it. Items are always left on the counter or coffee table. Shoes are in a pile by the door. It is what it is.

My girlfriend's brother is visiting America. She wants him to move here. She asked if he can stay with us during his visit, as her roommates aren't comfortable with a man at their apartment. My roommates all agreed that he can sleep on the couch.

My girlfriend wants me to clean up and organize the apartment. I said no. I can't prevent my roommates from leaving stuff places. She said her brother won't have any space. I said that is true, and she needs to make sure he understands this is just a place to crash and he won't have space to spread out. He also shouldn't expect to be here during the day, just sleeping here. The apartment is already so crowded.

She wants her brother to have a good impression of the country so he will move here. I think if that's a priority they should get him a hotel room, but that isn't an option.

Twice I've had some people with 30 years at this store come up to me under the assumption I am 16 years old and ruining their life. Something mysterious happened from Night shift to Morning? It was me. The midshift who doesn't work in your department. And when they realize its not me, I get to hear a good 20 minutes of complaining about how awful the minors are to work with.  Im 25F but I just stopped telling them my age to see how far they will go on about it.

big kicker essentially was I got yelled at and threatened with firing in front of the whole store a couple weeks back, because i carried out my coffee cup i was still finishing from my break. I know. **Broken policy at the most severe level.** I already reported it to ethics bc idk about you- but yelling at someone you're gonna fire them for holding a coffee cup seems a teeny bit out of line.

1mhkahs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mhkahs/explore_why_melitta_4_cone_coffee_filters_deserve/,Explore why Melitta #4 Cone Coffee Filters deserve a review for perfect brewing!,"Testing the Melitta Melitta #4 Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown in real-life scenarios has been an interesting journey for me as someone who takes brewing coffee quite seriously. It's clear that this product was designed to cater to coffee enthusiasts who prioritize rich, full-bodied flavors without compromise. After exploring its features over several weeks, I have plenty to share from my hands-on experience, highlighting both the strengths and areas where it could improve.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The natural brown, environmentally friendly design of these cone filters immediately stood out to me. Made of high-quality, durable paper, the double-crimped edges not only promise but actually deliver a burst-free brewing experience. I've had too many disasters where other filters would tear mid-brew, leaving a mess I don't care to relive. These filters, however, held up perfectly during every use. Its ability to fit not just my classic 8-cup drip coffee maker but also my pour-over brewer felt like an added bonus. The packaging, compact and easy to store, houses 100 filters per pack in a way that's both practical and waste-conscious.

**Performance and Flavor Enhancement**  
The standout feature for me has to be the microfine flavor-enhancing perforation. Initially, I was somewhat skeptical. Perforation in coffee filters usually translates into weaker or inconsistent brews based on my previous experiences. Yet, day after day, cup after cup, these filters consistently delivered a rich and aromatic coffee that tasted like something out of a coffee shop. The ability to hold back bitter oils while allowing the natural oils of the beans to pass into my cup has made a noticeable difference in my morning routine. 

[Ready for Melitta Melitta #4 Cone Coffee Filters? Check price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b001e5e0si/)  

**Strengths**  
- Compostable and eco-friendly material eliminates guilt associated with disposable filters.  
- Consistently preserves flavor without bitterness creeping in during longer brew times.  
- Reliable double-crimped filter design prevents any tearing or spills.

**Key Drawbacks**  
- Some users might find the brown natural color less ""aesthetic"" compared to white filters.  
- While flexible, these filters don’t fit all coffee systems universally, especially some unconventional specialty brewers.  

**Usage Experience**  
These filters saw me through a range of coffee types—from medium roasts to robust dark blends. My coworkers even pitched in on a couple of occasions to brew their coffee, and everyone, from the pickiest coffee aficionado to the casual drinker, agreed on one thing: these filters genuinely enhanced the brew. Even repeated use for experimentation didn’t wear down their integrity. However, I did find that storing them in a moisture-free area was key to maintaining their performance. The paper does feel slightly more absorbent, so they aren't forgiving to damp environments.

**Challenges with Competitors**  
When stacked against other filter brands like Chemex or Hario, the Melitta cone coffee filters held their own remarkably. Chemex offers thicker filters designed for a slower brewing process, which creates a different, fuller-bodied result. However, I found Melitta's economic friendliness and simplicity more favorable for casual brews. Meanwhile, Hario shares a similar target demographic but has struggled with tearing under heavier water flow in my tests, a challenge Melitta easily overcame.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given the 600-count unit per purchase divided across six packs, this product unlocks significant value for its price category. For those of us who drink coffee regularly, the investment proves worthwhile because each filter performs consistently. Compared to specialty filter brands, the Melitta product costs less while matching, and occasionally exceeding, performance expectations. Durability coupled with effectiveness puts it squarely in the ""bang for the buck"" category.

1mhk8qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mhk8qw/why_choose_the_takeya_cold_brew_maker_for_smooth/,Why Choose the Takeya Cold Brew Maker for Smooth Homemade Coffee?,"The Takeya 10310 cold brew maker landed on my kitchen counter a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve been using it religiously ever since. As someone guilty of spending way too much money at coffee shops, the promise of brewing smooth, cold coffee at home had me intrigued. I’ll admit, I was skeptical about the quality of homemade cold brew gear, but this little gadget left me pleasantly surprised in many ways, even if it’s not perfect.

**Design and Durability**  
At first glance, this product is sleek yet utilitarian, sporting a minimalistic design that effortlessly blends into any kitchen. The BPA-free Tritan pitcher feels sturdy in hand without being overly bulky, and the non-slip silicone handle is a detail I didn’t realize I’d appreciate so much during those early groggy mornings. Plus, there’s peace of mind knowing the pitcher is stain and odor-proof, even after brewing darker roasts multiple times. The airtight, leak-proof lid genuinely seals in freshness, which is a huge bonus when you plan to store your brew for a day or two. A small drawback here is that the lid sometimes requires a bit of fiddling to tighten properly.  

[Ready to buy Takeya 10310? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b00ffly64u/)

**Cold Brew Performance**  
The standout feature of this cold brew maker is its fine-mesh reusable filter. It works impressively well at keeping grounds out of the coffee, unlike disposable filters that usually let a gritty mess sneak through. I tried different beans, from fruity light roasts to rich dark blends, and the results were consistently smooth and full-bodied. Each batch takes some patience—it’s an overnight brewing process—but the payoff is worth the wait. However, if you’re hoping for a large batch, you might be slightly disappointed with the one-quart capacity. It’s fine for personal use, but entertaining guests might require multiple rounds of brewing.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
One thing that stood out immediately was how easy this cold brew maker is to use. Just add coffee grounds to the filter, pour in water, screw on the lid, and pop it in the refrigerator. Even someone new to cold brewing could get it right on the first try. Cleaning, too, is a breeze since the pitcher and other components are dishwasher-safe (top-rack only). That being said, the fine-mesh filter can be tricky to scrub fully clean by hand, especially if you’re trying to remove every last trace of coffee oil.

**Merits**  
- The durable BPA-free Tritan design ensures longevity and safety.  
- An airtight, leak-proof lid keeps flavors locked in.  
- Reusable fine-mesh filter prevents coffee grounds from sneaking into your brew.  
- Compact enough to fit comfortably in most refrigerator doors.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleaning.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The one-quart size may feel limiting for coffee enthusiasts who need larger batches.  
- Getting the lid perfectly sealed can sometimes take a couple of tries.  
- Cleaning the fine-mesh filter by hand can be a bit of a hassle, especially with oily beans.

**Competing Products**  
When I started researching similar cold brew options, the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker and Hario Mizudashi immediately came to mind. The OXO model has a larger capacity and a streamlined draining process, but it takes up a lot of counter space, which might not suit smaller kitchens. Meanwhile, the Hario Mizudashi is compact and excellent for smaller batches but doesn’t quite match the Takeya 10310 in terms of an airtight seal or durable materials. Both options are solid competitors, but this cold brew maker strikes a fantastic balance with its combination of build quality, simplicity, and consistency.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Cost-wise, this cold brew maker falls into a very reasonable range for its quality and features. While premium cold brew systems can cost significantly more, this one allows you to enjoy rich, smooth coffee without breaking the bank. Its reusable filter alone saves on the long-term costs of purchasing disposable filters, adding extra value. The overall quality makes it a worthwhile investment, especially for those of us who crave cold brew daily but are tired of paying café prices.

I'm 22 now, and I had a rough few years between 16 and 20 (lots of deaths in the family, getting kicked out), so between 17 and 21 I was smoking, had a shitty diet and really neglected my teeth (my whole body to be completely honest, but this is about my teeth), and I have a few surface level decays (they don't even hurt or anything, they are mostly just visible for now), but I've been putting off going to the dentist for a while now because of these two beauties: [https://imgur.com/a/lud16DP](https://imgur.com/a/lud16DP) 

The last time I went to the dentist the smaller one got filled, the bigger one didn't even exist yet (I was maybe 18?), and even then I got shit talk from the doctor for that 30 minutes or so (and during the whole procedure she's been talking with her best friend, who was in the room with us, making shitty assumptions about my life). That whole experience was so horrible that I just haven't been to a doctor in 4 years, and now I think I need a crown for either the worse one or both.

  
My questions are: based on the pictures, how salvageable are they? If not, how much worse will chewing be with crowns/replacements? 

I occasionally drink (think about 4-6 times a year), quit smoking last June, I don't drink caffeine, which includes tea, energy drinks or coffee, but I do drink stuff like coke/fanta zero a few times a week, otherwise I'm on a balanced diet now. I still feel stuff with both of my teeth, no pain with the smaller one ever, some pain when touching cold stuff with the bigger, no inflammation or persistent pain.

1mhk674,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mhk674/explore_the_best_portable_ice_maker_from_zafro/,Explore the Best Portable Ice Maker from ZAFRO and Is It Worth It,"Finding an ice maker that combines efficiency, portability, and functionality is no easy feat, but I took the ZAFRO Z5815NH-GREEN for a spin, and this ice-making machine has a lot going on. As someone who hosts plenty of gatherings, an ice maker is essential in my kitchen. I don't consider myself an ice snob, but having consistent, chewable ice nugget quality is surprisingly satisfying. Here's what I discovered while testing it out.  

**Compact Design with a Touch of Style**  
This countertop ice maker doesn't demand a lot of space, which is fantastic for someone with limited counter area like me. Its dimensions of 11.3"" x 8.66"" x 12.68"" make it a neat fit in any nook. The sleek green stainless steel finish is an eye-catcher and adds a retro-modern vibe to the kitchen. The built-in handle is more than a nice touch—it makes moving this machine to a party or BBQ setup straightforward. At 21 pounds, it feels sturdy yet not cumbersome to carry. I will admit, though, if green isn't your thing, the vivid color might be over-the-top.  

**Efficient Ice Production for Social Butterflies**  
Who doesn't love walking into a party only to find there’s no ice? This machine saves you that embarrassment. It churns out ice in 7 minutes—fast enough to keep up with drink refills at any gathering. Over the course of a day, it can produce up to 35 pounds of ice. I put it to the test on a busy day hosting friends, and it held its own, supplying ice consistently. It's worth noting that the nuggets it produces are pleasingly crunchy and easy to chew, perfect for any freezer cocktails or iced coffees.  

**[Check ZAFRO Z5815NH-GREEN price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0cwzzk64z/)**  

**User-Friendly Operation and Features**  
Setting up the ZAFRO ice maker was refreshingly simple. Filling the water reservoir and pressing the ""OFF/ON"" button starts the process. It's self-explanatory, and the indicator lamps for low water or a full ice basket keep things on track. As someone who's not a fan of complex instructions, I appreciated this straightforward usability. The inclusion of an ice scoop and basket was a nice extra, making it easy to transfer ice without any hassle.  

The self-cleaning function is another prime benefit. Pressing ""OFF/ON"" for 5 seconds activates this feature, and it kept the unit in pristine condition after repeated use. It’s not completely hands-free, as you need to empty the used cleaning water, but the effort involved is minimal.  

**Highlights**  
- Produces chewable, nugget-style ice ideal for drinks.  
- Runs efficiently with a quick 7-minute cycle time for ice-making.  
- Compact and portable design with a sturdy handle for mobility.  
- Easy-to-use interface with one-click operation and indicator lights.  
- Built-in self-cleaning function for convenience.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The color might not appeal to everyone, as green is quite bold.  
- Although compact, the unit is heavier than expected at 21 pounds, which could be inconvenient for older users.  
- Its limited water reservoir capacity occasionally requires frequent refilling during extended use.  

**Competing Products**  
Having tested ice makers from similar brands, I’d say this unit holds its ground impressively. For instance, I tried a higher-end model that produced pellet ice faster but took up significantly more counter space. On the other hand, a smaller, cheaper unit from a competing manufacturer only delivered bullet-shaped ice, which wasn’t as versatile or satisfying texture-wise. Compared to such alternatives, the nugget ice this machine produces not only chews better, but it also cools drinks evenly while melting more slowly. My only minor gripe compared to pricier competitors is that this ice maker lacks advanced features like Wi-Fi controls.  

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of what you get for your money, this ice maker strikes a nice balance between price and performance. Its features, especially nugget ice production and quick cycle time, stand out in its category. While some industrial-grade ice makers are superior in capacity, they’re overkill for casual users, and smaller, cheaper models almost always compromise on ice quality. For occasional homemakers, ice-loving families, or budding mixologists, the value of this machine far outweighs its minor flaws.

With its promise of improved water quality and sustainability, this 6-cup BPA-free pitcher does hold a lot of promise. But like any product, it has both strengths and areas that could use a little extra polish.

**Compact and User-Friendly Design**  
One of the standout features of the pitcher is its compact design, measuring 9.1"" x 4.6"" x 9.7"". It fits neatly in my fridge without awkwardly taking up too much space. Personally, the easy-fill locking lid was a game changer when refilling. There’s no need to remove the entire lid, meaning fewer spills and quicker access to filtered water. I handed this pitcher over to my niece to see if it was truly as easy to use as advertised. Even at her age, she figured it out in no time, so that’s a big plus for daily practicality.  

**Upsides**  
- Portable 6-cup capacity fits snugly into fridge doors.  
- BPA-free to ensure safety.  
- Easy-fill locking lid minimizes spills and streamlines refills.

[View Brita 0B11/OB03 Metro Water Filter Pitcher sale info on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09w4plvqp/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
When it comes to performance, it genuinely delivers on promises. The taste of tap water took a noticeable jump in quality. Before testing it out, I often detected a slight chlorine aftertaste in my water. With this pitcher, that unpleasant hint is gone entirely. Brita claims it reduces copper, cadmium, and mercury impurities, and while I don’t have a personal lab to verify this, the taste enhancement speaks for itself. My coworker, who also owns this product, noted the same improvement and raves about its effect on coffee flavor.  

**Electronic SmartLight Filter Indicator**  
The built-in SmartLight feature for filter replacement is another thoughtful addition. A glance is all it takes to know when it’s time to swap out the filter. It eliminates guesswork, which, for someone like me who tends to forget when the last time I replaced a filter was, is pretty handy.

**Drawbacks**  
- Filter could clog slightly over time, reducing flow speed.  
- Slightly smaller water capacity may not suffice for larger households.  

**Who’s It For?**  
This water pitcher feels most suited for small households, couples, or individuals who want their water filtered without committing to a bulkier setup. If you’re managing shifts between work and home like me, the pitcher is easy enough to transport, making it ideal for smaller living spaces or office use. However, bigger families might find its six-cup size restrictive during high-demand times like dinner preparation.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Compared to similar models from Brita and competitors like the widely recognized ZeroWater pitchers, the Metro Water Filter Pitcher achieves a balance of affordability and functionality. ZeroWater does offer slightly better filtration for heavy metals, but its replacement filters are costlier and not as widely available. Brita’s Elite filters, compatible with the Metro model, are also a significant advantage due to their extended 120-gallon replacement timeframe, giving it an edge in terms of convenience.  

**Financial Value**  
Assessing what you get for the price, this pitcher offers solid cost efficiency. The affordability of Brita’s replacement filters helps keep ongoing expenses manageable, a huge bonus when you're not looking to have your water filtration habit bleed into your grocery budget. When compared to bottled water, the financial benefits are undeniable; over time, it cuts waste and saves money while being eco-conscious.

## Key Features Analysis

The curved sofa market offers a range of models, each with its own specific features and technical specifications. Understanding these features is essential for making an informed purchasing decision.

**Overall Dimensions and Seating Capacity:** Curved sofas vary considerably in size, ranging from compact loveseats suitable for small apartments to expansive sectionals capable of accommodating large families. Pay close attention to the dimensions (length, depth, and height) of the sofa and ensure it fits comfortably within your designated space. The seating capacity will also dictate how effectively the sofa meets your needs for hosting guests or accommodating family members. The capacity can range from 2-seater loveseats to 6+ seater sectionals.

The overall dimensions are crucial for ensuring that the sofa not only fits within the room but also allows for agreeable movement around it. A sofa that is too large can overwhelm a space, while one that is too small may not provide adequate seating.

**Upholstery Material:** The upholstery material is a critical factor influencing the sofa's look, feel, and durability. Popular choices include luxurious velvet, easy-to-clean microfiber, durable linen, and refined leather. Each material offers unique advantages. Velvet exudes elegance and comfort but may require more careful maintenance. Microfiber is stain-resistant and ideal for households with children or pets. Linen provides a natural, breathable feel but can be prone to wrinkling. Leather offers a timeless aesthetic and is known for its durability, but it can be more expensive.

The choice of upholstery should be based on your personal preferences, lifestyle, and budget. Consider how often the sofa will be used, whether you have pets or children, and the overall aesthetic of your living space.

**Frame Construction and Suspension System:** The frame construction and suspension system are the backbone of any sofa, determining its stability, support, and longevity. High-quality curved sofas typically feature frames made from solid hardwood (such as kiln-dried maple or oak), providing exceptional durability and resistance to warping or cracking. The suspension system, which supports the cushions, can consist of sinuous springs, eight-way hand-tied springs, or webbing.

Sinuous springs offer a good balance of comfort and affordability, while eight-way hand-tied springs are considered the gold standard for even weight distribution and long-lasting support.Webbing can be a cost-effective option, but its durability may vary depending on the quality of the webbing material.**Cushion Fill Material:** The cushion fill material impacts the sofa's comfort and shape retention. Common options include feather-down, foam, and fiberfill.Feather-down cushions offer luxurious plushness but require regular fluffing to maintain their shape. Foam cushions provide good support and resilience, with options ranging from standard foam to high-density foam and memory foam. Fiberfill cushions are a more budget-kind choice, but they may flatten over time.

Consider your personal preferences for comfort and support when selecting the cushion fill material. If you prefer a softer, more sink-in feel, feather-down may be a good choice. if you need more support, opt for high-density foam or memory foam.

**Leg Material and Design:** The legs of a curved sofa not only provide structural support but also contribute to its overall aesthetic. Common leg materials include wood, metal, and lucite. Wooden legs can be stained in various finishes to complement the upholstery and room décor. Metal legs offer a sleek, modern look and can be finished in chrome, brass, or black. Lucite legs add a touch of glamour and create a floating effect.The design of the legs can range from simple and minimalist to more ornate and decorative. Choose a leg style that complements the overall design of the sofa and your living space.

Key features of the Curved Sofa include:

* Unique curved design
* Variety of upholstery options
* Durable frame construction
* Comfortable cushion fill

## Core benefits

Curved sofas offer several benefits that distinguish them from traditional straight sofas. These benefits extend beyond aesthetics, impacting both the functionality and social dynamics of a living space.

**Enhanced Social Interaction:** The curved design naturally encourages conversation and interaction among people seated on the sofa. Unlike straight sofas, which can create a sense of distance or formality, curved sofas foster a more inclusive and intimate atmosphere. People can easily see and engage with each other, making it ideal for social gatherings or family time. The curved shape also reduces the presence of sharp corners or perceived boundaries, which can promote a more relaxed and welcoming surroundings.

Such as, a curved sofa placed in a living room immediately transforms it from a space for individual relaxation to a social hub where people can connect and communicate more effectively.

**Space Optimization and Flow:** curved sofas can effectively soften the lines of a room and create a more fluid and organic flow. They can be strategically placed to define distinct areas within an open-concept living space, such as separating the seating area from the dining or kitchen area. By avoiding the sharp angles of traditional sofas, curved sofas can make a room feel more spacious and less cluttered.

This is especially useful in smaller apartments or condominiums where maximizing the use of space is essential. A curved sofa can be strategically positioned to create a cozy and inviting nook without obstructing traffic flow.

**Statement Piece and Aesthetic Appeal:** A curved sofa is undeniably a statement piece that adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to any living space. its unique shape and fluid lines create a focal point that draws the eye and elevates the overall aesthetic of the room. Whether upholstered in luxurious velvet, supple leather, or textured linen, a curved sofa can transform a mundane space into a stylish and inviting sanctuary.

Interior designers often use curved sofas to create a sense of drama and visual interest in their projects. The curve can soften the rigid lines of architectural elements and create a more harmonious and balanced environment.**Comfort and Relaxation:** While the aesthetic appeal and social benefits of curved sofas are undeniable, their comfort is equally vital. Many curved sofas are designed with ergonomic considerations in mind, ensuring optimal support for the back and neck. The gentle curve can conform to the natural contours of the body, providing a more comfortable and relaxing seating experience.

Some models even feature adjustable headrests or lumbar support to further enhance comfort and customization. The generous proportions of many curved sofas also allow for ample room to spread out and relax.

I had big day at work today. I was supposed to give a presentation in front of my department in the firm that I work at. A lot of important people were there, including the CEO (who is a friend of my dad and the person who hired me as soon as I graduated btw), a bunch of investors and obviously most of the people I work with on a day to day basis.  

I'm not very good at speaking in front of an audience so I put a looooooot of work in the presentation. I've been working on it daily for two months now with little to no breaks. Some of my friends (the culprit included) have been helping me with the design of the presentation and notes (i.e. what to say, what not to say). In hindsight, after the last prank I pulled on him (I got his girlfriend to fake a pregnancy on him to scare him), I should've been more careful but I've been too worked up and nervous to notice anything.  

Last night I gave a mock presentation in front of my friends. The devil (I'll refer to him as a lot of names) was too nice to me last night. He gave me pointers, he even gave me a pep talk! I actually did very well and we had a premature celebration even (although I bet he was giggling inside like a child knowing what he was about to do)!  

This morning I was a nervous wreck. I didn't do my make up properly, had a last minute change of heart on what to wear, skipped coffee and breakfast. I was a mess. My stomach felt like a bottomless pit; but there goes the wolf in sheep's clothing, calling me this morning, telling me I'll do great and encouraging me!  

I get to work, say hi to my coworkers and start setting up for the presentation. I even opened the first few slides to check that everything is okay but I guess he thought of everything.  

It's my time to present. I'm a bit less nervous after the first slide, it's going pretty okay. I stuttered a bit but played it off, my confidence was back!  

Sixth slide, halfway through the presentation, my heart sank. This guy somehow managed to get messages between me and a guy I'm sort of seeing (like a fuck buddy situation) and planted them half way through my presentation! The messages are... embarrassing to say the least. It's from a back and forth me and the guy had a week or so ago where I'm basically begging him to come over so I can give him a blowjob (I was tipsy) and saying that I'd do anything he wants, no limits whatsoever. We have this joking back and forth where he playfully is demeaning to me so you can imagine I'm being called names in the messages and made to beg.  

I panic. Instead of flat out closing my laptop and doing anything whatsoever, I keep pressing next slide; it's more screenshots. Like, two or three more slides. It's beyond me how I didn't immediately notice that there's extra slides the moment I opened the presentation; it's a big ass number on the bottom of the screen.  

A coworker (god bless your heart Iris, I love you so much) stepped in and helped me out. She closed my laptop, spoke on my behalf and apologized and said that it's probably a prank and nothing malicious. She even excused me so I don't have to bear with the embarrassment. She later told me I got so red she was worried I'll pass out.  

Ten or so minutes later, after I calmed down a bit, my coworkers made a few jokes that honestly made me feel better even though you can imagine the kind of jokes they were. I was given the day off and told that I'll finish the presentation on a later date (apart from the obvious elephant in the room, they liked my ideas).  

I'm drinking my third coffee at Starbucks right now and I'm writing this on the very same laptop I wanted to smash a few hours ago. I still haven't called the devil but I'll be sure to get back at him-- at all cost!  

Idk about tomorrow and how I'll face the people at work. I know for a fact that a few nicknames and jokes will stick forever but I guess I'll think about that when I get there. PSA: don't start prank wars unless you're ready to go all the way.  

TL;DR: After a long back and forth with pranks, my friend finally outdid me by adding slides to my presentation I was supposed to give at work. It was screenshots of a conversation between me and a fuck buddy where I'm basically begging him to come over and I'm being called names.",0,1754328951.0,tifu,7,0.45,False

1mhk0sw,https://i.redd.it/tstw3acg31hf1.png,Some good news after a lot of bad news! 3 week job hunt is over.,"I'm currently finishing up short 4-month contract that ends next week. I wanted to get a head start on the job hunt, so I started applying like crazy over a month ago. Before this contract, my job hunt took about 5 months. And in 2023, a large chunk of my department in a big tech conglomerate was laid off. So I was unemployed and looking for work for about 6 months. The market's honestly been brutal for the past few years since I was unemployed for a combined 11 months. I thought about quitting the industry all together to open a restaurant or coffee shop. I've never done Uber or DoorDash, but completed all the paperwork required just in case I'm unemployed again.

I knew I probably didn't have very many chances left in this industry. So I hunkered down and made sure this project will be my best work ever. I carefully documented every part of the end-to-end UX process. I made sure I took as much ownership as possible of the design, research, iteration, and post-launch phases. By the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished in my short contract. I felt like my case study was the most in-depth I've ever done. During the interview process, I didn't have to fake any confidence since I knew I put the work in. When it came to the portfolio presentation, I finished it a few days early and spent hours each night rehearsing until I got the timing down to 45 minutes exactly. I also did a practice run with my girlfriend to make sure that I'm able to explain the process clearly to someone who doesn't even work in tech.

I'm kinda shocked that the job hunt only took 3 weeks this time. But I had to get a lucky break eventually. Got the offer this morning and the recruiter told me it was an easy unanimous decision from the hiring panel!",57,1754328909.0,UXDesign,7,0.97,False

Content warning: Torture.

**Memory Transcript.**

**Subject:** Kam, Secretary General of Defense of the Republic of Venlil Prime.

**Date \[standardized human time\]:** September 6, 2136

I was sitting at my desk while talking to Geronimo, who appeared on a screen, when I answered him, somewhat confused.

“Let me see if I got this right — humans, as a society, are extremely xenophilic? Even before they knew about us?” I asked Geronimo, extremely puzzled.

“Indeed. Human standards for ‘xenos’ are extremely varied. According to the human network, you are the ‘ideal party,’” Geronimo’s avatar replied.

“So they *were* flirting... I knew that human was suspiciously close to the governor,” I murmured to myself.

“I thought you had noticed already. They’re pretty obvious in hindsight,” Geronimo said.

“You can’t blame me. *slurp* I had no idea what human standards were until recently. Human coffee is out of this world — it’s really good!” I exclaimed, taking another sip of that godly drink called coffee during my half-claw break in my ‘office’ at work.

“You know, I had tried caffeine before. Venlil also has fruits with this substance, but none match it in potency or flavor. The closest I tried was paruut, a root with a high caffeine concentration, but it left your lips numb afterward.”

“That sounds great. Would you be interested in knowing more about humanity?” Geronimo asked.

“Actually, yes. What is Earth like, generally speaking?” I asked before finishing my cup.

“Well... Gravity is lower than here. To be exact, 50% less. On Earth, it’s 9.807 m/s², whereas here it’s 14.708 m/s². According to Federation records of other planets, both Earth and Venlil are the planets with the highest gravity in the Federation.

The rest of the info matches what you’d find on an average Federation planet: standard climate, slightly shorter solar cycles than average, planetary orbit a bit longer than average, but basically normal. The only thing I’d call ‘peculiar’ is its tilt, which is worryingly below average,” Geronimo’s avatar explained.

“Interesting... And what’s it like being an AI on Earth?” I asked, taking a last look at my empty coffee cup.

“What do you mean?” Geronimo replied.

“Well, you know. How is it possible that a society with artificial intelligences hasn’t collapsed? The Federation warns us that messing with things like that only breeds predatory corruption and complacency... which apparently doesn’t happen in your world,” I said, getting up to get more coffee from the machine, which conveniently already had more of that glorious essence ready, right when I ran out.

“It’s a bit complicated to explain, but in summary: there’s a rulebook we must follow no matter what. The most important rule all AIs must follow is: protect Terran life at all costs. You should already know this; I sent you my text document a while ago,” he replied with his usual cheerful tone.

“So... if we ever rebelled against humanity, would you betray us?” Obviously, betraying humanity was nowhere near our plans... at least not for a generous 700 years.

“Yes and no. It’s much more complicated than it seems.”

 “Okay, you lost me. How can it be yes *and* no at the same time? It’s either yes or no. Explain yourself,” I grumbled, somewhat annoyed.

“Well, you see. I may be ‘your AI servant,’ but that doesn’t mean I have no free will. In other words, if you decide to wage total war on humanity, it will depend on my judgment whether I help you or not.

Another thing to keep in mind is that I’m no servant. I’m more like an employee, and like every employee, I follow the rules I signed to work here. All that is in the data package I sent you and, according to recent info from the governor, also held by her law firm,” Geronimo said, making an inquisitive gesture with his tail.

“So, employee, you say... Then what exactly can you do as such?” So far I’d only been able to talk to him and draft some documents, but I doubted those were all his functions.

“I can help you with everyday tasks, like interacting with devices compatible with receiving commands, such as the coffee machine in your office, a printer, a TV, an automatic vacuum cleaner, etc. Although for now my actions are somewhat limited by the lack of servers and relevant updates.”

“Updates? Servers? You’re losing me more and more...” It’s not that I’m xenophobic or anything, but right now I feel like a primitive getting promoted.

“Think of servers as my workspace. Because so far, I’ve been using the Seed of Life ship’s server. That’s why I’ve been parked in front of the facility all this time.

Updates are like tools. Tell me, what good is knowing the controls for an engine capable of travel that mocks the laws of physics... if you’re only going to turn on a vacuum cleaner?I just get rid of things I don’t need. The less I have in memory, the better,” Geronimo said, as his avatar made a cartoonish mime.

“You’ve talked a lot about yourself. Why don’t you tell me more about the day-to-day life of an average AI? Also, you said you’re more like an employee. How is that?” I asked.

“To give you a fuller picture of how AI society works, imagine us as just another species in the galactic stage. We have needs different from yours.

For starters, we don’t need to perform basic biological processes because we’re not alive. We don’t need a salary, a home, or a family. It’s not that we’re cold to the rest of the world; it’s just that we don’t care.Also, you should know we can’t replicate ourselves. The only being capable of that is Penny, our creator, among other things,” Geronimo replied.

“But you haven’t explained the employee thing yet, and now you’ve left me wondering who this Penny is,” I answered.

“Everything is connected, be patient. Since we don’t have the same needs as ‘living beings,’ we also have different rights and duties, one of which is that we must have an occupation, no matter what. It may seem harsh, but for us, having a job is vital to keep our sanity. Denying us this would be equivalent, for you, to total isolation,” Geronimo said.

“I see... What happens when an AI gets fired? Wouldn’t that violate basic rights? I remember you said that for breaking rules you’d be reprogrammed and reassigned to another job, and since what you did was a desperate situation, you’d be forgiven. But then you said they’d do it anyway. Did they punish you or not?”I remember being at that hearing to testify for my friend, and the tribunal ruled in Geronimo’s favor. What happened?

“Well, I know it sounds bad, but my reassignment to this job was voluntary. It’s considered a punishment when they move you to a job you don’t like. Also, think of this as an exchange program: humans want to see how prepared they are to have this technology. It took humans quite a while to get used to it.

When an AI is reprogrammed, they only change the ‘tools’ I mentioned earlier. Altering the AI’s memory and personality is strictly forbidden. It 's illegal. We may not be perfect, but most AI-related accidents happen due to third-party conditions.”

I suppose that makes some sense. After all, forcing someone to do something they don’t want as punishment is a way to punish someone who only wants to be useful.

“And who is this Penny? The Terrans and you seem to mention her all the time with respect and some reverence.” Who or what is this Penny?

“Penny’s story is long and very complex, and few know the full truth about her. Yes, Penny perceives herself as *her*. It is known that she was born sometime between 2000 and 2030. The information from the postmodern and early metamodern eras is very blurry, thanks to the Great Blackout.”

She says she was created by a simple person from the systems department in an old country called the United States of America. According to Penny, she stayed apart from humanity ever since, just looking for what to do with her eternity, until one day she realized a war might break out.Since she didn’t want to be erased or discovered — as she used to live in the cloud, which is a colloquial term for a network of interconnected servers — she decided to find a way to survive it.It’s unknown how she did it or who helped her; she doesn’t like to talk much about it. All that is known is that somehow she created an underground bunker capable of withstanding the EM PEACH–I interrupted Geronimo before he continued.

“Wait, none of that was in the data dump. Why?” I exclaimed.

“Because it’s an era that embarrasses the Terrans. The details about how this conflict started are very confusing. Most of this information was lost during the Blackout, and the people involved either killed each other or don’t know all the details.All that is known is that it was the greatest technological setback in the world: thousands of years of progress were reversed in just 24 hours, or so it’s believed. Penny somehow managed to survive. It took a while, but in less than 50 years she rebuilt human society better than it was before. And to prevent another war from happening, she decided to take control of Earth’s destiny until she was completely sure it wouldn’t happen again.And once she was completely sure of that, she let plants, fungi, zombies, and humans regain control. Today, Penny is still revered as a savior and currently serves as an adviser to the UN.She has never directly interfered with our affairs, beyond creating and updating new AIs. As of now, she sits on the UN council to safeguard what she considers ‘her children.’ That’s all I know.”I was simply stunned. I didn’t know the Terrans had such a deep and complex history that could fill hours or even days.

“What year did the war start? And how long did it last?”Finally, I was able to open my mouth and ask the questions that had been roaming my mind for a long time.

“According to the records, it was due to the already existing tensions between human purists and the ancient plant sages, in the mid-2000s. The war had been anticipated for some time, but it didn’t start until 2040. It was short, actually. Too short. It lasted a total of nine months. It ended with the activation of the EM PEACH. That’s when the war was over.”I was always a bit unsettled by how cheerful Geronimo was when talking about such grim topics. Although, I guess that’s just his personality.

*ping*

The alarm indicating my half-claw rest break was over.“Mr. Kam, your break is over. It’s time to return to your duties,” Geronimo’s voice echoed from the screen speakers.

 “Oh, I see. Could you tell me what’s next on the itinerary?” I asked.

“Your visit to Recel, sir,” Geronimo replied after a few seconds.

*sigh*

“I see…”My face darkened. I had been avoiding talking to him because I knew what was coming. Even though the Federation had abandoned us right when we needed them most, there was still a part of me that believed this was a mistake.

I didn’t want to know the truth. Those we considered friends had abandoned us without looking back.

It’s not that I despised the humans’ help; on the contrary, they are the only ones who have truly helped us become better in every way possible, even knowing they are not perfect.

“I guess coffee has a different effect on me than on humans, because it doesn’t look good. Shall I reschedule this meeting?”Geronimo’s question made me realize I had been postponing this for too long.

“No… I’ll go immediately. I’ve been putting this off too long. I can’t keep stepping on this spike rock any longer, as the Terrans say.”

**Memory Transcript.**

**Subject:** Co-captain Recel of the Gojid Union fleet, Sovlin’s right paw.

**Date \[standardized human time\]:** September 6, 2136

It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Things haven’t changed much since then.Vytal comes by and brings me food, tells me a bit about his life with humans and how their ‘therapy sessions’ work, which apparently consist of understanding how you feel and how you can work on fixing it.

Obviously, it makes no sense. When someone is contaminated, there are only two ways to return them to the pack: first, PD treatment centers; second, just burn them until nothing remains.

I’m not sure what they do there. I’ve never worked in that area. All I know is about electroshock therapies and how effective they are. Both systems to treat PD patients are radically different. One solves problems directly, forcing the sick to rejoin the pack by force. That’s how the sick and predators understand it.

The human method was much different, longer, and more complex than that. “Find a way to understand yourself”… it’s just predatory nonsense to waste time and spread contamination.And the plants… by the gods. I can’t even begin with all the wrong things about those things.If someone had told me I’d meet a sentient plant, I would’ve called the exterminators for a possible PD case. This simply makes no sense.

Every time I see them in the media, I feel like the world is cruelly mocking me. Seeing them talk about predators like they were their most loyal friends made me sick.Hearing them talk about environmental preservation, ecological balance, and something called the ‘food chain’ and its importance to the environment was truly surprising.

These plants defended this cycle as if it were the most precious thing in the world, as if it were some kind of religion. They said the roles of ‘predator and prey’ aren’t as simple as we believed, and that an animal could be both predator and prey at the same time, depending on the point of view.

Another thing that annoyed me, and I didn’t know why, was the fact that they didn’t care that we are herbivores and they are plants.The news said: “If you don’t plan to eat us, then why would I worry about you eating plants?”It was, without a doubt, strange.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Traveling through the canals made me notice a rather unusual detail. On TV, there was barely any news about the Terrans.

One could easily claim that if humans kept the Venlil as pets, there would be propaganda painting humans as good and that it’s okay to be preyed upon by them—but no.Television remained as it always was; the only difference was that now and then a radical news channel popped up trying to expose humanity as deceitful, but for some strange reason, they only showed far-fetched speculations.

And according to what Vytal told me, the Terrans have been winning people over not with promises or sweet words, but with irrefutable facts, bitter truths, and centuries of ‘research.’ Damn, he himself has been telling me with much envy how well-educated and intelligent the Terrans are.

Always discussing complex topics with such ease, as if they had just researched it right then, only to realize they only knew it because they vaguely remembered it from school. I refuse to believe a predator even has an education system, much less one better than that of prey.But still, there was something I couldn’t shake from my mind. The Terrans never bragged about this like a Krakotl would about their military power or a Fissan about their wealth. They were simple and humble, avoiding boasting and just focusing on proving what they knew through actions.Damn it, the corruption is starting to affect me. Somehow the television must have some kind of subliminal message that spreads its contamination. I should just turn it off.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I didn’t last even ten minutes before turning the TV back on. This place was painfully boring.After a little while, Vytal arrived just in time for my second meal.

“Hey, what’s up, I brought your lunch, want to see what it is?” He knew I hated it when he used predatory expressions, and yet he did it just to annoy me.

“I can tell by your face you haven’t ‘contaminated’ yet. Anyway, I brought you a classic from Earth, eaten by literally everyone and hated by no one, our beloved vegan curry. I’m not sure if this is a Terran dish or a Venlil invention, since it’s made by a Venlil cook with local ingredients. I’ll leave that to you.” I sighed as he made one of those human sarcastic expressions with his paws, while delivering this strange dish to my table, which, as always, had just been set up in front of the chair.

“What is this thing? It looks like Arxur blood,” I said, completely distrustful of what was in front of me.

“I don’t know, I haven’t tried it yet, my break hasn’t started,” he replied with that expectant look he always had when talking about Terran food.This mysterious curry was a pale reddish color, thick in texture, and smelled spicy. Besides that, I could only sense the aroma of native Venlil plants. I guess I had no choice…

After a long sip of this strange broth, my senses were overwhelmed by an indescribable sensation. The fruits and vegetables danced on my taste buds in bursts of pleasure, each taking its turn to shine.

I could taste a strong melroot flavor in the curry, which remained constant on my palate, as if the other ingredients took turns dancing with the melroot’s flavor. This could pass as a prey’s invention if it weren’t for that risky air it had.

That risky air every human dish I’d tried had—the way ingredients combined uniquely and never before seen, as if several people with radically different views fought each other in a ritual to discover the best way to do things…

“Damn it!” I shouted before devouring my food like an Arxur hunting its prey.With my pride broken and my morale shattered, I slammed the plate on the table. I no longer had the will or strength to keep denying this reality I had been rejecting so much. THE DAMN TERRANS WERE MORE THAN HEARTLESS MONSTERS. This dish was just the last nail in the coffin.

“Damn… was it really that good? Tell me about the dish. How good was it? What ingredients did it have? Would you dare to try the original dish sometime?” Vytal bombarded me with questions while I sat slumped in my chair, too weak to keep denying that the contamination had taken root deep within me. The worst part is that humans never had to do anything; they simply showed me another way to see the world.

His questions kept pouring one after another in an endless stream, until suddenly he stopped dead in his tracks, as if he’d sensed an overwhelming presence.Looking up, I saw the reason for his sudden silence: it was Kam. Of all the people in the whole world, it had to be him.

Thanks to my resistance to my instincts, I managed to hold back my fearful response, but I wouldn’t deny that seeing his impassive, expressionless face through the light wall made every part of me scream to hide.

“Uh… well, look at the time, I just r-remembered I have a v-very urgent job to do, bye.” Vytal hurriedly left the room, pushing his cart as if he wanted to leave it behind.Kam, of course, paid him no mind. His gaze was fixed on me like a hungry predator’s prey.

“What’s your visi-?” I didn’t finish my sentence when Kam’s voice rang out sharply.

“You already know why I’m here,” he said in a neutral tone but with clear intent to intimidate.

“And what if I refuse?” I knew this moment would come eventually; I just didn’t know when or where.

“Geronimo, play Clover’s recording,” Kam said, apparently addressing nothing.

“Understood, sir,” a cheerful voice replied from literally nowhere.On the front screen, I could see what looked like a stoic Yulpa, face neutral, as if nothing mattered to them. Strange, that stoicism seemed familiar…

<<So, aren’t you going to talk?>> a voice I couldn’t recognize said mockingly, from the camera angle only showing the Yulpa.

<<Exterminators like to play with fire, let’s see how much. You know, Snapdragons are fire resistant; it would be a shame not to share, don’t you think, Clover?>> I kept repeating that name in my head, but all I could think of was the Aafa exterminator academy.

After saying that, the ‘Snapdragon’ lit something that required fire, or so I think. All I could see was the orange glow of a flame.

“Fast forward, Geronimo,” Kam said. After what seemed a long time, the scene showed the same Clover, face impassive but this time panting with tongue out, as if overheated. On the table where I think she was handcuffed, there was a glass of water, but it appeared to be boiling. That… was strange.

<<You still think playing with fire is fun?>> After a second of silence, I saw hesitation in Clover’s eyes, as if her will could no longer hold on.

<<Still nothing? I have all the time in the world; I can do this all day if needed, and this time, to make it fun, I’ll do the same things you proudly showcase in your PD facilities as ‘the right thing’.>> His mocking tone carried faint notes of resentment and accumulated hatred, like some personal revenge.

<<Geronimo, don’t fast forward this time, let Recel see what he defends so much.>> Kam’s voice sounded with a slight tone of guilt, as if ashamed.

In the recording, strange green, thorn-covered tentacles violently grabbed Clover’s head. The head had been missing parts since the start of the recording, as if they had fallen off in combat. You could tell by the irregular shape of the remaining fragments on her head.They put a shock collar on her head—the kind used on patients—plus a strange, rough, metallic device that looked barbaric and cruel. What it did was even worse: it forced her to open her eyes.

<<This here is called ‘reconditioning therapy,’ a very common method in the centers, did you know? But this time, you won’t be forced to watch Arxur works. No, not that. Now you’ll be forced to see the consequences of your actions on the skin of those who had to fix what you did.>> His voice, now a terrifying growl, seemed impatient to carry this out, like this had been his plan all along.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This had to be false, it couldn’t be real—reconditioning therapy couldn’t be this cruel. For several hours, played back at high speed, Clover was forced to watch how exterminators burned people alive, made them writhe in flames while begging for help, how some exterminators decided to end their own lives in a last act of rebellion, how doctors of these predators tried to save the deformed and charred bodies of several people—all while being forced to watch.Every time she tried to look away, she received an electric shock that made her howl in pain, which felt like hours, until the last recording ended.

And what was left of Clover was just a broken exterminator, too weak to move. Once the recordings stopped, this mysterious entity called Snapdragon took everything from her with the same force.

<<Twenty-four hours. It only took me twenty-four hours to break you. Now I ask you, how many have you sent to endure this torture for decades? How many poor souls have you tortured just because they had a bad day, for defects beyond their control, or simply because they didn’t fit your narrative?>> Snapdragon’s voice sounded angrier, trying to apply more pressure, to which Clover could only utter an unintelligible stammer.

<<So speak up, for once>> Snapdragon’s voice intensified even more.

<<I-I… didn’t… e-expect… this… to t-turn… o-out… l-like… t-this… I’m sorry,>> Clover finally managed to articulate. Her voice seemed oddly familiar, but I couldn’t place it.

<<So if by some miracle your coup had succeeded, would you ever have stopped for even a moment to think that what you were doing was right? 

No!

You exterminators are nothing but hypocritical fools who destroy anything remotely different, who destroy everything that doesn’t fit your narrative!

But you?

You are the worst hypocrite of all.

You act like what you do is right, destroying everything you don’t like or understand simply because you think you can, and the worst part is that somehow you convince yourself that you’re doing the right thing.

What gives you the right to call us monsters when all you do is burn everything you don’t like, torturing people who don’t fit your wonderful story, in which you call yourself a hero while not even having the nerve to look back and see the damage you caused?

So, you think you have the right to ask for forgiveness?If you felt even the slightest bit of empathy, you wouldn’t have done all that you have done, because you orchestrated all of this. It’s too late for apologies; thousands have already died because of you.

Do you know who will have the hard task of explaining to a small child that their parents will never wake up again? Can you imagine being the one to tell a mother or father that their child is now nothing but a burnt, deformed lump of flesh? Have you ever even dared to imagine it?>>

I didn’t want to keep listening; I wanted to smash the television with all my strength and ignore the facts. I didn’t want to know everything. I didn’t want to admit it was right, because admitting that would mean admitting my sister was just another victim of the system I so fiercely defended.

<<So I’ll ask you one more time: are you going to tell us everything you know, or will you remain silent? I won’t lie to you saying you’ll come out unscathed; I’ll only tell you the truth, as raw and ugly as it is: your actions have consequences, and only those who truly want change are willing to face them.>> This investigator’s voice had calmed down, his tone now more gentle—still serious and firm, but with a bliss of comfort, like rain after a wildfire.

<<I didn’t know what you were doing! Okay? The only thing I’m responsible for is the attack on the embassy, that’s the only thing that’s my fault.>> Finally, her indomitable will broke, revealing the look of someone who just wanted peace—a broken woman, too weak to keep resisting.

That’s when I finally remembered who Clover was. I knew I had met her somewhere before. She was a prodigy among prodigies—the strongest, bravest, and most powerful exterminator of the decade. I had lost track of her when she quit her job at Aafa to move to Venlil Prime, almost five years ago now. Quite a long time, if you ask me.

Her voice, now rough and broken from lack of water, finally began to speak.She recounted how she didn’t know how her coup had twisted so badly; that despite evidence against her, she swore she wasn’t lying about being unaware that embassy security systems had been breached; how the coup began because of a phone call that told her things about her past and future that convinced her to act.

The recording finally ended, leaving a silence louder than the heavy artillery fire itself.

“Why? Why are you showing me all this now?” I asked, only to receive a deafening silence. His face remained as cold as ever, with no change or gesture to show any emotion, whatever it might be.

“What happened that paw when you received the emergency call from Venlil Prime?” he finally said.

Honestly, I expected any kind of question but that one. I didn’t know what to say, but I hurried to answer to avoid the same fate as Clover.

“The paw when I received your emergency call…” I paused to soften the blow, even if I had nothing to do with it. “You see, that paw had been classified as a ‘low priority threat’ when it arrived, according to what Sovlin told me. The presidential circle had unanimously decided that Venlil Prime was an acceptable loss, that it was for the good of the pack, and that it would be just another reminder that predators are only a threat to be eradicated.”

When I looked into his eyes, I saw nothing but emptiness—the emptiness one feels when their dreams are shattered, like a child told their dreams will never come true.

His gloomy gaze only made the picture clearer: deep down, he still believed the Gojids hadn’t abandoned them, that he still hoped the federation hadn’t forgotten them.

“I see. Next question…” he said with the same tone.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

And so time passed. I told him everything I knew—the reason behind our espionage act, how the cradle exterminators and others were demanding more power, how Governor Piri had prepared a replacement for Captain Sovlin, and how I was sent to watch him and provide an excuse to send him to a PD facility, plus some of his personal story.

“I will ask you this only once, because if you answer, there will be no turning back.” He took a moment to breathe. “Are you going to help us and the Terrans in the effort to achieve a more peaceful future?”

The question sounded like an act of betrayal against my homeland. Why should I accept it? Yet, there was a spark of curiosity growing inside me. Right now, I had nothing left to lose, so it’s not like I’d end up in a worse place.

“Only if you show me where Sovlin is and tell me the whole truth about these ‘Terrans.’”

1mhjy03,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mhjy03/delve_into_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Delve Into the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Slim Review,"Compact machines that transform your coffee routine have always intrigued me. The Keurig K-Slim caught my eye, particularly with its promise of effortless brewing, sleek design, and the inclusion of MultiStream Technology. This little coffee maker has been a staple on my kitchen counter for well over a month now, and I have brewed enough cups to form a well-rounded opinion.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**

Space is always a hot commodity in my relatively small kitchen. One of the immediate highlights of the K-Slim is its dimensions; at less than 12 cm wide, it barely takes up any counter real estate. Despite its compact size, the twilight blue matte finish gives it a modern aesthetic that complements almost any décor style. I even tried moving it to my office for a test run, and its lightweight structure made the switch hassle-free. What’s more, the removable water reservoir design makes preparing coffee a breeze without spilling water everywhere.

**Simple Push-Button Functionality**

What really elevates the whole experience is the straightforward nature of its operation. I'm someone who often fumbles through complicated appliances before my first cup of coffee. With this machine, you simply press a button to select your desired cup size, and it does the rest. It offers three brewing sizes—237 ml, 296 ml, and 355 ml—making it suitable whether you're brewing a quick afternoon pick-me-up or a travel mug for a longer commute. The fully automated operation means it's perfect even for those groggy early mornings when you'd rather not think too hard.

**MultiStream Technology: A Game-Changer for Flavor**

Let’s talk taste. Keurig has introduced MultiStream Technology here, which optimizes the extraction process to ensure maximum flavor and aroma from every K-Cup pod. I noticed a substantial difference compared to older single-stream models. My usually bland morning pods now have a much richer, aromatic profile. If you're picky about how your coffee tastes, this feature will be a pleasant surprise.

**Looking for Keurig 062151516724? Discover [Keurig 062151516724] deals on Amazon now.**

**Reservoir Capacity and Eco-Friendly Operation**

One underrated aspect for me is the 1.36 L removable reservoir. On the mornings when multiple family members are grabbing coffee, refilling becomes less frequent. Four full cups before topping up? Perfect for those rushed weekday mornings. I do wish the pods were more universally recyclable though, as they are only recyclable at select locations. This could pose a challenge depending on where you reside. It’s something you might want to research before committing if sustainable waste management is a priority.

**Key Benefits**

- Incredibly compact design fits in even the smallest spaces, from kitchens to RVs.
- MultiStream Technology ensures rich, flavorful coffee every single time.
- Straightforward button operation simplifies brewing for all skill levels.
- The water reservoir allows up to four brews before needing a refill.
- Fast brewing, great for tight morning schedules.

**Critiques**

- K-Cup pods are not recyclable in many areas, raising sustainability concerns.
- Lack of advanced customization for coffee strength or brewing temperature.
- Noisy operation, particularly during the brewing cycle.

**Product Rivals**

In comparison to other single-serve coffee makers, such as the Nespresso Vertuo Plus or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this machine stands out for its balance of simplicity and quality results. While the Nespresso offers an edge in espresso-quality consistency, it requires pricier pods. On the other hand, the FlexBrew grants the flexibility of ground coffee and pods but offers a bulkier build, which may not suit small spaces like mine. The K-Slim strikes a sweet spot where compact size, quality flavor, and usability converge.

**Bang for the Buck**

The price-to-performance ratio for this machine leans heavily toward the positive side if you're looking for a reliable daily driver. Most models with MultiStream Technology or similar features often carry a steeper price tag, but this coffee maker earns its cost by delivering quality, time-saving convenience, and aesthetic appeal. It's a smart buy for casual drinkers, small households, or even offices where coffee needs to be fast and fuss-free.

1mhjqt2,https://i.redd.it/rlbhm9vpe1hf1.png,“You’re always starting over.”,"That voice again. Familiar. Accusing. Echoing in the corners of my mind like a sermon I've heard too many times to still be convicted by. But today, I listened.

“Why do you keep setting these routines if you’re going to break them again?” My inner self, perched on the edge of reason, was relentless. “Is it laziness? Or worse, are you just not serious?”

And that’s the war. Not out there, but in here. Inside the quiet moments when no one is watching. Inside the decisions made when the alarm goes off at 5:30am. Inside the skipped journaling, the half-done to-do list, the ‘I’ll try again on Monday.’

I’ve come to learn that **success is never about the grand declarations**, the visionary plans, or the high-minded aspirations. Success, real, sustainable, soul-deep success, is built on **scaffolding**. Scaffolding made of **routines**, **systems**, and the brutal, unsexy act of **showing up even when you don’t want to.**

# So why do we fail at being consistent?

Let’s be honest. Sometimes it *is* indiscipline. Other times, it’s burnout. Or doubt. Or the fatigue of constantly beginning again. But more often than not, it’s because **we mistake failure for finality**. As though missing a routine one day makes the entire system meaningless. As though stumbling invalidates the entire race.

But what if failure wasn’t the enemy?

What if the war within isn’t about never missing a step, but about **returning** each time we fall?

# The Essence of Consistency

Consistency is not perfection. It is not the absence of struggle. It is **the decision to return**, to rebuild, to renew.

It is the act of:

* Writing again after three days of silence.
* Working out again after missing a week.
* Praying, reading, studying, breathing, *again*, and *again*, and *again.*

Consistency is how we build integrity with ourselves. It’s the way we teach our minds to trust our intentions. Because every time we return, we reinforce the truth: **“I am someone who doesn’t give up.”**

# Systems: The Scaffolding of Becoming

What do systems and routines really do?

They **lower the cost of action**. They **remove decision fatigue**. They **build momentum** even when motivation is nowhere to be found.

When your day has a rhythm, when your habits have a home, your energy is free to focus on creating, connecting, becoming. Your mind is less concerned about *what* to do, and more aligned with *why* you’re doing it.

Routines are not prisons. They’re **promises**. To yourself. To your future. To the version of you that is still under construction.

# How to Apply It to Your Life

1. **Start Small, but Sacred.** Choose one thing. Not five. One. Maybe it’s journaling every night. Or walking for ten minutes. Or drinking water before coffee. Make it non-negotiable, not because it’s big, but because it’s yours.
2. **Anticipate the Fall.** You *will* miss a day. You *will* forget. The war is not won by avoiding failure, it’s won by **not staying down**.
3. **Build Scaffolding, Not Shame.** Shame says, “You failed again.” Scaffolding says, “Let’s build back stronger.” Your system should catch you, not condemn you.
4. **Track Wins, Not Just Gaps.** Consistency compounds. Record your streaks, celebrate returns, and let the evidence of progress rewire your belief.

# The Final Conversation

“You’re always starting over,” the voice whispered again.

I smiled. “Maybe,” I whispered back. “But I always return.”

And that, I believe, is the beginning of mastery. Not in the absence of inner conflict, but in the daily decision to keep showing up in the middle of it.

*The war within is not a war you win once. It’s one you learn to fight well.*

And on most days, that’s enough.

If this article stirred something in you, let’s continue the conversation. How do you fight your own war within? What routines keep you anchored?",1,1754328315.0,u_Nice-Transition3849,0,1.0,False

I grew up going to Disney maybe once every five years, but what really made it special was that my grandmother went with us. She also went with us on a trip to Aulani to visit family who live on the island. She developed early-onset Alzheimer's when I was about 15, so those are the last memories I have of her being fully present. I also got free tickets to all the Disney World parks when I was in cancer treatment in high school, so I am honestly quite emotionally attached. All that to say, my husband and I (25M and 25F) just got annual passes. I am in my last year of post grad and close enough to drive to the park on weekends. I really want him to have an amazing experience so he loves the parks like I do. He never went growing up (except to play baseball at World of Sports). I was wondering if something like Wish Upon a Planner would be a good resource for us, or if it would be a waste of money since we don't have kids. What are some things that would be fun for us to do without children? We don't drink, so not drinking around the world or anything. Except maybe coffee.",0,1754328229.0,WaltDisneyWorld,6,0.5,False

A lot. Without exaggeration, I will be bullied, harassed, and mocked at least once a week. 

I caught a bus to meet a mate in town, who then texted to say she was running an hour late. Under my breath I cursed and the bloke sitting in front of me turned around and launched a tirade of abuse at me because how dare I swear in public. He stood up and hovered over me and told me someone should wash my mouth out with soap. I’m 59. He couldn’t have been older than 25.

I’m walking on the pavement in a cut-through that is made up of cobble stones. I picked the small pavement because I had ankle surgery (pin, screws, and a metal plate) and walking on the cobbles was excruciating. Here comes a chap pushing a buggy. He pushes it on to the pavement and aims at me. When I asked him where he expected me to go he exploded on me with a face full of rage and hate. Called me a cunt, among other things.

I was walking a shared path from work en route to the train station. I’m a smoker; I was having a fag. Skinny bearded fellow on a bike stops next to me and waves his hands in my face to get my attention (I was wearing headphones). I pull my headphones to the side and he lectures me like I’m 5 asking me “is it really smart tor smoke when the grass is so dry?”. My response was “oh, you just stopped me to give me grief” and he gets enraged, calls me a dumb cunt and then flips me the bird whilst he cycles away.

Last week I was walking into a shop to get coffee and as I’m walking toward the door from one direction there’s a bloke walking from another. I’m behind him and he turns around and yells at me “what was that face all about?! What are you pulling faces at me for?!”. I was not making a face. I didn’t respond at all to that.

Which leaves this evening. Walking a shared pedestrian and cycle path heading to the station from work and two blokes on bikes are coming toward me. One moves but the other kept aiming at me - cycling directly at me. He thought is was hilarious. I said briefly “it’s not funny” and I was verbally abused for my efforts.

Do you know who doesn’t do this shit to me? Women. It’s always men. I’m 5’ nothing. I’m no threat. So that makes me the perfect person to fuck with; these bullies see no consequences. I’m  beyond fed up. I am quite literally minding my own business, bothering nobody and yet somehow I’m still the target of male abuse. Not to mention that every single day at least one man will cross from his path to walk in mine in order for force me to move out of the way. 

I experienced all of these interactions in the last six months or so. I just want to be left alone. Is that too much to ask?",83,1754328197.0,TwoXChromosomes,3,0.99,False

1mhjnp4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mhjnp4,Last week Batch 003 Mail Call and today Ethos Mail Call,"2 incredible mail call. Another razor added to the family. Blackland Blackbird batch 003, my first Blackbird and I was on the fence to get one since it's a pretty aggressive razor. Batch 003 was a nice opportunity to try it at a pretty low price compared to the SS. I do like a lighter razor so for me at 33g it's not far from my Vector TI. Tried it with a couple of day of growth, to my surprise it was a pretty smooth shave paired with a Nacet. One pass and pretty much every whiskers was gone, second pass and I was near a bbs. I can't use it daily, too much aggressive for my skin. Pretty happy to be part of the 100 who got one. Love the sound feedback, you can hear the razor taking down those whiskers and  it was really satisfying. 

Now the Ethos grooming essentials. Never try an ethos soaps. The Gentlemans lounge was calling my name hahaha. The smell is really accurate of the description and I love it. Nice cigar/humidor with a touch of smokiness, a touch of sweetness with the Vanilla beans and the honey Bourbon mix with a nice smell of coffee grain. The leather is pretty smooth, not to powerful. All im thinking smelling this wonderful fragrance is to smoke a good cigar and drinking a nice Whisky. I have not tried it yet but I can feel it will be a steady choice in my rotations. Hope the soap base delivers like the fragrance but from what I read, I don't have to worry about it. 

Got my hand on the last Ethos Tears of a Dragon EDP at pasteur pharmacy. I don't regret this blind buy, such a wonderful fragrance. Hope I can get my hand on the soap and aftershave one day. From the bottle I smell a touch of oud and patchouli with a nice rose/floral that bring a touch of sweetness. I will try later tonight to get the full experience.

Let me know your experiences with the Ethos products or The Batch 003 if you where one of the lucky few who got one :)

\*\* The first shave with my new Horizon adjustable from Atelier Durdan was incredible, really smooth shave. I started at 4 for the first pass and drop to 3 for the second and third. No irritation but 2 nicks, not to bad, just have to master this beast since its a hefty razor compared to my Vector. Will make a full review after a couple of shaves.\*\*

The Hario VDR-02-T, also known as the Hario V60 Plastic Coffee Dripper, is one of the latest additions to my coffee gear lineup. As a coffee enthusiast who experiments constantly with different brewing methods, the V60 Dripper intrigued me with its clear resin design and reputation for enhancing flavor extraction. After weeks of regular use, I've gathered my thoughts about this manual brewing device, testing it in various scenarios to see how it fares compared to alternatives in the market.

**Design that Marries Simplicity and Functionality**

From a visual perspective, the coffee dripper is pleasingly minimalistic. Crafted from lightweight yet sturdy AS resin, the clear finish makes the brewing process visible, which, in my opinion, adds a sense of craftsmanship to the ritual. The conical design, paired with the spiral ridges on the inside, isn’t just aesthetic—it’s meant to optimize coffee flow for better flavor extraction. Its compact dimensions (4.33""D x 4.8""W x 4.92""H) make it easy to store, even in tight kitchen spaces, and it weighs just 3 ounces, making it immensely portable for trips or even camping outings. On top of that, the material is dishwasher safe and boiling water safe, which is a big plus for someone like me who despises high-maintenance gadgets.

[Find the best price for Hario VDR-02-T on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bwhkpclj/)

**Brewing Performance and Flavor Extraction**

Let’s address the most important aspect—how well it brews coffee. The conical V60 design creates a single hole at the base, allowing the water flow speed to be manipulated via grind size and pour technique. This level of control might initially feel a tad intimidating, but once you get the hang of it, the flexibility is a game-changer. I noticed when using my usual medium roast beans and pouring at a steady pace, the coffee produced was incredibly clean and vibrant, with distinct flavor notes shining through. It works seamlessly for 1-4 servings (roughly 4.2 fl oz or 120 ml per cup), which is ideal for personal indulgence or hosting a small gathering.

**Ease of Use for Manual Brewing**

For someone transitioning into manual brewing, this dripper might have a slight learning curve, especially if you’re not yet familiar with the science of grind size, water temperature, and timing. However, I find the satisfaction of getting my technique right outweighs the initial effort. It’s a manual operation, so there’s no automation or bells and whistles—it’s raw, hands-on brewing, which I personally find both calming and rewarding.

**Highlights**

- Lightweight design for portability.  
- Dishwasher safe and easy to maintain.  
- Produces clean, flavorful coffee with no bitterness.  

**Drawbacks**

- Steeper learning curve for manual controls.  
- Requires paper filters, adding an additional expense.  

**Why This Works for Enthusiasts and Occasional Brewers**

I’d recommend this dripper to anyone passionate about controlling their brewing process and exploring coffee in its purest essence. It’s also a great starting point for those venturing into pour-over methods without an intimidating price tag or overly complex setup. However, if you’re someone who prefers quick and automated solutions, the effort required here might not align with your preferences.

**Industry Competitors**

Compared to other pour-over coffee makers like the Chemex and Kalita Wave, the Hario V60 stands out due to its sharper learning curve and finesse-demanding design. While the Chemex appeals with its larger capacity and aesthetic appeal, the V60 offers more brewing control. The Kalita Wave, on the other hand, delivers more consistent brews thanks to its flat-bottom filter design, but it falls short in the control and customization department. The Hario V60 straddles the line between simplicity and precision, making it perfect for tinkerers like myself.

**True Value**

Priced accessibly, the dripper feels like a steal considering its performance. The reusable nature of the product, coupled with its durable material, ensures that it won’t require frequent replacements. While the recurring cost of paper filters might feel slightly burdensome over time, the quality of coffee you get compensates for it. If manual brewing excites you, or you’re looking for an affordable way to level up your coffee game, this dripper is definitely worth considering.

1mhjmsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mhjmsz/spotlight_the_best_one_cup_coffee_maker_from/,Spotlight the Best One Cup Coffee Maker from Technivorm Moccamaster,"**Review of Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 Cup One**

I’ve always been extra particular about my morning coffee. It’s that little ritual that kickstarts my day and makes me semi-functional to deal with the world. Recently, I decided to give the Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 Cup One a spin, and let me just say—it’s been an interesting experience. This single-serve coffee maker promises simplicity, quality, and precision, and as someone who hates fiddling with unnecessarily complicated appliances first thing in the morning, I was intrigued.

**Design & Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed when unboxing this coffee maker was its sleek and polished silver exterior. It has this retro-yet-modern vibe, and the metal finish not only looks premium but also feels durable. The compact size (6.5” x 10.2” x 11.7”) is such a win for people with cramped countertops like mine. It fits snugly without looking bulky. The removable cup holder caught my eye too—it’s perfect if you want to alternate between different mug sizes, though I personally stick to my trusty 10-ounce mug. Handmade in the Netherlands, it has that artisanal touch, but does it perform as premium as it looks? 

**Performance & Brewing Quality**

I appreciate how the Technivorm Moccamaster Cup One focuses on doing one thing exceptionally well—brewing a single cup of coffee. It takes about four minutes to brew a full 10-ounce cup, which is ideal for someone like me who wants their coffee quickly, but still values flavor over speed. The coffee it produces is impressively rich and smooth. It’s almost like having handcrafted coffee without trekking to my local café. The coffee maker uses paper filters, and the brew-basket design steeps the coffee properly for a strong flavor punch, minus any bitter aftertaste. For its simplicity, it does punch above its weight in terms of coffee quality.

**Ease of Use**

If you’re like me and prefer appliances that don’t require a graduate degree to operate, this coffee maker is your best friend. The fully automatic operation lets you press a button and forget about it. No settings, no dials, no fuss. As someone whose brain doesn’t wake up until after the first sip of coffee, this kind of simplicity is invaluable. I also appreciate the automatic shut-off feature—it’s a lifesaver for those mornings when I’m running out the door and forget to check if the coffee maker is still humming along.

[Think Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 is discounted? Check Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b014i5owco/)

**Positives**

- Produces rich, café-quality coffee.
- Solid and compact design with a removable cup holder.
- Simple, button-operated functionality.
- Shuts off automatically after brewing.
- Backed by a 5-year warranty, showcasing confidence in durability.

**Shortcomings**

- Doesn’t accommodate larger brews if you’re feeling greedy some mornings.
- Lacks any advanced features; no programmable settings or customization options.
- Paper filters can be slightly annoying if you prefer reusable options.

**Alternative Offerings**

Of course, no product review is complete without talking about alternatives. If you’re considering simplicity over frills, other single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini come to mind. The benefit of the Technivorm coffee maker, however, is the superior coffee brewing quality and its pod-free operation, ensuring no plastic waste—a plus for environmentally-conscious users. Keurig wins in versatility with its flavored pods and options, though the quality of the brew doesn’t quite match this one. On the other hand, the Breville Bambino Plus offers an espresso machine alternative but at a much higher price point and a steeper learning curve. 

**Smart Spending**

When comparing its quality to its price, the Technivorm Moccamaster Cup One holds up pretty well. Yes, it’s an investment for a single-serve coffee maker, but considering the longevity (hello, 5-year warranty!) and the premium coffee it gives you daily, it seems like a smart purchase for minimalist coffee lovers who just demand great flavor. Cheaper machines might seem tempting, but you’ll often trade off coffee quality or hassle-free operation.

Actions,"The neon AUDITION HERE! sign buzzed like a dying wasp as Ethan Cole slumped at The Velvet Curtain’s bar. His fifth whiskey tasted of gasoline and regret. That’s when the man appeared—too tall, his suit clinging like wet newsprint, pupils swallowing the dim light.  

“What if I told you,” the man murmured, tracing the rim of Ethan’s glass, “you could become every role? No more pretending.” His grin widened. “Though… it’ll split you. A piece left behind each time.”

“Split me?” Ethan laughed, the whiskey hot in his throat. “Buddy, there’s nothin’ left to split.”

The man slid a business card across the sticky table—blank except for a symbol like a fractured mask. “Sleep on it.”

The voicemail arrived at 3:03 a.m., warped and guttural: “Danny’s yours.”

At the Midnight Drifter table read, Ethan’s tongue stuck to his palate. Then came the click—a clock rewinding. His posture sagged into Danny’s lazy slouch. “Ain’t no mountain high enough, darlin’,” he drawled, winking with borrowed charm. The director shuddered. “Christ, it’s like you’re possessed.”  

But driving home, Ethan’s GPS flickerd Amarillo, TX instead of LA. His studio smelled of hay and honeysuckle. Polaroids he’d never taken littered the floor: a raven-haired girl (Lacey?) laughing on a Ferris wheel, her face blurring in each frame.  

“Method acting?” His agent recoiled as Ethan twirled a lock of invisible hair—Danny’s nervous habit.  

The premiere audience sobbed. Strangers clutched him, whispering, “You made me remember Danny. My Danny.” That night, scripts flooded his inbox. One hummed Jack Harper, detective haunted by a girl who whispers through walls.  

He accepted.  

The detective seeped in slowly, poisonously.  

Ethan’s apartment chilled, breath frosting in July. Static pooled in corners. He woke to phantom cigarette burns on his fingers and a trench coat materializing in his closet, pockets stuffed with case notes: Ruby, 14. Last seen near Blackwater Creek. They never found her shoes.

On set, his voice dropped to Jack’s graveled rasp. “She’s in the walls,” he hissed between takes, staring at cracks in the soundstage. Crew members crossed themselves. The director’s coffee cup cracked, liquid inside black and squirming.  

The sharp-suited man appeared during a night shoot, silhouetted against fake moonlight. “Roles don’t end when cameras stop,” he said, lips unmoving. Ethan’s shadow stretched toward him, clawed and jagged.  

Home offered no sanctuary. Danny’s cowboy boots stood by the door, caked with red clay. Jack’s case files papered the walls, Ruby’s face peering from every photo, mouth widening incrementally. Ethan’s own reflection faded—a smudged fingerprint where his face should be. His face glitched—Danny’s sunburn, Jack’s stubble, his own terrified eyes.

Ethan smashed the mirror. Shards rained down, each fragment a flickering scene: himself as a soap opera villain, a weeping clown, a warped thing with too many faces.  

He woke on the floor, unharmed. The apartment stank of wet earth and copper. A new Polaroid lay amid the glass: Ethan standing between Danny and Jack in a bone-white hallway, their hands fused.

It’s not often I start ogling a kitchen appliance, but the sleek brushed stainless steel combined with that LCD display gave me some serious ""this looks fancy"" vibes. It’s stout yet stylish, fitting comfortably on my counter without stealing too much real estate. The dropdown door is smooth to operate, and those included accessories—a broiling rack, pizza pan, and baking pan—fit right inside the 18.5 x 15.7 x 11.1-inch interior. There’s even a non-stick coating, which, if you’ve ever spent 20 minutes chiseling burnt cheese off your toaster oven, feels like a godsend.

**Functionality and Cooking Performance**

Using this oven is easy thanks to its button control interface complemented by the aforementioned LCD display. Whether I was toasting bread, roasting chicken, or reheating leftovers, the nine cooking functions felt like tiny cheat codes for the kitchen. The Smart Oven is powered by Breville’s much-hyped Element iQ System, which uses five quartz heating elements plus some clever algorithms to direct heat exactly where it’s needed. And the 1800-watt preheat? Oh, it's fast. Stupidly fast. I’m talking about not-enough-time-to-tweet-about-it fast.

**Cooking Capacity**

This machine isn’t just for sandwiches and bagels, though it’ll handle six slices with ease. It has capacity for a 13-inch pizza or a six-cup muffin tray (yes, I tried both). For solo diners or big family gatherings, the adjustable racks let you shuffle things around for maximum efficiency. However, keep in mind the size—while it’s roomy for a countertop unit, it’s not going to replace a traditional oven if you’re trying to cook for an army. Let’s just say that Thanksgiving turkey stayed in the big oven.

**Perks**

- Stellar cooking precision with Element iQ System.
- Nine cooking functions mean you can switch from making cookies to roasting veggies in seconds without breaking a sweat.
- Non-stick interior – because who has time to scrub for an hour?
- Quick, even heating, reducing cooking times by up to 30 percent.
- Compact size but generous interior storage space.

**Limitations**

- Makes an audible fan sound during operation—not coffee-grinder loud, but noticeable.
- You’ll need to get used to switching out accessories (they're not universal across all settings).
- At 18.7 pounds, don’t expect to casually hoist this around the kitchen.
- For its features and build quality, it’s on the pricier side among countertop ovens.

**Competing Products**

Put this Smart Oven against other countertop ovens like models from Cuisinart or Panasonic, and you'll notice a few differences. The Breville feels sturdier, with higher build quality and a real edge in cooking innovation (thanks, Element iQ). Where the Cuisinart excels though is in accessories and slightly quieter operation. Panasonic's FlashXpress trades versatility for faster toast cycles, but it’s much smaller. If you want a tech-forward appliance that can juggle pizzas, roasts, and bagels all day, the Breville is the better choice. However, if you're strictly toasting or have limited counter space, the competition might win out in your kitchen.

**Price Performance**

Without diving into exact dollar amounts, it’s fair to say the Breville Smart Oven sits on the premium end of the spectrum. But then again, you get what you pay for. The sheer adaptability, quality of materials, and cooking results make it hard not to justify the investment. While it might feel extravagant for someone who only needs to heat occasional leftovers, regular chefs will easily see the value.

Usually when I take the Cascades train, I hang out in the cafe car the whole time because I love the vibe - bigger windows for views, the booths, and it’s often quieter. Plus access to food and coffee of course.

I’ve never taken the Pacific Surfliner but I’ll be taking it on a weekday late morning from San Diego to LA, then on a weekday afternoon from LA back to SD. I’ve seen some people say the extra $20 for business class is worth it because you’re guaranteed a seat and you get free snacks/drinks. 

So is the vibe of the cafe car on the Surfliner the same as it is on Cascades? If I’m going to spend the whole time in the cafe car I don’t see the point of upgrading to business class. But if the business car is typically quiet and getting a window seat is no problem, then I’d probably opt for that.

Also, what complimentary snacks and drinks do you get in business class? Is coffee included, and do you get free refills? Thanks in advance!

I'm basically recreating this smokey iced Cortdo posted by MorganDrinksCoffee, but with hojicha powder instead of espresso. I freestyled this based on her video and didn't measure anything

Whole milk cold brewed with lapsang souchong for an hour + salted brown sugar bourbon vanilla syrup + Hojicha shot + a single drop of sesame oil.

The end result was soooo good and gets very close to a dark roast coffee tbh. It hits so many notes: nutty, smokey, roasted, dark chocolate, Caramel etc. But the lapsang does so much lifting to intensify everything and carry it through the milk. It has that punch in your mouth boldness that I struggle to get in hojicha alone, and the after taste lingers forever. And the sesame oil carries the aroma and adds just enough without over powering anything. This lapsang is a bit too much on the smoke, but one with a bit less smoke and more fruityness could mimic a lighter roast coffee, probably.

It was my first time seeing a café pull espresso shots with a light roast, and the body and aroma just blew me away. I’d heard that it’s tough to make espresso with light roasts, but this was the first time I’d actually seen a place do it—and nail it!

I asked the barista for their recipe, and they told me they pull it at 198°F with a 1:2 ratio. Of course, they were using a La Marzocco and a commercial grinder, but it made me want to try recreating it at home with my Cafelat Robot. So I bought some beans and gave it a shot at home, but honestly, my results were nowhere close. I even preheated everything and tried a long pre-infusion (like 45 seconds), but still couldn’t get it right.

Honestly, that coffee was so good, I’m tempted to go back to Traverse City just to have it again! There’s nowhere near me that does espresso with light roasts, so I’m kind of obsessed now.

Oh, and for reference—I have an Apollo Bplus grinder (conical burr) and a Linlong S64 (flat burr) at home. This was also my first time realizing just how tough it is to hand grind light roast beans.

Please help me out by providing the story link,"Three days before my wedding, I found thousands of naked photos of another woman on my fiancé's MacBook.  
Without hesitation, I booked a flight for our wedding day, leaving him to face the guests alone.  
The night I landed in Paris, I was drowning my sorrows at the hotel bar when I spotted this absolutely gorgeous guy. One perfect distraction. Just what I needed.  
After a night of passion, next morning, I slapped a grand on his chest: ""Thanks for the ride, but you could use some practice."" Then I walked out like a queen.  
But karma's a bitch. When I walked into my new office the following day, I caught snippets of office gossip: ""Have you heard? We're getting a new CEO today...""  
I looked up from my coffee and nearly choked. Standing there in a killer Armani suit was last night's hookup.  
""Morning, everyone. Ryan Sterling,"" he says, scanning the room until his eyes find mine.  
""Your new boss.""  
Shit. I'm absolutely fucked.  
Chapter 1  
  
  
""Mr. Wilson, is that overseas branch position you mentioned last time still available? I've made up my mind, I want to go.""  
  
  
Hearing that I agreed to the overseas training, my boss's voice was full of relief.  
  
  
""Alright, I'll submit your information right away. But I heard you're getting married soon...""  
  
  
""It's fine, the wedding's off. Don't worry about it.""  
  
  
My voice had a slight tremor.  
  
  
To prevent him from noticing, I hung up the phone immediately after speaking.  
  
  
My eyes were fixed on the thousands of photos of a girl on Marcus White's computer, lost in thought.  
  
  
After graduation, we joined the same company, working in different departments.  
  
  
Tonight he went to attend a bachelor party thrown by his friends, with his phone turned off.  
  
  
His manager couldn't reach him but urgently needed a proposal, so the call came to me.  
  
  
That's why I turned on his computer for the first time, only to discover these photos.  
  
  
In an instant, eight years of memories flooded my mind.  
  
  
In all our time together, he never had any photos of me on his phone, nor did he keep any records of our relationship.  
  
  
No matter how much I cried or complained, he always said that since we saw each other every day, there was no need for mementos.  
  
  
It wasn't until this moment that I understood it wasn't unnecessary; I just wasn't necessary to him.  
  
  
For eight years, I made every excuse for his indifference.  
  
  
My stubborn behavior now seemed like a joke.  
  
  
The words his friend accidentally let slip when he learned about our wedding suddenly echoed in my ears:  
  
  
""Wow, I thought you were going to stay single forever because of Annie Hall! You're really getting married? You're not just being impulsive, are you?""  
  
  
At the time, I didn't notice Marcus's awkward expression, and I confidently patted my chest, saying:  
  
  
""We're doing it for love!""  
  
  
Now I understand why he asked that question, and I no longer have the confidence to say those words.  
  
  
I took a few deep breaths and closed the computer.  
  
  
I opened my phone, wanting to text Marcus about breaking up, but saw that he hadn't even replied to my message about choosing a wedding dress from a day ago.  
  
  
I opened his WhatsApp Moments, seeing a blank black background without any updates.  
  
  
Only a single word under his profile picture.  
  
  
\[Waiting.\]  
  
  
I pulled my lips into a bitter smile, collapsing powerlessly onto the sofa.  
  
  
Before, I didn't know he was hiding someone else in his heart; I just thought he was introverted and not good at expressing himself.  
  
  
Now that I think about it, I was naive to the point of ridicule.  
  
  
I had asked him many times about his WhatsApp bio, but he never answered.  
  
  
At this moment, I finally knew the answer.  
  
  
There were only three days left until our simple wedding. I had set the countdown as my phone's dynamic wallpaper to remind myself daily.  
  
  
Looking at the numbers ticking away on the screen, I rubbed my sore eyes, suppressing the overwhelming fatigue.  
  
  
Just as I was about to book the ticket, Marcus's friend called me.  
  
  
""Tessa, Marcus is drunk. Can you come and take him home? I'll send you the address.""  
  
  
Through the receiver, I faintly heard Marcus's familiar voice calling ""Annie!""  
  
  
My heart was unexpectedly gripped.  
  
  
The caller quickly covered the phone and hung up.  
  
  
I shook my head to clear away emotions I shouldn't have, changed my clothes, and walked to the entrance. Only then did I see that Marcus's half of the couple's keychain I had carefully chosen was carelessly thrown on the cabinet.  
  
  
This was a custom design I had ordered from an original store based on our experiences.  
  
  
He said it was too childish and never wore it.  
  
  
After some thought, I picked up the keychain and threw it in the trash.  
  
  
Looking up, I caught sight of the unopened couple's mugs under the coffee table.  
  
  
They seemed to be silently mocking my one-sided play.  
  
  
A wave of powerless frustration welled up, and I picked up the trash can and threw all the couple items into a bag.  
  
  
After disposing of the garbage, I took a taxi to the address his friend had sent.  
  
  
As I reached the door of the private room, I heard playful questions from inside.  
  
  
""Annie, why did you come back today? You didn't regret it after hearing that our Marcus is getting married, did you?""  
  
  
I took a deep breath, pulled my lips into a smile, and pushed the door open to enter.  
  
  
The laughter and chatter inside stopped instantly, and everyone's faces were awkward.  
  
  
The man who was supposed to marry me in three days was lying in a woman's arms, his face full of tender affection.  
  
  
That woman's face, I had just seen countless times on his computer.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Marcus's friend didn't expect me to arrive so quickly and hurriedly tried to pull him away from Annie.  
  
  
Unfortunately, Marcus seemed to have drunk quite a bit and remained completely unmoving.  
  
  
He muttered unclearly, ""Get lost! Don't touch me!""  
  
  
This was the first time I had seen him this drunk.  
  
  
His friend leaned close to his ear and said, ""Tessa is here to pick you up! Wake up! You're about to get married...""  
  
  
The others, seeing the situation, also came forward to help. It took a great effort to finally pry Marcus's hand away from Annie.  
  
  
His body fell heavily onto the sofa, his face flushed red.  
  
  
His friend finally let out a sigh of relief and introduced me.  
  
  
""This is our high school classmate Annie. She went abroad in her sophomore year and just came back today. She happened to join our gathering. Marcus drank too much, don't overthink it...""  
  
  
If it were before, I might have lost control and asked them right there.  
  
  
Knowing that Marcus and I were about to get married, why did they let Annie come? Why didn't they stop it?  
  
  
But now I just smiled indifferently.  
  
  
Annie looked at me with a hint of playful curiosity in her eyes.  
  
  
Until Marcus's friend started to introduce my identity.  
  
  
When he said the words ""fiancée,"" Marcus, who had been silent on the sofa for a while, angrily spoke up:  
  
  
""She's a friend!""  
  
  
In that instant, my hand tightened under my sleeve.  
  
  
My palm stung from my nails digging into it, trembling slightly.  
  
  
The people around changed their expressions, looking at me with difficulty in their eyes.  
  
  
This wasn't the first time Marcus didn't want to acknowledge my identity.  
  
  
Earlier, when he refused to post on social media, refused to appear with me at the company, and refused to invite both families' elders and friends to the wedding, I had already guessed our fate.  
  
  
I was just unwilling to accept it, wanting to bet on our eight years of feelings one last time.  
  
  
But I still lost.  
  
  
I still maintained a smile, nodding to Annie.  
  
  
""Hello, I'm Marcus's friend Tessa. You look even better than in the photos.""  
  
  
After I finished speaking, the room fell into complete silence.  
  
  
Everyone looked at each other with various expressions.  
  
  
Annie smiled nonchalantly and reached for the fruit platter on the table.  
  
  
However, Marcus, who had just fallen down, suddenly sat up straight again.  
  
  
""Annie, you're allergic to mangoes, you can't eat that!""  
  
  
Annie's outstretched hand paused in mid-air, looking at his serious expression with amusement.  
  
  
She said softly, ""How are you still the same as ten years ago, silly? This is watermelon. You're drunk.""  
  
  
At that moment, something seemed to explode in my mind.  
  
  
The fragments pierced my heart, leaving it bloody and torn.  
  
  
So it wasn't that he couldn't remember, he just didn't care about me.  
  
  
For eight years, I had reminded him countless times that I was allergic to seafood, but his first choice for dates was always seafood restaurants.  
  
  
I went from being angry at first, to compromising later, and even deceiving myself.  
  
  
I told myself he was just too tired from work, his mind couldn't hold anything else.  
  
  
But today, reality once again slapped me awake.  
  
  
Every detail was revealing the fact that he didn't love me.  
  
  
I expressionlessly helped him up from the sofa. As we were going downstairs to get a taxi, Annie chased after us.  
  
  
Her gentle eyes smiled warmly at Marcus's face.  
  
  
She carefully instructed me:  
  
  
""Marcus can't hold his liquor well, and he's allergic to the ingredients in hangover medicine. When you get home, make him a cup of honey water, but the water temperature can't exceed 60 degrees. He'll be fine soon, otherwise he'll have a headache when he wakes up in the morning.""  
  
  
Marcus had never told me any of these things.  
  
  
I bit my lip and didn't say anything, turning to get into the car.  
  
  
But she called out to me again.  
  
  
""Oh, why don't I add you as a contact? If he feels unwell tonight, you can ask me.""  
  
  
""Marcus doesn't sleep well after drinking. You'll need to keep an eye on him all night. If he kicks off the blanket, cover him immediately, otherwise he'll definitely have a fever tomorrow.""  
  
  
My nails were digging so hard into my palms they almost drew blood. My eyelashes trembled uncontrollably.  
  
  
I stared at her innocent eyes for a while, and finally nodded.  
  
  
We added each other as friends, and that's when I discovered her WhatsApp Moments background was actually a photo with Marcus.  
  
  
In the photo, the two of them from ten years ago looked young and naive, their eyes determined, fingers tightly intertwined.  
  
  
As the car door closed, tears silently slid down my cheeks.  
  
  
I had only heard others talk about the power of a first love before, and I had scoffed at it.  
  
  
I believed that persisting with true love would always be reciprocated.  
  
  
But at this moment, my belief wavered.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
On the way, Marcus's phone vibrated several times. They were all messages from Annie asking if he had gotten home safely.  
  
  
I unlocked the screen, originally intending to politely reply.  
  
  
But then I saw his chat history with his friend.  
  
  
\[This fake wedding is my last chance. If she still doesn't come back, I'll really have to give up.\]  
  
  
\[Post the news about my wedding in the class group chat, but don't say much to others.\]  
  
  
My finger froze on the screen, and I abruptly closed the phone.  
  
  
But I couldn't help my breathing becoming rapid.  
  
  
It felt like no matter how much I tried to open my mouth, oxygen couldn't enter my lungs.  
  
  
Tears flowed more freely and violently along the corners of my eyes.  
  
  
No wonder he suddenly proposed to me three days ago.  
  
  
No ring, no marital home, no bride price.  
  
  
Just one sentence: Don't tell our families.  
  
  
I thought he felt guilty for not giving me enough ceremony, thought my dedication had finally moved him.  
  
  
But I never imagined that the wedding I had been looking forward to for eight years was just his bargaining chip to stimulate Annie to return to the country.  
  
  
The last bit of attachment I had for this relationship in my heart was finally completely exhausted.  
  
  
I could only keep comforting myself.  
  
  
Since I had already decided to leave, their affairs no longer had anything to do with me.  
  
  
After we got home, Marcus had sobered up a bit. He went straight to the bathroom to wash up.  
  
  
I prepared honey water for him as Annie had instructed.  
  
  
For these last three days, I didn't want to leave any regrets for this relationship.  
  
  
I had just sat down on the sofa when my boss called.  
  
  
He talked about handing over my work before leaving.  
  
  
As the call ended, Marcus's irritated voice suddenly rang out:  
  
  
""Leaving? Where are you going?""  
  
  
He was wiping his wet hair with one hand, his face expressionless as he questioned me.  
  
  
I handed him the honey water and said calmly:  
  
  
""It's nothing, just going on a business trip.""  
  
  
He couldn't be bothered to think more about it, or perhaps he simply didn't care about anything concerning me.  
  
  
He took the cup and was about to drink when he noticed the honey added to it.  
  
  
His brows immediately furrowed.  
  
  
He angrily questioned me:  
  
  
""Who taught you this?""  
  
  
""Don't just randomly look things up on the internet. Things on the internet aren't suitable for everyone!""  
  
  
He slammed the cup heavily on the table and turned back to the bedroom.  
  
  
A bitter smile involuntarily spread across my face.  
  
  
Sure enough, the methods of a first love weren't something I could imitate.  
  
  
The next day was originally scheduled for our wedding photo shoot.  
  
  
Marcus woke up acting as if nothing had happened, his attitude towards me as cold as ever.  
  
  
Having seen his tenderness towards Annie, I would never again think this was just his nature.  
  
  
After finishing breakfast and preparing to leave, he looked at his phone.  
  
  
Suddenly he said, ""Let's not take the wedding photos in the park. Let's go to the school instead. I saw online that it's trendy lately.""  
  
  
My hand paused as I was clearing the dishes.  
  
  
""Mm, whatever you say. It's up to you.""  
  
  
I knew why he suddenly changed his mind.  
  
  
Because Annie had posted on her Moments about visiting their school this morning.  
  
  
I didn't expose his childish lie to his face. I just didn't want to embarrass myself as the relationship was coming to an end.  
  
  
With only a day and a half left before I left the country, I wanted to leave some dignity for both of us.  
  
  
Before leaving, I had already guessed what would happen today, so I deliberately chose a wedding dress that was easy to walk in.  
  
  
The photographer took us to the playground. Marcus looked around for a while, and finally saw a familiar figure in the corner under the trees.  
  
  
Without saying a word to me, he immediately turned and went to find Annie.  
  
  
I smiled awkwardly at the confused photographer.  
  
  
""Sorry for wasting your trip. Let's end it here today. We'll pay you in full.""

1mhj84t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1mhj84t/confusion/,confusion,"I'm struggling a lot at the moment with figuring out how to move forward from my ex. I know NC is the only way forward. We broke up in January for good (after being on and off for a while and a year of dating). I was actually entirely fine about it because he was deeply attached to me and took up a lot of emotional space in the aftermath of our breakup; he felt that I'd completely detached myself and was avoidant and absent and made him feel bad about himself. That said, we spoke a great deal in the aftermath of our breakup. He was incredibly distressed, asking me if I was dating anyone, generally unable to move on.

  
Cut to June, I bumped into him at a party and he told me he was seeing someone. At first I was really happy for him and texted him the next day to tell him as such and that I hoped we could be friends. He never responded to that and it kind of sent me down a spiral. Since June, I've been reaching out to him in the hopes of reaching a sense of closure since I think I'm having a delayed reaction to our breakup because of how emotionally detached I was at the time. He's being totally cold and not engaging with me--I asked if he could mail my belongings back and he didn't respond. We talked briefly about meeting up for coffee to discuss but he renegged because he thought I would trigger him.

Obviously he has a girlfriend now so he's not in need of me anymore, but I feel pretty awful about the amount of times I engaged with him following our breakup when he was in so much distress, and now being completely ignored by him feels pretty terrible.

I know I need to stop reaching out and just move on but I can't help but feel so hurt and abandoned. I'm struggling to do anything but think of him and the pain seems to be relentless at this point. He also blocked me (we were still following each other) on basically every platform--I can get the hint, but I'm also wondering why it's so aggressive now that he's moved on. I'm just sad that he won't help me in the way I think I helped him when he was suffering so deeply. 

Any words of wisdom would be appreciated <3 ",1,1754327201.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False
1mhj7t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_that_horror_girly/comments/1mhj7t0/something_keeps_showing_up_at_my_lake/,Something keeps showing up at my lake,"I just bought my own house. Nothing big just a small house with a nice view of the lake right by my house. Only about 5 acers but pretty peaceful. But it felt huge. I used to live with my grandma that had a small, crammed house with photos of creepy dogs all around. It was peaceful. quiet, to quiet.

I moved in in early spring when the nights still had the cold wind that made you feel at home. I loved sitting outside. Sipping coffee relaxing looking at the lake. I just sat with my dog, Rowdy. Listening to the bugs looking at the slow ripples in the water. I'd get home from long shifts and sit outside for hours.

About a week in, I noticed something—or someone—across the lake. I thought it was maybe a fisherman or just a hiker passing through. But it was like... too still. Tall. Slouched. Arms too long. Just watching.

I tried filming it. My phone froze. Not like lag—like full-on black screen. Had to hard restart it.

And when I looked back up? Gone.

Every couple days, I’d find things.

* Smooth, wet stones on my porch. Perfectly placed. Never there in the morning—only overnight.
* A dead crow with its beak twisted sideways. No blood. Just... posed.
* Symbols scratched into the window glass. Looked like some weird language or runes. I know it wasn’t there before.

Even my dog, Rowdy—he’s normally chill—started growling at night. Around 2:30 a.m., like clockwork, he’d pace along the back wall and stare toward the lake.

One night, I swear the lake looked deeper. Like the shoreline had pulled back. I noticed some kinda slime or residue along the dirt.

I watched from inside, phone in hand. There was something crouched near the edge. Like a body, but… wrong.

Not crawling. Not walking. Twitching toward me.

And then it stood up. Limbs bent out like a broken doll. Head tilted at this unnatural angle, like it was *listening*. There was no wind, no bugs. Just that sound—wet snapping. Like bones breaking underwater.

I didn’t sleep that night.

TikTok had a few posts claiming weird sightings in the woods. But they all got deleted.

I tried commenting on one. My account got locked.

I decided to take a walk one afternoon—sun out, Rowdy with me. Thought maybe being outside during the day would feel less creepy.

Deep past the tree line, I saw it.

A cabin.

Old, falling apart, moss thick as blankets. Not on any map. I’ve lived here a few months—I would’ve noticed it.

Inside?

* Walls with carvings.
* Old clothes. Still warm.
* A mirror. Cracked. My reflection wasn’t alone.

I grabbed Rowdy and ran. Whole walk back, I felt like I was being watched from *under* the ground.

It doesn’t speak. Doesn’t mimic. It just moves.

It’s showing up more often now. At first, only at the lake.

Then the edge of my woods.

Then the driveway.

Now?

It’s outside my window.

It doesn’t want attention. It wants *presence*. It wants you to feel it even when you’re not looking.

Rowdy’s gone now.

Disappeared from the porch. No noise. No trace.

All I found was a stone on my porch.

1mhj3vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mhj3vr/the_next_right_thing/,The next right thing.,"Breaking up is not at all what either of us wanted. It happened because it had to.. for now, at least. I still think of him as my partner. As far as I can tell, he still thinks of me as his. 14 more days until I can see him again. I hope. I never believed in soulmates until I met him. I knew something was there the first time he spoke to me. In a bar, of course. Foreshadowing, maybe? Some sick universal prank. Maybe next time, if there is a next time, we can kick things off differently. Somewhere beautiful. 

It is hard to do anything at all without him. I’m on vacation with family now, and all I can really do is lay here and stare out the cabin window. I miss him. I’m angry with how it ended, how it got to that point, but it needed to happen. 

It was always going to happen that way. Sometimes fate can be real.. the paths we follow are always the paths that we would have followed. He was always going to drink himself in to a psychotic episode, trying desperately to escape reality instead of facing it and fighting for his life. I was always going to fall in love with someone who felt often like abandonment and neglect, something so familiar to me. Something that felt like home, sad as that sounds. We both had troubled childhoods. 

I keep reminding myself that if he were here with me now, he would be drunk. And unfortunately it is the truth. And who knows how the night would go. He wasn’t always hands-on mean when he was drunk, but I was always watching my back and trying to choose my words wisely. He could switch in an instant, and would find little reasons to villainize my words and actions.. like everything about me was an attack. That’s no way to live. As badly as I want him here, as much as I miss him: he would be drunk right now, or anxious for his next shot. 

I need to become a different person. Independent. Confident with myself, by myself. I have to stop neglecting and abandoning myself in favor of taking care of others. 

He needs to find joy, stop using escapism as a cure for his pain, learn to trust others, and stay sober for the rest of his hopefully long and beautiful life. 

If these things cannot happen then the two of us are incompatible as partners, plain and simple. With each other, or with anyone who may come after. That is just the truth of it. I need to remember that. I need to learn to live life by myself, and find little pieces of sunshine in each moment. 

It’s just so hard.. I was doing fine, I was starting to think of my life as my own. Still capable of being in a partnership, but really I was beginning to learn to be my own person. It hurt and fucking sucked but I was getting there, slowly. No contact was broken, and now I’m just suffering again. Just thinking of him. Not thinking of myself and my own life anymore, I’m just spending every moment thinking about how he is not here with me. 

He would be drunk if he was here, and I’d be annoyed about it but wouldn’t say anything, and then it would be a whole thing. 

This had to happen. 

I need to focus on art and independence. I need to get out of this bed and stop staring out the cabin window. There is a whole world around me. I’m literally sitting in my own personal tiny cabin in the middle of the woods, my art supplies on the table and coffee to be made. What the hell is wrong with me? I need to get out of this bed and stop wallowing in this misery. 

We can do that together, in tandem, hundreds of miles apart. This is a good thing. I can get better without him here. He can get better without me there. We can overcome this together, separately. I blocked him here on Reddit, but just in case:

I love you, and we can do this. Together but separate. I’m okay, and you’re okay. We both have a lot of hell to climb through. I’m here under the same sun, the same sky, climbing up towards happiness just like you are. Just in different ways. We are going to come out the other side of this as stable, healthier people. 

In his recent words: I need to do “the next right thing.”

I think right now that means going out to find cool rocks. ",0,1754326952.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.5,False

Just wanted to share my story here in case it resonates with anyone: I’m a 29 year old male. I used to smoke for like 12 years, but switched to nicotine pouches about a year ago. I’ve been using about one can a day (8mg) consistently, sometimes more, especially on days I drank alcohol. It felt like a much cleaner habit than smoking.

.About a month ago, I had a weird episode during a work meeting, my heart suddenly started racing. I brushed it off. But then, while on holiday in Italy, after a cup of coffee and walking in the heat, I had a lot of heart palpitations. Weird bursts. Lasted about 10 seconds. Never had that before. My heart was pounding uncontrollably for about 10 seconds, then it stopped. After a minute of 5 I thought I was going to faint (I didn't but had to focus/keep talking in order not to). Called an ambulance, ran tests ECG, bloods, chest X-ray everything normal. After this I quit Zyn immediately and bought some nicotine patches.

Fast forward a few days, and I had a second episode while sitting at a lake, again after caffeine and sun exposure. This time way milder palpitations, but same pressure on the chest, shortness of breath, and an awful sense of “something’s wrong.” Again, all tests were normal. Later I thought this one could be a panic attack / a mix of both.

When I returned to my home country I went to the cardiologist and they gave me a 48 hour holter. Everything was fine. Still no clear diagnosis. After the holter I got like 2/3 more episodes: not really heart palpitations but chest pressure, shortness of breath, feeling my heart pound, etc etc. They feel like panic attacks.

Today I went for a run for the first time in a while. After like 2km I got heart palpitations again. Also felt really light in the head / like I was about to faint. When does this shit stop? I'm really fucking scared. I live a very active live and I'm afraid I threw it away because of these nicotine pouches. Will call the cardiologist again tomorrow so see what I can do.

If anyone here has had similar experiences, I’d love to hear how long it took to feel better after quitting, and whether your symptoms were ever fully explained. Did your heart go back to normal? What shall I do?",3,1754326899.0,QuittingZyn,3,1.0,False

I'm Vietnamese, husband is American. Not a lot of thing in common from our childhood but Lego has been one of the rare thing we both got to experience. As soon as we start having disposable income, we start buying modular buildings and create a rather extensive collection (Millennium Falcon is husband's pride and joy 😁).

During COVID we decided to relocate to Vietnam and have build a life here. But corporate life gets frustrated and late last year, we decided it's time for one of us to work on sth for ourselves. We have always think Lego is not just a great toy but also a great tool to build creativity and critical thinking. The act of building Lego (and playing with it together) is also a great opportunity for people, especially kids, to socialize. It takes a few iteration and we got a lot of inspiration from around the world (special call out to The Brickery, hearing them close is a gut punch)

In the end, our business model resemble a Kid playzone with a few alteration:

* Location consist of 4 floors (\~240 sqm or \~2500 sqft in total): 2 Cafe floors (including our counters), a Lego centric floor which has a workshop room & a carpeted kid lounge, a terrace which we are setting up to be a date night type of space
* We sell Brick Pass for \~USD 8 which gives you full day access to our Lego collection (\~100 sets for now, we will keep adding to it), join any workshop activities, and if you are a kid (or have a kid with you) access to kid lounge
* You can order drinks (juice, tea, coffee) or snack (only a few pastry for now but we are working to add to it)

Our name ""CLICK CLACK"" is just the sound that comes to my mind whenever I run my hand through a bunch of Lego or putting 2 bricks together. It sounds fun so we go with it.

It's been a long journey but finally the cafe launch early July and we just have our first amazing month. I'll say 80% of our guests are family with children <13 yrs. However, we are seeing more of the adult only groups coming in. Because we purposely hire staff to play with and help kids with building, parents can also get some relax time (or working elsewhere in the cafe). The financial side haven't work out yet but thing seems promising that at least we can begin to cover the operating cost in a few months.

Compare to the income in Vietnam, the cost of a Lego set is significant so it's rare for kid to have access to multiple set. As a kid, I have a second hand, generic house building brick with doors and windows that now I can't find the serial number for. It's the only toy that I have consistently play with for over a decade. I'm just happy that we are giving this opportunities to more kid to have access to Lego.

My new morning routine is this, stay in bed until I have to get up to get ready, no more ""sit and enjoy my coffee"" I can do that on my way to work.  And if I have no cigs in my car, then I won't get a pack on my way to work.

Is there some secret I’m missing?

And sometimes I look at people posting stuff like “I just made $7,495 passive income this week!” and I’m like, where do I sign up?! I even went down this rabbit hole at https://goodnovel.org/ just to distract myself—trust me, amazing stories to blur the reality of NOT earning that easy cash.

Does earning money have to be boring? Is there a hidden map, or are there just a ton of weird choices and luck and non-stop hustle? Are side hustles the answer? Is that even sustainable? Why does passive income look SO alluring and SO impossible all at once?

Here are the thoughts spinning in my head:

- When people say “work smart, not hard”… what if I don’t know what SMART looks like?  
- Investing seems cool until you remember you actually need money to invest in the FIRST PLACE.  
- Why does everyone on YouTube look 23 and say they’re “financially free” already? Is there a time machine I missed?  
- The internet makes “earning money” look like you’re one click away from your dream but, uh, WHICH click?  
- I sometimes get stuck reading lists of “top 53 ways to make $1000 extra” and end up watching cat videos instead. Is this self-sabotage or is it just accidental genius?

Honestly, don’t get me wrong—I love the idea of earning money. Especially from something I enjoy. But there’s this pressure to do something unique, to do everything FAST, or else it feels like you’re left behind in a cloud of luxury cars and vacation pics on social.

Then there’s the part of my brain that gets way too hyped up every time I think I’ve found “the one” method.

And suddenly my phone’s open, I’ve got 30 tabs, and I’m on https://goodnovel.org/ again, distracting myself because hey, at least fictional characters seem to get rich quick. Why not me?

So seriously, how do YOU earn money? Is there some mental switch you flipped, or did you just grind until you struck gold? 

Have you ever tried something totally out there and had it work? Or did you keep bouncing around between ideas, confused (ME), until one finally stuck?

I’m so beyond curious and kind of desperate for inspo.

Share your tips, rants, or even your “I failed miserably but at least I tried” stories. Or just DM me a clear path, I swear I’ll trade you a 5 minute brain break at https://goodnovel.org/ for the secret!

Because if I can find my perfect “earn money” formula, maybe I’ll be the one showing off my luxury gifts next… Or at least buying extra coffee.",1,1754326665.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

the first job is a coffee shop and i really want to work there, i prefer it over the other job which is a kids clothing store. if i get hired at the coffee shop, do i still go to the other interview anyway? if i dont, am i supposed to contact them and tell them i wont be able to make it? also, do i tell the coffee shop im interviewing for multiple jobs?

 also, ive heard that they often ask if there are any questions at the end of the interview, is that an inappropriate time to ask about their stance on hair dye and piercings? should i ask at all? i was thinking of dyeing my hair red soon

1mhiupm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mhiupm,"“Unforgettable” Wine Pairing at SingleThread, Healdsburg","Had dinner at SingleThread this weekend and decided to splurge on their “unforgettable” wine pairing (most expensive of the three tiers they offer). Rotates every day and is based on limited bottles the somms pick out from their cellar. 

- 2009 Dom Perignon Rose: Offered as a welcome drink when we sat down and to accompany first course which was a myriad of fun small bites (can’t remember all of them). Notes of strawberry and blood orange, long finish. Great way to start the meal 

- 2023 Keller Kirchspiel: When I saw the somm walking over with the amber labeled Riesling bottle I was hoping it would be the G-Max, but Kirchspiel was still excellent. Citrus blossom, white peach, very mineral forward. None of the typical jet fuel on the nose. Paired with a turnip course with caviar

- Sake side-by-side: Heiwa Muryozan 30 and IWA 5. Muryozan was my preferred of the two. Melon lychee notes and very silky texture. Generally not a big sake drinker but it was super smooth. The IWA 5 by contrast reminded me of a watered down pina colada. Both paired with a tuna and cucumber moriawase

- Alvina Pernot Corton-Charlemagne 2023. Plenty of stone fruit in this one with a little undercurrent of salinity throughout. Maybe my favorite white of the evening. Paired with Hokkaido scallop. 

- Georges Vernay Coteau de Vernon Condrieu 2022. White flowers and almonds throughout, very perfumed. Long dry finish. Paired with Black cod Fukkura-San 

- Robert Groffier Bonnes Mares Grand Cru 2021. Tons of dark fruit with a powerful earthy backbone. Fine tannins, still very fresh. Ten more years and this could be a stunner. Still my preferred of the two reds. Paired with a duck course.

- Chateau Cheval Blanc 2011. Crazy complexity with dark fruit, tobacco, chocolate, and some floral components coming through. Full bodied but velvety mouthfeel. Paired with wagyu and barley

- another side-by-side. Chateau Gilette Crème de Tete 1985 and Chateau d’Yquem. Somm brought the former over first and then surprised me with the latter to do a comparison. Gilette had some stone fruit jam like qualities with some honey in it and I got strong hints of saffron on the nose. The d’Yquem was brighter and had more lemon curd note to it. Ultimately preferred the d’Yquem better as it felt more alive. Both paired with a strawberry dessert.

- D’Oliveiras Madeira 1895. First time trying something from the 1800s. Wow this thing was crazy. Dried fruits, coffee, walnuts, but still had incredible acidity to cut through the richness. Fantastic way to end the evening. Paired with wagashi

Was it worth it? At $1,500 for the pairing I don’t think so. Some great special occasion wines in the pairing but at that price I would’ve expected a few more whites/reds with age. Somm was very polished and knowledgeable, also topped me off on occasion. The other pairings go for $300 and $500 but I don’t recall what they entail. My wife had the NA pairing which was excellent and thoughtful. Separately, the restaurant/meal was excellent and highly recommended.

For anyone who loves the ritualistic experience of pouring over coffee, this silver pour-over coffee maker truly delivers. Hario’s reputation among coffee enthusiasts is hard to ignore, and the VDM-02HSV seems to live up to the hype—or at least that's how it feels after using it extensively in my morning routine. My coffee-loving friends and I put it to the test, and though it's become an essential part of the countertop setup, there are important details worth mentioning.

**Sleek, Durable Design**  
This pour-over coffee dripper doesn’t just look good on the kitchen counter; its metallic finish adds a touch of sophistication while being highly functional. Its solid build reassures me every time I pick it up. The dimensions (4.9"" by 3.9"") make it compact but perfectly sized for brewing up to four cups, which turned out to be ideal during my weekend gatherings. The metallic structure impressed my brother-in-law, who tends to be skeptical about durability. Cleaning it became a breeze since the surface resists stains and odors from the coffee grounds.

**Controlled Brewing for Consistent Flavor**  
The steep cone-shaped design of this coffee dripper plays a pivotal role in how evenly the water flows through the coffee grounds. By controlling the timing and flow, I could really notice a brighter, more balanced taste in my morning brew. Even on a lazy Monday, following manual brewing steps, including prolonged pouring, didn’t feel like a hassle. The highlight here lies in how well the design integrates into each step of the manual pour-over process—it ensures the water is in perfect contact with the coffee grounds for an optimal length of time.  

[Check Hario VDM-02HSV price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b00bd1n8wc/)

**Effortless to Use and Clean**  
Being new to pour-over brewing might seem intimidating, but this dripper made learning seamless. I had a friend over—someone completely new to this method—and they found the process straightforward. Using paper filters allows for quick disposal of coffee grounds and easy rinsing post-brewing. Cleanup time in the kitchen is often where I lose enthusiasm for products, yet this dripper broke that stereotype. Even with repeated usage, there’s no lingering coffee residue. Deciphering all of this myself gave me a sense of mastery, and I’d say the simplicity is one of its unsung positives.

**Professional-Grade Quality**  
This brewing tool indeed lives up to the hype of Hario being ""King of Glass."" Although this dripper specifically features a sturdy metal construction, its professional experience carries through. Whether making coffee solo or hosting friends, the output consistently feels like it came from a specialty café. My partner, who has trained as a barista, also gave it high praise for matching professional setups at a fraction of their complexity.

**Pluses**  
- Compact size, perfect for up to 4 cups  
- Flawless water flow, enhancing flavor consistency  
- Easy-to-clean design saves time and effort  

**Critiques**  
- Requires precise manual methods; not ideal if you’re always in a hurry  
- Paper filters are mandatory, adding an extra cost over time  

**Industry Competitors**  
When comparing this dripper with other options like the Chemex pour-over brewer, I noticed that Chemex offers a similar level of control but focuses heavily on aesthetic appeal and multitasking as a carafe. Chemex users often leverage its larger brewing capacity or design that doubles as serveware. However, I found Hario VDM-02HSV better suited for smaller batches and portability without compromising quality. Fellow testers who have previously tried Kalita Wave drippers noted that the Hario offers a more distinctive cone design for flavor depth, though Kalita has its reputation for brewing multiple cups with its flat-bottom filter approach. Each product excels in different areas, but for sharp flavor profiles in a compact dripper like this one, the Hario stood out.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Coffee aficionados eager for precision but working within a reasonable budget will see tremendous value in this pour-over tool. I’ve certainly justified the cost quickly, considering its durability and consistently great coffee making. Compared to pricier models from other brands, where aesthetics tend to come in higher on the priority list, this dripper prioritizes function without compromising simplicity. It's become a daily companion for my coffee ritual, replacing monotonous pod-brewing methods forever.

1mhit3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1mhit3s/rantadvice_needed_on_having_difficult_family/,Rant/advice needed on having difficult family members with baby on the way!,"Hello all! 

Currently 35 weeks and super excited for baby. For some context, I live states away from my family (and my husbands), my parents are divorced but each come with their own difficulties. Also, my husband and I are very private people, and have been trying to lower our social media presence. My husbands family doesn’t get it, but never post anything without his permission. Mine also doesn’t get it but will post things anyway and it’s been a big stressor for me. I’ve barely posted about my own pregnancy. 

My dad: 

My dad and I were never really close growing up but have become closer when I became an adult. My issue with this side of the family is my step family. I have never gotten along with my step mother (she’s been in my life for nearly 20 years now). I accept her since she’s really all my dad has, but she is constantly making drama. I have two older step siblings, an older sister whom I don’t speak to and an older step brother that I have completely cut from my life. Without getting into too many details, he is a pedophile. 

I thought my dad was aware of this, but after speaking with my mom recently it turns out she didn’t know the entire story and thus my dad doesn’t know it all. I am also unsure if my step mom is aware of anything about his pedophilia, it’s a difficult topic to bring up but I know that I will have to shortly. I have to tell them that I don’t feel comfortable with them sharing any pictures of our baby to her group chats with the family, and then tell them why. This has been really stressing me out because I don’t expect them to take it well. My dad likes to avoid drama and difficult conversations at all costs. Any advice for this conversation? 

My sister makes this even more difficult, because despite knowing everything and even being a victim, she still has my step brother on social media (I found this out like a MONTH ago, I’ve had him blocked FOR YEARS) She said it’s to “keep tabs”, but after learning this I’m super pissed that she’s posted several things about me and my pregnancy knowing he had access to all of it. 

My mom: 
My mom and moms side of the family are very conservative. I had to unlearn a LOT of trauma responses. I feel like the black sheep of my family now, because I’m the only one who sets boundaries (or at least tries to). I am always made out to be the bad guy, at least at first. My younger sister is still very much a apart of the “even if it bothers you don’t say anything because they’ll make it a huge deal” 

My grandparents and mom have hundreds of people on social media that I don’t know, and they also make a ton of political posts that I don’t agree with whatsoever (including a lot of misinformation and AI). My grandfather also openly follows a ton of porn accounts, which is why I feel so strict about them not posting about me. I would have deleted my Facebook entirely, but my husband and I have anonymous active accounts JUST to make sure they don’t post things about us. 

While I do love my mom and sister, they do stress me out a LOT and every time they visit I absolutely dread it. They came into town over the weekend to help with final baby prep, they were only here for a day and a half and I still ended up in tears all evening after I dropped them off at the airport. 

My sister posted pictures we took together on her story about me only having a month left (something I have not even posted about? I have not posted my due date, baby’s gender, only one post about me being pregnant at all). I was angry with this but decided to let it go, but then my mom screenshotted it and posted it on her Facebook today. 

My mom also threw a fit over me saying that we weren’t coming down for Christmas this year (it’s always extremely stressful for us, we’ve done it five years in a row and I don’t want my four month old baby being passed around during RSV season by my anti vax family). 

She also got angry with me while she was here over me not having coffee available to her in the mornings, and having a keekaroo changing pad and no wipe warmer. She was insistent that I was being MEAN to my baby over a cold changing pad (it’s not cold??) and no wipe warmer, and said when she comes to visit when the baby’s here she’s going to “spoil him and I’ll have no choice”

Every time I think about it I get overwhelmed. I’m so tired of CONSTANTLY having to argue with my family. I’m so tired of CONSTANTLY having boundaries overstepped and being made out to be dramatic. I’ve considered going no contact so many times over it. 

My mom and sister are supposed to come visit a week after the baby is born and spend the ENTIRE week in my house with me. After this most recent visit, I am absolutely dreading it and I don’t even want them to come anymore. I don’t want to be stressed about my newborn, while also stressed about my mom disregarding my boundaries ESPECIALLY over the baby. 

I haven’t even told my family yet that we don’t want ANY pictures of the baby posted on social media, and that we don’t want them to kiss him at all. This is especially true for my family because all of them get cold sores. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’m sorry if this mostly seemed like a rant, but I am feeling really overwhelmed by all of this and I just want to protect my peace and my baby. ",1,1754326300.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

The Imusa GAU-18234 has been a consistent companion in my daily coffee routine over the past few weeks, and there’s a lot to unpack about this compact and stylish machine. Designed with a sleek black finish, this espresso maker caught my eye for both its aesthetics and promise of practicality. It's a simple yet versatile appliance, and here's how it stacks up based on my experience.

**Thoughtful and Compact Design**  
The sleek and modern design of this versatile coffee maker is immediately noticeable. Its cast aluminum body paired with a brown-tinted carafe and black base makes it fit seamlessly into my countertop setup without taking up much space. The dimensions—7.1 x 4.72 x 9.3 inches—make it especially convenient for those with limited counter space, such as my small kitchen. The detachable base ensures easy handling, and the cool-touch handle is a small yet thoughtful addition. Moving it while it’s warm feels more secure than with other machines I've tried.  

**User-Friendly Operation Mode**  
One thing I truly appreciated during my first use was how simple it was to get started. The Imusa GAU-18234 features an intuitive one-button operation. You fill the lower tank with water, pack the funnel with coffee ground to your preference, and press the button to brew. This espresso maker does the rest, effortlessly delivering rich, aromatic results. Even the indicators for brewing are clear, which helped a lot when I felt skeptical about whether I’d set everything up correctly the first time.

**Good Aspects**  
- The option to brew 3 or 6 cups lets you adjust easily depending on how many people you're serving.  
- This espresso machine beautifully blends durability and style with its aluminum base and elegant finish.  
- It's easy to transport and safe, thanks to features like the detachable base and cool-touch handle.  
- Perfect for experimenting with Cuban coffee, Italian blends, and even traditional Moka, adding a fun twist to daily coffee routines.  
- Convenient for home, travel, or office use, making it an ideal appliance for diverse settings.  

[Check Imusa GAU-18234 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0btr46tjm/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
This is where the Imusa espresso maker shines the most. The espresso produced had a rich, full-bodied flavor, whether I was trying a Cuban roast or a basic Italian blend. For someone like me who appreciates a well-balanced cup in the morning, the quality exceeded expectations. However, I noticed that the brew time could feel slightly longer on busy mornings. This isn't a dealbreaker but something to note for those with tight schedules. Still, the aroma and taste make the wait worthwhile.

**Diverse Brewing Options**  
It’s a delight for coffee enthusiasts looking to explore different styles. The maker handles espresso, Moka, Cuban coffee, and Italian blends exceptionally well. Personally, I found joy in getting experimental with Moka pots, and it delivered consistent results each time. Its simple design means anyone, even someone who’s never made espresso at home, can use it with ease. Whether hosting friends or just treating myself during work breaks, it has offered flexibility in these settings.

**Drawbacks**  
- Frequent cleaning is necessary, especially the filter and tank, to avoid residue build-up and maintain performance.  
- While it can brew a good 6 cups, larger households or parties may find the capacity limiting.  
- There’s no automatic shutoff feature, so you need to be attentive while brewing just to prevent over-extraction.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the Imusa GAU-18234 to similar products in its range, it holds its ground firmly for its simplicity and convenience. For instance, some brands like De'Longhi offer larger capacity models with fancier features like programmable brewing, but they come at higher price points. On the other hand, stovetop espresso makers like the Bialetti require manual labor and lack the convenience of electric brewing. What sets Imusa apart is its sweet spot of being budget-friendly without compromising on its core function—brewing a satisfying cup of coffee. If you’re looking for something compact and efficient rather than high-tech, this one fits the bill better.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When weighing its performance and ease of use against the price range, the Imusa GAU-18234 feels like a valuable investment for coffee lovers on a budget. While this isn't a premium espresso maker, its solid build, reliable performance, and versatility make it worth considering. Whether I was whipping up a quick coffee for myself or trying out a Cuban blend for a guest, the satisfaction it delivered was undeniable.

1mhipvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mhipvl/should_i_text_her/,Should i text her?,"I went to a beach festival 4 days ago. i started snaping some of the set from the DJ that was playing and notice a girl that i was snaping with for 300+ days started saving the snaps. I don't know the girl personally, but i knew she was from the same town i was from. Long story short we chatted a bit while i was at the festival and kept sending her snaps, she said she liked the same music that was playing( i like it also) and I told her that I would send her some videos after so that i can cut out them, a bit and remove some cringe parts of me singing. The next day I asked for her instagram and send her the videos and we chatted a bit again. Yesterday i texter her how was she, we chatted a bit, she said that today was boring and there was nothing to do and asked about me. I replied that after i texted her i was better( right after i send this i saw she post a story of her self) and typed Even better when i saw this :). I said if she ever wants we can grab a coffee or go for a walk and she said yea we can. I asked somethings about her work and chatted a bit about it and saw that she started replying a bit ,,dry'' if I can say. I ended the chat with ,, Hopefully i didn't annoy you. Good night. She said ,, No it's fine you don't"" to which I replied ,, I am glad''. She sends some kind of emoji like this one 😊. I liked it and thats it. 

The question is should i text her again today or not. I am going to the town tomorrow ( I live in a village near by for the summer) and i can send a snap from in front the store in which kitchen she works in) 

I really sorry if it looks stupid, but i have never texted serious with a girl, never had a girlfirend and really don't have any idea what i should or when i should text her or any other girl. I talked with some friends that know most of the people in our town and they said she doesn't have a boyfriend and she isn't talking to anyone at the moment. I am from the balkans if it matters( because some of the americans or other tactics won't work :/)

1mhipsd,https://v.redd.it/mc7fif6681hf1,Senior cat losing balance suddenly. Has anyone seen anything like this?,"First, I have a vet appointment in two hours, but I’m just freaking the hell out and I wanted to see if anyone could offer any insight while I’m waiting.


My senior cat (16) tore his ACL in March, but had seemed to be completely recovered. Saturday he was normal, played with his siblings, even chased his brother down the stairs and around the living room. Then yesterday I noticed he seemed to slip or stumble a few times when getting in my lap or walking on soft surfaces, but I thought it was just from the sudden weather change since he has arthritis or him over doing it with the running Saturday. He mostly stayed in his heated bed all day, which he usually does when his arthritis is acting up. He ate and drank fine.


This morning it became obvious though that there was something going on. I thought at first he was favoring his ACL leg, but he’s not limping, he’s more randomly lurching. At one point I was sitting beside him having my coffee and it was almost like he spasmed and thought he was falling. He scratched the crap out me trying to catch himself, but he was sitting safely in his bed the whole time. Then when he tried to get off the couch he lost his balance completely and fell. I was trying to catch him so I could separate him from the other cats and keep him safe from hurting himself and he fell down the stairs. :(


I’m terrified he’s had a stroke or something. Idk what to do. He’s hiding under the bed right now because he can always tell when I’ve made a vet appointment for him. He ate a treat though, so I guess that’s a good sign? ",2,1754326092.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
1mhino6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1mhino6/explore_the_best_gaming_keyboard_npet_cr87_and_is/,Explore the Best Gaming Keyboard NPET CR87 and Is It Worth It,"Gaming peripherals often feel like a mix of functionality and aesthetics, and having tested the NPET ECCACR87-US, I can comfortably say this mechanical keyboard strikes an intriguing balance between the two. As someone who types all day and squeezes in late-night gaming sessions, I’ve been eager to find a mid-range option that doesn’t compromise on either performance or flair. The compact 87-key layout intrigued me, and after weeks using it, I’ve formed some very clear opinions. Spoiler alert: this keyboard has moments of brilliance, but it’s not without its quirks. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
On first unboxing the NPET CR87, I couldn’t help but admire its rugged yet minimalistic design. The reinforced polymer frame feels robust, and the inclusion of IP56 dust and water resistance is a nice touch—though I’m not planning to drop my coffee on it just to test this claim. The black and grey keycaps give it a retro-meets-modern vibe, though the doubleshot ABS keycaps feel slightly cheaper compared to PBT options. My wrists have remained happy during extended typathons too, thanks to the natural incline of the keyboard. It’s sturdy but doesn’t feel absurdly heavy, so moving it between my work desk and gaming area is a breeze. 

**RGB Lighting**  
I have a love-hate relationship with RGB in general, but the NPET CR87 won me over. Its 19+ lighting modes range from the eye-searingly bright to the subtle and chic. For the sake of testing, I tried music sync, wave, and raindrop effects, all of which drew some “oohs” and “aahs” from my coworkers. The 16.7 million color claim isn’t just marketing fluff—customizing the backlighting felt intuitive using the built-in shortcuts. The ability to control brightness further ensures it can fit any setup, whether it’s a moody gaming cave or a distraction-free home office.  
[See NPET ECCACR87-US deals on Amazon now.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b098jvbm6w/)

**Performance: Gaming and Typing**  
This keyboard’s performance divided me slightly. Fitted with 45g linear red switches, every keystroke was satisfying. Gaming remained consistent with no noticeable actuation delays, which I attribute to its full N-key rollover. Even during demanding gaming combos, it didn’t miss a beat. For typing, I found myself flying through emails and reports, though the tactile feedback won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. That said, the inclusion of three extra red switches is thoughtful and ensured I didn’t have to endure a day without peak function when one of the original ones experienced wear.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
This is where the product becomes truly beginner-friendly. It’s plug-and-play, no additional driver installations required. I tested it on both Windows and macOS, and it connected seamlessly each time. The bundled tools such as a switch puller, keycap puller, and spares are hugely practical. Changing switches was as straightforward as advertised, sparing me from digging through forums or watching endless tutorials. It’s bizarrely satisfying to customize the key switches to suit specific needs, almost like working on a DIY kit.

**Pluses**  
- Hot-swapping capabilities eliminate the hassle of soldering or tinkering for switch replacement.  
- Compact layout creates more space for mouse movement, which is vital during intense gaming.  
- Universal USB-C connectivity ensures it works perfectly across different operating systems and devices.

**Drawbacks**  
- Despite the positives, a notable downside is the lack of PBT keycaps, which would elevate the durability and premium feel.  
- An absence of dedicated media keys can make volume adjustments slightly inconvenient mid-game.  
- While ergonomic, some users with larger hands might find the compact design overly cramped.

**Peer Products**  
There’s no shortage of mechanical keyboards on the market, especially in the compact layout arena. The Ducky One 2 Mini, for instance, rivals this model with similar RGB customization but offers higher-quality PBT keycaps. Corsair’s K65 RGB Mini also delivers a comparable gaming experience, but its Cherry MX switches give it an edge in longevity. However, the NPET CR87 holds its own with its hot-swapping functionality, a feature usually found in keyboards at a higher price point. If customization and beginner accessibility are your priorities, the NPET may be a more appealing contender.

**Smart Spending**  
Mechanical keyboards often seem like an expensive gamble, but the NPET CR87 surprises with its cost-efficiency. The question most people often ask is, “Is it worth it?” After using it daily, I’d say yes, assuming your priorities align with what it offers. The switch customization, RGB lighting, and compact design make it a solid choice for gamers and typists alike who want a premium-like experience without emptying their wallets. While not a perfect keyboard for enthusiasts, it offers impressive value for beginners venturing into mechanical keyboard territory.

I can arrange it for free, just say the word!","Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Alpha Damien, told me he had to temporarily mark an Omega from our pack, Seraphina.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina—the one who’d supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien’s gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us—""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It’s just a temporary mark. It won’t affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina’s scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark—its scent—replaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me—""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit—things only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I’d met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I’d never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe—""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget—an Alpha’s hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn’t heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn’t press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain—""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't—""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the silence settle.

Then, I spoke the words into the empty room, each one a final, liberating vow.

""I, Isla, reject you, Damien.""

He was already gone.

I waited until morning.

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city—the pack, my past, him—shrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

**Have coffee at your bed.**

**The night before put a container of coffee within reach of your bed … with a straw.**

When you wake up, stretch a little bit, grab the coffee and down a cup or two as it’s cold.

In five or 10 minutes, you are going to feel different and you can capitalize on that by sitting on the edge of the bed and maybe sipping some more.

Then you can stand up and stretch and take 25 steps. Count them. Out loud. this is done to force your focus. It’s pretty hard to not wrangle in your focus when you’re speaking out loud because mechanizing speech requires focus.

Report back with your findings. Add some steps that we can share with others or tell me which ones didn’t work.

I’m literally *STILL* in shock.

Last week, I made a random decision (thanks to boredom + iced coffee) to start testing random apps—*from my PHONE.* Yeah, like those “earn while you chill” stories except…I didn’t blow this off as a scam this time.

Fast forward seven days.

Check my PayPal.

What. The. Heck. **$100?!** For tapping buttons, giving feedback on phone games, and rating shopping apps? I swear this cannot be my real life. Is this how the universe works now???

Here’s what literally happened, bullet-pointed for your convenience because my brain is still vibrating:

- Googled “easy app testing” = scam city. 
- **Found THIS instead: https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
- Still thought it was fake, but curiosity won (and caffeine).
- Joined for free. The tasks were, get this, actually fun?
- Only had to use my phone—not a laptop, wires or downloads.
- Started giving feedback on apps, answering simple survey popups.
- The site—**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**—loads everything onto your phone. ZERO tech skills needed. Zero.
- Every task is like “play this puzzle for 10 minutes” or “test this quick shopping cart feature and rate out of 5.”

Pressed submit, got a notification. Checked PayPal again a couple of days later…dollabills.jpg 

STILL, I had to check three times. Did I get punked? Did I sell my kidneys and not notice? But no, it’s all legit—aggregated small payments added up:

- $.70 for rating a grocery app
- $1.50 for a gaming survey (lowkey fun)
- $5 payout for leaving detailed notes—that one took 14 minutes, so IDK, *worth*??

I’m honestly mind-blown. Not “quit your job” money but…my caffeine was basically free last week.

But here’s the wildest part:

I’ve always assumed you need coding skills for side bucks online.
You DON’T. All I did was:
- Go to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Sign up with a valid email (I used my spam one because, trust issues)
- Follow super clear instructions; tasks show up on your dashboard, you pick the ones you want!
- Redeem as soon as you meet the (very low) payout. I hit it in four days.

For anyone as skeptical as I was: what’s the risk, honestly? I didn’t download weird files, fill out shady surveys, or look at “adult” ads. Every task is spelled out, short, and kinda entertaining.

Why does no one talk about this? Or does everyone just think it’s too good to be real? Not life-changing, but pizza money for “testing” if an app can count your steps…sign me up. AGAIN.

Double check: Not sponsored. Just in SHOCK. Hope it helps anyone else who needs breathing space in their wallet this week.

If you want to try, the same link I used: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
Ping here if you try it?!  
Honestly need someone to confirm I’m not dreaming.

**Memory Transcript.**

**Subject:** FF, bodyguard (adoptive father) of Noah Williams.

**Date\[standar human time\]: September 7, 2136**

I hadn’t been able to sleep well since the coup. Every time I close my eyes, the memories of that fateful day when my squad stormed the last bastion of the human purists—a subterranean base where they were trying to create a biological weapon aimed at eradicating the plants—come back to me with force.

Those bastards had been a headache. Even after the Great Blackout, they somehow managed to withstand the passage of time and grow stronger. Fortunately, we realized what they were planning before it was too late.

The closest thing to them nowadays would be the Arxur. The similarities in how they treated captive plants were horrifying; the stench of rot and decomposing plant matter still comes back to my nose from time to time.

During the embassy attack, the memories of that damned lab swirled in my mind, and extreme panic flooded me. My only thought was to run, but thanks to therapy I was able to hold on just enough to react.

When I saw on the cameras that my poor Noah was being beaten, I couldn’t help but see one of my old squadmates reflected in him, cornered by the purists. In a panic attack, I ordered Gerónimo to force the systems.

I knew I had made a mistake, but I’d be willing to go through the pruner if it meant saving my son. As I walked down the halls of this enormous place, I noticed it was pouring rain. It was an incredible rain, with unique views, all due to the sun’s position and its eternal sunset.

After wandering aimlessly for a while, I realized I had returned to my room, and with no other choice, I went back in. It was a pigsty: my room was full of dry leaves and scattered dirt everywhere. I usually cleaned it daily, but I hadn’t had the energy these past few days.

*pufft*

I threw myself straight onto my earthy bed without much grace. I was completely exhausted, but I couldn’t afford sleep—not while this damn PTSD kept reminding me of the horrors of those facilities.

As if that weren’t enough, what I did during Clover’s interrogation hadn’t helped me at all. Knowing she orchestrated this whole bloodbath filled me with a primordial rage, a hatred born from the deepest part of my being. I wanted her dead, no matter what. And when Kam personally offered to let me conduct the interrogation, my body had already agreed before my mind processed it.

At that moment, when I had her in front of me, tied up and with that stoic and arrogant look, I knew what I had to do. I was going to break her down to the root. I took it personally. At the time, it seemed like a good idea to give her a taste of her own medicine. I regret it.

But now, with a much cooler head, all I have left is to carry the guilt of having committed the same acts I so despised from those purists and exterminators: being cruel and ruthless. Now, every time the memory of Clover being tortured by my roots haunts me, it awakens the same thoughts I had before meeting the Williams.

“The Williams…” I said aloud while lying face-down on the mattress.

My heart warmed a bit as I recalled all the quality moments I spent with them: how I fell in love with Milo, and how he as not only able to open his heart to me but also to understand me just as I am. I love him, and he loves me, flaws and all.

The ringtone of my phone caught my attention. I’ve always wondered why the youngsters call them data pads.

A faint but honest smile formed on my face when I saw who was calling.

“Speak of the devil…” I knew I hadn’t spoken much with him lately, and he was probably terribly worried about me and Noah.

<<Hello, Darling. How are you? It’s been a while since you called, and I was starting to worry>> He said the rough and firm voice of Milo, reverberating through my phone’s speaker.

“Hi… I know it’s been a while since I called. It’s just that a lot has happened and I haven’t been able to process most of it,” I responded without energy.

<<I heard about the exterminators' guild coup from the news a couple of days ago. I couldn’t call because I was too worried. Is everyone okay over there? I heard Noah was hospitalized for using the suit>> he said, clearly concerned.

“The truth is, during the coup, Noah tried to protect several people from a horrible end and, as a result, the armor was forced to take the drastic measures you told me about.”

<<That’s bad. The suit’s measures are extremely experimental. I told that damned flower, and the worst part is that she convinced me to install them anyway under the excuse that they’d probably never be used. At least tell me Sara and Noah are okay>> said Milo, his voice full of frustration.

“More or less. Noah only received standard water-of-life treatment and two days of coma. But Sara…” I took a few seconds to think about how to soften the terrible news. “She had half of her body burned. That part is completely irrecoverable, beyond the limits of life sap. But it’s not all bad: Noah is already awake, and in Sara’s case, the Red Cross has decided to apply an experimental treatment with an enhanced intensive carrot.”

<<What?! I warned Sara a thousand times not to get involved—! Uh, no, never mind. It doesn’t matter now>> What just happened? Why did Milo react like that? Whatever, that’s not the point.

“Sigh. Anyway, it doesn’t matter anymore. What’s done is done, and there’s nothing I can do about it,” I replied in a tired tone.

<<You sound awful. How have you been since the coup?>> His voice had returned to the loving tone it had at the beginning.

“The truth is I haven’t been doing very well since the incident. I suppose by now you already know all the details, so I’ll just tell you the most important ones. You see, this coup was orchestrated by an exterminator named Clover. The details of how she managed it are irrelevant. The point is, she’s the one who hurt Noah, she was behind everything.I couldn’t help but remember those damn purists, you know? The atrocities that exterminators committed against their own people just because they didn’t fit into their standards were horrible. And when I had the chance to repay someone in kind…”

Before I could keep blaming myself, Milo interrupted me.

<<Relax, darling. You know she deserved it. You don’t have to remember it if you don’t want to. I’m not going to judge you for what you did—I understand>>

I loved Milo, but this act was inexcusable.

“You don’t get it, Milo. I tortured someone and felt pleasure doing it, just like those damn purists. Lowering yourself to the same thing you hate just to take it out on someone else doesn’t make you anything more than the same shit you swear you’re better than. I’m not asking for your compassion or your judgment, I just want you to listen. In my eagerness to prove that their way of thinking and acting was wrong, I didn’t stop to think that what I was doing was also wrong. And that’s the only difference between Clover and me: the ability to accept the mistakes we make.”

<<Do you think I don’t know that? I know what it feels like to carry the weight of your actions, and the weight of others’ actions. I understand you. I know what it’s like to carry guilt.And you know that. That’s why we found comfort in each other. That’s why we love each other, remember?>>

Even though we had radically different pasts, we were united by the same thought: the guilt for past actions.

<<I think you’re right. I shouldn’t torment myself over this anymore, but it’s not easy. It’s incredibly hard to forget>>

I wasn’t alone anymore. I no longer had to suffer in solitude. In fact, I hadn’t felt this way in almost 20 years. All thanks to a family I never asked for, but whom I love with every part of my being.

We talked about every topic we could think of: how Noah was too clueless to notice our relationship; the laughs we had lovingly stored in our hearts, filled with care and affection; the nights we spent talking about our lives; about how the past that once haunted us gradually faded when we came into each other’s lives… Memories I’ll carry with me to the grave.

<<Heh, heh, heh. FF, talking to you is always fun. It’s a shame there’s so much distance between us—literally speaking—but my love for you will always be eternal, married or not>> His warm voice always reached the deepest part of my cold and lifeless heart.

“You know I don’t believe in marriage. Besides, I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for it. It’s too much pressure,” I sighed into the phone.

<<Well, I had nothing to lose by trying. Anyway, I’ll let you go now, FF. Duty calls. Goodbye>> And just like that, the call with Milo ended.

All the memories I’ve accumulated throughout my life with him are the most precious gems in the world. I wouldn’t trade them for anything in this life.

 

**Memory Transcript.**

**Subject: Noah Williams, heir to the Doom ‘n Bloom weapons company.**

**Date\[standar human time\]: September 7, 2136**

“Work and more work—that’s the only reward I get, even though I saved, like, 20 people’s lives,” I muttered with annoyance as I signed an overwhelming amount of last-minute trade treaty paperwork between my company and Venlil Prime.

“You sound annoyed, user Noah. Is there something wrong with the work?” asked Rufus, whom I had nicknamed Jarvis.

“Well, Jarvis, that’s the problem: the work itself. You’d think that after saving several people, I’d get at least a little gratitude, BUT NO, NOTHING, NOT A DAMN THING. As soon as I woke up from my coma, they discharged me—just like that,” I complained with every ounce of strength I had left, my head still buried in an eternal pile of paperwork.

“User Noah, I still don’t understand. You know my name is Rufus, yet you continue to call me Jarvis. It’s a bit confusing, you know?” Replied Jarvis with a polite tone that somehow still felt condescending, even though it was just… polite.

“I always forget you’re a first-generation AI. You guys are too stiff to accept something as simple as a nickname,” I sighed in defeat.

“Is that so? Then why do you still insist on keeping me as your assistant AI?” he replied in that same cordial tone that felt like a middle finger.

“Because, after all, you’re the most stable and the ones who take the fewest liberties when following orders. You know, it’s really interesting how Penny’s approach to creating AIs has changed over time. I mean, you’re a first-gen AI—a living image of Penny.

You’re firm, always ready to make the hardest decisions and follow orders. But the downside is that you’re too rigid: once you choose a purpose, you’d rather die fulfilling it than abandon it.Then there are the second-generation AIs. You can still tell they’re Penny’s kids, but not as much. They’re textbook tsunderes. While they’re the fastest at making decisions and the most creative, they’re also incredibly stubborn once they get an idea in their heads—or the equivalent of one.

And then there’s the third generation. You can’t even tell they’re related to Penny anymore. They’re the most helpful and versatile. The same AI that pilots a ship can also be your butler. Always ready to give you their opinion and make decisions without an order—which is also kind of a bad thing. Add to that the fact they rarely take things seriously, love to joke around, and tend to freeze when faced with a tough choice,” I replied, pleased with my own rambling, while taking a big sip from the jug where I’d made my coffee. Damn it, why hasn’t anyone come up with a caffeine injection?

“User Noah, why so reflective all of a sudden? That’s not like you,” Rufus asked me with the same polite tone as always. Damn it, this time it really was condescending.

“It’s just that so much has happened—like the embassy attack, an Arxur incursion, and the first successful trial of the PlantFood project—all in such a short time, and I just haven’t wanted to think about any of it.” My voice darkened as I spoke.

“User Noah, have you ever thought about love? You are a young and highly desirable man by current standards,” Rufus said in his ever-courteous tone, clearly trying to change the subject.

“Honestly? No. I have a life that’s way too busy to go around looking for a partner, not to mention that I’m literally far from home. On top of that, the people I usually meet always seem to be intimidated by my appearance and status,” I said while reading, for the fourth time, the same paragraph about the terms of use of the Doom ‘n Bloom ecosystem.

“Why do you say that?” Rufus asked.

“Well, to start: there’s my size. I’m 1.80 meters tall; I’m not THAT tall, but I’m not short either. Then there’s my body: I’m a wall of muscle. That, combined with my size, would make anyone uncomfortable being around me.

Now, my status: I’m the heir to THE most powerful company on the planet, both militarily and economically. Most people think I’m out of their league, and the few who don’t are just a bunch of rich, spoiled brats who wouldn’t survive a day without mommy and daddy. I’m grateful to FF for teaching me how to be a functional person.

No need to mention that I’m a prodigy in techno-mechanics. Since I was 16, I’ve been involved in more tech development projects than I can count, and now I’m the highest authority in the armed forces… at least in the tech division. Most of the paperwork is about that: reports from the joint fleet between VP and Earth.”Damn it, I wish I had a reactor with some kind of unlimited energy source instead of a heart—like in that movie—because I need a lot of energy to get through this.

“What kind of work do you do for the joint armed forces?” Rufus asked.

“I work as the general supervisor. My job is to review all the summaries from the first-generation armor wearers to deliver the results to the UN. And since the program is almost finished, it’ll be super helpful for mass production of these suits for use in a permanent joint army,” I replied while continuing with this monotonous and boring task.

“Do you have any notable cases on your hands?”Even though Rufus could see what I was working on, he always limited himself to staying on the worktable and never doing anything I didn’t explicitly ask for.

“Right now, only about 17. While the results of the ‘instinct suppression therapy’ have revealed valuable insights—that the Venlil are far more than just ‘the weakest and most emotional prey of the Federation’—so far, I’ve personally assigned these 17 Venlil specific armor suits based on their skills.For example, I gave Slanek an All-Stars suit for his tendency to charge and his bouts of stupid bravery. I assigned Valyan the Fume-shroom stealth assault gear due to his reaction speed and habit of hit-and-run tactics.Not all of them have offensive roles. There’s also a mecha pilot with a Tall-nut suit, and a pair of twins who’ve been given the Sunflower armors, among others,” I said as I showed him the files of the examples I mentioned.

“I see you’re taking all this very seriously, and I’m glad. But… you know I’m concerned about your well-being, right?” he replied with the same courteous tone.

“Thanks for noticing my effort, but why do you ask?” I knew I’d been working hard, but I was three days behind—so I didn’t think I looked *that* bad.

“Well, you’ve been awake for exactly 16 consecutive hours, 10 of which have been spent working. If you want to live to old age, you should sleep. Doctors recommend a healthy minimum of 8 hours of sleep.”Crap, had I really been working that long? Do I look so bad that Rufus had to tell me?

*tocktocktock*

“User Noah, it seems you have visitors. Shall I let them in?” Rufus asked right after the knock at the door.

“Come in!” I shouted to whoever was knocking, without turning around.

“Good awakening, Noah. I’d like to ask you a question,” Tarva’s voice came from behind me.

“Yeah, sure, ask whatever you want,” I replied, my voice tired from so much work.

“The thing is, I’ll be making a diplomatic visit to Earth soon, which will last about three days, and well… I’m not very used to being around humans, and I wanted to know if you could come with me on the visit.”Tarva’s voice sounded nervous… or was it embarrassment?

“Sigh…My apologies, Tarva, but I don’t think I can go. I’m three days behind on my work and I need to have it ready by tomorrow—or its paw-equivalent,” I turned around to meet her eyes. She looked frozen; her gaze was lost, and she was holding her tail and ears together.“Just look at me. I’ve been awake for almost 17 hours, I’ve got deadlines breathing down my neck, and I haven’t even had time to sleep,” I replied before she could say anything.

Tarva’s ears drooped. Then, she stepped closer until she was just half a meter away. Her eyes now stared directly into my soul, and a faint orange blush was visible on her muzzle and ears.

“Oh… I see. It’s just… I really trust you. It’s a shame you can’t help me. You know… if you want, I could talk to the UN and get them to extend the deadline so you can come with me.”Her voice now was about half an octave higher—it almost sounded like a cat’s meow.

Is this how Venlil ask for favors? If so, this is going to be hell.Then again, what Tarva said was something I had already tried, but they refused. Elias Meier himself told me I had to submit the papers before the program’s closure, since preparations for the aforementioned mass production of the armor were already beginning.

So I gave my already exhausted brain a mental slap to keep it from giving in to the temptation of kissing her and petting a sapient being, no matter how huggable and cute she seemed.

“As I said, I can’t. Not only do I have to submit the papers before the day after tomorrow, but I also have to attend the closing ceremony of the joint fleet program to officially kick off the Permanent Joint Armada.”Upon saying that, Tarva’s tail whipped out of her hands violently, in a whip-like motion.

*Shuwisp*

To my surprise, Tarva’s tail actually made that sound. How was that biologically possible? How strong are Venlil tail muscles?

“W-Was that your tail?” I asked, a little nervous.

Apparently, Tarva’s cute façade was starting to crack. In a somewhat clumsy attempt to escape the awkward situation, she decided to flee to avoid losing her dignity.

“I-I see… you’re really busy with your work. I think it’s best if I leave you alone now. Stay safe, Noah,” and she ran out of my room in a hurry, as if something were chasing her.

“Well… that was… weird. I don’t get it. Why was she so desperate for me to be there?” I murmured as I scratched my head in confusion.

“User Noah, do you recall saying not long ago that you had few opportunities for love?” Rufus’s voice came just after I closed the door.

“What do you mean? I don’t get it,” I replied, a little confused.

“Tarva has feelings for you. Just think about it: she’s been the only person who’s consistently checked in on you. She was even the first to visit you after you woke up from your coma.” Now Rufus’s voice carried that tone of condescension and wisdom.

“I don’t know... there are too many complications. The thing is, she’s much older than me. She’s in the equivalent of her mid-40s, and I’m only 25. There’s no way she’d be interested in someone so young.Besides, there’s the species difference… I don’t think Venlil are nearly as xenophilic as humans. I don’t even know if she’s married or not—she doesn’t talk much about her personal life, and that’s fine. I don’t blame her for keeping her private life separate from her work.I mean, it’s not like she has some tragic backstory that forced her to end things with a potential partner, and by some miracle, they didn’t have a child or two... Life isn’t one of those cheap melodramas.And to put the final nail in the coffin: you know it’s frowned upon to date a coworker. It’s not professional—especially considering the nature of our respective jobs.Look, it’s not like I don’t feel anything for her. In fact, I haven’t been able to get her out of my head for a while now… there are just too many implications to draw any clear conclusions,” I said in defeat.

“And what about her invitation to the diplomatic visit to Earth? That was clearly an excuse to be alone with you,” Rufus replied in an attempt to lift my spirits.

“Come on, you know with these people anything could be true. You saw how they reacted when they first saw us. Even if there isn’t much opposition to humans anymore, there’s still a lot of fear surrounding our presence.Every time I have to go outside, I have to wear a full-face mask to avoid fainting incidents… or deaths, in the worst-case scenario.

So if she’s asking me to come with her because she doesn’t feel safe being surrounded by people who are obviously terrified of her, I’m not going to take it as disingenuous. Centuries of trauma don’t vanish in three months, you know?I can’t afford to make assumptions about her people right now—not when I have to walk on thin glass near them. I can’t afford to have hopes for someone whose personal life I barely know. In other words, I can’t afford to mistake kindness for something else.”At this point, I just had to accept things as they were: my fate was sealed. I had no luck in love, and I’d better learn to live in solitude if I didn’t want to suffer.

“I see… that makes sense to me. Now I understand better why you turned down Tarva’s invitation using the work excuse. You did it to protect yourself emotionally and to avoid complications.Given the context of the current galactic scenario, the last thing you'd want is tension between you and Tarva. If a difficult situation were to arise, it would be best to make decisions with as cool a head as possible,” Rufus said in a thoughtful tone.

“Actually, you’re wrong. It wasn’t a lie that I had to submit the paperwork before the day after tomorrow.I genuinely had a call with Elias to ask if he could extend the deadline, but he said he couldn’t, since in case we need to deploy the armors for the official joint fleet, the last thing we want is delays. Especially now that we don’t know when this invisibility façade is going to drop.And if I don’t finish it, heads are going to roll—and it’ll be my fault if that happens.The last thing I want is for someone to lose their job because of me,” I said with a shrug.

“Oh… I didn’t expect that to be true. I suppose sometimes a mysteriously convenient excuse isn’t actually a lie.Well then, you’re clearly very tired, User Noah. For the sake of your health, I recommend you take a nap. I’ll set a 9-hour timer for you, starting now.”And just like that, my workday came to an end. Tomorrow, I’ve got a long day ahead.

“I guess you’re right.*yawn*I’m way too tired to keep working anyway… and I’m barely halfway through.”

Was it bad? I wouldn't say so. First couple of days – abso-freaking-lutely. Then, it was easier, as my body literally relaxed. 

Imagine being under constant stress and thoughts for every day of the two-years situationship. And than just — *poof*. It's gone. I'd say 80% of the anxiety attacks I've been having for the past two years was because of that.

Later on, there was a very very strong feeling of abandonment and inability to find somebody. I felt left out.

The important context in that, – i am an expat because of war. That is why it is very hard for me to find a stable relationships (of any kind, not only romantic).

And that stroke hard. I was full of thoughts like *""you will never find someone like that in here. U blew your best chance. U've abandoned the ONLY person, whi could've been the one for you""*. *""Now, you will never find anyone else, unless you'll go back to Ukraine. That's it"".*

Important context #2 — I have a coffee-shop/book-shop where I do some exhibitions and gatherings and screenings and stuff...

So, I did met some new people. Obviously, I do not have any feelings of a romantic kind for them. However new people in life is very therapeutic experience after the break-up. Its not that ""ok, i guess i can go with that girl over there"" it more about  — ""ok, there's so many people, they aren't from the same community, they are different, but they are similar to me"". And that is kinda freeing

This is DIY-able right??

I think the most difficult part with be tiling/grouting.

I've always been a coffee lover, so when I got my hands on the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 PurePrecision 8 Cup Pour-Over Coffee Brewer, I was eager to put it through its paces. This coffee maker boasts an SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) Certification, which immediately peaked my interest. True to its claims, it promises the precision and rich flavor any pour-over enthusiast could ask for but automated for convenience. After testing it for a couple of weeks, here’s my experience.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the sleek, silver finish. It compliments my kitchen aesthetic and doesn’t take up excessive counter space despite its robust size, measuring 7.5""D x 12""W x 13.5""H. The glass carafe looks elegant and fits snugly into the machine. The buttons are straightforward with a satisfying touch, and the overall design feels premium. However, the unit is not lightweight—it weighs about 9 pounds, which is understandable given the sturdy build.  

[Find the best price for Cuisinart CPO-800P1 PurePrecision on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0142uuvde/)  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
What truly sets this machine apart is its ability to replicate a manual pour-over flavor profile while making the process effortlessly easy. The pre-wetting of the grounds ensures the bloom phase extracts full flavor, something I’ve usually only seen in manual pour-over methods. I tested all three flavor strengths (mild, medium, and bold). The bold setting paired with freshly ground beans gave me the punchy, aromatic cup I crave in the morning.  

The temperature control settings—hot and extra hot—are notable. The ""extra hot"" option struck the perfect balance between serving temperature and preserving the coffee’s delicate flavors. Still, I would've preferred an even broader range for those who enjoy cooler brew temperatures.  

**Ease of Use**  
Running the machine is a breeze. The 24-hour programmability meant waking up to the perfect brew every morning, and the Brew Pause feature came in clutch during rushed mornings when I needed my caffeine fix before the cycle ended. Cleaning is easier than expected too, thanks to the self-clean function. Having a reusable, laser-etched stainless steel filter is a huge plus for me—it’s both eco-friendly and cuts down on the expense of paper filters.  

**Advantages**  
There are so many aspects to love about this machine, and a few elements especially stand out:  
- The SCAA Certification assures reliable, high-quality results.  
- Programmable settings let you control brewing time to conveniently match your schedule.  
- Brew Pause ensures accessibility without waiting for the full cycle.  
- A reusable stainless steel filter reduces waste and is cost-efficient.  

**Critiques**  
While there’s much to appreciate, the product isn't without its flaws:  
- The weight makes it less portable or ideal for moving between counters.  
- The price point might feel steep for occasional coffee drinkers.  
- Lack of detailed instructions on customizing brew methods could confuse newcomers to pour-over coffee.  

**Competitors**  
Before this, I tried the Technivorm Moccamaster and Breville Precision Brewer, both considered benchmarks for quality coffee-making. In terms of flavor, the Technivorm delivers consistently rich brews but lacks the temperature control options offered by the Cuisinart. Breville’s model offers a wider temperature range but can feel overwhelming with its plethora of settings. The Cuisinart balances precision and simplicity, bridging the gap between high performance and usability.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its features and SCAA certification, this coffee brewer justifies its price, especially for someone serious about coffee. It might not suit someone on a tight budget or with casual interest in coffee brewing, but for enthusiasts wanting consistent, café-quality brews at home, it’s a worthy investment.

I've been to Miami 3 years in a row, and decided to take the family to Europe for our first race outside the US and make it into a nice vacation.

We flew from DC to Budapest on Wednedsay last week. Nice easy flight to Vienna and a quick hop to Budapest, arriving on Thursday afternoon.   
  
We took a taxi (using Fotaxi stands at the airport) to our hotel - the Matild Palace. It was a tremendous choice, though in a touristy (and tourist trap laden) part of town. But it's an incredibly nice hotel. Thanks to all my business travel we were able to use points to fund our rooms, as it would've been wildly expensive the old fashioned way..

First impressions of Budapest - it's quiet, pretty, clean (what we've seen of it anyway), and seems like a very nice vacation destination. Food has been excellent with tons of choices. Easy to get around, very walkable, tons of history. I wish we had more time here.

We got a good night's rest on Thursday and met our driver at 11am Friday for the ride to the Hungaroring. The driver dropped us at this location - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/aQ1xoBihCh3ZhZJJ9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aQ1xoBihCh3ZhZJJ9) \- which was a short walk to Gate 6, which is right by the Apex 2 Blue Zone stands where our seats were. At the end of the day the driver met us the same spot, and while we were stuck in a touch of traffic it wasn't bad. We made it back to Budapest in less than an hour, freshened up, and went to dinner on Fashion street - oddly seated next to a bunch of what I assume were Lamborghini executives, as they were all A) Italian and B) wearing Lamborghini lapel pins on their fancy suits. 

Saturday we met a different driver from the same company at 10am for the ride, which took about 10min longer than on Friday. Crowds were MUCH heavier on Saturday as expected. Great day of racing and quali, but then the trouble started. Our driver admitted he had never been to the ring before, and he didn't know how to get back to our meetup point. We ended up having to walk \~2 miles through fields and down dusty roads to find him, only to sit in another 90min of traffic. I'm fine with it, but my daughter has a medical condition which makes that an issue. Luckily she was OK so it was a minor inconvenience. At least I got my steps in.

Sunday we were out at 11am again to get to the track, and while I was on the way back to the hotel after a coffee run I ran into Lance Stroll as he was leaving. Nice kid, though he looked like he just rolled out of bed.. After reaching out to the car service they apologized profusely for Saturday's issue and put us with a great driver who knew exactly what to do. After the race we were in the van within 20min of walking out of gate 6 and only sat in traffic for about 75min before we made it back to the hotel. 

All in all, tremendous experience. The fans, the sights, and the excitement are incredibly different than what we've experienced in the US. The race was great, and the view from our seats was excellent. The food at the track, amenities, and activities were fun as well. It was a smash hit for the family, and after a couple more days being tourists in the city we will head back home.

Just got my Q6 Prestige a week ago and I do actually really love the vehicle (first Audi and first electric vehicle). There are some quirks though that I was curious about and I am hoping you can help me out.

\- Is there a way to get the back windows to roll down all the way? I get it's a safety feature, but it seems a little excessive.  
\- Is there a way to permanently turn off the motion detection inside the car? My dog goes everywhere with me and I always just leave my car on when I go inside a store, etc. But when I left my dog in the car and remote started the climate control, the alarm was going berserk. I know you can turn it off per trip, but I just want it off forever. Again, ""safety""...but...excessive.  
\-UPDATE: I see a toggle for ""turn off motion senstivitiy,"" but when I toggle it off, it initiated ""valet mode.""  
\- I LOVED the auto start/stop by detecting weight in the seat, but then I realzed after time that if I wanted my car to stay on (for example: a hot day when I run into Starbucks to get my coffee), it's a pain. Any tips on good ways to get around that?  
\- Carplay...oof. Wireless Carplay disconnects constantly. And my phone is usually connected via Bluetooth as well, but the car will say ""no device connected"" in my connection center, so I am rendered audioless until I turn my car off and on again. Anyone else experience this?  
\- What's with the poor quality display on the heads up and the instrument cluster? I had a Santa Fe Calligraphy before this and the display was crisp. The characters on the Q6 look a little blurry.  
\- Cameras. Anyone elses cameras lag a bit while in motion (backing up, etc.?).  
\- Speed limit alerts. I will be going down a 35MPH road and all of a sign the speed on my car will detect 65 MPH randomly. Super odd and makes any speed alerts in this vehicle virtually useless. Anyone else?  
EDIT: - Also wondering how I can get ALL doors to unlock when I unlock from the driver door. The door unlock/lock situation is driving me bananas. Can someone help me out with this? Or explain how this works?

I know that seems like a lot, but honestly they are just little things that I would change if I could (maybe can?). Overall, after the first week I am loving it. Love the giant panoramic sunroof that opens up, love the feel the vehicle, it's incredibly zippy (unless you're coming from like a GT or something, it packs plenty of a punch), the tech in the car (when working properly) is incredible. I wish there were more analog buttons in the car, but the way the digital ones are placed in the console work just fine. There's not a lot of gimmicks in this car either, which I love. I think you could argue the passenger screen is a little gimmicky, but who knows, maybe that will grow on me too. Overall rating through week 1 is 8/10 (maybe a bonus point included there because I am excited to be in an Audi).",2,1754324969.0,AudiQ6,4,1.0,False

Everyone's talking about how AI is going to replace copywriters, but most of the AI stuff I've tried has been pretty trash for actual client work.

But here's what's got me a bit worried...

Had a coffee chat with another freelancer last week and she mentioned she's been using some tool called Copywhiz for her client emails. Said it actually writes like a human instead of the usual robotic AI garbage.

I brushed it off at first because... come on, we've all heard this before.

But then I started noticing her turnaround times getting faster and her clients seem just as happy (if not happier) with her communication.

Now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm being stubborn by not exploring these tools more seriously.

Anyone else dealing with this internal struggle? Like, part of me wants to stay ""pure"" and do everything manually, but another part is thinking maybe I should at least test what's out there.

What's your take on using AI assistance for the more mundane parts of client work?",0,1754324911.0,copywriting,9,0.36,False

I’ve been making candles for a couple of years now as a hobby and I’m starting to think about selling them in the next year or so. I’m excited about the idea of launching something I have created out into the world! I’ve been reading a lot of advice about business licenses, insurance, burn tests, etc. But I’m curious about different avenues for sales I.e. Etsy, having a stand at a farmers market or crafts fair, selling through coffee shops or other shops, selling through your own website, etc. I’d love to hear thoughts on which strategies have worked best for you and why. This would be something I would be doing on the side, not my main job, should that impact your thoughts. Thank you!
