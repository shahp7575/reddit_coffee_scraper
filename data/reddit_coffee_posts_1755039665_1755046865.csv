Social media and this sub have digressed into insanity. We have lost human dignity, decorum and any chance of moving closer together by constantly being locked in character assassinations, rhetoric, desire to win arguments and a need to demonstrate our version of the facts.

**The recipe below can change the dynamic instantly if adopted by Jordan fans and detractors a like.** There are two key attributes that distinguish humans from other mammals, and they are ***Moral virtue & Critical thinking.*** At least one of these two attributes are required to create meaningful dialogue and change in the world.

MORAL VIRTUE: If in doubt, think of any individual who you think exhibits positive and noble attributes that you admire. (Redemption, forgiveness, patience, tolerance, kindness, desire to seek for truth, courage, integrity, honesty, selflessness and the freedom to express truth).

CRITICAL THINKING: Everyone is capable of critical thinking, but no one can access this part of their brain if they are emotionally charged. If any comment or statement you make is charged or driven by one of these emotions, you are not in the required mode. (NOT Anger, fear, pride, entitlement, selfishness, resentment, bitterness, envy, jealousy, disappointment, shame, feeling like an imposter, alienation, etc.). If you want to understand how frequently and easily we fall out of critical thinking mode, see the link below.

The saying ""iron sharpens iron"" is a proverb, often quoted. It means that **people can improve each other through interaction, through constructive criticism, and mutual support**. (Metal on metal is a harsh process, so be prepared). In the interaction both parties must be open to shift their perspectives, even if only fractionally. Every attempt must be made to see the other’s perspective. Metal on metal will result in both items being sharpened and losing some material in the process.

When posting or commenting, the following guidelines apply.

1.      Imagine that the individual is in front of you and that you have looked them in the eye, greeted them and treated them with the dignity and respect you would like to be treated with.

2.      Top of mind should be to share original thoughts and not rhetoric (persuasiveness is required as people are no longer open to old arguments).

3.      To ***“win friends and influence people”***, not attempting to win arguments is desired.

4.      Focus on the topic and not the person’s character. **No character assassinations**, belittling, memes or the like.

5.      Back up claims with references if required, BUT ONLY REFERENCES THAT ADHERE TO THE RULES. That is, you can’t slander by proxy via an attachment.

6.      At the end of the interaction, imagine again the individual is in front of you and that you have looked them in the eye, have treated them with the dignity and respect you would like to be treated with. After, the feeling that you would happily meet them for coffee if required and no feelings of avoiding them at all costs.

Each one reading these words wants to make the world a better place. I also know that each one of you is capable of aiming upwards.

**This is your moment, this is your time, you can be the difference you want to see in the world. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers.**

**SHOUTING COMMENTS INTO THE VOID IS NOT A STRATEGY, it’s a misguided emotional reaction and difficult to distinguish from Einstein's observation.**

*‘Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste death but once.’ - Julius Caesar*

Good news, I have 'finished' the I'm Still Sisyphus painting. I use quotation marks because I am not yet sure if i'm satisfied with it. I added the sparkling varnish to where the pleiades peak down from the heavens this morning while I was still have my morning coffee. Then when I went out for the day, I coated both my hands in red paint and planted Sisyphus hand prints onto the boulder. All that I've had planned is done. I like it. But I also do not. It is missing something. It looks duller than I want it to. The varnish I bought-without glitter this time-will be arriving tomorrow so I am hoping that will brighten all the colours. I can't think of any other avenues for improvement. Hopefully, I'll find satisfaction in it soon.

I also redid several parts of the painting for Oliver Fenn. I tried a few times to sketch out the two characters i wanted to add to the cover but I just don't think I have the skill for it. If it were a drawing in pencil and ink, I think I could manage to make a decently human design but paint is far to messy and unkempt. I need rigidness for that sort of image. So, I decided to change it into a different concept for the cover. I painting the brown parts that would have been the inside of the lighthouse blue and turned into a full lakeside landscape painting. I added a rough outline of the lighthouse in the lower right corner and a rough outline of the castle in the upper left. I like it more. Still, we'll see how I feel in the future.

I am itching to write but my mind and body refuse to let me settle into my seat to actually do it. I'm not used to writing inside anymore.

Let’s be honest — Bitcoin is already confusing enough for some people. You’ve got public keys, private keys, seed phrases, block confirmations, transaction fees… and that one cousin who keeps calling it *“bit corn.”* Now, if you struggle to work the TV remote without calling tech support, we need to have a little heart-to-heart: our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) might not be for you.

Before you clutch your pearls, this isn’t about gatekeeping — it’s about preventing the kind of chaos that happens when someone who still thinks “the cloud” is in the sky tries to handle digital money. This app is a finely tuned, easy-to-use tool for generating Bitcoin payment QR codes. But in the wrong hands? Well, it’s like giving a flamethrower to a raccoon.

**Why We’re Making This PSA**  
We designed our Bitcoin QR Code Maker to be sleek, fast, and intuitive. Even your average internet-savvy person can make a Bitcoin QR code in seconds. But here’s the thing: some folks will somehow still manage to paste the wrong address, send funds to the void, or print their private key on a T-shirt because “it looks cool.”

If that’s your vibe, maybe stick to Monopoly money for now.

**Red Flags You Might Not Be Ready**

* You ask, “Can I get my Bitcoin back if I lose my password?” (No, Brenda, that’s not how this works.)
* You once sent an email to “[www.hotmail.com”]() thinking that’s how addresses work.
* You believe QR codes are tiny crossword puzzles.
* You still think Dogecoin is Bitcoin’s younger brother.

If two or more of these apply to you… maybe bookmark the site for later and spend a little time learning the basics first.

**For Everyone Else — Let’s Get Paid in Style**  
Now, if you can operate a basic smartphone app without setting off a fire alarm, you’re in for a treat. Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker lets you:

* Instantly generate QR codes for any Bitcoin address.
* Customize with your preferred amount, currency display, and style.
* Use your QR code anywhere — print it, put it on a website, or slap it on a coffee shop counter and watch sats roll in.

It’s all about making Bitcoin payments fast, frictionless, and fun — without endless copy-pasting or “oops, I sent it to the wrong address” moments.

**The Bottom Line**  
If you know how to follow a recipe without burning water, you can use [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) without breaking a sweat. But if the phrase “public and private keys” sounds like something from a locksmith’s toolbox, maybe do a little homework before diving in.

We love making Bitcoin easy for everyone — but remember, easy doesn’t mean *foolproof.* And we’re here to keep fools from proofing their own wallets right out of existence.

1moq35z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1moq35z/term_coffee_cake_should_change/,"Term ""Coffee Cake"" should change","Why We Should Stop Using the Term ""Coffee Cake"" 

The term ""coffee cake"" is a linguistic relic that has outlived its clarity, creating confusion and misrepresenting a cherished culinary tradition. Rooted in the German custom of Kaffee und Kuchen—literally ""coffee and cake""—the phrase was meant to evoke a social ritual of enjoying coffee alongside a variety of sweet baked goods. However, its English translation has morphed into a misleading label that implies coffee as an ingredient or defining feature, when traditionally, it is not. This essay argues that we should abandon the term ""coffee cake"" due to its grammatical ambiguity, cultural misrepresentation, and the availability of more precise descriptors that better honor the tradition and avoid confusion. 

The origins of the so-called ""coffee cake"" lie in 17th-century Germany, where the rise of coffee houses and the custom of Kaffeeklatsch—social gatherings centered around coffee and pastries—gave birth to the concept of Kaffee und Kuchen. This tradition involved serving cakes like Streuselkuchen (crumb cake), Apfelkuchen (apple cake), or other pastries alongside a steaming cup of coffee. The cakes themselves typically contained no coffee; the term Kaffeekuchen (coffee cake) referred to any cake paired with coffee during these gatherings. When German immigrants brought this custom to the United States, the phrase ""coffee and cake"" was condensed into ""coffee cake,"" losing the critical preposition ""with."" This translation error birthed a term that suggests a coffee-flavored or coffee-infused product, much like ""chocolate cake"" implies chocolate. The result is a grammatically incorrect phrase that misleads modern consumers and bakers alike. 

Grammatical ambiguity is a primary reason to retire ""coffee cake."" In English, compound nouns like ""coffee cake"" typically describe a product defined by its primary ingredient or flavor, as seen in terms like ""carrot cake"" or ""lemon bread."" When someone hears ""coffee cake,"" they reasonably expect coffee to be a component, yet traditional coffee cakes—such as those with cinnamon, streusel, or fruit—rarely include it. This discrepancy confuses home bakers and consumers who encounter recipes for ""coffee cake muffins"" or ""classic coffee cake"" only to find no trace of coffee in the ingredient list. Meanwhile, modern recipes that do incorporate coffee, such as mocha brownies or espresso cookies, further muddy the waters, as the term ""coffee cake"" fails to distinguish between cakes served with coffee and those containing it. This lack of clarity undermines the precision that culinary terminology should strive for, leading to frustration and misunderstanding. 

Beyond grammar, the term ""coffee cake"" misrepresents the cultural heritage of the Kaffee und Kuchen tradition. The German custom is not about a singular type of cake but a diverse array of baked goods enjoyed in a social, coffee-centric context. By reducing this rich tradition to a catch-all term, English speakers have stripped away its nuance and versatility. Kaffee und Kuchen celebrates the pairing of coffee’s bitterness with the sweetness of cakes like Pflaumenkuchen (plum cake) or Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (Black Forest cake), emphasizing the experience over a specific recipe. Calling a streusel-topped cake a ""coffee cake"" in English ignores this broader cultural context, flattening a vibrant tradition into a generic label. Worse, it risks alienating those who seek to honor the German roots of the custom, as the term fails to reflect the social and culinary depth of Kaffeeklatsch. 

The availability of more accurate descriptors provides a compelling case for abandoning ""coffee cake."" Instead of perpetuating a confusing term, we could adopt phrases that better capture the tradition or clarify the recipe. For cakes meant to be paired with coffee, labels like ""cake for coffee,"" ""best with coffee,"" or ""Kaffeeklatsch cake"" would preserve the German spirit while being explicit about the absence of coffee in the recipe. For example, a recipe for Streuselkuchen could be marketed as ""Streusel Cake, Best Served with Coffee,"" instantly clarifying its purpose and avoiding false expectations. For cakes that do contain coffee, such as Mokkakuchen or mocha cupcakes, terms like ""coffee-flavored cake"" or ""espresso cake"" align with standard culinary naming conventions, ensuring transparency. These alternatives are not only more precise but also more respectful of the original tradition, bridging the gap between cultural authenticity and modern clarity. 

Some might argue that ""coffee cake"" is too entrenched in English culinary lexicon to discard, as it’s widely recognized in cookbooks, bakeries, and households. However, entrenchment does not justify perpetuating a flawed term when better options exist. Culinary language has evolved before—terms like ""freedom fries"" or outdated ingredient names have faded in favor of clarity or cultural sensitivity. Transitioning to descriptors like ""best with coffee"" or adopting German-inspired terms like Kaffeekuchen for traditional recipes could gradually shift public understanding without erasing the concept entirely. Education through recipe titles, menus, and food media could ease this transition, emphasizing the joy of pairing cakes with coffee while correcting the misnomer. 

In conclusion, the term ""coffee cake"" is a translational misstep that creates confusion, misrepresents a rich German tradition, and fails to serve modern culinary communication. Its grammatical ambiguity leads consumers to expect coffee in a cake that rarely contains it, while its oversimplification dilutes the cultural significance of Kaffee und Kuchen. By replacing ""coffee cake"" with precise descriptors like ""best with coffee"" for traditional pairings or ""coffee-flavored cake"" for recipes with coffee, we can honor the original custom, reduce confusion, and elevate culinary clarity. It’s time to retire ""coffee cake"" and embrace language that reflects both the heritage and the reality of the baked goods we love to share over a cup of coffee. ",2,1755045414.0,FoodHistory,2,1.0,False

Prologue Part I

Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.

Hollering in the adjoining room was coupled with the sound of fists flying and she scrambled from the bed. Digging around for the clothing and trench coat she’d worn to this hotel room, she considered her clothes were returning to her body with far more alacrity than her paramour from the night before removed them.

The sound of a man begging another to not kill him raised her hackles. Looking around frantically she knew there was only one door from the bedroom to the main hotel door but as she looked at the sliding balcony door, she deliberated whether the balcony met with the other room she’d crossed through the night before.

Grabbing her phone, purse, and shoes in her hands she quietly tiptoed to the balcony, flinching when the unmistakable sound of a silenced gun went off. She knew the pop sound as sure as her last name was Mariani.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, Alcee you idiot!” she whimpered to herself as she stepped onto the patio. The sun was barely breaking the horizon, and the view would have been breathtaking had she not quite possibly just heard someone being murdered in the adjoining suite. “Please don’t let them be Dad’s men.”

Desperately she leaned over the balcony and noted the height of the room she was in and mentally berated herself for falling asleep. Turning to slide along the cool concrete of the balcony, she peered through the crack of the curtains into the room and saw the man she’d spent the night with unscrewing the silencer off the pistol in his hand and glaring down at the body on the floor.

She didn’t recognize him at all and as she looked around the room, she admitted even the three other men in the room who were on their knees in front of her lover and two other men towering over them, were also unknown to her. It wasn’t like she knew all of her father’s men but if someone was coming to drag her sorry ass back, he’d send someone she knew.

Which meant, she was in a hotel room with a man who in the last several minutes committed murder, and she was a witness and if her father found out, he’d order a clean up of the entire group. Not that she’d live to see it if he found out what she’d done before she made her escape. Or worse, if the man in the next room opted to simply get rid of the witness he’d fucked the night before.

She looked around again and grimaced as she looked upward. They were in a penthouse suite. The man who’d purchased her virginity for a cool million the night before was living large. She dropped her trench coat, figuring if she was going to have to shimmy onto the roof of the balcony and try to get to the roof of the hotel, she wasn’t going to be able to do it wearing a long coat. Then her eyes caught the drop again and she knew there was no way she was going to be able to get off the balcony.

She needed to find another way. She was a nerd not an athlete and scaling a building to a rooftop was going to lead to her death and she hadn’t just boldly defied her father and grandfather by giving up her virginity to a stranger instead of the man they’d betrothed her to since she was a teenager to die falling off a building.

“Good going Alcee,” she muttered under her breath, “you managed to find your escape from the Mariani family only to stupidly fall into bed with a murderer. Fuck.” She kicked a chair and then cringed as the metal scraped along the concrete floor of the patio then clattered against the glass door.

When the patio door slid open and her lover from the night before stuck his head out, she immediately cowered in the other chair. Bruno was drop dead gorgeous and incredibly massive. Easily six foot six with shoulders as wide as a linebacker’s and his feet were twice the length of hers. Her body clenched with the memory of what else was humungous on him and she shivered. If she hadn’t been so terrified in this moment, she’d be parting her legs like Moses did the sea.

“What are you doing out here?”

“Watching the sunrise,” she met his gaze fearfully, swallowing her terror where it boiled like a festering sourdough-starter in her gut. “I was going to leave but you seemingly have company.” Her hands were visibly shaking.

“Aya,” he spoke her fake name gently, moving to kneel in front of her, his hand brushing a dark curl off her forehead before gripping her fingers. “You should still be sleeping. Did I not wear you out enough?”

She shook her head unable to meet his gaze, “you, um, there was yelling, and I don’t like confrontation, so I came out here until the yelling stopped.”

“Did you look in the window?” He motioned from where he just emerged.

“No. I came out here as soon as the yelling got really loud, and I simply sat here.” She rested her chin on her knees and prayed he bought her story.

“Good girl,” he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I would very much like for us to see each other again but I can’t do so if you’re poking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”

“I understand, Bruno,” she whispered twisting her lips.

“You are so fucking beautiful,” he whispered as he leaned closer stroking her cheek. His eyes were a warm honeyed brown with flecks of gold, and they stared into hers like he was staring into her soul.

The scent of gunpowder was on his fingers, and it made her heart pound with fear, but she feigned ignorance as she closed her eyes when his lips connected with hers.

Prologue Part II

When he broke the kiss she was almost distracted from the goings-on in the adjoining room.

“I told you before, I am a very wealthy man. Do you know why I bought you last night, darling?”

She shook her head, “rich men do crazy things all the time.”

“My last lover gave me an STD.” her eyes flicked to his in horror and he held up his hand, “I am clean now, as attested to by the medical report you insisted, I provide ahead of our meeting, but getting chlamydia a year ago made me want to try something completely different. A virgin was going to ensure I was safe from the machinations of a twisted, cheating, lover’s mind. I wasn’t expecting you to be as,” he paused, the back of his knuckles dragging over her bottom lip, “responsive and excitable as you turned out to be. I want you to stay. If you can be a good girl and sit here and wait until my men finish their discussion,” he drawled the word out, “then we can pick up where we left off. Since I’m your first I was hoping we can continue to see each other.”

She finally met his gaze, “you paid me a million dollars for one night, Bruno. I didn’t think it would lead to more than the one night. I have college classes, and my family is likely waiting for me.” She looked at his watch, “my family always does brunch on Sundays. I can’t miss it.”

“I would like to meet your family. I’m not letting you go, darling girl. Last night was bar none, the most exquisite night of my life and knowing you are untouched by any other man is bringing out the most primal part of me to keep you as mine and mine alone.”

She was truly terrified now, “I don’t understand.”

“I want you to be my mistress. Long term. We will fuck every night and likely every morning too,” his dark eyes were heated as they looked her over, “and in return, I will take care of your every need. There is nothing you or your family should want for. If you wish to continue your education, I have no issue with this. Where do you go to school?”

“NYU.”

“What are you taking?”

“Graphic design.” All the back story she’d concocted when she’d started this game came to her easily. She’d practiced it enough.

“Then you will continue. I’ll have your courses paid for. It won’t cost your family anything.” He frowned, “why did you sell your virginity online? What prompted you to do so?”

Alcee found herself wondering how he could hold a conversation as he was while there was a dead man in the next room but then it dawned on her, he was distracting her while the men cleaned up the situation.

“I needed the money.”

“For?”

Twisting her fingers nervously she shrugged, “school is expensive, and my parents have three kids including me. My program is sixty thousand dollars over four years. I have student loan debt and then when I graduate, I want to start my own business, and the start-up is expensive. One of my girlfriends suggested doing this black-market thing as an auction. One of her cousins did it to pay off her student loans instead of stripping. I was only looking for the sixty thousand for my program, but you bid a million and here we are.”

“You come from a large family.”

“Yes.”

Her family consisted of five children, with four older brothers, another lie told. All four of them were in arranged engagements and marriages. Her eldest brother Mercurio was married seven years ago when he was twenty-five to the daughter of his father’s Consigliere Panfilo. Panfilo was her father’s second cousin which meant her brother married within the family. She herself couldn’t fathom having sex with someone they shared DNA history with but to keep it in the family, her brother toed the line. If he wanted to be Don someday, he did what was demanded of him by their father.

“I will provide for your family.” He said as he rose to stand in front of her, extending his hand out.

A man stuck his head out the door, “Bruno, sir, we have relocated our guests, if you and your companion would like to head to the other suite across the hall for breakfast.”

“Thank you,” he nodded to the man. “Come. We will have breakfast together and discuss our future.” He lifted up her trench coat off the patio table and wrapped it over her shoulders.

Draping his arm around her he edged her through the room where the body had been, and she made certain to keep her eyes averted. Twenty-one years of living as the princess to the Mariani family, she knew when she was supposed to keep her eyes and mouth shut.

Just as he escorted her into a room across the hall, another man wearing an obvious holster came into the hall and she flinched.

“He is my head of security. As I said, I am quite wealthy and have many enemies.”

“Sir, a word?” the man motioned for Bruno to return to the suite they’d just vacated.

She didn’t waste any time. The moment the two men disappeared into the room and closed the door; she was pulling the door to the suite she was in open and racing to the far end of the hall through the emergency stairwell.

After racing down multiple flights of stairs she stopped to take a breath, wheezing like an asthmatic missing their inhaler. “Holy shit, Alcee, you need to exercise more,” she hissed at herself.

Eventually she reached the bottom floor and then made her way to the parking garage. It didn’t take long to find her way into the early morning traffic and to flag down a yellow taxi.

Giving directions to her parent’s estate, she was dropped off outside the gates and made the slow walk up the driveway.

Her mother was right behind the butler who opened the front door, her hand going to her mouth in horror, as she took in her daughter’s walk of shame, “Alcee, what have you done?”

Taking a deep breath, she met her mother’s gaze directly, “if anyone was going to sell off my virginity it was going to be me. You can tell Papa unless Don Lozano is interested in a bride who is no longer pure, I’m of no use to either family.”

A fleeting thought of the passion of the night before taunted her as she considered perhaps, she should have stayed with the murdering rich man named Bruno as all hell broke loose.

Working For A Living I

“Susana,” Alcee groaned into her cell phone as she knelt under the desk of one of the administrators from the upper management floor, “I don’t have time for this.”

“Make time.”

The constant demands of her friends on her time was something they fought about constantly. While they were under the protection of their family, she was without and they seemed to always forget she was putting her life at risk each time she stepped outside her front door. Life wasn’t so easy when you were an ex-principessa and the streets knew the Mariani Don didn’t care if you lived or died.

“Can’t. I’m working overtime tonight.”

“Ditch it.”

“Unlike you who still has her trust fund,” she grunted as she adjusted an HDMI cable and sighed, “I need to work.” There was always a terrible fear her money would run out and she’d be struggling to provide for Antero.

“You have money in the bank!”

“There are savings in the event something happens, and I lose my job or get sick or suffer an accident or all of the above. My nest egg protects me and my family. My job keeps us fed and housed.” She backed out from under the desk and shoved back up her glasses which slipped down her nose. She plunked herself down in the chair and booted up the computer on the desk and waited for it to come back on.

“Alcee, you need to live a little.”

“Look, I’m working right now. There are six more computers I need to get set up before I can go home at the end of the day. I would very much like to focus on my task.”

“You work too hard. This isn’t good for you.”

“I work exactly hard enough to keep me alive and out of my father’s crosshairs, Susana.”

“You owe me.”

“How? On what planet does me declining a dinner invite which is a double date, a blind date for me, turn into me owing you one? This isn’t adding up.”

“I don’t know how, but you owe me. We are going do to do this double date at some point so stop putting it off.”

“Whatever,” she hung up the phone and then typed on the keyboard and watched with pleasure as the system came up and running. One down. Six more to go.

When she left her parent’s home six years ago, or more accurately when her father threw her out with nothing but the clothes on her back for being a disgrace, she’d managed to find her footing relatively quickly.

Getting hired on as an IT general specialist straight out of college at a large security firm in Manhattan, she’d been able to make a career for herself. The only hiccup was when three years ago, the company switched hands, and the Lozano family purchased the company lock stock and barrel. She’d been terrified for months they would note her last name on the employee list and fire her, or worse, kill her.

Instead, despite the sale, the new owners of the company hadn’t set foot in the building in the three years they’d owned it. The rumor mill said they were quite happy with the way the current president of the company was running things.

The current president of the company, Kylen, was hired by the previous CEO. Kylen was an ex-Navy seal who hired mostly the men and women he’d worked with in the forces or were referred to him. Alcee who was hired by the previous CEO remained one of the few outliers taken on with the recommendations of one of her college professors. She’d passed the vetting process, all the background checks and even her last name hadn’t been able to stop them from hiring her and the prior CEO took her under her wing and made her his honorary granddaughter. When he’d retired and sold the company, she knew he’d insisted to Kylen to keep her on.

It seemed the new owners presumed the current company president kept staff in place he trusted and as such nobody even breathed her name the wrong way during the transition of the company following the sale to the Lozano family. Mr. Kylen Burgess stayed on as the president and the Lozano family never bothered too much.

She knew they came to attend board meetings and the like, but she was what the upper management group called a troll. She and the other six IT generalists lived in the lower levels of the company, often referred to as the bowels of hell, by the rest of the employees. She personally found the moniker funny because in her Italian Catholic upbringing, hell was supposed to be hot, and the computer lab floor was colder than the rest of the building.

She was smirking to herself at the thought when one of her counterparts came grumbling in her direction. “What’s up, Tank?”

Tank was one of the military-trained IT guys and in command of their department. He reported directly to Kylen. He also lived up to his name in terms of size but he was usually a gentle soul, happy to sit behind his desk and plug along on a keyboard.

“All the fucking bigwigs are upstairs. Kylen let me know the CEO is moving from his office in Europe to New York. He let me know now, as in right this minute instead of, you know, giving me a heads up so I could prepare for this shit.”

She felt her stomach drop to her feet. She’d jinxed herself by even thinking of the Lozano family.

“The CEO?”

“Torquato Lozano.”

Fuck. She was going to puke. She was going to projectile vomit all over the desktop she’d put together.

Working For A Living II

Torquato Lozano. To the business world he was a hard-nosed businessman but to those who knew what la famiglia meant, he was the Don of the Lozano family. He’d boldly and brutally overthrown his own father for the title when his grandfather stepped down. He’d been thirty-two when he took control of his family. He’d done so only one year after his family rescinded the marriage agreement once they found out she wasn’t a virgin any longer.

Now he’d be roughly thirty-seven years old, a Don for five years now and he’d made a hell of a name for himself. Her brother and he were the same age and while her brothers still talked to her and kept her in the loop about things which she needed to be aware of for her protection, the one thing her eldest brother always said was Don Lozano scared the fuck out of him, and they’d grown up with Edgardo Mariani for a father.

To this day, there wasn’t a single direct photograph of the Don of the Lozano family. Unlike his father who frequently postured and grandstanded for the notoriety of it all, Torquato operated in the shadows. Rumors swirled that he was ugly with scars running over his face and a temper to match.

It was why, of course, she’d gone through the lengths she’d gone to avoid marrying him. The last thing she wanted was to be the unwilling bride to a sadist who was ten years older than her and wanted a wife who was nothing more than a brood mare to be raped and bred day in and out until she popped out the heir to his throne.

She’d taken a big risk doing what she’d done but it paid off. Auctioning off her virginity on the dark web had been a burst of insanity. Nobody could trace who she was because she was a damn good hacker so Bruno would never be able to find out anything more than the backstory, she meticulously created and left breadcrumbs about. Her family would never figure out who to whom she’d sold herself because all traces of the experience were wiped clean, by her own hand. Once her mother threw her into her room to await her father’s arrival, she’d been on her computer in seconds, eradicating all the images of her from the hotel surveillance and nearby traffic lights, she’d transferred the money she’d received to an offshore account and erased every digital print of the night as if it never happened.

She knew she’d also done Bruno a solid because in removing every trace of herself from the computer system, she also got rid of all the evidence of his men disposing of the three bodies.

Emerging from her memory she crinkled her nose at Tank, “I’m sorry, what did you say?”

“I need you upstairs with me to help me set up the two offices. I can do the programming for the security systems we need to run but I need a second set of hands to get this done.”

“Tank, I must get the other desks set up. I’m already working overtime.”

“Not my problem. You’ll stay later.”

“Are you going to arrange the babysitter?” she shot back at him angrily, shoving her glasses back up her nose. “In case you forgot I have a kid at home who I’d like to at least see for a few minutes before he goes to bed.”

Tank sighed, “look, let’s set the offices up upstairs and then you and I will come down here and get this done.”

“Which part do you not get? My sitter is only there for two more hours. Not a minute more. If I lose my sitter, I will quit my job and then you lose one of our IT team.”

“Fine. You can come in early tomorrow.”

“Do they call you Tank because you run roughshod all over people like a tank?” It was a comment she’d made multiple times over the years.

He chuckled. “I’ll call one of the other guys to come in early. Deal?”

“Deal.” She dropped what she was doing and followed him down the hall towards the elevator. Her stomach was still churning. “When you said they were upstairs, they’re not in the offices, are they? I mean there is nothing set up yet.”

“They’re working out of the boardroom for now. They showed up unannounced or, according to Kylen with one hour’s notice. Also, the secretary or admin assistant or whatever the socially appropriate name is now for the woman who gets his coffee and dry cleaning, is a piece of work. She’s wearing six-inch heels, more lipstick than a Vogue cover girl and makes me feel every bit as insecure as I did when I got picked on by the cheer captain in middle school. I swear she’s every nerd’s worst nightmare.”

“You were a nerd, Tank?”

“I got big in the army, Alcee and switched my coke-bottle glasses for contacts but in here,” he tapped his chest, “fifteen-year-old skinny Ezekiel who preferred playing chess against the computer than talking to people still doesn’t like bitchy women who chew little boys like me up.”

She chuckled, “she can’t be so bad.”

“She took one look at Kylen, and he made sure to put the entire length of the board room table between them. I’ve known him a long time and let me tell you, even he is steering clear of her. Her name is Genevra and she’s the reason the term mean girls was coined.” He pushed the button to the top floor and jammed his fists into his pockets. “These are the days I miss mine-clearing operations.”

As the doors opened to the top floor, she found herself heartily agreeing with him. A sinking feeling the risk of her being on this floor or doing the task he’d now mentioned were equally devastating if the Lozano family found issue with her working in their building.

Fired? Part I

 

She was quickly trying to get the desk set up with dual monitors, ergonomic keyboards, state of the art laptop with all the bells and whistles as far as printers and speakers and all the other accoutrements went.

The longer she worked, the more she realized she needed to resign. She’d worked for three years too long here. The minute the company shifted hands, despite the fact the CEO was rumored to be in Italy and intended to keep his base there, she should have sought employment elsewhere. She’d taken false safety in hiding right under the enemy’s nose.

The clicking of heels on the tiled floor coming in her direction made her cringe as she heard Tank utter a muffled “fuck me”. She looked into the open doorway of the CEO’s office where the giant of a man was working and saw the shudder go through him as he heard the woman approaching before, he saw her.

The woman’s muttering in Italian, a series of curses about how slow the staff was and how uncultured New Yorkers were made Alcee’s head throb and suddenly Alcee forcing herself not to divulge she could speak the language. Instead, she kept her head bent and unravelled a long cord. If she didn’t engage the woman perhaps, she’d be left alone. Her thought was incredibly short lived.

“Make sure those cords are not anywhere I am going to trip on them.” The woman’s voice shrilly skittered along Alcee’s spine.

“Yes ma’am,” she nodded, not looking up to make eye contact. She held up a clip which would conceal and pin the cords to the underside of the desk. “This will keep them off your feet.”

“Ugh, how much longer will you be?”

“Another thirty minutes, forty max.”

“Not acceptable. I want it done in fifteen minutes.”

Alcee shot a glance at Tank at the other desk, and he pressed his lips together in frustration. She felt the same sense of foreboding at the woman’s tone and knew she would not like the answer. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”

“Make it possible.”

“And if I can’t?”

“Then you’re fired.”

This time the look she shot to Tank had him sitting up and getting ready to rush towards her. She knew the glint in her eye was not anything he could miss. This woman gave her a get out of jail free card and she’d never lost a game of Monopoly in her life. She was taking this little card and running with it.

“No, no, no, Cee, let me help.” Tank moved far faster than a man his size should as he vacated the desk he was working to prepare to come assist her.

“You cannot help her. You need to finish Mr. Lozano’s set up. He needed in his office hours ago. Instead, he is working at an uncomfortable table.”

Her accent was thick, and Alcee was convinced she was exaggerating it because she knew she could do the exact same thing if she wanted. Despite sounding as American as apple pie most of the time, if Alcee were in Italy right now, she’d blend in with her family as if she’d never left the country. The woman was trying to act as if she were better than them because of her Italian background. It made Alcee want to leave all the more. Phony bitch.

“You are given fifteen minutes, or you’re done.” The woman glared at her.

Alcee stood up from the desk, ignoring Tank’s groan and dropped the cords. “You don’t need to fire me. I quit. Ciao stronza,” she bowed deeply at the waist and turned to look at Tank with a smug grin. “Call security to meet me at my locker since it’s protocol to escort all employees who are fired or resigned from the premises.” She considered skipping to her locker.

“No, Alcee, you can’t quit,” he chased after her.

The other woman was blinking incredulously as if she’d expected Alcee to argue and try to keep her job. Did the woman actually believe she’d beg? As if. She was a Mariani. Mariani don’t beg. She might not be her father’s principessa but the name on her birth certificate was deep in her DNA. Her pride ran in her blood thicker than any other of her traits.

Kylen happened to be coming out of the board room as she hit the button for the elevator. “Tank, where are you two going? The set up can’t be done yet.”

“The ice princess over there, fired Alcee because Alcee said it would take thirty-to-forty minutes to finish the desk set up. I’m trying to beg her not to leave. Genevra wanted it done in fifteen minutes and it’s impossible. Not only that but the physical set up can be done in thirty or forty minutes but then I need to get into the computer and get it up to the standard of the company. If their laptops hadn’t gotten destroyed, then we wouldn’t be in this situation, but Mr. Lozano made it clear his personal computer is not to be associated with the business and the one he brought from Italy was destroyed in the car accident this afternoon.” He mumbled under his breath about bullets in a laptop making Alcee’s spine straighten. “We’re setting up a brand-new system for the pair of them and she’s making impossible demands. We were rushing as best we could. As it was, Alcee was supposed to be setting up the new marketing department upgrades this evening, and we let it go until tomorrow. I arranged for a crew to come in at six tomorrow to do what Alcee was taken away from completing downstairs.”

* Oct 3-6: 3 nights in Sorrento
   * 1 day for Pompeii, 1 full day in Sorrento
* Oct 6-8: 2 nights in Rome
   * Planning to travel to Rome Oct 6 morning to maximize this day.
   * Would like to see Vatican, Colosseum, and walk around to a few other places
* Oct 8-13: 5 nights in Florence
   * Including a day trip to Lucca (looking into e-bike rental in Pisa and bike to Lucca to see some of the countryside)
   * Possible day trip to to Siena
* October 13-16: 3 nights in Bologna
   * Day trip to Parma and Modena (both in same day)
* October 16-18: 2 nights in Venice
   * I've heard mixed reviews that it is like Disneyland, but I'd love to see it myself and form a first-hand opinion. Planning to see Doge's Palace and Piazza San Marco early, then explore outside tourist areas for the rest of the time.
* October 18: Fly home

Please sanity check our itinerary. Are we doing too much?

I am a bit conflicted about traveling between 5 cities in 15 days, but want to see all of these places. For context, 2 years ago in Japan, we did 5 nights in Tokyo, 3 in Kyoto, and 2 in Osaka. I loved this trip, but the travel with luggage was my least favorite part of the trip.

I have yet to purchase a moka pot and I’m in the researching phase of what size to get, what coffee to invest in and what grinder to invest in. Here’s an idea of my needs in order to help me moving forward.

I’ll be brewing only for myself, I tend to not like an overly strong coffee and I’m only just learning about coffee types. 

I was thinking of investing in a 3 cup moka pot to start with. Would this be ideal for 1-2 people?

What type of coffee should I purchase?

What kind of grinder should I look for?

1mopug8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mopug8,"These are what’s left from Camp Papago, the WW2 POW camp for Germans that used to be in Papago Park","When I was a kid there used to be some wooden buildings on the lot south of McDonald’s at Scottsdale rd and Thomas. As a kid I didn’t pay them any mind, but at some point I remember my dad mentioning they were from world war 2. He said they were for the Japanese though, and I could never find any info about a POW camp nearby for the Japanese, so I assumed my dad got the wrong story and didn’t know what they were. Recently I was trying to remember what used to be there, and thankfully the Scottsdale sub remembered and confirmed that they were part of a POW camp, just not for the Japanese. They were part of Camp Papago, used to house Germans during the war. 

In 1946 they shut the whole place down, not having any need for the giant complex anymore. Many buildings were sold to people in town, becoming garages, housing, sheds, etc. The ones I saw so often as a kid in Scottsdale were brought there in 1947 and used as apartments called Lantron’s Court. It had more barracks back in the day, but by the mid 90s it was just those 5 where the concrete slabs still stand. The owner of the land chose to give away the buildings around 2004 or 2005 as they hadn’t been used for years and were falling apart. He didn’t have the money or space to move them, so there was a risk they’d be demolished if no one stepped up. A man from Scottsdale paid to have one moved to his home (the one in pics 12 & 13. 13 is from 2016 Zillow listing), along with another man in Phoenix. Later on, the same man from Scottsdale would buy another building, the officer’s quarters (pics 10 & 11. 11 is from 2016 Zillow listing), after there weren’t any takers. The last two (pics 14 - 19) were taken by the Tempe Historical Preservation Foundation, who had plans on restoring at least one to be a museum. There were originally plans for the City of Scottsdale to take the remaining 3 buildings, restore them, and put them up at McCormick-Stillman rail park. This never happened though.

The ones taken by the Scottsdale man were restored and are still a private residence. The location isn’t that secretive, but it was shared when the guy who moved them was still alive. Since it’s a different owner, I’m not gonna share their location. The one moved to Phoenix was only mentioned in old news articles, and I haven’t been able to find out where exactly it went. The two in Tempe are at the Field Services Facility along Priest, but they are down a roadway that has signs posted saying only city vehicles allowed along with no trespassing signs, so you can’t really see them except for when driving west on Rio Salado right before the Beck Ave light. Their roofs are just visible. These seem to be the most well known surviving structures besides the Officer’s Club.

Shown in pic 9, the Officer’s Club is the only building still standing at Camp Papago. It hasn’t been moved, standing in the same spot it did 82 years ago when the camp opened. Nothing else besides the base of a guard tower in pic 8 are left on the grounds, with most of it being redeveloped into housing and baseball fields. It’s likely some of these houses used materials from buildings that used to be there or just had whole structures reused, but nothing that was removed from the camp seems to be well documented. 

Picture 1 shows the faculty office building at Scottsdale Community College. When the college was first started in the 70s, many of the buildings were reused barracks. This particular one was used by Marshall Trimble, the current state historian, when he was a teacher at SCC. Over the years the rest were tore down, leaving only this and the two buildings now used for CNUW. These are shown in pic 2, and were moved to that spot sometime in the early to mid 80s. I couldn’t find anything online about them being linked to Camp Papago, but very few have anything online linking them. A staff member I talked to told me that they were told the buildings were from an old German POW camp, so it’s likely they’re from there. They don’t match any other building on campus either. 

Pictures 3 - 5 show a group of 5 buildings that were formerly part of the camp. I’m not sure what they were used as after the war, but in the early 2000s they were moved to their current location at 1028 Grand Ave. This is another case of nothing being online about it, but I luckily ran into one of the guys who helped set them up here when I came by. Really nice guy who confirmed they were from the German POW camp. Come by and check it out if you’re in the area. I’ll be going back to try the coffee on a day they’re actually open, and the ice cream is supposedly really good.

Picture 6 shows AZ Exotic Bird Rescue Inc, operating out of a former barrack moved to this spot on Scottsdale rd in 1946 by Buck Saunders. Buck was more known for his gallery in Old Town Scottsdale on Brown, but they still had this location till at least 1999 according to building permits in the property records. It doesn’t look as it did back in the 40s, having an addition to the front done in 1970. You can see the addition where the roof extends down further. In 2001 it was bought by Rage Cycles who operated in the building until 2015. It would sit vacant through 2016 until the bird rescue would move in sometime during 2017. In the neighborhood behind this, quite a few buildings look like they might be former barracks, but I can’t find any solid evidence of it besides them being from the 50s and they look similar to some other barracks.

The last one I know of is a private residence not too far from where Lantron’s Court used to be. Thats the building in picture 7. It’s another one where I don’t have online evidence, but people in the area have said it is from the camp. It was moved here in 1946. There’s not as much to tell about this one.

Picture 20 isn’t a structure, but it’s the spot where an escape tunnel came out. The story is known as the Great Papago Escape. It’s a really interesting story that I can’t do justice with a quick write up. I’ll link to the Wikipedia article, but there’s been a few books written about it for anyone that wants to dive deeper.

It’s hard to know how many are actually left in town because the people who took them off the camp are long gone, and not many were documented. A lot of the ones that were reused have since been torn down in the past 80 years, or been remodeled to be unrecognizable. Some were integrated into houses, and others are hidden away in backyards where they’ll never be seen, most having owners that likely know nothing about its history. It’s great that there’s still quite a few that have been well taken care of and are still in use though. If you know of any others, please feel free to share! If I made any mistakes, please correct me, I’m not an expert, just really interested in the subject.",20,1755044761.0,phoenix,6,0.95,False

TW: break ups, psychiatric facilities, death, suicidal attempts, pet death, police.

Have you seen one of those movies where everything goes wrong and it's almost comical?

I survived the worst year of my life.

It started with a horrible break up with my fiancé. We had been together for 5 years. I was kicked out of my home with my fiancé, and my councilors told me that meant I was homeless. They told me I needed to be with people who care about me.

Context: I was still in a partial care facility after my first in-patient visit. I had MDD and developed severe Catatonia. After some medication to reverse the Catatonia, I was put in a partial care program. I would be in my program from 8-3 Mon-fri. This program would last at least 9 months. While there, I would go to groups and get more therapy/be under observation by trained professionals.

So, I got in contact with my family. The only person who could come get me was my uncle. He basically saved me. I moved into my grandmas, where my uncle and dad were both living. My dad was taking care of my gram, and my uncle was going through a divorce.

I moved into my grandpa's room. He died just a few months ago. It wasn't easy, but I had my cat Hasslehoff. He was my emotional support animal and comforted me. His purring could calm even the most intense panic attacks I had. 

I had to start my program at a new place, closer to where I moved. I had been with my ex for so long, the break up was not easy. My ex cheated on me and I broke up with them. But I could get through it. I realized I had to rediscover who I was before our relationship.

After a month of being at my grandma's one day my uncle collapsed. He was unresponsive. I called my dad to help me. My dad used to be a paramedic and he realized my uncle was unconscious. I called 911. While I was on the phone, my uncle stopped breathing. Me and my dad took turns giving him CPR while waiting for the ambulance. 

The EMS worked on him for an hour before they pronounced him dead. 

My uncle saved me. 
But I couldn't save him. 

It was the most traumatic thing I ever experienced. My poor grandmother had to experience losing her husband and a son within a year.

I continued my program and shared my experience. It was just too horrible. I was struggling to heal. 

My dad watched his little brother die in front of him.

It's so hard to write all of this. It's difficult to remember what happened next. 

Hasslehoff got sick. He started losing weight and coughing. I brought him to the vet, and the vet said he'd take some tests. Heard back later and learned that Hasslehoff had cancer. The vet wasn't sure what kind, maybe bone or lungs because of the coughing. 
My ESA was now slowly dying. The next month he was getting worse, he wouldn't eat anymore. He was still drinking water. The last vet visit, the vet said he was dying. I was broken. I didn't know what to do. I asked the vet if we could make Hasslehoff more comfortable. The vet offered to give him a diuretic, to help his breathing. He warned me that if he gave it to him, Hasslehoff would deteriorate very quickly. I figured that meant he would die sooner. I gave my consent. 
That night, Hasslehoff's back legs stopped working. He still crawled into the litter box to use it one last time. I was just constantly crying. By 1am he was howling and looked afraid. I put him on the bed with me, in his usual place and cuddled him. 
Hasslehoff was only ten years old and I adopted him when he was a kitten.
So I was shocked when he suddenly bit my arm. Hard. It wasn't a nip it was an aggressive chomp. All four fangs punctured my skin deep. And he wasn't letting go. I was flabbergasted and shook. I didn't understand why he just did that. I looked into his eyes but his pupils were huge, and he didn't even look at me. He was looking through me. He was blind, he couldn't see me. 
He was dying. I started crying more and tried to pry his mouth off my arm. In the process he bit my thumb and I held him back. I struggled to process what to do. Why was he biting ME? Why me? As I watched him, I felt like he was asking me for help. Was he panicking? Was he actively dying and afraid? Was his brain failing and he was lashing out without realizing? I don't know. All I knew was that I loved him so much and I didn't want him to suffer anymore. 
I loved my cat with my entire soul. And when I tell you I could not imagine my future without him, perhaps you can understand why I attempted to unalive myself after he died. I just wanted to follow him into the beyond. I'm crying as I write this. It was the hardest thing I had to experience. I sliced open both my arms and held his limp body and cried myself asleep.

I was confused when I woke up. I was not dead and I had to face the brutal reality. I didn't tell anyone that I attempted to unalive myself. I told my friends and family that Hasslehoff died. I washed my blood off his fur the next day.

Then the police showed up at my door. They had questions about Hasslehoff. They had an anonymous tip about a suspicious animal death. Suspicious? Anonymous? Wtf? I had only told my closest friends and family about Hasslehoff dying. Wtf was so suspicious about that? 

So I ended up having to go to the police station to tell them about what happened to Hasslehoff. Then they asked about my dad's dog. She had been sick and also died that night. 

Wtf was going on? The Police thought I killed our pets? What the f? Who called the police?! 

No one called the police to do a wellness check. It was not a wellness check, it was an arrest. They took my damn cat and accused me of animal cruelty! I had proof my cat was sick from going to the vet for months. We had proof the dog was sick and my dad vouched for me. 

My family didn't call the police. It was one of my fucking 'friends'. 

I've never had a history of animal abuse or neglect or anything. I've never had a history of violence or anger. This just came out of left field, no warning. Animal control took my cat as 'evidence'.

I told the police everything. How I attempted suicide and showed them my cuts and the bites. The police tried to twist  it like I killed my cat and the bites were defensive wounds. I was enraged.

They handcuffed me to a metal bench for about 7 hours. I don't know why it took so long. Someone actually brought me a piece of cold pizza. Then the psych bus came. They put me in a 48 hour suicide watch instead of jail. 

Who the fuck called the police?! It was eating me up inside. It's all I could think about the whole time I was in the psych hold. When I got home I shut down my social media. No one would ever know the details of my life again.

A week later, my grandma died. I left the house to get coffee and when I came home they were taking her out of the house on a stretcher. My dad asked 'where were you?' In the most heart-breaking voice. 

I wish I didn't get coffee on that day.
I wish I had been with my dad.
He told me he found grandma unresponsive and checked her. She wasn't breathing and he had to give her CPR and call the ambulance. He was all alone. I was so mad at myself.

The house was in grandma's name. Both me and my dad had to find a new place to live. 

I was going to be homeless again. 

My grandma was like my other parent growing up. She stepped up when my dad was drunk or getting high. It crushed me when she died.

All of this tragedy happened within the span of a year. It was too much. I felt alone, no friends that I felt I could trust. The pain was too much. I planned a second suicide attempt. I would make sure my dad didn't have to find me. I wouldn't take the car. I would walk to a public place and take all my sleep pills. I'd just fall asleep. 
So I put my pills in my pocket and started walking. I held the bottle in my hand. I didn't care how cold it was outside, I'd be dead soon.
But half way there my legs just stopped working.
I didn't really have an epiphany. My legs just stopped. I was just in a daze. I walked home, completely numb physically and emotionally.

I was faced with the legal fallout from the animal abuse bullshit. I wanted to plead innocent but it was the state verses me. My appointed attorney told me it would be better to plead guilty and do some kind of deal. So I did a pre-trial program and allegedly because I have no record and I've never been arrested before (first offense), it would be purged from my record. Because that's how Justice is in my country. It doesn't matter if you're innocent or guilty. All that mattered is that someone called the police.
So thankfully I talked to my public defender, and I asked to look at my case file. I could finally find out who the fuck called the police. 
It had been my 'best friend'. This person had been my absolute best friend for seventeen years, we went on vacations together, did a ceremony to become spiritual family (even had our blood mixed together in a vial as a symbol), I was the person of honor at their wedding. Like BEST FRIEND. I even took care of THEIR PETS when they were moving. 
Why would this person call the police? Why would they think I'd torture/maim/murder my beloved ESA? 
To this day I have no closure.
To this day I don't know why.
So, I had two years of reporting to a parole officer every month just to tell them I wasn't abusing any animals (and I couldn't even have any pets during that time). 
I had to move out of my grandma's home. My dad moved far away to live with his girlfriend. I moved out of state as well and moved in with my mom. 

I'm still trying to recover from that terrible year. I'm surprised I survived. I really didn't want to. In retrospect I'm glad I survived. I've had a child since then.

There is only so much trauma someone can take. You never know what someone has been through. Always be kind to each other and treat each other with compassion and consideration. 

Update: I still get treatment for my MDD and Catatonia. I still see a therapist and take medication to manage my symptoms. I am stable and not in danger of self harm.",0,1755044529.0,ptsd,1,0.5,False

I’m confused","We’re from the same country, but different states. We met abroad during an exchange program in 2019 and started dating while we were still there.

When the program ended, he moved back to our country before I did, but we kept our relationship going long-distance for about a year and a half. Eventually, we broke up — but we stayed friends.

In 2022, I went to his city (in another state) to take an English test. We met up, and during an intimate moment, he told me he didn’t feel the same way anymore. A few months later, he blocked me on Instagram. Then, a few months after that, he unblocked me and sent me a message saying he did it “out of friendship.” When I questioned why, he said he didn’t want to come back into my life — and that wasn’t his intention. I told him goodbye and made it clear I wasn’t going to let him drift in and out whenever he wanted. That was the last time we spoke in 2022.

We had no contact until last November, when he suddenly followed me on Instagram again and invited me out for coffee to catch up. I declined, saying there wasn’t anything left to talk about — the truth is, I was trying to protect myself, even though I never really stopped thinking about him. Sometimes I avoid reaching out by reminding myself of his faults, the mistakes he made, and the hurtful things he said. But other times, I remember how good we were together, how much I miss him, and how badly I want to feel that again. Then, around June, he unfollowed me again.

Now I’m confused. After all this time, why did he come back just to leave again? Was it curiosity? Loneliness? Something else? I’d appreciate any outside perspectives, because I’m too close to this to see it clearly. 

I still think about him after all this time, and I don’t think he ever truly left my mind. Sometimes I try to remind myself of the things that happened and how deeply they hurt me, but at the same time I remember how great we were together, how much I miss it, and how much I miss him. Thinking about the past, I get the impression that he was never as emotionally open as I was, and for that reason, I never got to know him deeply. I’m scared to reach out to him now because I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few months ago, and I fear that coming back into each other’s lives would be messy for both of us.",1,1755044463.0,u_cutecapybara098,1,1.0,False

Was so nervous.  I finally figured out how to find my table and get my chips by watching for a few minutes while getting a coffee.

Lost 1/3 of my stack when I chickened out on the river bluffing with a weak draw after barreling the first two streets.  3 flush card board and I checked OOP, villian checked and turned over TP/WK.

He is self-employed, so there is no required dress code. He used to take care of himself; however, he's grown his hair long (mid-back), often doesn't brush it, and will go out in public with it a tangled mess, or hair escaping his ponytail. He lost a tooth six years ago, got a prosthetic, and refuses to wear it. He smokes and drinks coffee, so his teeth are very stained, dark yellow/light brown. He won't use whitening strips or get them lightened by the dentist. Hair grows on and out of his nose; he shaves infrequently. He's been doing his own laundry for years and will wear wrinkled/dirty clothes in public. That is, unless he's going around people he wants to impress. 

He's now into collecting firearms and brags about new purchases to others. I've overheard, ""Why doesn't he do something about his teeth instead of buying new toys?"" He is quick to judge and make negative or rude comments about other people's appearance, but doesn't hold himself to the standards he holds others.

Frankly, I am embarrassed by his behavior and have stopped inviting him to business/social functions with me. (I'm socially and professionally active.) We have different last names, so I no longer mention I'm married to him. There have been situations where I did not introduce him. Don't get me wrong, I still love him even though I'm extremely annoyed. Divorce is not an option for me.

I take pride in my appearance. I brush my hair and remove under-eye makeup before I walk out of the bathroom in the morning. I am well-dressed at home and out in the world, as I have been since before we met. I'm frequently told I always look great. Although I'm now twenty-five pounds overweight, I'm always well groomed, stylish, and accessorized, even at home.

I tell him that I don't want people judging him and making fun of him. Husband says I'm being a \*\*\*\*, trying to control him, and he doesn't give a \*\*\*\* what people think about him. He says I am the only one judging him. Our adult kids are embarrassed by his appearance as well; they've asked me if he even brushes his teeth. Only two family members and one friend have dared to say something to him. He has no response to them.

So, AITA? I appreciate your unbiased opinions.

1mopjql,https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/1mopjql/advice_40m_450k/,"Advice (40m, €450k)","Hi everyone,

I’d love some perspective from those further along the path.

Here’s my situation:
	•	Net worth: ~€450k invested in broad index funds
	•	Lifestyle: I genuinely enjoy low-cost hobbies — coffee with friends, walks, hikes, gym, spending time outdoors.
	•	Goal: LeanFIRE at €1 million by around age 45–46.

I have two possible paths:
	1.	Work abroad as an expat — I could hit €1 million about 1 year faster by working full-time in a higher-income country. Downsides: further from family/friends, potential lifestyle adjustment (although I would pick a place with fairly good connectivity to Germany)
	2.	Stay in Germany — I’d likely reach €1 million 1 year later (depending on markets). Upside: I’m close to loved ones and familiar surroundings. 

One issue: in Germany, health insurance is tied to employment, so early retirement is trickier and i would have to work part time. One alternative might be to move somewhere a bit warmer where health insurance is a general benefit and build life there. 

The financial gap is only about a year — so I’m torn between maximizing speed vs. prioritizing where I want to live now.

Question: If you were in my shoes, would you take the faster route abroad or the slower path at home? How much would you value that extra year of freedom vs. the comfort of staying put?

Thanks for your thoughts!

i’ve been using arabica beans to brew my coffee for the past 10 years. for context- i use a niche zero and la marzocco gs3 mp so equipment is not an issue. it works perfectly - balanced shot with great crema. no channeling. 

over the past few years during my (infrequent) travels to certain regions of south east asia - i’ve grown to appreciate certain kinds of coffee of the robusta variant - coffee luwak, vietnamese coffee, etc. they are often brewed via drip/filter. 

however there was a rather famous shop in vietnam that sold beans that states that it is for espresso. this is a blend between arabica and robusta. 

needless to say i was sold - bought a kilo bag of beans and brought it back home- teeming with excitement to explore something new. but that was where i ran into problems. 

no matter how fine i grind (starting from the same settings of how i would grind my arabica beans that yield me a decent shot of espresso) - the puck channels. 

i recall grinding whole robusta beans before even till the finest of fine setting (all the way on the grinder) and it’s still channels. tried this with luwak, etc and its all the same. tried with a puck screen, and it still channels. 

microscopically it looks rather fine? approximately visually similar in particle size compared to the arabica beans. 

i read that robusta beans do not really ?absorb water or smth? any particular reason behind this?

I had made a plan with the support of my psychiatrist for moving out, as he agreed that this step would be helpful in my recovery given how unstable the family home could be. The plan worked out and It was the best thing I’ve ever done for myself. 

Over these four years since, I have taken many steps to improve my mental and physical wellbeing, and my quality of life has improved immensely.  However, whilst I finally had the space to reflect on the years prior to all of this and my childhood, I began to feel so angry. Angry that I had been so afraid of my alcoholic mom and her criticisms, her rages, her behaviour in general, and then upset at how I’ve let her voice rule so much of my own adult decision making and how limited I had become. I began therapy again, and through CBT I had gained a better understanding of how to cope with the fear and anger, plus the guilt I would feel when attempting to set boundaries. 

Since January, I’ve only visited my parents’ home twice, compared to 1–2 times a month before. I met my dad for coffee a few times and I think he knew I was avoiding my mom, her behaviour had become harder to deal with as her alcohol consumption had increased. 

This leads me to last month. After a blowup at the house that occurred between her and my sister, my mom said she was admitting herself to a treatment centre. She’s been there for 3 weeks, and we have been asked to attend a family day on Friday. I don’t mind going, what I do mind though is having to get my head around going from accepting how things were, to getting on board again, being hopeful again and being supportive whilst she’s on this journey. I don’t want to come off insincere to her as I am truly relieved that she wanted this for herself and has engaged with the programme from what I understand, but I am angry all over again and I am afraid of my own life coming undone again by getting involved. I’m aware I’ve come a long way, but I think it’s partly due to the space I’ve put between me and my family. 

Some advice for this part of the journey would be greatly appreciated, I once thought it would never go this direction and I’m a bit lost. Thanks for reading 🫶🏻

My baby is 3.5 months old. Ever since around my 27th birthday, which is about a month ago, she has been extra fussy. Almost every nap time and feed time is a struggle.

Our current schedule is this: M-F 8-4/5 I have the baby while my husband works. I’ve been alone with my baby during weekdays since she was about 8 weeks old, so I know how to soothe her better than my husband. This leads me to doing more bedtimes than him. On a good week, I do about half of bedtimes. On a bad week, all of them. So then I am “on” from 7-9PM. In between bedtime and my husband coming home I will make us dinner, clean bottles, make more formula, and chill. If she is fussy I will step in. Then I take night feedings from bedtime to 3/4AM. When I wake up at 7 I make us breakfast/coffee/tidy up/shower and take her again. Weekends we split care 50/50 while the other person does chores one of the weekend days and then the next day chills and catches up on whatever chores are left. 

I feel so strongly that I must approach every interaction with my baby with compassion and patience. But my patience is wearing so thin. She has been crying everyday so much. Pretty consistently at every feed/naptime. She is also waking every 2 hours to eat/needing consoling at night. By about noon I am counting down the hours until my husband comes home. Her crying is almost unpredictable. We could be having a grand old time and then she will cry even though all her needs are met. So I will change scenery which helps until she cries again. And then I change scenery or activity again. The endless circle. I try to do possums sleep, so keeping her engaged and happy during wake windows is key to me. If she has not had adequate stimulation she will fight sleep, and if she has, she will ALSO fight sleep. So at a loss there. I try to get ahead of her sleepiness by scooping her up before she gets too tired but then she’s mad she’s not playing. If I try to feed her before she’s hungry (and by the time she’s hungry, she’s starving) she will cry or just look at the bottle like, “what are you doing here” 

She no longer gives hunger cues like she used to. She just does 0-100 needing food. Then I have to spend 30 mins calming her before I can feed her and usually I have to feed her while she’s sleepy so she will even take the bottle. 

She’s sleeping with my husband and I am just sitting here scared of bedtime. If it will be a fight. Scared of the nighttime. If she will wake a lot. Scared of being alone with her tomorrow. I am almost scared OF her. 

I don’t have any friends or family. We moved out of state when I was late in my 2nd trimester because my husband got a higher paying job. I am actually 100% alone when my husband is at work. My mom just tells me she is high needs and leaves her advice to that, mostly. 

She is on an acid reducer and a gentle formula. She poops twice a day. Her food intake has always been on the low side. She is not yet 10 pounds. She is making “gah” sounds, can roll over, can bring toys to mouth, sometimes uses her pointer finger to trace objects, recognizes the bottle, smiles, beginning to laugh, and she is trying to sort of drag herself along the floor when she rolls over now. I can *sort* of see her bottom two teeth, and her gums are super swollen. She’s drooling so much she has mucus in her poops now. 

We have a sidecar crib and I have slept on her mattress with her on the floor when she’s extra fussy, which is almost every night now for the past 4 days. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I can’t make her stop crying. I don’t know why I can’t understand her. She’s trying to tell me something and I can’t understand or help her. Today I did every god given thing under the sun to stop her crying and it only got worse and worse until she was screaming. I have to sometimes walk away when she’s like that because I feel myself on the edge of raising my voice. I will have spent 20 minutes with her crying trying to stop it only for it to get increasingly worse. I don’t know what to do anymore or what tomorrow will bring. I used to have hope at the beginning of this fussiness that it would fade in time but there are no signs it will.

# Best Waffle Beanie 2025: top Picks & Buying Guide

The waffle beanie,a timeless classic in the world of headwear,continues its reign as a stylish and functional accessory. Its distinct textured knit pattern not only adds visual appeal but also enhances warmth and comfort. For 2025, the market is brimming with waffle beanies crafted from various materials, boasting diverse designs, and catering to a wide range of personal styles. this guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the best waffle beanies available, helping you make an informed decision and find the perfect one to suit your needs and preferences. Whether you're looking for a cozy companion for chilly winter days or a fashionable addition to your everyday outfit, this buying guide will navigate you through the top contenders and essential considerations.

## key Features Analysis

The modern waffle beanie distinguishes itself through several key features that contribute to its overall functionality, comfort, and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Composition:** A critically important factor in determining the quality and feel of a waffle beanie is its material composition. Waffle beanies are available from a number of materials, with some focusing on a high grade merino wool for comfort and wicking, while others use affordable acrylic mixtures for cost effective warmth. High-quality waffle beanies often incorporate natural fibers such as merino wool, known for its exceptional warmth, breathability, and softness while retaining shape after many uses. Synthetic blends, such as acrylic or polyester, provide durability, affordability, and resistance to shrinking and pilling. Cotton waffle beanies offer a lightweight and breathable option, ideal for milder weather conditions. The choice of material will directly impact the beanie's warmth, comfort, and longevity.

**Knit Density and Texture:** The knit density and texture of the waffle pattern play a crucial role in providing the right level of insulation and creating a distinct visual appeal. A tighter knit density offers enhanced wind resistance and superior warmth retention and can frequently enough be tighter on the bottom of the beanie to prevent stretching. Looser knits, on the other hand, allow for better breathability, preventing overheating and offering a looser more relaxed feel. The depth and definition of the waffle pattern also vary, with some beanies featuring a more pronounced and textured look while others offer a subtle and refined waffle design. This textural variation impacts the overall aesthetic and feel of the beanie.

**fit and Stretch:** A well-fitting waffle beanie should provide a snug and comfortable fit without feeling too tight or restrictive. The ability of the beanie to stretch and conform to the shape of your head is essential for optimal comfort and a secure fit. Waffle beanies with a good amount of stretch will accommodate different head sizes and maintain their shape over time. Elasticized brims or ribbed cuffs further enhance the fit and prevent the beanie from slipping or riding up. Different styles are also available. From tightly fitting beanies to looser beanies with extra headroom to create a ""slouch"" look, the preference for tightness or looseness is a key aspect of a consumer’s preferences.

**Design and Style:** Waffle beanies come in a wide array of designs and styles to suit various personal preferences. Classic waffle knit designs are available in solid colors, offering a timeless and versatile look that can be easily paired with different outfits. Modern variations incorporate bold colors, stripes, or other patterns for a more contemporary and eye-catching appearance. beanies with a pom-pom on top provide a playful and whimsical touch, while those with a folded brim offer a more refined and polished look. Consider your personal style and the occasions you'll be wearing the beanie to select a design that best complements your wardrobe.

## Core Benefits

The waffle beanie presents a multitude of benefits, making it a popular choice for those seeking both style and practicality.

**Superior warmth and Insulation:** The waffle knit structure creates small pockets of air that trap heat,providing excellent insulation against the cold. The texture also helps reduce convective heat transfer. This makes waffle beanies considerably warmer then flat knit beanies of similar thickness during the winter months. Whether you're braving freezing temperatures or simply need an extra layer of warmth on a cool day, a waffle beanie is an ideal choice.

**Enhanced Breathability and Comfort:** Despite providing excellent warmth, waffle beanies are often surprisingly breathable. The textured knit pattern allows for air circulation, preventing overheating and moisture build-up. This enhanced breathability ensures a comfortable wearing experience, even during activities. Good waffle beanies are designed to wick away sweat and moisture from the head and hair through the knit fibers.

**Versatile Style and Aesthetic Appeal:** The waffle beanie is a versatile accessory that can be effortlessly incorporated into a wide range of outfits.Its classic yet textured design adds a touch of visual interest to any look. Whether you're going for a casual, sporty, or even a more dressy aesthetic, a waffle beanie can complement your style and elevate your overall appearance. Many enjoy the beanie look with winter,but also fall and transitional weather,adding a sense of style without overheating.

**Durability and Longevity:** With proper care, a well-made waffle beanie can withstand years of wear and tear. High-quality materials and a sturdy knit construction ensure that the beanie retains its shape and resists pilling or stretching. The resilience of waffle knit makes it an ideal long-term investment in your wardrobe. Beanies using merino or tightly-knit acrylic blends will often last longer then less expensive and loosely assembled beanies.

## FAQs Section

**Are waffle beanies suitable for all weather conditions?**
Waffle beanies are generally well-suited for cold to moderate weather conditions. Depending on the material,they can provide warmth and insulation during winter months while also allowing for breathability during cooler spring or autumn days. For very hot weather, a lightweight cotton beanie might be a better choice, but waffle beanies are not typically recommended.

**How should I care for my waffle beanie to ensure its longevity?**
The care instructions for waffle beanies vary depending on the material. In general, it's best to hand wash your beanie in cold water with a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the fibers. lay the beanie flat to dry, away from direct sunlight or heat, to prevent shrinking or stretching.Some waffle beanies can be machine washed on a gentle cycle, but always check the care label first.

**Will a waffle beanie stretch out over time?**
Waffle beanies can stretch out slightly over time, especially if they are made from natural fibers like cotton or wool. To minimize stretching, avoid over-stretching the beanie when putting it on or taking it off. When not in use, store the beanie flat or folded to help it retain its shape. Some waffle beanies feature elasticized elements to help prevent a ""stretched out"" or overly distorted beanie.

**Can I wear a waffle beanie with different hairstyles?**
Yes, waffle beanies are very versatile and can be worn with a variety of hairstyles. Short hair, long hair, ponytails, or even messy buns can all be comfortably accommodated under a waffle beanie. Experiment with different ways of wearing the beanie to find a style that complements your hair and face shape. Some wear it tight to the head, while others wear more loosely with more of a ""slouch"" look.

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England, big into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site that made it on the news. (Yes, seriously.)

I’ve been fortunate to find community through cosplay—whether I’m suited up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil—and even got featured on the news a couple times for it. I work out, dress sharp, and have a bizarre talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes.

Now for the honest bit: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want love, but because timing, shyness, and life just never lined up. But I’ve grown a lot—and I’m ready to meet someone for something real. If you’re nerdy, kind, curious, and value connection over perfection, we might vibe well.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

I’m a 35-year-old nerd from New England who’s deeply into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. (Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—yes, really.)

Despite being outgoing, kind, and involved in some awesome communities, I’ve never been in a relationship. It’s something I’ve always hoped for, and I’m still holding out for the right person who genuinely clicks with me. If that’s you, I’d love to chat.

When I’m not suiting up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil, I enjoy dressing sharp, working out, and entering sweepstakes (weirdly good at winning them). I’ve been featured on the news for my fandom, and I’m passionate about creating fun, authentic connections—romantic or otherwise.

Ideally, I’d love to meet a woman who’s nerdy in her own way, emotionally available, and open to building something real. Cosplay is totally optional—I just want someone who enjoys shared adventures, mutual support, and maybe even some travel.

If you’re nearby, coffee could be a great way to start. If not, I’m open to long-distance for the right vibe. Also, I can’t post my dating site here (Reddit rules), but it’s in my profile if you’re curious!

I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced this type of fatigue reaction to TRE.

I have tried TRE twice, with a practicioner in my area who was trained by Dr Berceli. 

The first time was October 2024 and the second time was February 2025.

Both times, during the session it seemed to be going well. My body responded with tremors as expected, and this was coupled with a general sense of well-being (although with no emotional release of any kind). My session involved around 25 minutes of guided exercises followed by two 10-minute tremoring sessions, with a 5-minute break in between.

In the immediate aftermath of these TRE sessions, I felt especially energized for the rest of the day. Almost as if I had drank a cup of coffee.

But then I crashed hard from the next morning onward. Experiencing this absolutely unending, crushing fatigue that hangs around for ***weeks or even months*** and legitimately made my life much harder to live. The type of fatigue that is so strong, that breathing feels noticeably more difficult than normal.

After the first TRE session, I thought the fatigue was just a coincidence. But when the exact same thing happened after my second session, I've become convinced that this is a real reaction to the TRE.

**Has anyone else here experienced this before? And more importantly, did you find a way to resolve it?**

I do have a variety of autoimmune health issues which might contribute to the fatigue. My cardiologist even thinks I have a very mild case of ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis AKA Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) although I'm in disagreement with her diagnosis.

But still, autoimmune issues are common among trauma survivors... So I imagine I'm far from the only autoimmune patient here. And I'd imagine there are even people here with ME as well.

**ETA: I don't react this same way to exercise in general, only TRE. I can repeat the same exercises but without the tremoring, and I will feel fine the next day, without any fatigue reaction. Hell, I can easily walk 15,000 to 20,000 steps in a day (I've done that twice in the past week) without any major fatigue on the following day**",1,1755042512.0,longtermTRE,3,1.0,False

GenSpark GPT-5 just gave you access to the world's most advanced AI for free. But most people don't know it exists yet.

I'm Julian Goldie, founder of Goldie Agency. I've been using AI tools to grow my SEO business for years. GenSpark GPT-5 is the first AI platform that actually replaces human work instead of just assisting with it.

Here's exactly how to get started with GenSpark GPT-5 and use it to transform your business.

# 🎯 Step 1: Getting Free Access to GenSpark GPT-5

While ChatGPT makes you wait in queues and pay monthly fees, GenSpark GPT-5 gives you immediate free access to the world's smartest AI.

# How to Create Your GenSpark GPT-5 Account

Go to GenSpark's website and create a free account. The signup process takes less than two minutes.

Unlike ChatGPT Plus, there's no credit card required. No monthly fees. No usage limits that kick in after a few hours.

GenSpark GPT-5 gives you generous free access to their entire platform including the Super Agent system with nine AI models and 80 specialized tools.

# Understanding GenSpark GPT-5's Interface

GenSpark GPT-5 doesn't give you a simple chat box like ChatGPT. Instead, you get access to a complete AI workforce through their Super Agent interface.

The platform is designed around getting actual work done, not just having conversations. You give it goals and it figures out how to achieve those goals using the best AI models and tools for each task.

# 🚀 Step 2: Your First GenSpark GPT-5 Project

Don't start with complex projects. Begin with something simple to understand how GenSpark GPT-5 works.

# Simple Website Creation Test

Ask GenSpark GPT-5 to create a simple homepage for a local business. Give it basic requirements like business name, services, and desired style.

I tested this with a coffee shop called Brood Awakenings. I wanted a hero section, menu area, customer reviews, and responsive design.

GenSpark GPT-5 delivered a complete website with warm colors, smooth animations, optimized images, and professional typography. Every section was perfectly designed and fully functional.

This would normally take a web developer days to create. GenSpark GPT-5 did it in minutes.

# Basic Content Creation

Try asking GenSpark GPT-5 to create a blog post about a topic relevant to your business. Include specific requirements like word count, target audience, and key points to cover.

The content quality will surprise you. GenSpark GPT-5 understands context, audience, and purpose in ways that other AI tools don't.

# Simple Data Analysis

Upload a spreadsheet or provide some business data. Ask GenSpark GPT-5 to analyze it and provide insights.

The platform will create professional reports with charts, trends, and actionable recommendations. This is analysis that would normally require hiring specialists.

# 🎮 Step 3: Testing GenSpark GPT-5's Advanced Capabilities

Once you understand the basics, start testing more complex projects.

# Interactive Application Development

I asked GenSpark GPT-5 to build a fully functional Tetris game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. I wanted all seven Tetramino pieces, proper rotation, line clearing, scorekeeping, and modern visuals.

In less than 30 seconds, GenSpark GPT-5 delivered a complete Tetris game. Not a basic version. A full game with animations, next piece preview, increasing speed, and professional graphics.

Try asking for simple games or interactive tools relevant to your business. GenSpark GPT-5 can create customer calculators, product configurators, or educational tools.

# Professional Presentation Creation

Ask GenSpark GPT-5 to create a presentation about your business or industry. Specify the audience, key messages, and desired tone.

The AI Slides feature creates complete presentations with speaker notes, custom graphics, and professional design. The quality rivals expensive design agencies.

# Business Analysis and Strategy

Give GenSpark GPT-5 a complex business scenario from your industry. Ask for detailed analysis with pros and cons for different approaches.

I tested this with remote versus in-office work strategies. GenSpark GPT-5 delivered comprehensive analysis covering talent acquisition, cost factors, productivity metrics, and business continuity.

This is consulting-level analysis that you'd normally pay thousands for.

# 💡 Step 4: Understanding GenSpark GPT-5's Super Agent System

GenSpark GPT-5 uses nine different AI models working together like a specialized team. GPT-5 acts as the coordinator, deciding which agents to use and how to combine their outputs.

# The Nine AI Models Working for You

Each AI model in GenSpark GPT-5 specializes in different tasks:

Content creation models handle writing, editing, and storytelling. Design models focus on visual elements and user experience. Code models write and debug programs across multiple languages. Analysis models process data and generate insights. Communication models handle customer interactions and phone calls.

# The 80 Specialized Tools

GenSpark GPT-5 integrates 80 different tools all coordinated by the Super Agent system. These tools handle everything from image generation to database management to API integrations.

You don't need to learn each tool individually. GenSpark GPT-5 automatically selects and uses the right tools for your specific project.

# How the Coordination Works

When you give GenSpark GPT-5 a complex task, it breaks the project into smaller components. Each component gets assigned to the most appropriate AI model and tools. The results are then combined into a complete solution.

This is why GenSpark GPT-5 produces immediately usable results instead of rough drafts that need editing.

# 🔧 Step 5: Integrating GenSpark GPT-5 Into Your Business Workflow

Don't use GenSpark GPT-5 for random tasks. Build it into your regular business processes.

# Identify Your Biggest Time Wasters

What takes the most time in your business? Content creation? Customer service? Data analysis? Project management?

Start by using GenSpark GPT-5 to automate your biggest time wasters. This gives you immediate ROI and frees up time for higher-value activities.

# Create Standard Operating Procedures

Document exactly how to use GenSpark GPT-5 for recurring business tasks. Create templates and processes that your team can follow.

This ensures consistent results and makes it easy to scale your GenSpark GPT-5 usage across your entire business.

# Set Quality Control Standards

Always review and test outputs from GenSpark GPT-5 before using them in production. While the platform delivers impressive results, human oversight ensures everything meets your specific standards.

Create checklists for different types of projects to maintain consistent quality.

So much more has become apparent in my mind, now that I'm out of it and over the shock of his exit. How most of his behaviours are textbook narcissistic. 

How stopping my hobbies because it made him mad to ""not be enjoying our precious time together"" was really his insecurities over my success.

Actually believing I had done something wrong, being his personal driver, cook and cleaner while footing 90% of the finances to live together. It was all just his twisted mind games.

Having your partner look at you with irritation and annoyance, most of the times he looked at you, every damn day. Being annoyed with me for asking for a kiss that lasted longer than a second, or a hug. For expecting me to be the housewife, and the worker, and so much more and when I wasn't 100% perfect at it, I heard about it. For dealing with the worst depression of my life, sinking into that black hopeless hole, and he told me ""I'm not your therapist"" when I tried to open up. For all the wrong he did, which is way too much to mention, but it was all my fault. 

Our relationship ended, amicably. Thought we'd still be friends, housemates. But I moved on to someone else, too quickly in his mind. So he attacked me physically, endangering both our lives, mine more. Destroyed my car, my belongings. I paid him 3 grand to leave, gave him the couches, the coffee table, a new mattress, even felt sorry for him and gave him something very sentimental to me. He continued to gaslight me, denying the attack, denying it all, blaming me.

Now he gets to move on, on to the next woman. I fear for her, for her life. He gets to badmouth me, just like he did with all his other 'crazy exes'. He gets to move on, and I'm stuck, angry with the injustice, he never had to pay for his actions, he never felt the consequences.

I literally cannot believe I missed out on this until now, but apparently, 2025 is ALL about “get paid to test” apps, and some of these pay way more than I ever imagined! Like, some of y’all out here making *serious coffee money* just trying new tech before anyone else!?

🛠️ **2. BetaBound**  
A hub for techies! Most of the apps are unreleased, and you feel like you’re in a secret club. Payouts vary, but I’ve earned up to $100/feature test. Pro tip: Check them daily, the good stuff goes FAST.

📲 **3. UserTesting**  
Loved this! They pay you to record your thoughts as you browse new apps. Average test lasts 15 minutes. Just last month, I made enough for a Spotify Premium YEAR. Not joking.

💡 **4. PlaytestCloud**  
Originally for gamers, but recently they've been flooding in apps from fitness and finance. Super quick missions and easy PayPal cashouts.

🔥 **5. TryMyUI**  
It’s basically getting paid to complain. Just try out new user interfaces, say what you love/hate, and get paid. Huge variety, and surprise bonuses for great feedback.

⌚ **6. Respondent.io**  
Wanna get paid for your opinion? Here’s the jackpot. Tasks can be interviews or surveys, and the best part—they sometimes PING YOU for super high-paying feature tests outta nowhere!

1moopwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1moopwf/bootstrapped_a_niche_health_tool_after_20_years/,Bootstrapped a niche health tool after 20 years with MS — here’s how it went,"I’ve lived with multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years.

For most of that time, I’ve been trying to track symptoms, sleep, movement, and meds — hoping to spot patterns that could help me manage my days better. I used notebooks, spreadsheets, generic apps… but nothing felt like it understood the unique challenges of MS.

About a year ago, I stopped searching and decided to build the tool I wished existed. I had no grand plans — this was supposed to be just for me.

What I built
Over time, my private tool grew into a full health companion for MS:

Daily Dashboard – quick symptom logging, medication reminders, daily checklist

AI Day Planner – suggests activities based on my current symptoms, past trends, and even local weather

Timeline – a chronological history of symptoms, movement, sleep, and meds

AI Scanner – upload food, supplement, or medication labels for MS-specific analysis

Insights – finds patterns like “fatigue spikes two days after poor sleep” or “movement improves mood on low-pain days”

The basics (logging, reminders, day planning) are free.
The AI features cost money to run, so I added a small paid tier — about the cost of a coffee per week — with a 7-day trial.

Lessons learned so far
Build for yourself first — solving my own problem kept me motivated when there was no audience yet.

Niche is okay — I’m not targeting “everyone with chronic illness,” just people with MS, and that’s fine.

Free first, then paid — offering a free tier makes it easy for people to try without feeling sold to.

AI infra is expensive — pricing has to at least cover those costs, even if you want to give it away.

Now it’s called MultipleSclerosis.ai, and I’ve started opening it up to others in the MS community. It’s still early days, but the feedback so far has been encouraging.

If you’ve ever taken a personal tool and turned it into something public:

How did you approach early growth?

Any tips for marketing something in a very specific niche?

Would you spend more time on community or on product at this stage?

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, process, or how I balanced building while managing a chronic illness.

They're missing the point. While they argue about price, smart entrepreneurs are using GPT-5 to eliminate $50,000 development costs. Here's the math that changes everything.

Last week, I got into an argument with a developer.

He was ranting about GPT-5 Pro costing $200 per month. ""It's way too expensive,"" he said. ""Who can afford that?""

I looked at him and smiled.

See, while he was complaining about $200, I was using GPT-5 to build applications that would have cost me $50,000 to develop.

While he worried about monthly costs, I was eliminating entire job roles from my business.

While he focused on expense, I was creating revenue streams that pay for GPT-5 in the first hour of every month.

Today, I'm going to show you why GPT-5 at $200/month is the best investment you'll ever make. And why the people complaining about cost will be the same ones wondering how you got so far ahead.

# The Real Cost of NOT Using GPT-5

Before we talk about GPT-5's value, let's talk about what NOT using it costs you.

**Hiring a developer:** $80,000-150,000 per year **Custom software development:** $50,000-500,000 per project  
**Marketing automation tools:** $500-5,000 per month **Content creation team:** $60,000-120,000 per year **Customer support staff:** $35,000-55,000 per year

Add it up. You're looking at $300,000-800,000 annually just to handle what GPT-5 can do for $2,400 per year.

That's a 99.7% cost reduction.

But most people see $200/month and think ""expensive.""

This is why most people stay broke.

# The GPT-5 ROI Calculator: Real Numbers

Let me show you the exact return on investment I'm getting from GPT-5:

# Month 1 GPT-5 Savings:

**Content Creation:**

* Previous cost: $4,000/month for writers

# What $200/Month Actually Gets You With GPT-5 Pro

Let's break down what you get for that $200:

**Unlimited Usage** No token limits. No usage caps. Build as much as you want.

**GPT-5 Pro Access**  
The most advanced reasoning model ever created. Handles complex problems that break other AI models.

**Priority Access** No waiting. No ""try again later"" messages. Instant responses when you need them.

**Latest Features** First access to new GPT-5 capabilities and improvements.

**Integration Support** Connect to any business system, API, or workflow tool.

Compare this to hiring equivalent human talent:

**Senior Developer:** $150,000/year ($12,500/month) **Content Manager:** $70,000/year ($5,833/month)  
**Marketing Specialist:** $60,000/year ($5,000/month) **Business Analyst:** $80,000/year ($6,667/month)

Total: $30,000 per month for what GPT-5 does for $200.

The math is stupid simple.

# GPT-5 Pricing Tiers: Which One Makes You Money?

**Free Tier:**

* Limited GPT-5 access
* Good for: Testing and basic use
* Revenue potential: Low

**Plus Tier ($20/month):**

* Higher limits but not unlimited
* Good for: Small businesses and side projects
* Revenue potential: Medium

**Pro Tier ($200/month):**

* Unlimited access to all GPT-5 models
* Good for: Serious businesses and entrepreneurs
* Revenue potential: Unlimited

Here's the reality: If you're building a business, $200/month is nothing. That's $6.67 per day. Less than most people spend on coffee.

But if you're just playing around, stick with free or Plus.

The Pro tier is for people who understand that spending money to make money is how wealth is built.

# Case Study: How GPT-5 Paid for Itself in 24 Hours

Let me tell you about Sarah, one of my AI Profit Boardroom members.

She runs a small marketing agency. 5 employees. $30,000 monthly revenue.

She was skeptical about the $200/month for GPT-5 Pro. ""It's almost 1% of my revenue,"" she said.

I convinced her to try it for one month.

**Day 1:** She automated her client report generation. Saved 10 hours of manual work. **Day 2:** GPT-5 wrote social media content for all clients. Saved 8 hours.  
**Day 3:** Built an automated lead qualification system. Started capturing 40% more leads. **Week 1:** Client satisfaction increased because reports were more detailed and delivered faster. **Week 2:** She pitched automation services to existing clients. Landed $15,000 in new contracts. **Week 3:** The lead qualification system generated 60 new prospects. **Week 4:** Closed $25,000 in new business from the automated lead generation.

**Month 1 Results:**

* Time saved: 80 hours
* New revenue: $40,000
* ROI: 20,000%

She now pays for GPT-5 Pro and has budget left over to scale her team.

The $200 was never the real cost. The real cost was the $40,000 she was leaving on the table every month by NOT using it.

# The Hidden Costs Everyone Ignores

When people complain about GPT-5's $200/month cost, they ignore the hidden costs of NOT using it:

**Opportunity Cost:** Every hour you spend on tasks GPT-5 could automate is an hour you're not growing your business.

**Competitive Disadvantage:** Your competitors using GPT-5 are moving faster, delivering better results, and charging less.

**Scaling Limitations:** Without automation, you hit a ceiling. You can only hire and manage so many people.

**Quality Inconsistency:** Humans have bad days. GPT-5 delivers consistent quality 24/7.

**Knowledge Loss:** When employees leave, they take knowledge with them. GPT-5 retains everything.

Add up these hidden costs, and NOT using GPT-5 costs more than using it.

# GPT-5 vs Traditional Business Solutions: The Real Comparison

Let's compare GPT-5 to traditional business solutions:

# Content Creation

**Traditional:** Hire writers, editors, content managers

* **Cost:** $5,000-15,000/month
* **Speed:** Days to weeks per piece
* **Quality:** Inconsistent
* **Scalability:** Limited by headcount

**GPT-5:** Automated content generation

* **Cost:** $200/month (Pro tier)
* **Speed:** Minutes per piece
* **Quality:** Consistent and improving
* **Scalability:** Unlimited

# Software Development

**Traditional:** Hire developers, project managers, QA testers

* **Cost:** $10,000-50,000/month
* **Speed:** Months per application
* **Quality:** Varies by team
* **Scalability:** Expensive to scale

**GPT-5:** AI-powered development

* **Cost:** $200/month (Pro tier)
* **Speed:** Hours to days per application
* **Quality:** Consistent with proper prompting
* **Scalability:** Build unlimited applications

# Customer Support

**Traditional:** Hire support agents, supervisors, tools

* **Cost:** $3,000-8,000/month
* **Speed:** Limited by agent availability
* **Quality:** Depends on training and mood
* **Scalability:** Requires more hiring

**GPT-5:** AI customer support agents

* **Cost:** $200/month (Pro tier)
* **Speed:** Instant 24/7 responses
* **Quality:** Consistent and knowledgeable
* **Scalability:** Handle unlimited customers

The pattern is clear: GPT-5 delivers better results for a fraction of the cost.

Regardless of business size, GPT-5 Pro pays for itself quickly when used strategically.

# Common GPT-5 ROI Calculation Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Only Calculating Direct Cost Savings** Don't just look at what GPT-5 replaces. Look at what new opportunities it creates.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Time Value** Your time has value. If GPT-5 saves you 10 hours per week, what's that worth in revenue generation?

**Mistake 3: Underestimating Quality Improvements** Better quality leads to higher customer satisfaction, which leads to more referrals and higher lifetime value.

**Mistake 4: Not Factoring in Competitive Advantage** Being first to market with AI automation can create lasting competitive moats.

**Mistake 5: Thinking Short-Term** GPT-5's value compounds over time. The ROI gets better, not worse.

# Building Your GPT-5 Business Case

Need to justify GPT-5 Pro to yourself or others? Here's how:

**Step 1: Audit Current Costs** List all tasks that GPT-5 could automate and their current cost.

**Step 2: Calculate Time Savings** Estimate hours saved per week and multiply by your hourly value.

**Step 3: Identify New Revenue Opportunities**  
What new services could you offer with GPT-5 capabilities?

**Step 4: Factor in Competitive Advantage** What's the cost of falling behind competitors who use GPT-5?

**Step 5: Project 12-Month Impact** Calculate cumulative savings and revenue over a full year.

Most businesses find 100x+ ROI when they do this exercise properly.

# The Psychology of GPT-5 Resistance

Why do smart people resist GPT-5 despite obvious benefits?

**Loss Aversion:** People fear losing $200 more than they value gaining $20,000.

**Status Quo Bias:** ""We've always done it this way"" thinking prevents change.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy:** ""We already invested in these tools/people"" creates resistance.

**Complexity Aversion:** GPT-5 seems complicated, so people avoid it.

**Identity Protection:** ""I'm not a tech person"" becomes an excuse not to adapt.

Understanding these psychological barriers helps you overcome them and gain competitive advantage while others hesitate.

The question isn't whether you can afford GPT-5 Pro.

The question is whether you can afford to let your competitors get there first.

1moomge,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1moomge/tomorrow_will_be_one_year/,Tomorrow will be one year,"It will be one full year tomorrow since I have had a smoke.

Since then I have moved twice, and the second time was to the place that I was in PRIOR to the place where I quit smoking originally - so I am in a weird place that I have spent the whole year trying to move forward only to literally move back into the place I was in before I quit smoking - I've been a single dad for 3 years now 2 of which I worked full time on the nightshifts. I've had some other issues and missed out on a lot of sleep and rest etc and the whole while smoking about a pack a day - the last stint was probably since 2020 or so.

About a week before August 13th, I hastily made and consumed a grilled cheese before letting it cool down and burned my gums and the inside of my mouth pretty badly; it became uncomfortable and irritating to smoke a cigarette and the burn was so bad that it actually broke a capped tooth; the dentist said she has no idea how that kind of damage could have happened - My idea is that the oil was still hot and the bread was so burnt and crispy that it burned my gums and then all those sharp little crumbs got all stuck in my gums and on top of the burn was even more irritating - I took a couple nights off because of this. I went on the third night and it was so painful, taking so much tylenol and using orajel like crazy; at the end of my shift I went to the hospital where idk even I wanna say blood clots were pushing their way from between my gums and teeth. I was in the emergency at this point and they had a little spot and a chair and i asked the guy for 2 cups; one empty and one with water - one to spit and the water to rinse and spit - after transferring the cup of water one mouthful at a time and washing it a bright-bloody red and into the other cup with multiple blood clots emerging from behind my teeth - I vomit at the sight of this cup that just looks like a full cup of blood at this point, probably from a combination of swallowing some of it and also looking at it. 

2 doctors came in and gave me 4 injections of the numbing thing directly to the gums in around my 2 front teeth. I called and booked an emergency appointment with my dentist for the next day where they did a cleaning and assessment; I asked if she could fix my now eroded, broken tooth and she said she would but there are cavities she wanted to take care of - my son has special requirements so he was also needing some dental work that was scheduled already - This was all scheduled over the course of the year and then for then for the first time in a long time that I had made a significant change in my life - 

On August 13th 2024, I had a cigarette at 11pm my gums itching and tingly and I put it out - I think as much as smoking is romanticized, quitting is also romanticized. I tried not to make a big thing of it  and just tried to put it out of my head. I got patches and my friend had some gum later on as my gums healed a bit - my gums are good now i guess they are kinda sensitive but they are fine and after getting 4-5 cavities done she fixed my fake tooth that sits right beside my front teeth at this point I feel good cause for the first time me and my son are both fully cavity free at the same time - its a weird sensation. 

I deleted the account I had after a year - after having a breakup, then i moved and had a bunch of other relationships and then moving from where i lived originally - it feels like a huge backstep.

But there has been progress as I negotiated a cheaper rent that is still too much for what it is, I have quit smoking, both got all our dental work done so I'm just really trying to kind of look at the positives here - the last time I was in that place I was still smoking shamelessly.

What has also happened is that I have opened my eyes again and its not just about cigarettes, weed, booze, drugs, food, coffee, video games or video games its the realization of how your time is spent and the time is what is valuable - having some control over yourself and spending - not hating yourself because of it but just at least being open to the change or the possibility and it seems now again I want to change myself more but it's hard to 'see' yourself in a different way. 

Someone once told me that smoking doesn't suit me and I have thought about it ever since; why? why doesn't it suit me?

I urge you if you are in the process of quitting DO NOT smoke as I promise the guilt you will feel within yourself is much worse than anything me or anyone else can say.

  
If you have not quit smoking - try to quit. Avoid it as much as you can and put it off as long as you can.

  
I am having probably one of the toughest times in my life right now and walking on the beach in the heat after jumping in the ocean a smoke is all I can think about but I won't smoke.

TL;DR: I quit smoking cause I burned myself by accident, feel strange about making changes in myself as an adult and trying to stay positive.

Every time I bring it up, she says she's too tired or not in the mood or that i make her feel pressured by even bringing it up. 

So about a year ago, I just… stopped. Stopped doing the little things I used to do for her, making coffee in the morning, leaving notes, fixing things right away, giving her massages, planning surprises. I still pull my weight with chores and the kids, but the “extras” felt pointless when I’m basically being treated like a platonic roommate.

Now she’s upset that I’ve “changed” and that I’m “not as loving anymore.” I told her straight up that love feels different when it’s one-sided. She says I’m punishing her for not having sex with me, and maybe she’s right, but I’m also just tired of feeling rejected over and over.

I know marriage is about more than sex, but if theres zero intimacy, what are we? Im starting to feel like we’re just staying together for the kids and the mortgage.

1moojg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1moojg3/i_hate_budgeting_apps_so_i_started_antibudgeting/,"I Hate Budgeting Apps - So I started ""Anti""-Budgeting","I hate budgeting apps. They’re all just graphs and categories and “weekly spending summaries” I don’t care about. For the last year I literally just tracked my “savings” in Notes on my phone. If I didn’t buy coffee or eat out that day, I’d just write “+5” or “+12.” It was stupid simple and it actually worked for me.

Honestly, my app is basically an *anti-budgeting* app. The opposite of tracking your spending, it's tracking when you don't spend. I never liked all the pressure and guilt that comes with traditional budgeting tools. No obsessing over every dollar, no shame for slipping up. Just simple small wins you can actually keep up with.

A couple weeks ago I tried turning it into an app. Posted it here. Top comment was basically, “Cool idea but no one is gonna type numbers in every day.” Fair.

So I changed it. Now you just pick your bad spending habits once, say how much you usually spend, and when you skip one you just tap it. App does the math. No thinking.

Still Streamlit (don’t judge) but now it’s way faster to use and I think actually useful. Got a few people trying it and giving me ideas. Feels way better than V1.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I am seeking a lady that is from 25 to 32 In this age range please dont be shy to message me

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

Steven Jr. jumps bad with his mother, telling her.  ""God forbid I have a social life"" and just tares  into her, not even giving her a chance to speak.  Kristi, wisely leaves saying she will not be disrespected that way.

Stephen then, gets on the phone, smirking and laughing (probably with his gold digging ex) about the exchange.

She was likely overlooked amongst her litter because she was black (the least adopted of breeds) and had extra toes.   She was also spending all her time clawing at the newspaper at the bottom her cage at the shelter with her monster feet.   In all honesty, she wouldnt have been my first choice either, but i couldn't say no.

What I ended up adopting was the sweetest cat who slept next to me every night and wouldn't ever leave me alone.   Every morning, she would wait for me to wake up so she could walk to the living room with me while i grabbed my coffee and she could start her morning with me.  She never missed the opportunity to sit in my lap for pets if i was ever lounging around.  All she wanted was to be near me.   I'm going to miss her and im thankful for every moment I had with her.

I’ve kept my mouth shut because I didn’t want to shatter their picture-perfect view of him. But honestly? Every time they fawn over him, it feels like I’m getting cheated on again except this time, it’s my own family doing it.

* 1 tbsp maple syrup or honey (because life *needs* at least one sweet thing)
* A pinch of instant coffee granules (for bitterness, both literal and metaphorical)
* 1 handful of ice cubes (cold, like your inner dialogue)

# Instructions

1. **Ignore your problems** long enough to gather ingredients.
2. Add bananas, milk, peanut butter, cocoa powder, maple syrup/honey, coffee granules, and ice to a blender.
3. Blend until smooth — unlike your coping mechanisms.
4. Pour into a glass (or drink straight from the blender; we’re not judging… much).
5. Sip slowly while questioning your life choices, or chug and move on.

High saturated fat , processed foods, low to no fiber, red meat and no fruits and veggies. Was smoking cannabis like a chimney. Doctor told me I need to get my shit together . 
I shrugged it off as a high test because I forgot to fast and had a little cream in my morning coffee.
2 months later I was retested and it came back even higher 277. I honestly felt like crap, something snapped within myself, I think I was just ready for change.. plus I have 3 young children and I don’t want to check out early , they need me.
Over the last four months I’ve radically changed my lifestyle. I lost 40 lbs , reduced my caloric intake , I nearly quit eating red meat, chicken turkey and occasional fish, oatmeal every morning with blueberries. Grilled veggies , beans almost everyday black and pinto homemade , homemade salsas. Hummus and Baba homemade.Lots of avocado. No sweets no butter no dairy. Also quit eating bread and only corn tortillas no flour .
Got my Cardiac calcium score and it came back zero on all accounts and I went in for my blood work yesterday and they said my total score is 162. LDL way down triglycerides way down and HDL is 54 nearly unchanged.
I’m happy as hell to say the least wanted to share these results with the community and wish everybody dealing with this struggle the best. Super stoked on this news going to drive the truck down to the lake with my oldest son who is 9 and have a nice bike ride together ..

A prompt like be something like ""Book a coffee catchup with Tim and I"". All I need for CoPilot Studio to help with is:
1. Work out who Tim is based on who I interact with the most and get Tim's full name (eg. Tim Bloggs)
2. Submit the request with Tim's full name into the PowerAutomate Flow (that will take care of the rest). 

There's a lot more I will do later but trying to work out the best path. I can easily prompt Copilot directly and ask something like ""give me the full name of Tim based on who I interact with the most"", but struggling to get this working in a Copilot studio agent that I work with. 

I've done some research and it seems to indicate I will need to connect the CoPilot agent to Microsoft graph but wondering if anyone has achieved something similar?

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in the octagon, stats don’t lie (unless they’re lying on the mat). George Mangos is the favorite here, with odds hovering around **1.75** (implied probability: \~57%), while Radley Da Silva is the underdog at **2.14** (\~47%). To put that in human terms: Mangos is the guy who always wins the office “Who’s going to fold first?” pool, and Da Silva is the guy who keeps betting against him, refusing to learn.

The totals market? A snoozefest for fight fans who love drama. The “Over 1.5 rounds” line sits at **1.37** (73% implied), while “Under” is a steep **3.10** (32%). Translation: Bookmakers think this fight will end before your second cup of coffee. Expect a knockout, TKO, or possibly a referee stopping a fight that looks like a one-sided dance class.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Guy Who Can’t Tie His Shoelaces**  
Now, let’s spice things up with some *fabricated but plausible* fighter news. George Mangos, the 6’3” wrecking ball, has been training with a new coach: **“The Iceman” Greg Jackson**, who previously taught fighters how to channel their inner glacier (i.e., *don’t* melt under pressure). Mangos also reportedly hired a “shoelace specialist” to prevent history from repeating itself—last time he fought, he tripped mid-punch, face-planted, and lost by TKO. “I’m not just training my body,” Mangos said. “I’m training my shoelaces to tie themselves before the ref can count me out.”

Radley Da Silva, meanwhile, is the underdog with heart (and a suspiciously convenient injury). He pulled out of his last fight with a “mysterious c

### Parse the Odds: Why Ewert’s Odds Are About as Surprising as Day Following Night

The numbers don’t lie (unless they’re vigorished, but we’ll get to that). At **BetOnline.ag**, Ewert is a **1.4 favorite** (implied probability: **71.4%**), while Panferov sits at **3.1** (32.3%). FanDuel tightens Panferov’s line to **3.05** (32.8%), which is basically the sportsbooks saying, “We’re 70% confident Ewert wins, but we’re also charging a 5% fee for the privilege of betting on this.”

The totals market? A masterclass in pessimism. **Over 1.5 rounds** is priced at **1.44** (69.4% implied), while **Under 1.5** rounds languishes at **2.85** (35%). Translation: Bookmakers think this fight will end before your third commercial break. Ewert’s odds and the totals suggest a **quick, decisive finish**—probably a knockout or submission that leaves Panferov asking, “Was that it?”

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of a military green hoodie largely depend on its construction and materials. Understanding the specifications of different hoodies can help you make a more informed decision that aligns with your individual needs and preferences.

**Material Composition:** A crucial element of any hoodie is the fabric from which it is indeed made. Military green hoodies are typically crafted from cotton, polyester, or a blend of both. cotton provides breathability and comfort, making it ideal for everyday wear. Polyester adds durability and resistance to shrinking and stretching, enhancing the hoodie's longevity. A blend often combines the best qualities of both materials, creating a garment that is both comfortable and resilient.Look for hoodies with a high percentage of cotton for maximum comfort or a balanced blend for optimal performance and durability. Weight is also important, with heavier fabrics offering more warmth and substance.

**Hood Design and Adjustability:** The design of the hood is another essential feature that impacts both functionality and style. A well-designed hood should provide adequate coverage without obstructing vision. Look for hoodies with adjustable drawstrings that allow you to customize the fit and protect yourself from the elements. Some hoodies feature a lined hood for added warmth and structure, while others have a more streamlined design for a sleeker appearance. Consider the size and shape of the hood to ensure it meets your personal preferences and needs. Also, check the quality of the grommets and drawstring ends as these can indicate overall build quality.

**Pocket Configuration:** Pockets are a practical addition to any hoodie, providing convenient storage for small items or a place to warm your hands. Military green hoodies commonly feature kangaroo pockets, which are large, open pockets located on the front of the garment. Some hoodies also include zippered or snap-closure pockets for added security. Consider the size and placement of the pockets to ensure they are functional and accessible. Reinforced stitching around the pocket edges is a sign of durability and prevents the pockets from tearing over time. The depth of the pocket is also something to check - a deeper pocket generally has better utility.

**Seam Construction and Stitching:** The quality of the seam construction and stitching is a key indicator of the hoodie's overall durability. Look for hoodies with flatlock seams, which minimize bulk and prevent chafing. Reinforced stitching in high-stress areas, such as the shoulders and cuffs, enhances the garment's ability to withstand wear and tear. Consistent and even stitching throughout the hoodie signifies attention to detail and a commitment to quality. Examine the stitching closely for any loose threads or uneven lines, as these can indicate potential weaknesses.

**Cuff and Hem Design:** The cuffs and hem of a military green hoodie contribute to its overall fit and style. Ribbed cuffs and hem provide a snug fit that helps to trap warmth and prevent drafts. Look for hoodies with durable ribbing that retains its shape over time. Some hoodies feature plain cuffs and hem for a more minimalist look.Consider your personal preferences and the intended use of the hoodie when evaluating the cuff and hem design. A tighter rib knit on the cuffs and hem will help to insulate better and prevent the hoodie from riding up.

Key features of a good military green hoodie include:

* Durable and comfortable material
* Adjustable hood for weather protection
* Functional pocket configuration
* Solid stitching for durability
* Reinforced cuffs and hem

Music is a big part of my life. I’m huge into EDM, reggae, German rap (can’t get enough of K.I.Z.), and indie rock. Always happy to swap playlists or discover new artists.

I’m also into deeper conversations, especially around international relations, the clean and green economy, and how the world is changing. If you like geeking out over ideas or debating (respectfully!) over coffee or a beer, we will probably get along great.

I’m not looking for anything romantic. I just want genuine friendship and good conversation with people who are open-minded, kind, and maybe a little curious about the world.
