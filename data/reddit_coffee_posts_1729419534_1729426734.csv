1g7xdm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fryup/comments/1g7xdm7/the_ultimate_full_english/,The Ultimate Full English?,"I feel that there hasn't been a collaborative discussion that establishes, beyond any reasonable doubt, the platinum standard of the Full English. I'd like to rectify that once and for all.

You might ask, who art thou who claims the role of leader in a discussion of this cultural magnitude and sensitivity. Without going into details, I'll just ask you to have faith in the claim that I've cooked well over 10,000 breakfasts to a reasonably high standard in my career. So I would say, as qualified as anyone. I'm also hungover, a state which, while deadening some areas of the brain, sharpens one's focus on the particulars of a Full English.

 I don't claim to have absolute authority on what dictates the platinum standard. However, there are some observations that I can make with a high level of certainty. I'll be less open to being contradicted on those. Not closed, but less open.

There are some aspects of the Platinum Standard  Full English that I'd like to open to the community.

 I'm sure some opinions will be equally valid and irreconcilable. What I'd ask is that you offer your opinion with humility and respect. We're not seeking the ""wrong"" way to do it here, we're seeking to get as close to the unanimous most perfect iteration as it's possible to get. 

I'd like to conclude this introduction by establishing that this discussion ought to only be open to those who can confidently assume the appellation of ""Connoisseur"" regarding English breakfast related matters.

Now, to business.

The Essentials

Without any doubt, we can say that the following are needed:

Eggs

Bacon

Sausages

Mushrooms

Black Pudding* (more on this later)

Tomatoes

Baked Beans

A Potato Based Accompaniment 

A Bread Based Accompaniment 

A Condiment

A Hot Beverage

I wholeheartedly feel that if you are already in disagreement with these basics, your participation is no longer welcome. That's said without animosity. I fully respect your right to disagree, I am just unable to change my view here.

Scottish/Irish/Ulster

In my view, the only accompaniment from the above variations that elevates the Full English, is white pudding and I will talk about this more later. The other unique accompaniments from variations don't add anything that shouldn't already be there. Going forwards, we're talking about the ultimate Full English in particular.

Eggs

I think that two ""sunny side up"", fried, class A, free range (or better still, locally sourced) hen eggs is the only real option here. Whilst we all know and appreciate how scrambled and poached eggs are still very nice, the eating experience changes significantly enough that fried eggs should be the expectation. 

The yolks should obviously be runny, a light golden crisp can develop at the extremities of the albumen but the white should otherwise be gently fried and easily cuttable. The golden colour of the yolks should be visible which means that, if a lid has been used for more even cooking, the steaming of the tops of the eggs can't be excessive. The tops of the eggs may be seasoned with Maldon and freshly cracked white pepper towards the end of cooking.

Because of the surface area covered by the eggs, they ought to be placed on the warmed plate before anything else. The whites can be obscured by other accompaniments (we'll talk about the Alan Partridge thing later), but the yolks must be visible.

Bacon

I believe that back bacon and streaky bacon are both acceptable. My preference is streaky bacon. I think that the bacon should be smoked, offering a different flavour profile to the other pork based accompaniments. I believe that less than three rashers is disappointing. The bacon should be dry cured and thick cut is preferable to thin.

An important note is that the fat of the bacon must be rendered. The best method to achieve this is to cook betwixt baking parchment in the oven first and then crisp in the frying pan to finish. The bacon must be crispy, but not brittle.

Sausages

Sausages must be >95% pork. Plain or Lincolnshire and Cumberland regional variants are both acceptable but the Cumberland sausage ought not to be in the traditional coil.

The sausages should be browned on all sides and fried gently to avoid splitting of the skins or extrusion of the meat on either end. I am of the view that 2 sausages is superior to 3 but I understand this is contentious.

Mushrooms

I am personally against the whole flat cooked mushroom. I think they cool too quickly and hold too much moisture. For me, flat, button, chestnut, Portobello or closed cup are all acceptable, but they must be sliced and fried slowly in a small amount of oil to extract moisture and intensify their flavour. A small knob of butter can be added and the temperature increased to finish, developing come caramelisation. Salt and a copious amount of freshly ground black or white pepper should be used to finish them.

Black Pudding

I feel strongly that black pudding is an essential accompaniment but I do respect it is not for everyone. The black pudding should be best available quality. Small diameter is preferable to large but both are acceptable. One slice of large diameter should be used or two of small. The slices should be crispy on both sides and piping hot throughout.

N.B. If using white pudding, say for a treat, it can be used in addition to, not instead of, black pudding. In that case, one slice of small diameter of each should be used and cooked in the same way.

Tomatoes

I feel quite strongly that a good quality, fresh, vine ripened tomato cooked in the appropriate method is without question superior to the tinned plum style. There is, however, a way to incorporate tinned tomatoes to a high standard if that is your preference which I will outline below.

The fresh tomato should be fully ripe, halved lengthways and the stem trimmed neatly out with two small 45 degree cuts. It should be seasoned with salt (I often insert a sliver of garlic into the locular gel and use a tiny pinch of dried oregano later but I accept this is a personal preference and shouldn't be included in the specification). The tomato halves should be placed, flat side down, onto a hot grilling surface or frying pan until the cross sectional flesh in attractively charred. They can then be flipped and pepper can be cracked onto the flat sides. The tomatoes should be finished in the oven to cook fully through so the flesh isn't firm at all.

If using tinned plum tomatoes, they ought to be simmered in a small pan and should be seasoned with salt and lots of white pepper. The finished tomatoes should be served with minimal tomato juice from cooking.

Baked Beans

Heinz is obviously the gold standard, but there are increasingly acceptable alternatives. The beans should be gently simmered in a pan to the point that the starch just begins to thicken the sauce. Beans should be added to the plate secondly after the eggs, due to the surface area taken up.

N.B. Regarding the humorous Alan Partridge quote: ""Minor criticism, more distance between the eggs and the beans. I may want to mix them but I want that to be my decision. Use a sausage as a breakwater."" The popularity of the show means that eggs not touching the beans has become a cultural standard adopted by people who like to echo Partridge's infantile fussiness when they encounter a bean-egg convergence. I'm of the view that it is utter nonsense because the combining of items is the joy of a full English and the intention of the joke serves not to highlight a popular cultural preference but to illustrate that Partridge is elaborately juvenile and ungrateful.

Potato Based Accompaniment

This is a particularly tricky area to nail. Bubble and squeak is traditional and probably quite preferable, however, the need for leftover roast potatoes and cabbage for a ""true"" bubble and squeak is an understandably difficult proposition. While I'm ashamed to defer to the Americans on this, I am of the view that hash browns very conveniently provide the majority of the function of bubble and squeak, and therefore should be acceptable. Very interested to hear views on this. I think it cannot be argued that a true, leftovers bubble and squeak cooked properly is superior.

Chips are not acceptable.

Bread Based Accompaniment

In short, I think that the optimal solution here is two slices of plain sourdough, one toasted and buttered, one fried. Fried bread is a real treat when done right but toast is an essential mopping tool. The best of both worlds is possible, so why do it any other way?

The fried bread may be served on the same plate as the rest of the items but the toast should ideally be on its own small plate. This is because fried bread takes much longer to get soggy than toast. Partridge's OCD would have been justified if this was his gripe.

Condiment

I think HP sauce has the ultimate monopoly here. I have tried other brown sauces and I really think they don't hold up. Essentially, the condiment should be dealer's choice, but if you gave me a selection of sauces and HP wasn't there, I wouldn't be eating the platinum standard full English.

Hot Beverage

I will cut to the chase here and say it is tea and by that I mean it is a strong Yorkshire tea with a drop of whole milk. Coffee doesn't have the refreshing quality of tea and is a horrible thing to ""wash down"" a proper full English.

Other Garnishes

I've received a significant enough push back from garnishing with things like chives that I think it's best to omit them entirely. Tensions will be high enough as it is and I have a family to think about.

So there we have it. Whether or not I'm on the spectrum shouldn't have a bearing in your decision to respond with your own views or valid criticisms. These are my observations and beliefs in a long, practical study of this cultural mainstay. Perfection is impossible, I understand that, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for it. This concludes my thesis and the discussion is now open to contributors.

1g7xdiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1g7xdiy/please_read_and_give_feeback/,Please read and give feeback,"Hello, 

this is sample of a project I've been working on for while. I would love to hear your honest feedback. My GF aranged a sit down with a proper editor as a b-day present and I would love to give them something cool. 

Chapter 1

“This journal will detail the stories, adventures and records by Deckhands, for Deckhands. Each entry MUST have: your name, the date, and whatever information you feel is worthy enough to make it into this holy document.”

This was my very first entry into my new Deckhand Journal: A Deckhand’s Tale of the Sea. Funnily enough, I broke two of the three rules I highlighted in the first paragraph of the original journal, so I will fill in the blanks where necessary. The first thing you need to know is, who is the person writing all of this. Theodore is my name however, I will be referred to by various nicknames. Some of those include Dumbass and Meatball, as well as a whole other host of names convenient for those working around me who don’t want to learn my name or pay me any kind of respect. 
	
The second piece of information missing is the date. Sadly, this is harder to pinpoint, however I can confirm that it was sometime soon before June 12th, 2018, as that is the date of the following journal entry (thank you, Kiara, for following the rules of the book - she will be an important character later on). 
	At the time of writing, I would have been 20 years old, and in my second year as a deckhand at the glorious company known as Murphy’s on the Water. At the start of this season I already have a year under my belt and I’m thinking this year is going to be my year! I’m taller, more handsome, and just finishing up a great year at university where I’m finally really getting girls and gaining some confidence. Watch out world!
	Unfortunately, I was still living with my parents as I was home for the summer, leaving my apartment in my university town. This bump in the road was not going to stop me from enjoying the summer ahead. 

Before we continue you should know a few things about me: I like to talk, I mean, love to talk, socialize, drink, have fun and enjoy life. I’m a relaxed, go-with-the-flow, type of guy. Nothing bothers me except when there’s a job to do. This is the only “type A” personality trait I have; when something needs to get done, and my reputation (and money) is on the line, it is going to get done. This is exactly why Murphy’s was the perfect summer job, especially for me. 
	It might be important to add a description of my appearance, since my adventures with the ladies are a key component to this story. If you can imagine the most ordinary, white college boy in the world, you wouldn’t be far off. I am 5’11” and between 150-160 pounds, not huge but also not a shrimp. I’m also not lying about my height (you assholes, I can feel your doubt through the pages!). I have standard brown hair which gets flowy when I let it grow out, and a very normal face with a set of hazel brown eyes under a pair of thick, dark eyebrows. Aside from the biggest smile you will ever see, the one feature of mine that stands out the most is the abundance of freckles, which are peppered all over every inch of my skin that manages to glimpse any sunlight. 

I’m your classic guy who is a jack of all trades, good enough to get by, but never good enough to show off. 
I am essentially perfectly average in every aspect - besides my stunning personality, which undoubtedly has already been conveyed. My personality is what carries me over the line. Most of it is due to my crazy upbringing in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The Darkside, the Dirty D, whatever you want to call it. For anyone who doesn’t know the area you can do you research, but who cares what they say. I love it here. 

People here have more character than your average bear. You need it to live and survive here, as we can’t really do all the fancy things those fakes do on the other side of the harbour, in Halifax. You need to have something going for you on this side of town. If you’re not funny, you might as well get outta town. Dartmouth, for those who don’t know, is the gritty, suburban, and less glamorous side of the Halifax Harbour. It’s a place where your street smarts, quick wit and jokes are a must if you want to survive here. This is what allows me to glide through the ups and downs of life, where otherwise people are beaten down. These are all reasons why Dartmouth is a great city, and there’s no place I’d rather be.

A question you might be asking yourself is Where, and what, is Halifax and this Dartmouth you call the “Darkside”? Well readers, it might just be the single best city in Canada, in my not-so-humble opinion. Halifax, Nova Scotia is the largest city in the Atlantic region of Canada (and at one point way back in history, one of the largest cities in the entirety of Canada), it’s the capital of Nova Scotia. Halifax isn’t really thought about by the rest of Canada, aside from students who want to attend university here. This is what makes Halifax awesome, it’s a hidden gem. Not many people live here that don’t want to be here. If you didn’t want to be here, you would have already left for better work, and you would have  hated your life somewhere else. 

People love this place and it’s not hard to see why, it has everything you could ever need. It has a compact old downtown filled with history and unique buildings, sitting on a beautiful harbourfront that flows into the Atlantic Ocean. There are old yet cool buildings previously deemed rundown. These places are being reinvented by hipsters, who somehow make the best coffee, beer and patio furniture one could ever find.

To maybe give Halifax it’s final bump. It has the 2nd most bars per capita in Canada. Having 40 000+ university students in the city may have something to do with that. The population is simply pleasant, polite, and easygoing. The Harbour is everything here in this city, and this is coming from a person who believed this even before he started working on boats. You could argue my love for the Harbour is a chicken and egg type of deal. I would have never worked on the boats if I didn’t think the Harbour was as cool as I think it is. 

There are a few reasons why I think the Harbour is crucial to the greatness of this city. First of all, the winters are not nearly as bad as most places in Canada, as the water prevents it from getting out-of-this-world cold, in the way most people associate with Canada. However, it creates very unpredictable weather. I have a theory that these weather 
patterns (or lack thereof), make people more apt to roll with the punches when life is unpredictable. 


These are the characteristics most locals have. And they were they were ones I had going into my first year at Murphy’s, although it was severely tested with all the nonsense this job throws at you. 

Now that all you really readers are familiar with the area. It’s time for that final piece of the puzzle. How did I find myself in this crazy place called Murphy’s? I ended up at Murphy’s the same way I seem to find myself in almost every situation in my life, by sheer coincidence. 

This time the coincidence was Eve. Fucking cousin Eve, the cousin who helped me choose which university I would be attending for the next four years of my life. She sold me on the parties, the food and the thing I cared least about, my degree. Credit to her recommendation , I had a spectacular first year so far. I was almost finished and about to pass every class. Her last piece of advice was to apply for this tourism company called Murphy’s.


At an Easter dinner she told me that I fit the bill of a classic Murphy’s deckhand. Whatever the fuck that meant. She told me to apply online as soon as possible as there was a job fair coming up and I would no doubt get a job for the summer. She wasn’t selling well enough so I decided to disregard her suggestion. I wanted to work as a server or bartender, all my buddies were doing this. This is where I thought the big bucks were made doing those roles in a restaurant. So I took half of her suggestion. I applied first for this Murphy’s place as a server, then as a back up I applied as a deckhand.


For those who don’t know Murphy’s is a combination of gift shop kiosks, a massive restaurant on the longest pier in the harbour, called the Cable Wharf, and last, but certainly not least, it owns wide variety of tour boats. The kiosks are corny, cheap,and touristy. If you read the yelp reviews the restaurant is “amazing”. In my opinion the food was average at best but that didn’t stop the tourists from flocking and being disappointed when they left. 

Thankfully, there the boats on premise to save the day. There were five different boats, and a handful of harbour hoppers, which were amphibious vehicles that operated both on land and in the harbour. These were the crowned jewels of the company they made hand over fist. But god damn were they boring. The people, the tours and the employees were fucking sandpaper.

The real fucking boats proceed as follows: The Harbour Queen, a beautiful Mississippi-style sternwheeler; the Kawartha Spirit, an all white, whale watching double decker; the Peggy’s Cove Express, a speedy fishing boat; Theodore the Tugboat, almost as if Thomas the Tank Engine was a tugboat instead of a locomotive with red colouring instead of blue; and the Tall Ship Silva, a massive three-masted schooner. They are the crowned jewels of this fantastically horrible place.

Now readers, I did tell you at the start that I would be frank with you, and tell the story responsibly, so I must admit…. I lied. The boats aren’t that great, realistically they’re falling apart and their tours are encompassed in deception. In my first year, the Kawartha’s engines blew up and its whale watch tour saw so few whales Murphy’s had to rebrand it as a “nature tour”; the Harbour Queen is commonly known as the Harbour Slut in Halifax because of all the raunchy late-night parties thrown on it; the Peggy’s Cove Express is so old it can no longer make it to Peggy’s Cove; and the Tall Ship Silva is not a real tall ship. It is technically a sailboat, although the way the sails are rigged, it cannot genuinely sail. Theodore the Tugboat is the only boat that does not deceive the public, but it’s geared towards kids so who cares. Hopefully, all this irony already exhibited in the boats will help foreshadow the wonderfully ridiculous nature that embodies the core of Murphy’s on the water. 

The one saving grace is that the boat staff are much more isolated than any other department in the company. This separation creates just enough of a disconnect so that everything that could go wrong will go wrong, almost all of the time. It also allows for more fun to be had, as the corporate heads of the company cannot mould all of the crew to fit into their perfect cookie cutter employee displayed on the travel brochures. There is also the additional contrast of the people who work on these boats; they are either supreme neat freaks or outright slobs in every aspect of work, life, and social settings. It is in this sort of chaos that I thrive.

Second, the water makes people want to have fun. It provides a location for activities you otherwise wouldn’t have if you lived in another city. Halifax is on the coast, with plenty of access to beaches where you can go swimming, surfing, and sailing. Most people around here like this sort of stuff.

After Eve, told me all this great information I did a little research. I discovered that the company would be holding a massive job fair in March, leading up to the season start in May. The instructions were simple: bring a resume, and for some reason prepare two stories; one of Halifax’s history, from which they selected a number of topics, and one of your choosing. The need to prepare a couple stories seemed strange to me, but I was unaware of what the job had in store regarding responsibilities. All the same, I began to prepare. 

My mom came and picked me up from university, and for the whole two hour car ride home, all we did was practice telling stories so I was prepared to crush this interview. I was definitely going to get this job. I wanted it desperately because one of my best friends, Jaggar, who attends the same university I do, was gunning for the same position. 
Jaggar is bananas, as he is an absolutely crazy, larger than life human, standing at 6’4”. With a booming voice and huge personality, he typically beats me to the punch on everything. If he were to get this job over me, I’d never hear the end of his crazy summer stories, being on the boats and talking to pretty girls. 
On the day of the job fair, we both arrive at the cold, wooden, unheated waterfront restaurant where they are conducting interviews. All of the managers of the various departments are sitting at tables with applicants for about 5-10 minutes, before the applicants move from table to table, talking to each of them. 
At this point I’m sweating it as I keep seeing good-looking people in their mid-20’s everywhere, and I’m this little, freshly 19 loser. Just as I’m getting this flash of self awareness and becoming nervous, my name is being called for my first interview, starting with a restaurant manager. Roxanne was her name, and the interview was a total bust. It was easy to see I had no idea what I was talking about, and I was quickly shooed away, only to hear my name being called by another person. 
This time it was a heavier set man, with dark hair half slicked back from his almost piggish face. Pierre was his name, and he was the manager of the boats and the captains. He was venting applications for the captains to “create good chemistry” on the boats - whatever the hell that meant. 
We sat at a small table that felt like it was about to break, the way Pierre was leaning on it. He began to ask general questions about my resume, but it was clear nautical questions were on the rise. So, as a man with zero knowledge of boats, I had one option - lie. 

Pierre called me over shortly and sat me down in a dark booth. He skipped every single pleasantries as if he had talked to 1000 guys my age. So I cut straight to the chase. I told him stories of sailing camps I never went to, knot tying I never did in scouts and the all the power boats my father wish he owned.
The stories were all fake, but my dad and brother both went to scouts so I bluffed the basics, and Christ almighty, it was working! Big manager Pierre was eating up what I was feeding him. Ten minutes passed and he told me to sit back down for a further interview. I’m pumped, but nervous, as the next interview might just start to expose all my well crafted lies. 
While I was waiting I googled names of knots, boats, nautical terms, you name it. I looked at everything I possibly could in five minutes. Like I said, I was not going to get turned down. In what seemed like two seconds since my last interview, my name gets called again, but by a different person.
Sitting at the back, in a booth, was a very tall, skinny, red haired man in a shirt that desperately needed to be tailored. The man in the booth is named Liam, and he will be a lurking character throughout my four years at Murphy’s. At every turn he was always constantly throwing wrenches into many of my plans. At the time, he was the manager of the deckhands, as well as some of the nautical operations in conjunction with Pierre.  
Liam took his turn asking the exact same beginner level nautical related questions Pierre asked during his interview. I gave him the same perfect  answer by lying right to his face. I told him I could tie many knots and knew the basics of sailing thanks to the same sailing camp I told Pierre about. Liam seemed very content with my answers. He never questioned a single explanation I gave and since there were no further questions from the two so called superiors I was free to leave.  After I left I felt as if I was a master of disguise. There was no way these guys believed me and my stories. I had to have given clues that I was full of shit and they must have sniffed it out. 

Regardless, it was worth a try. I had to go back to school to finish my first year of university. That was my first priority. They said I would know within a few weeks if I got it or not. I could find some summer job after my exams if I had too. 
Fast forward a couple of weeks and I got the email with the job offer, just as my final exams are ending. This is a huge weight off my shoulders. Jaggar received the same email and we were both thrilled to be potentially working together. We head home after school finishes and wait for a call to begin work, not knowing what we will be doing. 
It seems as though these calls will not be coming anytime soon, as day after day goes by without a word. In order to pass the time, Jaggar and I begin to gamble online, playing Blackjack in order to make just enough money to party with our friends, who have all started their jobs already. This was a terrible mistake, as we quickly started to burn through all of the money we had left from out first (and very expensive) year at university. Our bank account balances are getting very low, along with our morale, and any hopes of making enough money during the summer to pay for school. 
Just as I start to close in on my last couple hundred dollars, I get a call! Jaggar is pissed, as he still hasn’t heard a thing. I’m not told much, just that I am to report to the main Murphy’s gift shop for computer work. Now readers, this is the point of no return in this story. I was about to fully enter a world that would grip me for four summers, before nearly breaking me in the summer of 2020. The next chapters will be themed by individuals who have drastically shaped my time at Murphy’s

I wanted to gain 10 lbs by 2025 but I realized in the process that my eating habits in general are not normal. I used to not really eat breakfast before school in high school and it's the same now in uni. It's not that I don't have time but I never feel hungry until like 3 or 4 pm in the afternoon. I drink tea or coffee in the morning to feel awake and usually that's enough to get me through the classes. 

My classes usually end at 3 and by then I'm freaking starving, so when I get home I eat a huge huge meal (probably equivalent to 3 servings) and then I'm done for the day. The thought of eating when I'm not hungry doesn't make sense to me. My sisters say it's weird how there will be the best cake we've ever had in the fridge but I still won't have the temptation to eat that if I'm not hungry. 

I've tried to get myself to eat before classes but that gets me super sleepy by 10 or 11 am. I workout like 2-3 times a week and it's just basic cardio for 30-40 mins to keep my heart healthy. I also don't eat 3-4 hours before bed cause then I feel stuffed and have trouble feeling comfortable enough to fall asleep. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Why's it that I feel hungry that too on a severe level only once a day? How do I fix this and start building up a normal routine of 3 meals a day and hopefully gain a few pounds to look healthier?  ",1,1729426247.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

1g7x7ew,https://i.redd.it/s7ux0fffjwvd1.png,"A ""How-To"" on Journaling ","TL;DR: Transform your daily journal into a collection of vivid, story-like moments instead of a to-do list. Pick one meaningful incident each day, craft it into a mini-story with details and dialogue, and see how this practice helps you become more observant of life’s small yet significant moments.

---

Journaling has been a staple in my life as both a therapist and an individual. I often recommend it to clients as a way to reflect and process their experiences. However, I’ve realized that the act of journaling can sometimes feel daunting. When asked to reflect on your day, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the multitude of emotions and events that define it. As someone who has dabbled in various journaling styles—from lists to prompts—I can empathize with the struggle to articulate our thoughts on paper.


This John Berendt (author of The City of Falling Angels) quote does a good job of how to get started on journaling (whether you are utilising the prompts posted on this subreddit, freestyling it, or you are an experienced journal-er just looking for ways to improve the experience).


Rather than documenting everything, you choose one incident that caught your attention – perhaps the way morning light played on your kitchen counter, or an unexpectedly meaningful exchange with a colleague. This selective focus helps train your mind to be present and observant rather than just mechanically recording events.


For instance, a seemingly boring wait at the bus stop can become an opportunity to observe human nature. Your daily coffee run could turn into a chance to notice the barista’s (settled on barista because couldn't decide between chairwaala and coffee bhaiya/didi) quirks or the interactions between regular customers. This practice is about recognizing the narratives that exist in everyday life, rather than forcing meaning into each moment.


Writing about an incident as a structured story, complete with dialogue and sensory details, allows you to explore it from multiple angles. You're not just recording what happened, but considering the atmosphere, the context, the subtle interactions. This deeper engagement can help process experiences more thoroughly and often reveals insights you might have missed in the moment. Plus, it builds your writing skills naturally – you're practicing story structure, dialogue, and descriptive writing without the pressure of creating a masterpiece.


The beauty of this journaling method lies in its flexibility. One day you might write about the determined sparrow building a nest outside your window, another day about a touching moment of kindness witnessed at the grocery store. There's no pressure to find earth-shattering meaning in everything – sometimes a funny interaction with your pet or a peaceful moment in your garden is worth capturing simply because it made you smile.


Think of it as creating a personal anthology of moments. Over time, these vignettes not only preserve your memories but help train your attention to notice the small details that make each day unique. It's not about forcing profound meanings or treating journaling as a cure-all for life's challenges. Rather, it's a gentle practice that helps you become more attuned to the texture and richness of your own experience, one story at a time.


Remember, this is just one approach among many for engaging with your daily experiences. Like any practice, it might deeply resonate with some while feeling unnatural to others. The key is finding what helps you connect with your life in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you, whether that's through detailed storytelling, quick sketches, or simple moments of quiet reflection.",1,1729426015.0,HeadwayHealth,0,1.0,False

So this PC work laptop is from a company I work for, but it’s way too bulky and heavy and I hate bringing this monster with me. I’d like to carry my Mac (which is smaller and lighter) with me and access my PC through Tailscale. Since I work from home I want to leave it at home and use my Apple TV  as an exit route so I can remote access from my MacBook anywhere I go. I tested remote accessing my personal laptops from a coffee shop in downtown and it worked nicely (personal laptops at home and me at the coffee shop).

The problem I have with the work PC is that I don’t have permission from IT to install Tailscale so I need to use one of the subnet route. I'm still green with network access and VPN stuff so forgive my ignorance.

Below are some pics of my setup. As I said I have two laptops I own connected to Tailscale and they can be access with no problem.

I am a gay man who for a long time has not been to church and had challenges to connect to my faith for the obvious reasons, but recently started feeling a call to connect with God. In the last weeks I seemingly out of nowhere I have began praying and bought myself a bible, and strangely (side note) recently started having dreams about being attacked by demons and praying in my dreams to God / Jesus to stop the attacks.

Anyway, I finally plucked up the courage and decided to go to church this morning. I nearly didn’t go in but a young man who was part of the church saw me on the path down and greeted me and I felt more comfortable to go in. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming to me, even though I just felt so out of place.

I didn’t know what to expect really but soon as I entered and sat down I felt overcome with emotion and I just started crying. The service was lovely but I felt shy to sing and I found it overwhelming. At the end everyone was so nice and spoke to me about the community and invited me to lots of different things which felt lovely to be included but also again very overwhelming. After leaving I feel a bit emotionally drained from crying and overall experience. 

I got myself a coffee and sat outside in the park to contemplate and the branch of an Ash tree just randomly fell into my lap haha.

Anyway, I’m wondering if this is a normal way to feel after first attending church and where I go from here :)",2,1729425185.0,GayChristians,2,1.0,False

Seems like a good price, but not sure if the age is something to be mindful of and what else I should be checking when buying second hand?

As a second question, partner drinks decaf, is it easy enough to swap between beans from my coffee beans or would that be a total nightmare and better of with a grinder just for that?

I am a gay man who for a long time has not been to church and had challenges to connect to my faith for the obvious reasons, but recently started feeling a call to connect with God. In the last weeks I seemingly out of nowhere I have began praying and bought myself a bible, and strangely (side note) recently started having dreams about being attacked by demons and praying in my dreams to God / Jesus to stop the attacks.

Anyway, I finally plucked up the courage and decided to go to church this morning. I nearly didn’t go in but a young man who was part of the church saw me on the path down and greeted me and I felt more comfortable to go in. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming to me, even though I just felt so out of place.

I didn’t know what to expect really but soon as I entered and sat down I felt overcome with emotion and I just started crying. The service was lovely but I felt shy to sing and I found it overwhelming. At the end everyone was so nice and spoke to me about the community and invited me to lots of different things which felt lovely to be included but also again very overwhelming. After leaving I feel a bit emotionally drained from crying and overall experience. 

I got myself a coffee and sat outside in the park to contemplate and the branch of an Ash tree just randomly fell into my lap haha.

Anyway, I’m wondering if this is a normal way to feel after first attending church and where I go from here :)",3,1729424491.0,OpenChristian,2,1.0,False

He gave me the earings at midnight and this morning woke me up saying he had a somachache. When he finally got up, he just made coffee. Not even toast. I told him I thought there would be something to eat and he told me 'You didn't ask for anything, we usually don't eat for breakfast' and then made me some toast. I told him I wish I didn't have to ask for everything I want. I know I could be overreacting, but I want to cry. I feel so sad that he never comes up with any surprises to make me feel special.

1g7wqzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/1g7wqzi/how_to_look_for_a_job/,How to look for a job,"I was thinking to write this post back in the days - and now as I just passed my L3 I thought it might be the right time for it.

Before you dive any further - just FYI that this post will be regularly updated to reflect changes in the job market for CFA charter holders and general trends

Now a bit of a context and who this post will be applicable to:

I am an ex-Googler (L6) with 10+ years of experience in StratOps and Enablement roles in Ecomm and RetailTech. I have a decent network of Directors, VPs and other senior stakeholders in large companies and certain startups who I consulted

I am also European, live and work mainly in Europe. That is an important piece as many of you might be outside EMEA - so my post will not be as relevant as I wish it could

I also never worked in Finance nor had any desire to (okay, maybe a little). I will explain the rationale and advantages of CFA degree outside of Finance world later on

Your first thought might be “Hell, this dude probably has an avalanche of offers and invitations to companies. He is also a CFA charter holder! Where can it get any better?!”

Unfortunately, I do not.

The reality of the job market is brutal - something nor me, nor any of my ex-colleagues, senior friends (VPs) have seen since 2008 GFC. Getting a job is extremely difficult. Getting a decent job is almost impossible 

Over the last 11 months I have made certain mistakes in my job seeking approach and tried various tactics, talked with 5+ HRBPS in Meta, X, Amazon, LVMH, MBB (Big3) and finally managed to find the right approach to expedite getting an offer

So to recap:
I am an experienced European professional with CFA charter and 10+ of experience in non financial industries

I will also answer a well expected question “Why did you need CFA?”

The reason is actually quite straightforward if you think about it - Strategic roles for director+ level positions require a cross functional collaboration with Finance team on a regular basis. CFA (especially material in L1 and L2) helps to navigate among various company initiatives and prioritise the ones with the highest ROE (remember DuPont? Well here it comes handy indeed). It also helps you to gain quick wins and respect in CFO eyes. And gaining allies is always important the more senior you get

Also, CFA gave a ton of understanding how VC/PEs think and how to talk with them in their language: ideas like vintage, distribution mechanics (realized vs non-realized) and benchmarking helped me a ton in doing my due diligence when advising startups which team they would be better of getting a new round of financing from

It also gave me an edge in understanding trends and changes in the economy and how a Retail/Ecomm player should readjust itself to survive - and helped to dilute all salesy pitches of “strong growth and unbelievable profits” that you constantly hear on LinkedIn or industry conferences. For those who disagree here I strongly advise to read “Should Economists Deceive?
Prosocial Lying, Paternalism, and the
‘Ben Bernanke Problem’” by George DeMartino. You will love it, believe me

So - after all this intro let’s finally discuss the strategy and tips that work for me

First, applying without references does not work. Period. You can play delulu and hear random 0.01% stories of people who received and offer just by applying on a company website - but they are nothing but a myth, winning a lottery or a God’s miracle. You pick what bests suits your world view. The references are a must - do not even waste your time applying without getting at least 1

Second, we are in a market of specialists- not generalists. Thus, you should be not an accountant - you must be an accountant in BioTech with years of expertise in Medical industry, for example. This is the reality of the job market that was completely destroyed by LinkedIn algos having pushed people into narrow holes of specialisations

Third, get LinkedIn premium. Use it for cold reach outs via Connect button and add a small text that you are looking for career opportunities in their company. Make it crisp, to the point and relevant. Pro tip I gained back in 2015 from my sales teams - ask to meet for a coffee. If the person you are reaching out is not in your town - still ask for a coffee in a week’s time. Then 2 days before a coffee meetup tell him/her that you won’t be able to attend due to recent changes on a project at work and ask if a Zoom/Hangouts call would be ok. 95% are OK with it

Fourth, reach out 50 people A DAY. It might seem a lot - but only 10-15 will add you and maybe 2 will actually reply back. And it takes time to grow a network - so if you have 3K relevant people in a year then people will treat you completely different. You think people don’t care? Well, wake up buddy - certain Directors won’t even respect (not my words, I quote here) professionals with less than 2K in their network. “They are invisible for us”

Fifth, get ready to eat negativity. You are in a Sales role now - and you sell yourself. It is a tough job, so hit gym, play video games, eat out. You need to air out this nightmare. But don’t get scared - in general people are happy to connect you with someone

Sixth, CFA is recognised and respected outside the Finance world. Consulting world knows about it, large Retail knows about it, large Advertising know about it - and so forth. Do NOT waste your time explaining what CFA is if a person you speak with has no idea what it is. Your charter is like a gem - it glows in crown but you must have a crown in a first place. Otherwise it will be just a shiny pebble with no use

Seventh, post once a week and reply to post once a week too. Do NOT post random shit with cute dogs - unless you are so top tier that all companies beg you to work for them. But if you would be one I doubt you would be reading this. So post interesting findings or market reviews or your takes on recent trends. Better be boring than irrelevant 

Eighth, attend interesting RELEVANT (God, I can’t stress this one enough) conferences and events. If you can give a presentation or a keynote - even better! DO NOT go to general networking sessions in your town unless you literally have nothing else to do

Ninth, dress the f@£} up! You have only one chance to make the first impression and I have seen so many people underdressed that is it literally embarrassing. Disregard people saying it is not important - they are clowns themselves who never tried to sell anything. A simple jacket/blazer with paired trousers and a nice crisp shirt would do a job. It is that simple. And yes - it is also applicable to Zoom/Hangouts meetings

Tenth (and final for now), do NOT use “Open to Work” status on LinkedIn. Yes, I know it is a controversial statement and there are many reasons why you should be using it. Once again - this is true for Directors+ and what I hear on the street among seasoned professionals. So put “Stealth Startup” or your own Consulting company. ANYTHING but “Open to Work” - damn, even sabbatical would be better

I live in a townhouse with six other people, and recently, one of my roommates asked me not to make noise in the kitchen in the morning because his room is near it. For context, I wake up around 8 a.m. to start my day, and I make breakfast, which involves using the blender for coffee or juice (part of my daily routine). According to the lease rules, quiet hours are from 10 p.m. to 7:30 a.m., and the washer/dryer can be used from 10 a.m. to midnight.

Here’s the issue: this particular roommate is a PhD student who sleeps late (around 2 a.m.) and wakes up around 10 a.m. He doesn't have any morning commitments, and most of us in the house (including me) leave between 8 and 10 a.m. He initially approached me politely, asking me to avoid making noise in the kitchen because it disrupts his sleep. But the conversation escalated when I mentioned that I’m up early for a reason and have a busy schedule.

The main reason we even started talking was that it was my cleaning day, and while mopping near his door around 9 a.m., I accidentally touched the door with the mop, which woke him up. I apologized and told him I'd be more careful, but he then brought up the noise from breakfast as an ongoing issue. He even complained about the beep noise the microwave and oven make, which honestly seems a bit unreasonable since I don’t think I can control that.

His argument is that everyone should follow his sleep schedule, but that doesn’t seem fair. I get that the house can be noisy sometimes, but I follow the lease's quiet hours and have to start my day early. He suggested I don't need to clean that early, but I prefer to get things done before I shower and head out for the day.

I’ve checked the lease again, and I'm not breaking any rules. I'm just wondering if I should compromise more or stand my ground. Any thoughts on how to handle this?

P.S. one more thing he suggested was to have tea instead of coffee since it requires boiling only ",3,1729423558.0,badroommates,3,1.0,False

Any advice?,"I hope I'm in the right subreddit for this: I always dreamed a lot and kept a dream diary thrughout my childhood and teen years. Amongst the ""usual"" ""I know I'm dreaming"", I would also have reoccuring dreams where I felt like I had to make different choices in order to stop the dream from reoccuring and a lot of ""fake wakeup"" dreams and dreams where it felt so real, I would feel actual pain. I never wanted to explore lucid dreaming because the whole topic kinda scared me and I just wanted to stop dreaming.

After getting older, I dreamed less frequently and mostly my dreams would just play out without any ""incident"". However, recently the intense dreaming returned, and I had a really terrifying encounter last night.

For those interested, it was one of those fake wakeup dreams and the oddest thing was that the people within my dream were trying to convince me I'm awake. The last encounter was with my mum. She was sitting at the kitchen table as usual, drinking her coffee and asked how I slept. I told her that I had this fake wakeup dream and she commented that it sounded really scary. I sad ""Thankfully I'm awake now"" and suddenly, she had this expression. I had a gut feeling and asked if I was really awake and she started smiling the widest, creepiest smile I have ever seen and replied ""Yes! You are awake. Everything is okay, just stay here!"" before her face started distorting further and further.

I then woke up for real, but for the first few hours, I was so scared of talking to someone because I was not sure if I'm actually awake. I don't want to find myself in these situations but I have no idea what the best course moving forward should be. Do I try and surpress it, or act like I don't know I'm dreaming while I'm in a dream? Or do I have to get into lucid dreaming in order to controll what is happening? All I want is to avoid these situations where I'm uncertain of reality, and situations where I feel like my dreams are ""attacking me"" for realizing I'm dreaming. 

I hope someone here can give me some answers and some advice on how to deal with this.",0,1729423349.0,LucidDreaming,4,0.5,False
1g7wh9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1g7wh9w/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_17/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 17","The next morning, it was still raining very hard.  Jim and Sydney were the first two up.  They made themselves a cup of coffee and they both had a doughnut.  By eight-thirty, all five of his girls were out of bed and dressed.  All five girls had a bowl of cereal and milk (each girl ate a different cereal) and a glass of orange juice.  Jim turned on the Sunday morning news on Channel 3, which followed the gospel music program that Faulkner Motors sponsored.  It did not take long for everyone to see something interesting on the news. 

For some reason, Channel 3 was at the car show yesterday.  The anchor said that the car show was held for a good cause, the rebuilding of Salem Church.  The anchor went into some detail about the explosion that took place in September of 2011, and the church’s efforts to rebuild.  Julie was interviewed extensively.  Some of the others who were at the car show were also interviewed.  The anchor also told the viewers the beauty contest that was held on Friday (Channel 3 was also there, getting video shots of the beauty contest), along with the last car show, the one that was held a few months before.

Sydney saw the shots of the beauty contest.  She said, “I can see everyone had a good time at the beauty contest Friday evening.”

Jim said, “Yes, Sydney.  They did.  I just wish you could have been there.”

“I know.  I just wish Mom didn’t do what she did.  I guess if that didn’t happen, I would have been there, and I would have enjoyed it.”

“Yes.  And Valerie did a great job as a judge.”

“It looks like the judges made the best choices, and that includes Valerie.”

“Yes.  And I am very happy three of my daughters participated, and one of my daughters was a judge.  I’m also happy Caitlyn won her age group.”

Caitlyn spoke up.  “I am happy, too.  I just don’t know what I’m gonna get with my gift card from Toys ‘R Us.”

Then Lauren said, “I don’t know.  Neither do I.  I guess I could get a video game or something.”

Lindsay spoke up, and she had a pretty good idea what she wanted to get with her Toys ‘R Us gift card.  “There is a car racing game I’ve been wanting.”

“Lindsay, that sounds good,” Jim said.

Then Caitlyn said, “I’m thinking about getting a Power Wheels car.  There is one, a new Camaro I’m wanting.”

Sydney said, “Caitlyn, you should get a new bike or something.  Maybe a helmet and some knee pads.  You are not getting any smaller, you know.”

Jim added, “Yes, Caitlyn.  I think you’re getting too big for Power Wheels.”

Lindsay said, “Caitlyn, I found a bike that sounds like something you may enjoy.  It’s a girl’s bike, but it has a lot of cool stuff on it.  It has a horn, a small radio, and even a speedometer.”

Then Chelsea spoke up.  “Yes, Caitlyn.  You should check it out.”

Jim said, “Yes.  I’ll tell you girls what.  After our Sunday dinner, we’ll take a little trip to Toys ‘R Us and check it out.  What do you all say to that?”

The girls were all in agreement.  Then Jim said, “Okay, then.  It’s all set.  Now let’s be getting on to church because I think Julie has a major announcement.”

Right then, Sydney gulped down the last of her coffee, and then she said, “Yes, Jim.  You’re right.  Julie did say something about that yesterday, and I would like to know what it is.”

Everyone finished getting ready.  Jim decided to drive everyone to church in the minivan because it was still raining very heavily.

 

😊

 

The services for that Sunday morning were underway.  Just before her sermon (which would be about Christmas, seeing that it was about four weeks away), Julie made her announcement.  “Folks, there’s something I need to tell you.  First off, thanks to all of you who came out to our beauty contest on Friday and our car show yesterday.  Both events were a success.”

Then, Julie came out with it.  “Folks, a few days ago, Jim Faulkner and I took a little ride through Dilworth.  We stopped at a church building on Romany Road.  The place was built in 1957, with a fellowship hall added about twelve years later.  The church fell on hard times and went into foreclosure.  The place had been vacant for many years.  Jim and I had an opportunity to check the place out.  The place did smell bad and the baptism pool was full of algae, and the fellowship hall was falling apart.  But all in all, Jim and I both agreed on something.  With some fixing up and some cleaning up, we could use the place as the new location for Salem Church.  Fixing up the place could be better and cheaper than rebuilding the church.”

Then Julie went on about the conversation she and Jim had with Lloyd and Gladys Burton and their granddaughter.  Julie said, “Lloyd and Gladys are retired, and they want to sell the old church and move to their vacation home in Alexander County.  And they want to get it done as quickly as possible.  So, I was wondering if we could take a little trip to the church next Sunday in place of our usual service.”

Jim stepped up to the podium, and he said, “Folks, what Julie said, it is what she would like.  I know doing this thing next Sunday instead of our usual service is quite out of place, especially with Christmas coming and all that.  But, as a deacon of this church, I do feel you all should see what Julie has in mind.  What do you all say to that?”

Everyone looked at each other for about a couple minutes.  Then Russell, being a deacon as well, said, “Folks, from what Julie said, it looks like it may be something that could benefit this church.  Therefore, I make a motion we go along with this.”

Just as another deacon, Kurt, said he would second the motion, there was a loud rumble of thunder.  Julie looked up at the ceiling, and she said, “Oh, dear.  I think someone’s trying to tell us something.”

That got a laugh out of everyone.  And then Julie said, “Okay, then.  Motion passes.  Next Sunday, we’ll take a little field trip to what could be our new church.”

Then Julie went on to something else.  “Folks, with the situation we’ve been in for a little over a year, with the church explosion and having to hold services in the school auditorium and all that, you all know we didn’t hold our usual Christmas program last year.  I’m not sure if we can do that this year.  So, for this year, my plan is this.  We’ll have a nativity scene, and we have some Christmas songs from our youth ensemble.  But we will have no play this year.  Hopefully, we’ll be in a better situation and maybe we can do a play next year.”

That got an applause out of everyone.  Julie also said she would be able to do a Christmas dinner this year after services the Sunday before Christmas if everyone was interested.  Everyone agreed.

After the offertory hymn, Julie delivered a sermon based on a story from the Book of Matthew, coinciding with the birth of Jesus.  After delivering that sermon, everyone got ready for the final hymn.  Before anyone could start singing, the power suddenly flickered and then went out.  The only light in the auditorium came from the battery-powered backup lights.  The congregation went into one verse of “It Came Upon the Midnight Clear.”  After Julie delivered the closing prayer, she said, “Everyone, please be careful going home because it is bad out there.”

It was still thundering, and the rain was now coming down heavier than it did before church started.  Everyone ran to their vehicles as quickly as they could.  In one direction and toward the Charlotte skyline, there was a lot of lightning.  Jim and Sydney and his daughters got into the minivan very quickly.  Sydney’s dark blue dress was almost completely soaked.  She was not able to run because she was in high heels, as were Jim’s three oldest girls.  Jim did manage to get to the minivan quickly (seeing he was in casual shoes), but he did stay out long enough to open the minivan doors for the girls.  After they were all in, Sydney said to him, “Jim, thank you for opening the doors for us.  Now please get in before you get sick from being out in the cold rain and lightning gets you.”

Jim ran to the driver’s seat very quickly.  Jim left the school parking lot and drove on Euclid Avenue.  Jim had the radio set to his favorite Sunday afternoon smooth jazz program.  The music was interrupted at one point by a traffic bulletin.  *If you are driving through Dilworth, please be careful.  There is a report of a downed power line blocking some lanes on East Morehead.  There are also some power outages in the Dilworth area*.  After Jim made the turn onto East Morehead Street, he saw cars from the North Carolina Highway Patrol and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police blocking off lanes on East Morehead Street at Myrtle Avenue, and all the way down to McDowell Street.  Jim did manage to get onto Bethany Street.  Jim pulled into his driveway.  Once again, everyone got into the house quickly, only to see there was no power.  Jim did put the chicken in the refrigerator before they left for church.  When they got back, Jim did want to cook the chicken on the rotisserie cooker.  But Jim ended up saying, “I guess we’re not going to cook Sunday dinner today.  I guess we can have that chicken tomorrow evening.”

The girls agreed to that.  Then, Jim's cell phone rang.  He answered it.  “Jim, it’s Charlie.  How are things in Dilworth?”

Oh, yes.  Charlotte Elizabeth Faulkner.  Nicknamed Charlie.  One of Jim’s half-sisters.  She lived in Ballantyne with her mother, Wendy, and her other sister, Emily.  Jim said, “Charlie, everything’s not well.  We just got home from church to find we have no power.”

Charlie said, “I know.  We just got home from church ourselves.  A friend of Mom’s invited us to services at her church.  As soon as we got home, we got word there was a major power outage in Dilworth.  Is everything okay?”

“No.  We were going to have rotisserie chicken.  Now that plan is shot.  I don’t know what we’re going to do.”

“Jim, if you all can make it down here, we’ll be happy to have you all for dinner.  Bring Sydney and your girls if you’d like.”

“Sure, Charlie.  We’ll head down there.”

“Okay, Jim.  You all come on over.  Take your time and be careful, okay?”

“Yes, Charlie.  See you all soon.”

Jim told everyone he was about to take them to Wendy’s house.  Sydney said, “Sure, Jim.  But let me change my dress because I am soaked from the rain.”

Jim’s daughters said pretty much the same thing.  Jim said, “Okay.  But please wear something nice.”

Jim stood in the living room for about a minute.  His feet were wet.  So much so, they felt like they were itching and driving him crazy.  Jim said to himself, “Come to think of it, maybe I better change clothes myself.”

Jim walked upstairs to the master bedroom.  Jim picked out a polo shirt and some slacks.  He put on a dry pair of socks and a pair of canvas shoes.  Then he went back downstairs.  By the time he got into the living room, Lauren and Caitlyn were already in there, dressed and ready.  Sydney stepped into the living room shortly after.  Chelsea was in the kitchen, but she was wearing the same dress she wore in church.  Jim asked Chelsea if she intended on wearing that red dress.  She said, “Sure, Dad.  It’s still dry.  I’m okay.”

After church, Valerie was quick to change from nice clothes to play clothes.  After all, she was a tomboy.  She would be in that stage for some time.  Jim could hear Valerie and Lindsay getting into it, and possibly about Valerie’s choice in clothes.  Jim shouted from the bottom of the stairs, “Valerie Faulkner!  You better be wearing nice clothes and I do mean business!”

Lindsay shouted, “She will, Dad!  I’ll see to it!”

Sydney had something to say about that.  “Jim, I don’t think it would hurt Valerie to wear a dress occasionally and like it.”

Jim said, “Yes, Sydney.  I know.  I wish someone could convince her of that.”

Chelsea said, “Yes, Dad.  I think we all have, and to no avail.”

“That’s usually the case,” Jim said.

After a few more minutes, Lindsay and Valerie both entered the living room.  Valerie was wearing a light blue dress, but she did not have a smile on her face.  Sydney asked her, “Valerie, would it not kill you to smile?”

Valerie didn’t say a word.  She just made a face and stuck out her tongue at Sydney.  Lindsay quickly attempted to get to her.  Maybe she wanted to let Valerie have it.  Lauren and Chelsea stopped both girls.  Jim said, “Valerie Renee, you know we don’t stick out our tongues at anyone.”

Once again, Valerie didn’t say anything.  She just stood there.  Her face was nearly beet red.  She did take a few deep breaths.  After that, Valerie seemed to calm down.  Maybe she was not comfortable in a dress, but she would make the most of it.  Just as they walked out the door, Sydney asked, “Jim, is it always like this when you try to get Valerie to wear a dress?”

Jim answered, “Yes, Sydney.  It is.  You’ve seen it, no doubt.”

Sydney gave Jim a hard look as she said to him, “Then I guess we’ll just have to try harder.”

Jim said, “Sydney, good luck with that.  Maybe Valerie will leave that phase sooner or later.”

“Jim, I hope it’s more sooner than later.  I know you do, too.”

And with that, the subject was dropped.  Jim and the bunch were in the minivan and on their way to his mother’s house in Ballantyne.

 

😊

 

It was still raining hard when they left, and the wind was blowing quite hard.  When they got home from church, the wind was blowing, which was what may have caused that power outage.  Jim saw that East Morehead Street was still blocked near McDowell Street, so he had no choice but to turn left onto East Morehead Street. 

Jim took South Tryon Street and drove past Queen City Chevrolet.  He saw the wind was making the pennants he had put out along the car lot blow in nearly every direction.  From there, Jim took a few side streets before he reached South Boulevard.  Jim usually took Interstate 77 to Interstate 485 to get to Ballantyne.  But since the weather was bad, Jim was not sure he would be comfortable taking I-77, which could be very busy with traffic, even on the weekends. 

Jim drove on South Boulevard only to Tyvola Road, which he took to Park Road.  Park Road eventually turned into Johnston Road, which led to Ballantyne.  When he got to Wendy’s house, he saw two cars in the driveway.  Those cars were Emily’s Camaro and Charlie’s new car, a late-model Honda Civic.  The garage door was open, exposing Wendy’s BMW.  Next to it was a car covered with a canvas cover.  Jim parked his minivan behind Charlie’s Honda.

Jim and Sydney and the girls walked into the house.  As soon as they got inside, they could smell what was cooking.  Barbecued ribs.  And to go with it, fries, salad, garlic bread and iced tea.  Wendy stepped into the living room and gave everyone a hug.  Then she shouted, “Emily and Charlie!  Come down here!  Jim and his bunch are here!”

Emily and Charlie quickly went into the living room.  They gave Jim and his bunch a hug.  Then Emily and Charlie gave Sydney a hug.  Emily said, “Hi, Sydney.  It’s been a while since we last saw you.  How have you been?”

Sydney answered, “I’ve been doing quite well.  You know I’m living with Jim now.  Mom asked me to leave the house.”

Charlie said, “We know, Sydney.  We are sorry.  We know that’s very cold.”

Sydney said, “Yes.  But I guess it had to be.”

Then Emily asked Sydney, “How does it feel to be an aunt to twins?”

Sydney answered, “It feels great.  But remember, I’m about to be an aunt to three.  Ariel is expecting twins, and Kendra’s going to have a baby.”

“Oh, yes.  Sorry, Sydney.  We forgot,” Charlie said.

Then Jim said, “Thanks.  You all just reminded me to do something I meant to do before we left our house.  I need to check on them and make sure they’re okay, with the storm and all that.”

Jim excused himself to make his phone calls.  He walked into Wendy’s laundry room because he wanted to make his calls where it was quiet.  The first call he made was to Simon and Ariel.  Simon answered the phone.  Jim asked him, “Simon, are you and Ariel okay in this storm?”

Simon said, “Yes, Jim.  Ariel’s sound asleep.”

Jim asked Simon, “I didn’t wake her up by calling you, did I?”

“No, Jim.  You didn’t.  I’m glad you called.”

“Okay.  As long as Ariel is okay.”

“Where are you and your girls at?”

“We’re down in Ballantyne at Mom’s house.  Sydney came with us.”

“Okay, Jim.  As long as you all are safe.  How was church today?”

“It was okay until the power went out before we could get into the final hymn.”

“Jim, I heard Julie wants to buy an abandoned church on Romany Road.  Did everyone go along with her plan?”

“Simon, you heard right.  It sounds like everybody’s supporting Julie on her decision.  Julie wants to take us on a field trip next Sunday after services to check out the building.”

Simon said, “Jim, that’s good.  I’m going to call Julie and let her know that Ariel and I support her.”

Jim said, “Okay, Simon.  Go ahead and call Julie.  I’m going to go and call Mark and Kendra and check on them.”

“Okay, Jim.  I’ll speak to you later.”

Jim and Simon ended their call.  Then Jim called to check on Mark and Kendra.  Mark answered the phone.  Jim said, “Howdy, Mark.  I just wanted to call and check on you and Kendra.  Are you two okay in this storm?”

Mark answered, “Jim, we’re okay.  I’m glad our girls got home from church safe and sound.”

“Kendra’s not asleep, isn’t she?”

“No, Jim.  She’s been awake since about nine-thirty.  I taped the car show story on the news on Channel 3, and I suggested to Simon that he do the same.  I’m sure he’ll want to show it to Ariel.”

“Good going, Mark.  It’s a good story.”

Then Mark said, “I understand Julie told everyone in church about her plan.”

“You mean to buy that abandoned church on Romany Road?”

“Yes, Jim.  And I understand everyone in the church is going along with it.”

“Yes, Mark.  But I don’t know if it’s a done deal yet.  But she does want to take us to the building to check it out next Sunday after services.”

“Jim, I saw you and the girls pulling out of your driveway, and Sydney’s with you.  Where are you all at?”

“We’re at Mom’s house in Ballantyne.  Mom, Emily and Charlie knew there was a power outage in Dilworth and they wanted us to have Sunday dinner with them.”

“Sounds good, Jim.  What are you all having?”

“Mom and my half-sisters have fixed barbecued ribs, fries, salad and garlic bread.”

“That sounds good, Jim.”

Then, Jim got a text on his cell phone.  It was a message from Paulina to call her as soon as possible.  Jim said, “Mark, I better scat.  I just got a text message from Paulina, and I need to call her.  I’ll see you later.”

“Okay, Jim.  You and the girls be safe.”

Jim dialed Paulina’s cell phone number.  After Paulina answered, she asked, “Jim, where are you at?”

“At Mom’s house down in Ballantyne.”

“Okay, Jim.  I just had to make sure you and your girls are safe.”          

Jim asked Paulina where she was.  Paulina answered, “The police have got our neighborhood street blocked off because of a downed tree.  We’re at Julie’s house, eating fried chicken from Church’s Chicken.”

“Who’s we?” Jim asked.

Paulina answered, “Me, Mom, Russell and Scout, along with Julie and Crystal and their kids.  Julie was not too happy about the power being out.  So, me and Julie and Crystal went to get something to eat.”

“Are Crystal and Julie and their kids okay?” Jim asked.

Paulina answered, “Oh, yes.  They’re all okay as well.  Crystal and Julie and I went to a Family Dollar and a Church’s Chicken on Wilkinson Boulevard.  We got some sodas at Family Dollar before we got the chicken and sides at Church’s.”

“Was it bad going there?” Jim asked.

Paulina answered, “It was pretty bad, but we made it.  The kids rode with us.”

Jim said, “I’m just glad you all made it there and back safely.”

Then Paulina said, “Yeah.  So am I.  Harmony and Cooper didn’t even want to go into the toy aisle at Family Dollar.  But Crystal and Julie got Landon and Cooper each a Hot Wheels car.  Sunshine got a stuffed animal and Harmony got a Barbie.”

“That’s nice.  Maybe those things helped them get their minds off the storm.”

Then Wendy announced that dinner was ready.  Jim said, “Paulina, I’m going to go.  Mom has dinner ready.”

Paulina said, “Okay, Jim.  You all be careful coming home.”

 

😊

 

Everyone sat down for dinner.  Wendy asked Jim to say the blessing, and he agreed.  Jim told Wendy and his half-sisters about the services today.  He told them about Julie’s plans to buy an abandoned church on Romany Road.  Jim said, “Julie seems to want to get things going.  She says buying the church may be less expensive than building a new one.”

Emily said, “I just hope Julie doesn’t bite off more than she can chew.”

“Emily, what do you mean by that?” Charlie asked.

Emily said, “Julie is making plans to buy a church that had been closed for many years.  From what I understand, it’s going to take a lot of work to get it in one piece.  The pews are going to need to be redone, the place will need new carpet, and the fellowship hall will need new tables and chairs and appliances.  All that can get expensive.”

Then Wendy said, “Yes, that is true.  But a church like Salem Church could take months, if not years, to rebuild, if ever.”

Charlie said, “I know.  I just don’t want to see Salem Church make the bad mistake many other churches made when they were in those situations.  Getting ahead when things are good but struggling to stay afloat in bad times.”

Jim shook his head and said, “I don’t think Julie would ever do that.”

Wendy said, “I know.  We worked too hard to get out of our last mortgage.  I remember when we burned that mortgage.”

Emily said, “I know.  That’s a day everyone will long remember.”

Then Jim told his mother and half-sisters about the beauty contest and the car show.  He said, “Those two events were a success.  We raised quite a bit of money.”

Charlie said, “I heard about those two events.  We’re sorry we couldn’t make either of them.”

Then Emily said, “I know.  I would have gladly helped out with those two events, especially the beauty contest.”

“Emily, we all know you would have helped out,” Charlie said.

Chelsea said, “It’s okay, Emily.  It still was a success.”

Jim said, “Caitlyn won her age group.  Lauren and Lindsay also participated.”

Then Wendy asked, “Valerie, why didn’t you participate?”

Valerie answered, “I didn’t want to take part in any beauty contest.”

Jim said, “As we all know, Valerie doesn’t like to do girl things.”

Emily said, “Valerie, I think it’s about time you took part in things girls do.”

Valerie made a face, and she said, “You mean like wearing those dorky pageant dresses and those painful dress shoes?  I don’t think so.”

Jim said, “It’s okay.  She did take part as one of the judges, along with Dad.  And I will have you all know she did a good job.”

It was true that Wendy, Emily and Charlie wanted Valerie to do the things other girls do.  Valerie was now nine years old.  Everyone knew that nearly every girl of that age tended to go into a “tomboy” stage.  For the past year or so, Valerie was more content with climbing trees, playing with toy cars (versus playing with dolls), playing sports, and of course, wearing jeans and t-shirts and tennis shoes instead of wearing dresses and dress shoes.

After dinner, everyone gathered in the living room.  It was still raining, so there was no playing outside.  Valerie and Caitlyn slept for about an hour.  Maybe all that food made them doze off.  Jim and his three oldest daughters managed to fight the urge to doze off, as did Sydney.  There was a football game on TV, and it involved the Carolina Panthers.  They were taking on the Atlanta Falcons.  Carolina ended up winning the game. 

After the game, Jim and Sydney gathered up the girls, and they left Wendy’s house.  They stopped at a Toys ‘R Us in Pineville to look around, and to allow the girls to pick out what they wanted for Christmas.  This lasted for about an hour.  Jim bought him a couple die cast cars.  After they got done at Toys ‘R Us, they went to Carolina Place Mall to do some more looking around, and to walk off their dinner.  Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay found some dresses and outfits they wanted.  Jim also found some outfits for Valerie and Caitlyn.  Jim took Sydney to a jewelry store.  Jim had a hunch that Sydney would look at engagement rings.  And he was right!  Sydney spent about ten minutes finding one she felt she would like.  As soon as she found the ring she would like, she called Jim over to look at it.  Sydney softly put her arm around Jim as she said, “Jim, sweetheart.  I want you to look at that.  That’s the kind of ring I want.”

“You mean an engagement ring?”

“Yes, Jim.  That one.”

It looked almost like the one Jim gave Candi.  Jim felt sad when he saw it, but he did manage to maintain control over his emotions.  The more Jim saw the ring, the more he felt he just may be ready to pop the question to Sydney.  At this point, Jim was not sure how he was going to pull that off.  Jim proposed to Candi at the Indianapolis 500 in 1987.  Now, the Indy 500 was not even a possibility.  If Jim was going to propose to Sydney, it would have to be in Charlotte. 

Jim said, “Sydney, if that’s the ring you want, I’ll see what I can do.”

“Jim, if you can’t get it, it’s okay.  If you get something close to it, it’ll do.”

Jim didn’t say a word.  He just put his arm around Sydney, and he gave her a kiss on her cheek.  Before Jim, the only other boyfriend Sydney had in her life was that race car driver named Lyle McPherson.  Sydney hoped she had found her knight in shining armor.  But Lyle did turn out to be wrapped in tinfoil.  He was not ready to take the next step.  Lyle was preparing to break things off with Sydney when he was killed when he wrecked his race car at the speedway in Hickory in the summer of 2011.  Now, here was Sydney Cavanaugh, about a year and a half later.  Maybe now, she had found her true love, someone she admitted having a crush on when she was younger. 

Jim and Sydney walked hand in hand.  His daughters were walking behind them.  The five girls sat on a bench while Jim and Sydney walked around Belk for a few minutes.  They walked into the women’s department.  Jim saw some mannequins dressed in some very pretty dresses, blouses and skirts.  Right away, he pictured Sydney in some of those clothes.  Sydney got a look at Jim.  She asked him, “What are you looking at, sweetheart?”

Jim answered, “I don’t know.  I guess I’m just picturing in my mind how pretty you would look in those dresses and outfits.”

Sydney looked at Jim and smiled.  Then she said, “It’s okay, Jim.  I guess I’ve found myself picturing in my mind how I would look in clothes like those.”

“I did the same thing when I was with Candi.”

And now, here was Jim, years later.  In the women’s department of the Belk Department Store in the Carolina Place Mall in Pineville, North Carolina.  Sydney was standing right beside him.  Sydney said, “Jim, I know what you’re thinking, and trust me, it’s okay.  Those dresses and outfits are very pretty.”

Sydney did like to dress nice.  She did tend to dress a lot like April Lynn and Julie.  April Lynn was a former beauty queen and Julie was a minister.  They, along with pretty much all the other women and girls in the neighborhood, had good taste for very nice clothes.  That impressed Jim, along with the other guys. 

Jim asked Sydney, “Could you wear clothes like those if I got them for you?”

Sydney said, “Yes, Jim.  I most certainly would.”

One of those mannequins had on an outfit consisting of a white blouse, a black pencil skirt, and a silk scarf around her neck.  Then, it hit Jim.  Julie liked to wear scarves around her neck.  Sometimes, Julie would have the scarf tied to one side.  In recent years, Sydney had been wearing scarves pretty much the same way as Julie.  Not only that, Jim had also noticed that Lindsay and Morgan were doing likewise.  Whatever Julie had been doing, it must have been rubbing off on them.

Then Jim saw another pretty dress.  It was a light blue one.  It had white lace and some ruffles.  Jim pictured Sydney in that dress.  He thought, *If Sydney could wear a dress like that with high heels, I know she would look so pretty.  I wouldn’t know how I could contain myself*. 

Sydney walked outside of Belk to join the girls.  They were all sitting on a bench in front of the store.  Meanwhile, inside Belk, Jim bought the light blue dress for Sydney.  He also bought two blouses (a white long-sleeved one and a light blue short-sleeved one), a black skirt, and he bought a pair of black high-heeled pumps.  Before he made it to the cash register, Jim called Sydney on her cell phone.  He told her to take the girls to the food court and get them a small snack and a drink.  After he paid for his purchases, he would take them to the minivan.

On the way to the food court, Jim made one more stop.  The store that sold Hallmark.  Jim realized he had not got his annual car Keepsake Ornament yet.  Jim had got a classic car ornament every year since the first came out in 1991.  That year, it was a red 1957 Corvette.  This year, it would be a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am.  Jim got that ornament, along with one of Tinker Bell (for Caitlyn’s sake, he thought).

Jim joined Sydney and the girls.  They were in the food court, eating chips and drinking sodas from a sandwich shop.  Jim wasn’t hungry, so he just got him a cup of Coke from a Chinese restaurant.  While everyone was eating, Jim got a text message from Julie.  She said that the power was back on.  With that, everyone got ready to leave.  Jim drove the minivan to the mall entrance.  When he got there, Sydney and the girls were already there.  They got into the minivan.

Jim took Park Road to get to Dilworth.  By the time he got there, the rain had let up.  He saw that East Morehead Street was cleared from where the power lines were down.  It was already getting dark.  As soon as Jim got onto Bethany Street, he saw the lights were on.  Even the Christmas lights were on.  Jim and his girls had already had their Christmas tree up.  They always put their tree up on Thanksgiving weekend.  They had their tree up since Friday.

After Sydney and the girls got into the house, Jim took his Belk purchases into the house.  He did a good job of hiding them in the attic. 

As the holiday season progressed, Jim would shop for his girls.  Jim got the bike for Caitlyn.  He also got clothes for all of them, and he got tablets for Lauren and Lindsay.  He also got Lindsay a new guitar.  Just like he did with Sydney’s gifts, he did a good job of hiding them in the attic after he wrapped them one day while Sydney and the girls were out of the house.

As she promised, Julie took some of the members of Salem Church to the abandoned church building on Romany Road.  Jim and Sydney went along with them, but Jim’s girls went to Wendy’s house for Sunday dinner.  They did get a look inside.  They all agreed on one thing.  It would need a lot of fixing up.  But if they could do it, maybe Julie would come out cheaper than to rebuild Salem Church from scratch.

Jim did his grocery shopping for Christmas as the holiday season progressed.  He got a turkey, a ham, various canned vegetables, cheddar biscuit mix, stuff to make salad, and stuff to make a pistachio cake, cherry cheese pie and Chex Mix.

On the second Sunday in December after the morning service, Julie got everyone to meet her at the church building she was wanting to have restored.  Everyone did agree that restoring the building would be a great idea.

Jim knew Nikki Crabtree was wanting to meet with him.  One day during the second week of December, Nikki called Jim at work.  Nikki told Jim she wanted to meet his daughters, along with his friends.  They were also friends with Vince and Marissa. 

They agreed on meeting one evening in the week before Christmas.",0,1729423308.0,writers,4,0.2,False

Hey everyone!

I’m fairly new to Riyadh/Saudi Arabia and currently working in the QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) sector. I’ve noticed that while people love to hang out in cafes, relax, and chat over a cup of coffee, in QSR chains, most customers seem to prefer takeout rather than dining in. I understand that QSRs are generally geared towards takeaway, but casual dining is an option too, right? Yet, I don't see many people opting for it.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on what features or parameters makes some restaurants more customer-centric and appealing here in Saudi. Thanks in advance!",1,1729423296.0,RiyadhExpats,0,1.0,False

First time using this so apologies if I'm not used to the normal etiquette and stuff, let me know if there are any questions. Apologies, there's a lot of context!

I've been depressed for the last few months over an experience I had in March with a guy. For some context, I've not really had a very good experience with relationships at all throughout my life, usually I just got ghosted or only contacted if the person wants to have sex, which doesn't feel great. Also for further context I'm 26m and he's 31m. I have / had an online friend that I've known for a few years, we met on a niche interest dating site and ended up adding each other on discord and chatting for a while. I really really liked him, since I thought he was both super hot and we shared a lot of the same interests which is rare for me. I'm quite picky. Our conversations actually started out somewhat sexual and flirty, and it's weird looking back on them now with the context that he's apparently straight. At the time he said he was bi and said he found both men and women hot, but mostly women.

Regardless, we'd been chatting for a while but eventually the conversations became a little more passive from his side, sending 1 word responses and not really communicating much. Now, something to keep in mind is that I live in the UK and he lives in the US, so a relationship was basically never going to be feasible, and I understood this at the time. However in march I was visiting the US, near where he lives, so I told him that I'd be happy to meet him for a coffee if he wanted. He agreed, and told me I could stay at his place because he had a spare room. By this point all the sexual conversations had stopped, and I just assumed we were friends, so I knew nothing was going to happen. I still really liked him though, since again online I don't really have anyone to speak to that has the exact same nerdy interests I'm into.

We eventually meet and he's a little awkward but it's fine, again, under the assumption that we're just friends, I go to his place, play videogames, watch a movie with him, he tells me about the quaint little rural town he lives in, and bizarrely offloads onto me about how he got fired from his last job/issues he has with other people that live in the town that hate him for ""no reason"", and how he lives like a bit of a hermit now because he's looking for a job. I kind of knew already that he didn't tend to do much outside of his house, but in a stupid self righteous way I wanted to help him, I always said I'd help him look for jobs and help him with his CV and stuff if he wants.

Anyway, some time passes and I'm at his place playing a videogame and he leaves the room briefly, only to come back in shirtless and flirty, telling me something along the lines of ""I feel bad if you come all this way and we don't get to do anything"", I go to his bedroom with him and we start to cuddle and kiss and stuff, and eventually he tells me he's getting turned on. I start having sex with him, but I'm not very experienced so I need to be guided a lot, this goes on for a while, and he's kind of not really turned on anymore, and he asks me if he can watch porn while I'm helping him out. Stupidly, I say yes, and then I eventually pull off him a few minutes later because I feel like I'm not getting anywhere and basically let him finish himself off. By this point I'm already feeling humiliated, and he makes an off comment about how ""it's fine, I know youre asexual"", which, I'm not, I have no idea where he got this idea from. After that I go to the spare room and basically struggle to sleep for the rest of the night. I end up sort of doing my own thing for the next day after that, since he doesn't really want to leave the house much after that point, until I eventually head home. Now, at that point I just thought of all that as a random awkward encounter, still speaking to him on text here and there. But months later I feel absolutely mortified that all that happened, what makes it worse is that, months later, all his social media profiles have changed to say he's just straight now, and he'll make posts insisting he's never had feelings for men. We still speak on occasion, but it's usually me pestering him with memes and stuff that he barely responds to.

About a month ago I blocked him because it hurts me to even message him, and it just felt super unrequited. I added him back eventually and he seemed confused why I blocked him in the first place, so I just came out and said I had feelings for him and it kind of hurt me that he seemed so indifferent towards me, and I asked for some sort of clarity on where we even standing at this point. He barely even responded to that confession, basically sending a meme back and being like ""idk lol were just friends"". I didn't know what to say after that.

Now, in the present, I'm just constantly thinking about him and I really don't want to because it hurts me so much, I dont even think I'm in love with him, since my brain seems to have finally caught up and seen all the red flags he's shown over the years I've known him, but it's more because I've never felt so humiliated. It's the fact that I was absolutely ready to catch up with him like a friend would, then we had sex, only for him to start watching porn mid sex, and now he's set his dating stuff to straight. It makes me feel as if I made him realise he was never bi which feels absolutely awful. I understand that people need to experiment sometimes, but it does NOT feel good to feel like you're the reason that someone realised they don't like men. Something else to consider is that even before we met I'd always asked him if he'd been with guys before and he said he had, since I was worried something like this might happen.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is what can I do to forget about him? My original plan was blocking him but I ended up going back on myself for that. I really want to stop thinking about him because I feel like an obsessive psycho and it's interfering with my work by how depressed it's making me. I wish I could do some sort of eternal sunshine thing and just remove him from my brain.",1,1729422796.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I (31F) met my ex (32M) when I was still in high school. We were friends for a couple of years before we decided it could be worth it to pursue things romantically, considering how we both felt. It was a whirlwind, YA novel type of romance that became so deep and meaningful at the time, but seems so embarrassing looking back. For my eighteenth birthday, he even made a short film about the reason he supposedly loved me starring his art/film school friends giving their testimonials. 

We had an on-again-off-again relationship for five years following, as we always lived in different places and had an understanding of “we’re together when we’re together.”

When I was 21, he called me every night for maybe a year (along with our holiday reunions) to eventually convince me to move to LA to join him. I had previously attended a liberal arts school on the east coast. I applied and received a very large scholarship (at least for someone from my background who had no extra money for anything), told him, and he and I decided to find a place to live together. We planned it all. Down to the linen colors for our bathroom. The lease was signed. I felt secure. 

The night I arrived, he told me that he met an interesting girl at a party the night before, and maybe I shouldn’t live there. I’d spent all of my savings moving across the country, and I spent my first night in LA trying to sleep on a hardwood floor in the bedroom that became just my own. I tried to make the best of everything despite what happened, and despite having an old married couple dynamic with my ex, for whom I’d made coffee for in the morning and would drink wine with on the porch swing seat at night. I still helped him be able to write women in his scripts and help him and all of his friends with their film projects. (Yes, I did enjoy it while I thought I was appreciated.)

Anyway, I fell off of the roof onto the driveway and broke three ribs, my elbow (which needed emergency surgery), and shattered my pelvis. I returned to my parents’ Midwestern home so that I could be helped to physical therapy. (I mean, they told me they weren’t sure if I’d walk on my own again at first.) I got some perspective and decided to only return to California for a short time to organize everything to return home, as I finally had the distance to see how unhealthy the living situation was. The guy was back in town for the holidays; I told him at a diner. He cried and refused to allow me to drive him back to his father’s house—despite the extreme snow—and walked back.

When I went back, I ended up flying out my best friend(now 35F) to celebrate my 22nd birthday with me and (supposedly) help me back everything up before driving back across the country with whatever possessions I could keep. Instead, she used my car as she wanted, was largely absent, and packed so much luggage that I didn’t have room to even drive my printer back home. 

Six or seven months later—after months of hanging out and sleepovers and even hooking up—she told me she’d been secretly dating that ex and was going to move into that same house with him. My house. I completely broke. 

Five years later, she reached out to me a bit and apologized, saying it was the worst thing she’d done. I had been through so much therapy and also time that I forgave her, and we became best friends again, despite living in different cities. She and I would video chat for hours all of the time, and she, having SO much more money, would come into town (where most of her relatives live as well) to see me around my birthday. I felt like I had my best friend back.

Maybe six months ago, she stopped reaching out to me almost completely. When we talked, she made comments that I should change my sleep schedule to her preference. My mum was diagnosed with cancer, but she just told me about her experiences traveling as what I view as a rich person. And about how I should improve myself based upon how she needed to improve her communication with her generationally wealthy husband. 

I think I might be the villain. Why did I hold any judgment when I know I am fallible??? I hate myself and fall apart almost every day because of it. But I cut her off and am starting to feel guilty and like I’m the “bad guy,” but I have no idea. I’ve always thought of myself as the ass, so I’m having a hard time standing my ground and listening to my close family and friends—who know all of the history and details and messages—as somehow reasonable or potentially right.

I'm really struggling to find the perfect coffee table for my living room, and I was hoping some of you could lend a helping hand. I've been scouring online marketplaces, furniture stores, and design blogs for weeks, but I just can't seem to make up my mind.


My living room is pretty cozy, with a comfortable sectional sofa, a large window, and a neutral color scheme. I'm looking for a coffee table that's around 40-50 inches in diameter, with a sturdy base and a surface that's easy to clean (I've got two kiddos and a clumsy husband, after all).


I've considered glass-top tables, wooden ones, and even metal ones, but each has its pros and cons. Glass seems elegant, but I'm worried it'll show fingerprints and water rings. Wooden tables are warm and cozy, but they might scratch easily. And metal tables are industrial-chic, but they can be noisy and cold.


I've read that a coffee table should be around 1-2 inches lower than the sofa cushions, but is that a hard and fast rule? And what about the shape - should it be round, rectangular, or oval? I've seen some gorgeous oval tables online, but will they work in a rectangular room?


So, I'd love to hear your advice! What's the best coffee table style, material, and shape for a cozy living room like mine? Have any of you struggled with similar decisions?

I’m aware there’s a significant price gap between these options, which would mainly affect how soon I can purchase, but it won’t limit my choice (i.e., I’d get the cheaper one sooner).

After going through many reviews, I haven't found a clear consensus. What matters most to me is durability and taste. I’m aiming for a balanced cup with some sweetness and good clarity. Since I’ll be grinding for just one cup at a time, capacity isn’t a major concern.

I’d love to hear your experience and recommendations. Do you think the price difference between the Q series and K series is noticeable in terms of durability and taste? Or is it more about added features like refinements, capacity, or external adjustment dials?

Thanks a lot!",1,1729422051.0,1zpresso,1,1.0,False

I was stoked to see modafalyst in the show as a way to combat their tiredness!!

Modafinil generally acts within a few minutes.

When I take it inanticipation of oncoming tiredness, I feel completely fucking WIRED. I'm talking had too much coffee, heart beating fast, excitable, at worst rising panic. I generally Do Not do this as the outcome is unpredictable in its severity and is generally to much stimulant for calm, everyday function.

If I take it when I am already tired and I need it to combat my microsleeps/active desire to sleep at daytime, modafinil can either feel like it did completely nothing or it can make me feel a regular amount of awake. 

If I feel like the modafinil did nothing, I have to really intently look at sunlit surroundings, or find something so interesting that my brain wants to forgo sleep. Otherwise its more pills or bed. Generally there can be a point at which I am so deep in the tired it's basically too late and the drugs do nothing.

I think it makes sense to me why Teo was feeling the effects of it in episode 3, because he probably isn't regularly as sleep deprived as Dave. He probably falls more into that first category of feeling not actively tired at that point and therefore the stimulant makes him feel more wired or Very awake. Dave, having extreme exhaustion, experiences it more neutrally or doesn't feel effects at all.

noticeable when I use the large container. The ground coffee sticks to the walls, bounces around, and doesn’t pour out easily. Only when I ground the container in the sink (metal) does the effect go away. 

I have cleaned the Podmkr very thoroughly three times now. I tried to remove the static charge, but it didn’t help. Has anyone else experienced this? 

Can anyone help? I contacted Podmkr support, but I haven't received a response.

I’m serious about finding someone to connect with, and I’m not the type to play around. If things click, I’m open to taking serious steps, even having that important conversation with your family.

I was coming home early from California and I remember the blast of the 3 woods that came through the phone. Don’t come home.. In 3.5 years I would have never thought although I understand who I was then because of who I am now. I don’t know if I’ll ever actually have a conversation with you again but I do know I will see you for 7 days in June every year.. Well, at least until God takes one of us.. I often wonder how you’re doing now. Not so much of what you’re doing.. I wonder if you’re sitting upstairs with a little listening to her sleep scrolling through your phone.. I wonder if I ever cross your mind these days when you’re alone and how you feel when or if you do. I wonder as your filling up the pellet stoves now if you think about how that was the most we ever really did together in the end.. I wonder when you go into the kitchen for your coffee if you look around and see me working on your dream of a big kitchen.. I remember how it was.. I had the memories of the downstairs remodel show up a few days ago.. I haven’t been brave enough to delete any pictures yet.. I actually sit sometime and purposely go through them.. Noticing changes throughout the short years. I begin to wonder how I could have been better for you and the girls.. I know the answers to all my questions now.. Time allows me to reflect. It’s not a haunting of you anymore because fortunately most of the grief and everything that goes with it has gone. I find myself actually smiling now because somehow I feel even though we aren’t together anymore that you are happy. I used to find that heartbreaking but these days are so much different. I know you said you would hate it seeing me change into who you wanted me to be and another woman gets the best version of me but .. I find myself at peace without that interaction. I don’t know what it is honestly.. maybe I haven’t let you go totally because I feel like I’m cheating on you.. I just really don’t care to invest my time into anyone else I guess. How ironic right? Seems I always had time for others except for you.. That wasn’t the case at all.. I don’t really understand what happened to you only you do . Maybe it was loosing the girls dad, your brother, your dad, me, and your friend.. I don’t know. I know I constantly tried to help although why would you talk to a guy you couldn’t trust. I get it.. You said I should have seen this coming but actually I didn’t. When I married you, my plan was very much different.. I so wanted us to be different and it kinda is different now.. I think for me, I get up randomly and just wonder about you. I’m sure it’s normal and I’m certain it’s something that won’t ever go away.. I don’t know if you stumble up on me from time to time and that is okay. I’ve learned to live without you but kinda hold the memories.. I do try looking for you but it doesn’t consume me anymore.. To be honest, I don’t think I’ll ever stop loving you and you are right.. It’s a different kind of love.. Not one of husband and wife, not one as friends.. Just a love of knowing who you are and how you impacted my life. If I see you again, I’m sure you’ll feel my heart vibrations when we notice each other for that split second. It’ll be hard for me not to notice.. As I’m sure you will feel the same.. I think it’s human nature.. I think.. Maybe next time we see each other it won’t feel like it did last June.. I guess the aches were still too strong for us both. I wish you the very very best in all your ventures in life and rest assured I think of you often..

To me, ganache is a versatile medium that can be used to fill, frost, glaze, or enjoy on its own, among many other applications. Given Chhena's subtle profile, I believe that using it as any flavored ganache will enhance its overall appeal while also promoting Odisha's indigenous Chhena industry.

Imagine a bun with Chhena ganache, a cake frosted with Chhena ganache, a tart topped with Chhena ganache, or macarons with Chhena ganache filling. Think of donuts oozing Chhena ganache, cookies sandwiching Chhena ganache, or even a decadent Chhena ganache truffle. The possibilities are endless!

With that in mind, allow me to introduce a Chhena Ganache recipe!

Ingredients:
- 1 cup Chhena cheese
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar (optional, adjust to taste)
- Flavoring (such as Chocolate, Vanilla, Almond, Hazelnut, Coffee, Mint, Coconut, Orange, Lemon, Raspberry, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Ginger, Chili powder (for a spicy kick), Matcha, Caramel, Peanut Butter, Lotus Biscuits, Oreo, Kesar, Pista, Malai, Mango, Rose, amongst many other flavors — with the quantity varying based on your choice of flavor)

The instructions are very simple. In a food processor or with a whisk, blend the Chhena cheese until smooth and creamy. If using, add the powdered sugar, and then the flavoring, and mix until fully incorporated. Then, refrigerate the ganache for about 30 minutes to firm up slightly. 

Do try it and suggest how it can be improved!

He won’t stop barking in it now… free roam is not an option. He won’t sit still for any reason ever. He wanders too much and chews on things he should not. it’s relentless barking.. It’s demand barking for my attention, but I need to work. I work from home mostly. I walk him every morning, middle of the day we play in the yard, night walks. On days off it’s the dog park or it’s a very long walk and coffee shop stops. New toys all the time. Puzzle ones with trying to get treats out. He gets tired of them really quickly. I’m doing everything. My entire life revolves around him. I’m training him. I don’t know what to do. I need to change something obviously, but I’m at a loss. Please help me before I go insane lol.
