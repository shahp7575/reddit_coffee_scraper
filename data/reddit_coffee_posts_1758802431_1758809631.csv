( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nq7sr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nq7sr1/not_being_supportive_of_my_friends_relationship/,Not being supportive of my friend's relationship?,"This story goes back a year ago while I was in a relationship with my now ex. Me and let's call her Carol, have been friends for at least 4 years and she just recently came out as bi. I did have a crush on her two years back but it came and went such as crushes do. We went to an amusement park and I talked to Carol about my relationship with my partner at that point, and I saw it fit, because that is what to female friends do right? Anyway, after the adrenaline rush after the amusement park on the bus ride home she confessed that she had feelings for me and I was at that moment full of bliss, because someone who I had a crush on liked me back, but I also told her that I was in a relationship and it can't work out. 

Conveniently I just talked about my doubts about my current relationship at that time. Long story short me and my partner broke up at that time but it was not about Carol, it was due to other underlying problems we did not discuss. Thus began the whole stretch for winning Carol over and possibly dating. I thought we were ideal, such as delusionist tend to think.  Before you say I moved on too quick, this happened two months after me and my partner broke up

  
Over a couple of months I tried telling her that I like her by even creating a website to ask her out on a coffee date, but decided not to show her it, because I thought that was too much and I might scare her off. But subtly I leave messages and notes in her locker and even drew her as a way to show my appreciation for her. Unfortunately, every time we get to discussing it, she changes the subject. After trying to chase her, and her also letting me down as a friend a couple of times, I decided not to pursue her anymore.

  
But I still wanted to know why I got radio silence after explicitly telling her that I like her and she did not want to believe met. So after a couple of months I finally asked Carol why she did what she did. Her reasoning for not reciprocating was due to her parents disapproving the whole ""being bi"" thing. I finally understood why and respected her parents' reasoning and decision. 

Time went by and we both got into talking stages with gents and at one point both of our talking stages were failing so yet again we talked about relationships and brought up the topic of ""why didn't we work out? "" She then managed to tell me that she will forget about everything her parents said and do as she pleases. We flirted once again and decided that maybe we should try something. After that talk, nothing happened no attempts were made further and upon further inspection it was her parents' views again that were the problem. 

  
I was so fed up with Carol at that point that I kind of shunned her out of my normal friend group and focused more on the people who actually care for me. Then came her birthday... I wanted to one-up her by getting her a gift that beat the gift she got me for my birthday last year. (This will be extra info- She basically cut me a CD and made a playlist for me that represented our friendship and the whole CD was filled with pictures of us. I wanted to one- up her by making a scrapbook for her and so I did. I proceeded to make a nice little cover page and so forth. I also ended up making a page in the book where I also made her a playlist and even drew us together playing guitar. Then I added another page were I asked all of the people who were close to her to say something nice about Carol. I then took everything the people said and wrote it down and put it in an envelope so that she can read all the nice things people say about her)

I was invited to her bday party but couldn't go even though I wanted to. I was restricted in my circumstances, but I still managed to give her present to her the day after her party and she literally started sobbing. After I got home and she went through the things she sent me a voice note saying how she will respond accordingly to her bday present. Time went by and there was no response. All my effort for absolutely nothing.

After all that we went on like nothing happened and nothing transpired but  we still kept talking as just friends and she came to me saying that there is no one who likes her and she is not emotionally ready anyway for a relationship. Although she did not stay true to that statement. A few weeks back she and this guy started talking to her and she was completely fawning over him and doing maximum effort for him and even putting less effort into her studies (bc she also used that as an excuse for why we couldn't work) She dropped almost everything to make him a handmade gift bc he was a nice bloke

  
This is so frustrating to me, because all my efforts were not appreciated but as soon as a guy does it, then she will drop everything for him. This might sound as jealousy but when you have spent almost a full year trying to get someone to notice you, then you had enough. I am supportive trying to be happy for Carol seeing that this is her first real situationship where you go on dates and things but everything I did feels like it meant nothing.

1. There were dragons and dragon-riding involved
2. Whatever the relationship was, it started as Enemies to Lovers
3. The hero, no I didn’t know his name, was a Shadow Daddy in some way
4. And he called the heroine “Violence” as a pet-name which had me making a stank face every time I thought of it
5. There was some sort of school element/training going on
6. When the book first came out, my local Costco had soooo many of the OG sprayed edges and I didn’t get a copy because “oh what if it’s bad” and then when I went back a month later it was gone. 

It’s been my personal decision that I would only be breaking glass on this book when either nothing else was available or I was at my wits end. In this case, I had had LASIK surgery that day and you cannot open your eyes after surgery so they can heal, and I had already finished my current audiobook. I had to make it two more hours before bed for my last medicated drops of the day and the nice drugs they give you to sleep, and *Fourth Wing* was available at my library.

Violet Sorrengail is at the age - 21 -  where she must enroll in the Basgiath War College, so she can take her place in the ongoing fight between her homeland of Navarre and THE ENEMIES. No, I do not remember who they are, where they’re from, etc. It should be noted for plot reasons that Violet is a small little thing who is always getting injured from everyday activities, the tips of her hair are silver naturally, and she is the daughter of the Commanding General of the armed forces. Her two siblings followed in their mother’s footsteps to become dragon riders, but Violet always took after her dead father and was set to go into the Scribe training (historians and record keepers of the war) until Mommy said no. 

Violet’s older brother is dead, but her older sister, Mira, shows up the day of conscription with riding leathers, knives, and the dead brother’s journal that chronicles his time through Rider Camp or whatever it’s called and basically tells Violet “Don’t die and stay away from Xaden Riorson. Bye.”

This is all a very basic Fantasy Romance set-up - NLOG girl who had no chance in whatever challenges await her, a handsome man (we hadn’t even met on-page but *with a name like that*) who is supposed to be her enemy, and a school setting. The world-building is vague at this point, but I think that’s better for moving the plot along and getting to the action - especially when this clocks in at just over 500 pages and 21 hours as an audiobook. Also, I don’t think people were/are picking this book up for its world-building, but it is something I kept track of throughout my reading, so you’ll see my call-outs to it as we go.

The first task set before those wishing to be dragon riders is to cross a parapet which is really a shoe-wide stone bridge connected by two turrets that is over a ravine where many hopefuls plummet to their death. Violet makes it across, makes a friend in another hopeful, and gets her first look at Public Enemy Number 1 all in the span of a few minutes. 

Who is Xaden Riorson? He’s the Wing Leader of the Fourth Wing branch of riders and cadets, but what he also is is the son of a leader of the Tyrrish Rebellion who was responsible for Violet’s brother’s death and whom Violet’s mother then executed. What’s real fucked up in this universe is that when the rebellion was quashed, Navarre’s government not only killed the rebels while their children watched, conscripted their innocent children into the very army their parents fought against, and marked them as rebellion spawn (think massive black tattoos). So yeah, Xaden has a reason to hate Violet and all she, her mother, and her countrymen stand for ...but he’s also hot. Violet notices it from the first time she sets her eyes on Xaden and will not let you forget: he could get it if only she didn’t have to hate him. That said, he’s a classic tall, dark and fit fantasy man but with tattoos he didn’t consent to, one he did, that classic “golden” skin tone of ambiguity, and a scar that cuts vertically from browbone to cheek over his left eye. I get it.

Once Violet is back on solid ground, her childhood bestie shows up - Dain. He’s a Second Year rider and he gives off protective older brother vibes but also love interest vibes in a way we who have suffered fictional love triangles know. I would be lying if I said I liked Dain at any point. Not even here. While he clearly cares about Violet, he goes about it in the most asinine way that means I could never take him seriously as a Love Interest, but I also never thought he was a good friend to Violet! At every turn, he makes it clear she’s too weak to be in the Rider Quadrant, no matter how flowery he dresses up his words or actions. 

Having seen Violet, Xaden makes the decision to put the squad she was placed in under his command in the Fourth Wing and everyone is like oooooooh Xaden wants to KILL Violet. She better be careful!!! And I was like…it’s been 10 minutes? All he’s done is glare? Make a snarky but accurate comment…? But okay, every other character. You push that enemies to lovers agenda!!! (I will be discussing if this is an actual Enemies to Lovers romance later.)

Naturally, the timeline has to speed-up here as all of that was 20% of the book and only one day in the FW universe. 

Violet’s time as a First Year Cadet is packed with classes. Think combat training, battle strategy, dragon facts and history. There is also some character development for the other squad members - Violet’s new friend from the parapet is Rhiannon; a sweet and earnest woman who is Ride or Die for Violet. There are other squad members that the reader gets to know, and also some piece of trash who wanted to attack Violet on the parapet just because of her last name. This asshole, Jack Barlowe, is sadly plot relevant, so I’m mentioning him. But what really happens that is important to us, the Romance Readers, are Violet’s encounters with Xaden. 

As I mentioned, Violet’s sister brought her their brother’s journal of Cadet Camp - in it, he not only shared his progress, but he shared tips for getting through certain challenges First Years go through. It’s common knowledge among every new class that none of them are safe until graduation - death can be found anywhere on the campus from one training exercise to another…and sometimes from one’s enemies, and Violet knew that signing up. But one challenge in particular - the weekly sparring matches - is her biggest worry as her bones and ligaments are said to be weak in a way that makes injuries common and take longer to heal. (This has been compared to EDS in our world, which is not something I know anything about but is a condition Yarros herself has.) In the journal, Violet’s brother says she can find the upcoming matches listed the night (? I don’t exactly remember the timeframe) before and prepare accordingly. 

Violet’s preparation involves finding ways to poison her opponents before their match just enough so she can beat them. It is while she is out past curfew foraging for poisonous plants and allergens of her opponents that comes across Xaden and a group of other Marked cadets. **World-Building Time:** Another part of punishing the children of the rebels is that they are not allowed to be in groups larger than three, else it is suspicious and against the law/rider’s Codex/will it hurts Navarre’s feelings. And this group is MUCH larger than three. They are also in the way of Violet sneaking back into the dorms, so she settles in and overhears the big evil plot Xaden has to \**checks notes*\* make sure the new Marked First Years are getting the support they need. 

Neither Violet and I were flabbergasted, but she was impressed that Xaden and the other higher-year cadets were doing the bare minimum, even if that could get them in trouble of the permanent life-ending kind. It’s the first time Violet sees Xaden as anything beyond his last name or a glaring Wing Leader and it humanizes him just a smidge…but he’s still an asshole, obviously. 

**More World-Building** that is relevant to what comes next: when a dragon bonds with a rider, that rider can channel the dragon’s magic into what are called ‘sigils.’ The more powerful the dragon, the more powerful the sigil. Xaden is said to be the strongest rider of the generation on top of his blue dragon, Sgaeyl, who is a noted badass amongst dragon-kind and his sigil power is the ability to control shadows. But uh Violet was hiding in the shadows, so he knows she’s been there this whole time and they have a little conversation, a little mutual threatening and assured destruction if either of them tell Command the other was out after curfew and then Xaden leaves. Maybe he doesn’t want her dead after all.

Violet’s poisoning of her opponents in combat training has a 0% fail rate until she poisoned someone too much and guess who offers to spar against her??? Xaden absolutely wipes the floor of her, but he does so while actually providing instruction and advice on her technique which is more than anyone else has thought to do - Dain, this is a call out for you specifically. This is also when Xaden starts calling her “Violence” and I never find it cute, charming, adoring, or anything but cringey.

With two one-on-one interactions between Violet and Xaden so close together, Yarros is able to start laying the breadcrumbs for their connection that is the whole reason we the readers are (mostly) here. And with **only** two interactions, she sets their adversarial dynamic, hints at there being more to Xaden, and makes it very clear that while Violet dislikes the guy, she cannot ignore how attractive he is. It’s stated plainly throughout the entire book how hot Violet is for Xaden, just as often as her ‘hatred’ is on page. I put hatred in quotation marks because while his father killed her brother, that’s the kind of emotion that you are holding on to in place of your grief. Xaden was not responsible for his father’s actions, but he is a daily reminder of them just like Violet is a daily reminder for him of his own father’s death. It’s clear at this point that anything between them, even just acceptance, would be a hard-fought battle.

It was also pretty clear by this point that the Romance was coming in second to the War College plot and Violet's First Year experience, and that was fine as I found it to be rather interesting, and the times that Xaden showed up were enjoyable. I was here for the slow-burn and to actually get to see the fucking dragons. So:

Threshing, which always happens on October 1st, is the event where the First Years are let loose in the valley where the dragons willing to bond come and either you bond with a dragon, a dragon kills you, or another First Year does. Violet survives to Threshing and is meandering this valley, worried she’ll either be killed now or not good enough for a dragon when she comes across the asshole Jack Barlowe and two of his cronies going after this little dragon. Feathertail dragons are gold in color, small, rare and they apparently NEVER bond with a human, but this one is here and because Jack is a piece of shit, he wants to kill it to “weed out the weak” or prove that his dick is big. 

Violet stands up for the Feathertail and is willing to go down protecting it when the biggest, scariest, and most powerful dragon of recent record shows up. His name is Tairn, he’s a grumpy old ass, he’s only there to protect the little one, but then he bonds to Violet as does the Feathertail, who is named Andarna. It’s a whole thing. No rider has EVER bonded two dragons! AND A FEATHERTAIL?!?!?! Everyone is bamboozled, outraged, hoodwinked! 

BUT LOOK AT THIS BABY DRAGON:

https://preview.redd.it/6yll0a5dfbrf1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=67c4c456a7ba6598e90ec726a01ab80e0cc72339

I LOVE HER!!!

Tairn really made everything a mess by bonding with Violet because he is mated to Xaden’s dragon. Those uh…cannot be separated for very long, and the bond is so strong between the dragons that each rider can communicate with both dragons (instead of just their own) and each other mentally, and if one rider dies, chances are the other does too.

As Xaden said to Violet upon learning of this bonding, in complete exasperation: *""Unfortunately for all involved, there is an us.”*

I want to take a second to acknowledge how all of this does actually suck for Xaden, though. My guy watched his father be executed, was forced into the service of the army his father fought against, has risen through the ranks despite everyone’s preconceived notions of him (and probably because of spite), is just trying to make it to graduation and gtfo or whatever and the BAM! The youngest daughter of the woman who ruined his life shows up and complicates everything. Granted, he DID move her into his Wing but his emotions have got to be running in every direction. Wanting revenge. Uninterested. Curious how this weakling is making it…and then kinda finding himself on her side??? On multiple occasions!! WDYM SHE BONDED TO MY DRAGON’S MATE???

If you thought that Violet making it through Threshing must mean she would be safe, you and I would have been in the same incorrect camp. Those First Years who were not able to bond have the…let’s call it an ‘option’ to kill a newly bonded First Year in an attempt to free up that dragon for themselves. Although most riders now respect Violet for not only bonding with the Biggest and Baddest dragon but also being worthy enough for another dragon, some still see her as a weak link and attempt to kill her. It’s in the middle of the night some days later, and she wakes from Tairn screaming in her mind and her bedroom full of 7 would-be assassins. This is where we learn that Andarna (tiny dragon) can channel her powers to a human, and she does so by giving Violet the ability to stop time. Xaden then bursts in, because Tairn called him using their mind bond, right after a very confused Violet escapes a death blow, and then he murders the six remaining riders. 

The next day, in a completely normal reaction that is not at all overstepping, overbearing, or protective, Xaden assigns one of his marked First Years to be Violet’s bodyguard and she handles that about as well as you think she might. His name is Liam. He’s a delight and he spends his free time whittling dragons for all the bonded First Years and also being the shadow Violet did not want. (But then a friend she didn’t know she needed!!!) 

The book gets plot heavy here, moving Violet’s first year along as classes continue and Xaden takes her under his wing (HA!) so that she won’t get both of them killed with her lack of experience, but most of those moments sadly happen off-page. Her sigil from Tairn is not manifesting, and as the mated dragon family of five agree it’s best to keep Andarna’s powers secret, everyone thinks she has no powers and is the weak link they all assumed. 

And then because it hasn’t been rough enough for Violet, being bonded to a mated dragon means that certain carnal feelings are near impossible for her to ignore. Of all the places I thought this book was going, the dragon fucking was not it, but I also didn’t expect that when Violet busted out of her room in a fit of horniness she would find Xaden smoking what is this universes weed like:

https://preview.redd.it/r8uwwg9ffbrf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b5bc2d7d9e9136a6d7dcaa088f14f66659c0db4

Incredible.

Even with Xaden’s level of control and training, he cannot completely block out what the dragons are up to, and because he has experienced Violet’s level of hell, he teaches her how to build a mental shield to muffle Tairn's emotions. I gave Violet a lot of shit early on for being a classic NLOG, but she spent her whole life training to be a Scribe and can pick up what people are putting down, and she is able to build her shield and hold it at a pace that startles Xaden. There is still the residual horniness on both sides, and we all know that against her better judgment, Violet knows Xaden could get it and blame the dragon hormones if you must, but this is when Xaden and Violet kiss for the first time. It’s pretty great, tbh, and it was my first experience of Yarros’ writing of a physical scene, and yeah - she said those two had chemistry and she proved it. As Rhiannon said at some point, Xaden looks like a man who knows what he’s doing and Yarros gets that across. But she also has Xaden come to his senses and send Violet back to her room because anything more than one kiss would be stupid.

That burn - it is slow, but it’s about to start picking up.

It has now been 9 months since Violet crossed the parapet (and 63% into the book), and it does not matter what shit this woman is going through emotionally day to day because the War College’s annual Squad Games are the next big thing to survive. The winner of this assignment, naturally being Violet’s squad, is rewarded with a trip to the war front which is the opposite of a reward, but the way in which the riders are excited means that the Navarrian propaganda has done its job.

As the squad took off for the outpost, I was not sure who the enemy was; was it another rebel faction (that seemed unlikely), or bandits from other countries? What is so precious at the border that dragons and riders are dying at rates the graduating class cannot shore up? No reader should be 2/3rds into a book that is so heavily focused on an ongoing war with such vague details. It is possible I missed a line of detail about here or there, but when the squad reached the eastern outpost I had no idea what to expect - certainly not Violet’s sister Mira. 

First Year cadets are not allowed to send/receive any communications for the entirety of the school year (and there’s now summer break btw, they just become Second Years on a Tuesday or whatever and go to new classes), so seeing Mira is a heartwarming surprise that Violet desperately needed. And with Rhiannon’s village being only a five minute flight from the outpost, it makes sense for her and Violet to sneak out of the barracks to go and see them. I’m adding the Rhiannon detail because 1) I haven’t mentioned her enough and she is one of my favorite side characters (actually, Yarros does great work with her SCs), and 2) it further illustrates the cruelty that Navarrian citizens have simply accepted. 

I will also be welcoming Xaden to this little sneaking out venture because when the girlies are about to head back to the outpost, who steps out of the shadows? Annoyed as hell that his dragon dragged him across the country to see her mate, but looking great as always! It seems that the only peace Violet and Xaden will ever have from one another will be 72 hours, and at this point it’s not like Violet wants even that much space since the kiss that rocked her world. Even though she still hates him. No, really. Okay, so maybe he’s not the worst. He has been helping her with training, and their lives *are* tied together but absolutely nothing can happen between them for a multiple of reasons. Their families are enemies, he’s her commanding officer, their dragons are bonded…but I cannot stress this enough, Violet will take any opportunity to notice how attractive Xaden is. Her inner monologue is packed with her thirsting after Xaden while assuring herself that she still hates him. By this point, it was annoying and tiring that Yarros couldn’t trust the reader to understand the building relationship between her romantic couple without shouting it through Violet’s thoughts. 

The following night, there’s an attack at the outpost and Violet is desperate to stay and help her sister while Mira is all but throwing her into Xaden’s arms as the cadets frantically try to gtfo before shit gets too real. Violet is vehement she will hate Xaden forever if he won’t let her stay and he counters Violet’s argument that Mira would never leave her by saying *“Do it for me,”* kisses her, and then like the plushies of many claw machines of my youth, Tairn grabs Violet in a flyby, giving neither her nor the reader time to ask what he could have even meant. It’s when Violet et al. is safe back at the college, waiting outside of (Insert Professor’s Name who also teaches the Battle Brief class, once again I do not remember) office to ask if Mira survived the attack that Xaden joins her with a coffee for both of them (I liked this detail) and banging his head against the wall, admits that while he set out to destroy Violet, his feelings changed over and he can’t get her out of his head. Dain is there to ruin the moment, like he was at the outpost but there he was more concerned with his own neck than making sure Violet was safe. But when the trio finds out that Mira survived, it’s Dain who wraps Violet in his arms, and when they break apart Xaden is gone. 

…It’s time to talk about the lack of Xaden’s POV and how, up to this point but also throughout the rest of the story, that leads to the unbelievability of his feelings for Violet - at least *for me.* Romancelandia as a large will argue over single vs dual POV until the world ends, and readers have their reasons for why they enjoy one type of story over the other. I personally fall into the camp of “whatever is best for the story.” The kicker is that I do think that Violet being the only POV for this book is the right choice, but the way in which Yarros portrays Xaden through Violet’s POV and how Violet interprets his actions leave the reader little room to form their own opinion regarding what he might be thinking/feeling. Violet is a very self-assured character, even if she’s sure she’s going to fall off her dragon and die, and so she never takes the time to question the motives of others around her, not even Xaden (at least in this book). As the reader I can, and did, make my own assumptions based on his actions, but I never really thought “oh he’s actually developing feelings for her” before Xaden said it himself, and that is a failure in Yarros’ craft. There is/was so much potential for Violet and Xaden to build a relationship on page with all that stands between them, but instead of serving readers a decadent cake of detail, angst, and longing, Yarros left just enough crumbs to make their connection believable *if* the reader chose to fill in the holes themselves (which I did). (For those of you going to yell that Xaden ha a POV chapter, it's the last one in the book and the bonus chapters Yarros has released do not count in this analysis. Although those bonus chapters were very nice.)

Now that Violet knows that Mira is safe, Xaden has moved the Romance plot along with his confession, and Dain showed up to ruin it, Yarros turns the story away from the Romance and back to the College/War Plot. 

If the Squad Games were like that test you did not study for even though you knew it was coming, the War Games are like midterms and finals for the cadets, but even deadlier (and deadlier than any exam I’ve ever taken, that’s for damn sure), and this is what starts the ball rolling for the remainder of the book. I’m saying that because if everything above has you a little worn out, or you’re thinking “how could Violet go through anything else” - Yarros is gonna make her.

During this challenge, the ass clown that is Jack Barlowe tries to kill Liam from his position defending the egg Fourth Wing is supposed to capture, but FINALLY channeling her power from Tairn, Violet is able to call down lightning from even the clearest of skies and kills Barlowe. That’s uh - pretty badass, actually. 

Violet does not think it’s badass. She feels like she’s lost her humanity by killing Barlowe and while everyone is celebrating, she has the beginnings of an (understandable) menty-b until Xaden knocks on her door. He offers words of wisdom and assurances that she’s still the same person she was yesterday - all the things a decent person would say. If we’re going to blame anyone for what happens next, we’re going to blame Violet and her *“I don’t want to think, I just want to feel”* line which was cliche, but you know what? They finally banged it out, broke some furniture (but not in a weird Edward Cullen way) and my Romance Reading heart rejoiced! I’ll say it again - Yarros is skilled with writing physical chemistry between these two. No matter how much time I spent thinking “but when was this change of feelings from Xaden?” nor how many times Yarros tried to red-herring me with Dain as a possible Love Interest, I never once doubted Xaden and Violet’s physical attraction to one another, nor their chemistry after that first kiss. And the pay-off here for the reader is 👌.

Because Xaden is the Hero in a Fantasy Romance, there’s cuddling but also a “don’t fall for me” line, but then he leaves Violet violets on her nightstand. I don’t think I’m being mean when I say that all of that is very by the book for a ‘darker’ Romance Hero who accidentally caught feelings and doesn’t know how to handle them, but I’m not supposed to be able to PICK IT OUT so easily. In another choice that was plucked from the zeitgeist of the 21st century, when Violet and Xaden are alone later the next day, she admits that she won’t be able to separate a physical relationship from her developing feelings for him, but also says that until Xaden is ready to be honest about *his* feelings, they cannot be intimate again…. I fully support Violet drawing her line in the sand, but I’m not sure where she gets off demanding Xaden come to terms with his own feelings (that she is making assumptions about) so they can be together. She cannot ask that Xaden respect her boundaries and then throw his under the tracks in the next breath. That defeats the purpose of the emotional maturity Violet displayed, but it also shows the complexity of human emotions and I get it. I do. But I still sighed about it. It was another example of Violet’s self-assurance that Yarros has written to be correct, but that doesn’t mean it was believable. 

It’s four days before graduation and also Navarrian Independence Day when Yarros checks us back into that plot - a month has passed where the reader can assume Violet and Xaden had that one night together and reverted back to their previous dynamic and the college has been shaping young minds, preparing them to die for their country, etc.

The King of Navarre decides to spend this Independence Day at the war college, and makes the demand that all students be there to receive him, especially the Marked ones. At this point, the gleans of the government readers have been given make it sound more like the Star Wars Empire than a democracy, and the King’s behavior is not helping that. Why are you at a War College for Independence Day? Don’t you have a fancy residence in the capital to watch fireworks at? Oh you wanted to lord your victory over the children whose parents you murdered? GOT IT GOT IT. But the only Marked one to show up is Liam, and that’s because he’s protecting Violet (although he makes it clear Xaden didn’t force him to attend he did it because he’s a GOOD FRIEND I love Liam!). 

Violet, realizing that Independence Day is also the anniversary of the assassination of Xaden’s father and she doesn’t want to be at this celebration - she wants to be wherever Xaden is. In a very Shadow Daddy move, Xaden has been chilling on the parapet, staring off into the distance and being (understandably) moody. He is even moodier when Violet makes her way to him and refuses to leave until he comes with her, saying that he doesn’t have it in him to take care of someone else tonight. Violet, once again with the emotional maturity is like right, but I can take care of you and I made this face about it: 🥹. I was more 🥹 about Xaden’s love language and the actual hint at his feelings for her than Violet catching on to how to be a partner.

They bang again. Like all night. Violet realizes she loves Xaden and tells him so. Xaden does not say it back and no I have not forgiven him for this even though I don’t think I would have believed it had he said it. But Yarros quickly switches the focus back to the fantasy plot as it’s time for War Games 2 and as a reader, I was tired. As the person writing this review, it’s like I lived it twice.

As Fourth Wing’s commanding officer, Xaden is given instructions to fly past the border of Navarre and set-up command at one of the country’s outposts. He builds his own squad for this out of other Marked cadets and Violet and when Dain shows up to ~~be a pain in the ass~~ tell Violet goodbye, he says that he’ll miss her. It all seems a little suspish to Violet, but sexed up and love drunk, she follows Xaden across the border where a group of gryphons (griffins, they’re griffins Rebecca you were doing so good with the fantasy spellings!!) corners the cadets when they stop to water and rest the dragons.

None of the other riders are panicking but Violet who realizes that the children of assassinated rebels would still be rebelling against the Navarrian government. I mean - sure, it was a surprise to me as a reader, but an expected one. Idk why Violet was so shocked about this - the King had their parents murdered in front of them -that leaves an impression. The treason being committed: Xaden et al. have been supplying the gryphon riders with weapons to fight Venin.

What are Venin? For the sake of brevity (which at this point feels moot), I left out the subplot of Violet’s folklore book and all that was in those pages so please trust me that Venin are those who could not bond with dragon or gryphon to channel magic and took it upon themselves to be their own conduit for the power. They’re evil obviously, will stop at nothing to leach more power from the land which then makes the land inhabitable, and the only thing that can actually stop them is the special blend of alloy in the wards around Navarre which have also been put into the weapons the rebels have been smuggling to the gryphon riders. 

Navarre has been letting its bordering countries fight off the Venin and their mounts - Wyvern - despite being the only country with the resources to fight them and the wards to keep them out while also lying to their own people for centuries. While Violet’s mother is the Commanding General of Navarre’s armed forces, she is very quickly down with the folklore and genocide being true but boy howdy is she big mad at Xaden for keeping this from her. Because they’ve been in a relationship or whatever for long enough that he could have spilled all his secrets. /s

But **back to the War Games:** Once Xaden, Violet and everyone else gets to the outpost, it’s clear that it’s been emptied. A note has been left by Colonel Aetos, the game-keeper of this War Games (and also Dain’s father) for Xaden: he can either stay at the post and help civilians survive the incoming Venin forces, outing themselves as traitors, or leave everyone to die and go on to the actual command center for Fourth Wing.  The battle that follows is very well written, well plotted, and action-packed. I am not going to do it justice if I attempt to go into more detail than that, so I won't. There are deaths to the squad that I am hiding behind the spoiler tag >!(Soleil who we barely knew but Liam dies and it’s fucking awful, heartbreaking, and I cried about it)!<. In plot relevance, Violet takes a mortal wound to her side, but figures out how to use her lightening power to kill all but one of the Venin and then plummet off the side of Tairn.

She does not plummet to her death because then it wouldn’t be an ongoing five book series. Instead, she is saved and Xaden makes the decision to fly her to his homeland, Aretia. It was supposed to have been scorched from the earth after the rebellion, but nobody has paid attention to the rebuilding (that's a complacent government, if you ask me). Violet is healed, comes to days later, and is still Big Mad about Xaden hiding the rebellion from her and says she can’t trust him enough to ‘be’ with him. And it's not like they don't have bigger priorities right now. Xaden would disagree, despite being the leader of this rebellion, and is much focused on fixing their relationship as he offers her big words and declarations, leaving out the three most important ones. This back and forth after everything else can seem tiring, but as I mentioned before, this is the only chapter in Xaden's POV, so it was at least refreshing in that respect. I also personally love a fictional man that is all ""it can all burn as long as we fix us"" but alas - it's not working on Violet. 

In fact, whatever is going on between her and Xaden is way less important than her assumed dead brother walking into the room and welcoming her to the revolution.

**THE END.**

🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️

I cannot believe I still have more to say. 

I also cannot believe how much I had to leave out. (Xaden and Violet can mind-speak thanks to their mated dragons! Dain kisses Violet at one point! Xaden's back scars!) 

First things first: **my official rating is 4 stars - it would be 5 stars for the concept and 3 stars for execution of the romance.** 

I swear, I really did enjoy this reading/listening experience. I know this review might not make it seem that way, and at points as I was writing it I was like “oh was it actually any good?” but it was. It’s a fun book with an interesting fantasy set-up and the potential for a fantastic romance that gets lost in the weeds. I really, really, enjoyed Xaden as a character and Violet grew on me throughout the story until the end when I was like what in the Y.A. hell is this behavior. Their romance was enough to keep me interested, but the war college and political intrigue carried this book. I really had no idea the effort Yarros put into this world before picking this up, and while some things (THE ENEMY??) were vague by the end, I judged this book harshly based on the Romantasy label and that’s my bad.

On that note, this is not an enemies to lovers romance. I went into it a bit in the review, but Xaden and Violet are never really enemies to one another - they are two people forced into proximity whose families were on opposite sides of a conflict that tried to tear a nation apart. I’ve been mentally describing it as Romeo and Juliet but there’s dragons and neither of them die. At no point is there actual hatred from either of them (it doesn’t matter how many times you type it if there isn’t on-page evidence, Rebecca), and it’s really more of a forced-proximity opposites-attract trope smoothie.

I mentioned that Yarros does really well with her side characters, but I didn’t get to mention how fucking funny Tairn ends up being. At first, I was unsure about Ye Old Dragons talking like modern humans, but that’s a detail I chose to let go and I’m glad I did. Everyone needs a dragon making off-hand remarks about their love lives now and again, if for nothing else than comic relief. 

…I think that’s it. God, I hope that’s it.

At the time of posting this, I’m already halfway through *Iron Flame* even though I told myself I wasn’t going to dive right in. I did do that.  I will not be making a post about that book or *Onyx Storm* because I can’t do this again BUT I am mostly still having a great time in this universe. 

I have been listening to a Xaden Riorson playlist for the past week. 

I would love to talk to others who have read FW because I may be late to this party, but I'm here now and I've got my I ❤️ Xaden shirt on. I'm even here to discuss what didn't work with those who didn't enjoy it ~~and get a new fictional crush out of the book~~!

🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️🐉⚔️

1nq7lo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nq7lo9/water_damage_treatment_without_removing_the/,Water damage treatment without removing the motherboard,"Hi all,

One of our employees spilled coffee on their laptop keyboard. A few keys stopped working, so we brought it to a local repair shop. They said a “mandatory water damage treatment” for €200 had to be done. I paid it and after a couple weeks they messaged saying a replacement keyboard is no longer deliverable so they couldn't do the repair.

I got the laptop back and opened it myself and to my surprise all the original tape binding the various cables to the motherboard were still there, untouched. It's impossible to remove the motherboard, and thus get to the keyboard and where the spill was, without removing the tape to disconnect the cables.

I called the repairshop and told them my findings. There was a lot of vague talk that didn't really have anything to do with the treatment but he didn't confirm or deny that a treatment without removing the motherboard was possible because ""then we would have to give you a course in laptop repair for a month and it would cost 2000€"". 

Here’s my question:

* Is it actually possible to do a proper water/liquid damage treatment **without disassembling the laptop** (removing the motherboard, disconnecting cables, and taking the keyboard out)?
* Or is disassembly the only way to really check/clean the keyboard and internals?

The laptop is a Dynabook Satellite Pro where the keyboard internals can only be accessed from the bottom.

1nq7kst,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1nq7kst/adhd_concerta/,Adhd Concerta,"So I got my ADHD stamp about 6 months ago (age 32) and tested the medication Elvanse 30 mg from a friend, and omg it legit made me into a 2.0. I felt drive to even have conversations with people like I used to before school messed up my head — “sit down, don’t talk, don’t speak to your friends,” you know the drill. My head went quiet, I didn’t get the spiral thoughts that would block me from talking to people, and it was even interesting to hear what others said. Music sounded great — I spent 3 hours just lying down listening to different songs. I could watch TV and not think about everything happening, just be in the present.

Now to today: I was given Concerta 18 mg because they no longer start with Elvanse, and the first week I felt nothing other than it being harder to sleep on day 1. I did get some very weird energy rises/dumps after like 6 hours. Then 6 days later I was told to take 2 pills (36 mg), and I honestly just feel flat. No motivation, like a blanket is over my head, and the spiral thoughts are still there.

At what mg did you guys start to notice Concerta? I’ve read that if you’re a high-end caffeine consumer, Concerta tends to have less impact. I usually have about 560 mg caffeine in me the first half of the day — normally 1 coffee, 1 Monster, and 1 pre-workout for the gym.

I was kinda expecting the same effect as Elvanse, but so far they feel the complete opposite. And I guess Concerta works better for people that just need to sit down in school, but as an adult I need to function 16 h/day lol. The random energy crashes/rises I get about 6–8 hours after taking the pill just mess up half of my day.

Hey there,

So here’s me, easygoing, mildly funny (on good days), and navigating through the everyday chaos of life with decent music, strong coffee, and a soft spot for late-night conversations.

I’m looking to connect with someone I can talk to regularly—be it casual texts through the day, meme exchanges, late-night rants, or spontaneous calls when the world feels a little too much. If we’re in the same city or close by, even better—I’d be totally up for grabbing coffee or chilling in person when schedules align.

Not looking to jump into anything intense or weirdly fast. Just hoping for something genuine and organic. If we end up flirting a little along the way, cool—as long as it’s light-hearted and respectful. Think teasing banter, not crossing lines.

If you’re:
	•	Someone who values regular, meaningful (and sometimes silly) convos
	•	A fan of dry humour, music, random deep dives into life, or sending voice notes without context
	•	Open to eventually meeting up or just having a solid digital connection

…then drop a message or a comment and let’s see where this goes!

P.S. Bonus points if you’re into movies, coffee, or just vibing in silence sometimes.

The world held its breath. News anchors spoke in clipped tones; markets trembled; governments whispered behind closed doors. Everyone knew something was coming—something big. But no one knew exactly what.

Maya Singh sat in the dim glow of her newsroom office, half-empty coffee growing cold beside her. She had been chasing whispers for weeks—rumors of a scientific breakthrough buried under layers of secrecy. Every lead pulled her deeper into a story that felt less like journalism and more like a fuse burning toward something explosive.

That morning, she found it. A single line in a press release from Dr. Rachel Kim, a physicist who rarely spoke to the public: We are on the edge of discovery. The kind that changes everything.

Maya's pulse quickened. Dr. Kim wasn’t known for exaggeration. Whatever this was, it wasn’t ordinary. She grabbed her recorder, her notebook, and her courage. It was time to find out what the world was really standing on the edge of.


---

Breaking the News

The research facility looked more like a military base than a lab—barbed wire fences, armed guards, watchtowers slicing the skyline. As Maya approached, the air smelled of rain and metal. She signed forms she didn’t read and surrendered her phone to a stone-faced guard before being led inside.

Dr. Rachel Kim looked like she hadn’t slept in days. Her lab coat was wrinkled, her hair tied in a loose knot, but her eyes burned with purpose.

""Ms. Singh,"" she said, shaking Maya’s hand firmly. ""Thank you for coming. I can only give you a glimpse, but you need to understand the stakes.""

In the lab’s center stood a machine unlike anything Maya had seen—sleek, humming softly, surrounded by monitors scrolling incomprehensible data.

""Zero-Point Energy,"" Dr. Kim said simply. ""Energy pulled from the quantum vacuum itself. Infinite. Clean. But... unstable, if misused.""

Maya scribbled furiously. ""This could end energy crises. Poverty. Climate change.""

""Yes,"" Dr. Kim said, voice low. ""Or trigger disasters we can’t contain. That’s why certain people want it buried.""

Hours later, back at the newsroom, Maya typed the story with shaking hands. As she hovered over the 'Publish' button, her editor burst in, pale-faced.

""Maya, hold it. The government called. They say this is classified. If you run it, they’ll come after us.""

Maya’s eyes locked on the headline: A World on the Brink: Zero-Point Energy and the Future of Humanity.

She hit Publish.


---

Global Response

The article detonated like a bomb.

Within hours, world leaders called emergency meetings. Talk shows speculated wildly. Protesters marched with signs reading Power to the People and Clean Energy Now. But as support grew, so did the threats.

A text arrived on Maya’s phone that night: You’re playing with fire. Stop before it’s too late.

At the United Nations, chaos reigned. Delegates shouted over one another as Dr. Kim presented the discovery’s potential—limitless energy, no emissions, no dependence on oil or coal. But an oil-state ambassador slammed his fist on the table.

""This technology will destroy our economies,"" he snarled. ""We will not accept this!""

Arguments fractured along political lines. Some saw salvation; others saw an existential threat to power itself.

From the press gallery, Maya watched alliances crumble like sandcastles in the tide. She felt the weight of history pressing on the room—and on her story.


---

Secrets in the Shadows

As negotiations dragged on, a stranger slipped a note under Maya’s hotel door: Midnight. Old clock tower. Come alone.

Curiosity battled fear, but in the end, the journalist won. At the clock tower, a nervous delegate emerged from the shadows, eyes darting.

""I opposed the project,"" he admitted, handing her a folder thick with documents. ""But not because of energy. Because of them. Corporations, officials—they want to control it, not share it. These files prove it.""

Before Maya could speak, footsteps echoed in the darkness. The delegate went rigid. ""They found us. Run.""

Figures closed in. Maya sprinted through rain-slick alleys, lungs burning, clutching the folder like a lifeline. A van screeched around the corner ahead of her—not the pursuers, but Dr. Kim.

""Get in!"" she yelled.


---

The Daring Broadcast

Together, they raced to a hidden studio prepared for one purpose: to tell the world everything.

As cameras rolled, Dr. Kim revealed the truth—the discovery, the corruption, the danger of secrecy. Maya spoke directly to the world: ""Knowledge belongs to everyone. And so does the future.""

Authorities stormed the building mid-broadcast, but too late. Backup systems kept the signal alive, beaming the truth to millions.

By morning, protests erupted across continents. Governments pledged transparency. Energy companies faced investigations. The Zero-Point Energy project moved under international oversight.

And somewhere in the chaos, Maya and Dr. Kim vanished, leaving only the story behind.


---

Epilogue

Months later, power plants lit up using the new technology. Children studied by clean, free light in villages that once went dark at sunset. But the files Maya leaked hinted at deeper secrets—projects still hidden, forces still watching.

Because revolutions, like discoveries, never really end.

I don't want to have to fool with heating a kettle, steeping, setting a timer, doing all that for one cup of tea. I know a lot of people find the process to be relaxing and ceremonial, and maybe I'll get there eventually. 

But where I'm at now, is wanting something like a Mr. Coffee, for Tea. I want to be able to scoop loose tea in, pour water up to a line, turn a dial for the amount of time it takes to steep (because different teas take a different amount of time), press the ""On"" button, and walk away.

When I come back, whether it's five or ten minutes later, I want a carafe of anywhere between 6 and 12 cups of tea that I can pour from, and come back to later for a refill, without having to repeat the whole process, or worry about the tea steeping too long and becoming bitter.

I want to know— does a product like this exist? If so, where can I find one?

1nq7d0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Form5472_us/comments/1nq7d0m/the_summer_i_learned_about_estimated_taxes_the/,The summer I learned about estimated taxes the hard way,"When I left my 9–5 to go freelance, everyone kept warning me: “Don’t forget to save for taxes.” I thought I was being smart by setting aside about 20% of what I made into a separate account. What I *didn’t* know is that the IRS expects self-employed people to pay estimated taxes every quarter, not just once a year.

That summer, I was feeling unstoppable. Work was pouring in, I was finally making more than I did at my old job, and I even splurged on a vacation because I thought I’d “earned it.” Taxes didn’t cross my mind again until the following spring when I sat down to file.

Cue the horror: not only did I owe way more than the 20% I’d saved (thanks to self-employment tax), but I also got slapped with penalties for underpaying all year. I had basically been borrowing from the IRS without realising it. I remember staring at the total balance due and feeling my stomach sink. It wiped out my savings account in one click. For the next two months, I lived off ramen and instant coffee just to get by.

That summer was brutal, but it permanently changed how I think about money. Now, I have *four separate calendar reminders* for estimated tax deadlines, and I pay them religiously, even if it hurts. Freelancing taught me freedom, but the IRS taught me fear.",1,1758808334.0,Form5472_us,0,1.0,False

Right off the bat, I found myself drawn to its sleek beige design and compact build. It’s stylish enough to blend into modern kitchens, and portable enough to fit snugly in my travel bag. With frequent trips and long days in the office, this little device has become more of a companion than just a kitchen gadget.

**Compact and Lightweight Design**  
It’s honestly the first thing that caught my attention. At just 8.66 inches tall and weighing 1.1 pounds, this travel kettle is ridiculously portable. Tossing it into my carry-on luggage didn’t feel like a burden at all. I tried using it in a small hotel room and then at my desk at work. Its compact form stood out both times, fitting inconspicuously in cramped spaces. The 400ml capacity is great for single servings or small portions for two if you’re sharing. However, for larger households or group settings, this might feel a bit limited.

**Advantages:**  
- Lightweight build perfect for travel or office
- Compact design fits into most bags and small spaces  
- Sleek, modern appearance adds a touch of sophistication  

[Check Touxila Travel Electric Kettle B0CFQ7BGPT price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cfq7bgpt/)

**4 Smart Temperature Presets**  
Navigating the four temperature presets with the LCD display feels more intuitive than I anticipated. From 113°F to 212°F, the control over temperature gave me the flexibility to perfect various hot beverages. Whether brewing green tea, steeping black tea, or just heating water for instant coffee, this feature met its promise every time. My favorite part? Watching the temperature change on the display in real time. It gave me the assurance that I had precise control over my drinks. That being said, the presets may feel unnecessary if you’re simply using it for quick boiling.

**Enhanced Safety Features**  
Using this kettle isn’t just efficient—it’s safe. I noticed the improved vent holes worked wonders in reducing pressure during boiling. That’s especially crucial when handling something this compact. I made the mistake of tipping it slightly during a hasty morning rush, and I was relieved to see that the seal held, with no leaks whatsoever. It even has a non-slip base, providing great stability whether on a wooden surface or ceramic countertop. Knowing it won’t shift or spill easily adds extra peace of mind. But since it’s designed specifically for boiling water, you can’t heat other liquids—something you’d have to be mindful of.

**Negatives:**  
- Limited to boiling water only, other liquids not supported  
- Capacity may feel restrictive for family use  

**Rapid Boiling Capability**  
Running around in the morning and not having time for elaborate preparations is part of my routine, but this kettle gets the job done in under 9 minutes. Plug it in, let it boil, and out comes steaming water ready for my cup of the day. What’s even better is its automatic shut-off feature. There have been countless mornings where I got distracted, yet the kettle managed itself without overheating.

**Food-Grade Stainless Steel Build**  
Durability is an important aspect for me, especially with something I plan to use daily. This portable kettle features an inner pot made from food-grade 304 stainless steel that feels robust and long-lasting. The seamless design eliminates any awkward corners where residue might potentially hide. Not to mention, its PP outer shell guarantees a cool-touch exterior, even fresh out of boiling. While pouring hot water, I felt confident there wouldn’t be any accidental burns.

**Competing Brands**  
When placed beside other products in the market, such as collapsible silicone kettles or larger electric kettles, this one excels with its compact, aesthetically pleasing design. Compared to rival brands, some alternatives offer greater capacity but lag in portability. I once tried a collapsible kettle from a competing brand, and although it compacted nicely, it lacked this sturdy and refined build. For solo travelers or professionals who prioritize utility and style, this mini kettle checks all the boxes. However, larger households might want alternatives with greater volume.

**Value for Money**  
Given its multiple features and reliable performance, I’d say the cost hits a sweet spot for someone like me who needs portability and functionality in equal measure. While there are cheaper options around, they simply don’t offer the same combination of safety, utility, and sleek design. This electric kettle doesn’t just boil water—it makes a statement. Whether you’re on a budget or splurging a little, it feels worth every penny for what it delivers.

""In addition to the store closures, Starbucks announced an additional 900 corporate layoffs, on top of the roughly 1,000 layoffs in February. Affected employees will be notified Friday and will receive “generous severance and support packages.” Also, “many” open positions will be closed, he announced.""

""Niccol joined Starbucks about a year ago, hoping to revive the storied coffee chain. However, the financial results haven’t come to fruition with the stock down about 12% and sales haven’t turned around.

He’s pared back the menu by about 30%, while also introduced new items to keep the the brand on trend, like protein toppings and coconut water. Food is also getting a revamp, with new croissants and baked goods being rolled out.

In addition to remodels, smaller touches have been integrated like bringing back self-serve milk and sugar stations as well doodles on coffee cups. The company also tweaked its name to “Starbucks Coffee Company” to reinforce its coffee roots.

However, his changes have butted heads with some baristas including uniform changes that sparked lawsuit. And some new drinks are causing stress for baristas for being over complicated to make during peak times.""

1nq70m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1nq70m8/should_best_liquid_detergent_gain_ultra_oxi/,Should best liquid detergent Gain Ultra Oxi really be your go-to choice?,"Having tested the Gain Ultra Oxi Liquid Laundry Detergent P_15659 for several weeks now, I can confidently share my experience with it. As someone juggling endless piles of laundry daily, finding the right detergent that delivers on both cleaning power and fragrance matters a lot to me. This detergent claims to tackle stains effortlessly, and it certainly lives up to its reputation in many ways. Not without its quirks, though, there's a lot to unpack about this product.  

**Packaging and Design**  
The bottle’s design is both functional and sturdy. With its 134-load capacity, the size might initially seem overwhelming, but the well-designed spout ensures minimal dripping or spillage. It’s compact enough considering the volume it contains, so it slides neatly into storage space without taking over my entire laundry shelf. That being said, its weight does make it a bit unwieldy to maneuver for extended periods, especially if your laundry station is at an awkward height.

**Performance**  
The cleaning power of this liquid detergent is something else. With kids constantly getting grass stains, mud, and who-knows-what-else all over their clothes, I've come to rely on it to restore their outfits to something presentable. The Ultra Oxi formula means even the toughest stains, like coffee or grease, come out after just one wash. I even threw in a load of old towels, and they came out smelling heavenly and looking almost brand-new. Its compatibility with both cold and hot water also makes it versatile for various washing needs.

**Fragrance and Freshness**  
The fragrance labeled as ""Waterfall Delight"" truly lives up to its name. It's fresh without being overpowering, which is perfect for households like mine that prefer a subtle scent. My closet now smells crisp and clean, even in clothes I haven’t worn for days. Unlike other detergents that leave an artificial smell, this seems to linger naturally. Don’t expect it to completely mask odors in something like sweaty gym socks, but for day-to-day wear, it does a fantastic job.

**Highlights**  
- Powerful Oxi formula for tackling tough stains  
- Gentle yet refreshing ""Waterfall Delight"" fragrance  
- Large capacity for extended use  
- Suitable for both cold and hot water washes  

**Critiques**  
There are a few aspects that left me a bit frustrated.  
- The bottle’s weight can get tiresome when repeatedly pouring.  
- Lacking a precise dosing cup, it’s easy to overpour detergent.  
- While the fragrance is fantastic, it might not be enough for overwhelmingly smelly items without pre-washing.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to alternatives such as Tide’s Ultra Stain Release or Persil’s ProClean, this detergent seems to emphasize stain removal and fragrance balance equally. Tide, for instance, excels in stain-busting power alone but doesn’t offer the same lingering freshness. Persil might clean as effectively but doesn’t quite have the same pleasant scent. Gain Ultra Oxi seems to find a sweet spot, though it might not perform as well in tough odor-neutralizing scenarios where Persil and Tide outperform.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its performance-to-load ratio, this detergent stands out in terms of value. While priced slightly higher than run-of-the-mill liquid detergents, the quality speaks for itself. The larger size means fewer trips to the store and less plastic waste in the long term. If you’re serious about stain-fighting power and delightful scents, it’s worth the extra investment.

1nq6xj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nq6xj0/was_i_a_red_flag/,Was I a red flag?,"I (32M) recently went on a date with someone (F34) and was rejected for being overly sexual and giving excessive compliments. So I am wondering where I went wrong based on our interactions. We had been chatting for a week or so about interests, comedy, movies, music, and some funny life situations. I did mention a photo of a costume looked cool but nothing else nor did we talk about anything sexual. 


We ended up having coffee. On meeting I did say she looks great/amazing and mentioned her dyed hair looks cool. She reciprocated saying I looked nice and smelled good. She mentioned she was feeling a bit awkward about conversation and I acknowledged it and said that’s okay and that first times can be a bit awkward but this is a space where you can be yourself. After that she opened up quite a bit. There was dark humor and a lot of laughter, we talked about almost everything under the sun. We decided to go for a walk after and touched a variety of subject ranging switching from light humor to dark humor, and even some sexual related humor initiated by both of us. She joked about doing things to me and made some bdsm related jokes. Her humor and jokes really stood out to me and really enjoyed it along with the openness since I do focus on letting people show me who they are. She started to even suggest a date idea weeks out and even doing coplay meet ups. 


Eventually we sat down at a bench and I figured she was interested so I put an arm around her. She moved closer and I went in for a kiss. We ended up making out so I took that as a positive sign. We were in a public area so I didn’t force it when people were walking past. I mentioned she was a good kisser and she returned the compliment. I did ask if she wanted to be more intimate but she replied she doesn’t do that in the first date. I told her I will respect that and didn’t press the matter. We both mentioned that overall this was completely unexpected but obviously welcomed. Personally I was happy I met someone I felt like I vibed with and enjoyed the laughter and the compatibility around interests and social issues. Of course the physicality was fun but that wasn’t my focus going into this. 


We eventually parted ways and I mentioned through text about setting up a second date. I didn’t want to suggest something far from us since it was only the second date. So I suggested late afternoon wine tasting. I planned surprise her with flowers at the end, because I noticed she mentioned she liked the garden we walked through and the flowers/plants there. She agreed and seemed enthusiastic about it. We texted a bit talking about a variety of subjects, like walls of text concerning her hobbies, more dark humor, and opinions on weird topics. She even invited me to join her in one of her hobbies. I playfully mentioned I was jealous of how funny she was. She replied with saying I was funny as well even more than her. I did also mention she had a nice figure but nothing overtly sexual. I also joked about getting a new couch and she is free to come test it. She replied with a flattered aw and thanks for having first dibs. So I took that as just banter. I didn’t really think much of it since in comparison to everything else we have talked about, it didn’t seem to cross any lines. 


Conversation continued and one day I was with some friends. One mentioned they play classical music when intimate and I thought that would be an interesting question to pose to her. Considering what we talked about before it didn’t seem out of left field and far tamer than what we have previously talked about. I asked and she essentially said whatever floats their boat. I did notice the response was short and I felt something was off. I thought perhaps maybe that was a bit rude to ask her so I apologized if it seemed like a bizarre question to bring up. 


After that I got a message saying it isn’t going to work out because I excessively compliment her and make sexual jokes. She also had reservations about an alcohol centered date and said all of that together gave bad vibes for someone she just met and said take care. I was a bit taken aback it since it seemed a bit abrupt but I didn’t fight it. I was also a bit offended by the implied implications but I understood that the situation present is in reality a legitimate concern for women. 


I send a text back quickly apologizing that I came across that way, that I misjudged what we were comfortable discussing, it wasn’t my intention to make you feel this way, and that I can change that behavior since we have just met. I accepted responsibility. I also mentioned I was totally open to changing the date idea since she was uncomfortable with wine tasting and if there is something I can do to make up for it, I am open to it. 


Overall I think I complimented her 5-8 times over a span of a week I believe. I can see it being love bombing if it was all on the first date or a few days. Though I feel like was talked a lot more about other things in general. Perhaps complimenting her figure was too much. I think that, hairstyle, and kissing were the only physical compliments I gave two of which were reciprocated. I did mention she was intelligent and made mentioned character traits that I thought were positive. The couch joke wasn’t serious and I thought it was in our line of humor. Were those my red flags? Was I moving too fast and vulgar? Does this have anything to do with me?",0,1758807270.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False
1nq6xf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nq6xf0/ms_waking_up_somewhere_new/,[MS] Waking Up Somewhere New,"   This is my first time posting here! And my first story, though it is the first part of many. This is mainly a practice piece to practice my formatting and descriptive writing. So please provide all the constructive criticism you got I appreciate it :)) here's the story:

Log 1:
		Everytime I wake up I end up somewhere new…

	     It started only a few days ago, three or four? I can't remember now. I've found myself lost in such a strange situation that I've lost track of time. What matters now is where I am, or rather where I am not. I thought it was only a dream at first, when I woke up in a world so different from the one I was used to. The world was one giant open plain. No matter how long I walked, nothing but empty lowland prairie. Stranger yet I couldn't spot not even a single mound sprouting from the low grass. The buzz of cicadas itched through my eardrums. Growing ever louder as I trailed in the thick of the low grass, the grass rising behind me leaving no evidence I had even passed through it in the first place. Being an outlier in a world of swaying blades of deep vibrant green, the yellows cast by the radiant beaming sun flickering between the blades. Not a cloud dotted the sky to obscure the blazing heat. Not only was I an outlier, I was not welcome. The buzzing grew unbearable, as if the drone of insects that weren't there began to burrow between the ridges of my brain. Quickly I threw my palms against my ears with a loud smack. Only to be met with not even a muffled hum, the droning buzz spiraled quickly into a thrumming. As if a hammer was being brought to my skull over and over, the feeling drilled into my consciousness. I can still feel it when I think too intensely. The next thing I felt was the soft lush grass cushioning my body as I tumbled forward, as I huddled my body firm against itself the grass tugged itself from under my weight. Raising around me leaving myself buried in the sea of ever shifting weeds. My resting place as I fell unconscious.
	    I expected to wake up back in my bed, the light blankets adorning my body. My bed side table, covered in the stained rings from the coffee and tea that once sat there. Only when I opened my eyes, I found another place I had never been before. Every time I blink I'm expecting to wake up, but I don't. There is no telling if this is one of those dreams which seem to last forever, Whether I'm asleep at all, Or if ill ever wake up. So I've decided to begin writing a journal, a 'dream’ journal of sorts. This will be my first log, though it won't be my first time chronicling my thoughts in such a way. I've written in many journals, about many topics. From front cover to back, And at times on those covers. I was a researcher, or well self proclaimed researcher. My classification was more that of a botanist. Though I have always fancied the idea of the daring journeys of a great adventurer. Whatever this may be, whether it's a dream, delusions of a false reality or what else. It peaks my curiosity like nothing has before. It could be my freed0m. Closing my eyes to be met with a new reality every time I open them. I'm ready to close them again now, and be met with something new…

My doctor is hesitant to put me on medication and feels I can lower it with diet and exercise alone, he would like to see it under 100 and prefers it under 70. So, I have a re-check in 4 months to see if I've been able to get it down.

I'm essentially making small changes in hopes that each of them brings my LDL down a few points. Trying to eat in a calorie deficit 80-90% of the time to lose weight (I'm 20-30 pounds overweight), 30 minutes of treadmill (trying to keep heart rate 110-120) 5 days a week plus 3 days a week of weight machines, switched from coffee (4-5 cups a day brewed at home in a good old fashioned Mr. Coffee drip machine) to Earl Grey tea (1-2 cups a day), and trying to keep my saturated fat under 15 g a day. I'm hoping all of those things together can get me under 100.

My question is - has anyone experimented with drip coffee (filtered) to see if it had any effect on your LDL? I really am quite dying for a cup of Joe by the afternoon, and I've been having a small one a few afternoons a week, but I worry that it will hold me back from getting my LDL down. I'm changing too many things at once to do my own test with just the coffee, I'm just curious if anyone has anecdotal experience of their own.",2,1758807229.0,Cholesterol,4,1.0,False

So I took my daughter to get some stuff and saw a Cornetto and grabbed it. When we got home I lit a cigar and brought out the Cornetto. This is a very creamy and milky ice cream, with bits of chocolate and caramel. It surprised me how well it paired with this cigar in particular.

This is a very creamy and milky ice cream, with bits of chocolate and caramel. It surprised me how well it paired with this cigar in particular.

Open floor plan, no cubicles, which is already rough. But there’s one guy, let’s call him Dan, who cannot stop narrating out loud like he’s David Attenborough describing wildlife.

It started small. He’d say stuff like, “And now Dan bravely opens his inbox… what horrors will await him today?” Everyone laughed the first couple times. Harmless.

But now it’s constant. I’ll be typing and hear, “Observe as Sarah attempts to complete her report. The stakes are high, the deadline looms, and her coffee is dangerously low.” He’ll do this for EVERYONE. On phone calls. In meetings. While people are trying to eat lunch.

HR actually pulled him aside after someone complained, and he toned it down for like a week. Then it morphed into “whisper narration,” which is somehow worse. You’ll hear him muttering under his breath: “The herd senses danger… the manager approaches…”

Last week was the breaking point. Our boss was presenting quarterly numbers and Dan interrupts to say, “Ah yes, the alpha of the group reasserts dominance by displaying the kill.” He said it loud enough that the VP from another department heard and just stared at him.

I don’t even hate the guy, he’s not mean. But holy hell, working next to a one-man National Geographic special every day is exhausting.",21,1758807172.0,coworkerstories,15,0.96,False

1nq6uqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smooth_Effect4095/comments/1nq6uqt/show_dont_tell_crafting_compelling_business/,"Show, Don't Tell: Crafting Compelling Business Narratives","The stale scent of yesterday’s coffee hangs in the air, a familiar companion to the late-hour glow of your screen. You’re crafting an email, a proposal, a post—the digital artifact that will represent your idea to the world. Your cursor hovers over a phrase you’ve written: “Our solution is highly effective.” You pause. A faint, internal alarm sounds. It’s a good sentence, it’s correct, but it feels like a cardboard cutout of an idea. It \*tells\*, but it doesn’t \*live\*. It’s the linguistic equivalent of pointing at a meal and saying “this is delicious,” instead of letting the aroma of garlic and herbs, the sizzle from the pan, and the rich, complex taste on the tongue do the work for you. The former is a statement to be accepted or rejected; the latter is an experience to be absorbed.



This is the quiet chasm between telling and showing, and it is the fundamental difference between being heard and being felt. Telling is a summary; showing is an invitation. When you tell me something is bad, you’ve given me a conclusion and asked for my compliance. But when you show me—when you reveal that a team’s “success created a ritual of skipping post-mortem analyses, until a minor oversight snowballed into a catastrophic, entirely preventable client loss”—you are not handing me a conclusion. You are handing me a puzzle piece. You are engaging my cortex, asking me to connect the dots myself. And in that moment of connection, \*inside my own mind\*, the idea ceases to be yours and becomes, profoundly, mine. You haven’t persuaded me; you have allowed me to persuade myself.



I think of a designer I once knew in Lagos, trying to explain the friction in a user journey. She could have sent a report stating, “The checkout process is frustrating.” A true, but skimmable, fact. Instead, she shared a single, anonymized video clip from a user-testing session. In it, you see a user’s finger, poised over the ‘purchase’ button, hesitating, pulling back, scrolling up and down the page three separate times, a tiny digital dance of uncertainty, before finally abandoning the cart. She showed us the ghost in the machine. That silent, looping video did more to mobilize the product team than a dozen bullet points ever could. It didn’t describe the problem; it made us \*witness\* it. We weren’t analyzing data; we were feeling a shared pang of empathy for a confused customer. The data told us \*what\* was happening; the story showed us \*why\* it mattered.



This principle is the bedrock of building not just compelling narratives, but meaningful connections. Consider the modern malaise of networking, a word that has been stripped down to the cold mechanics of transaction. The teller approaches this world by stating, “I am a valuable connection.” They hand out LinkedIn connections like business cards, a currency of accumulation. But the shower approaches it differently. They understand that true influence is not a spreadsheet of contacts but a lattice of trust, a delicate, interwoven structure built one genuine interaction at a time. You cannot tell someone to trust you; you can only show them, through acts of generosity and insight, that you are trustworthy.



Imagine a project manager, the sole connective tissue between a team of brilliant, fast-moving engineers and a methodical, detail-oriented legal department. She could simply \*tell\* each group that the other is important. Or, she can \*show\* it. She translates the engineers’ rapid-fire technical jargon into the specific risk-mitigation language the legal team understands. She then circles back to the engineers, not with a list of obstructions, but with a clarified framework: “Here’s exactly what we need to document to protect your brilliant work and get it to market faster.” She isn’t a messenger; she is a node of value. She doesn’t announce her worth; she embodies it. Each solved problem, each defused conflict, is a silent, powerful deposit into the bank of trust. And trust, I have come to believe, is the highest form of compound interest in business. It accrues quietly in the background, and when you need to make a withdrawal—to ask for a favor, to push for a tight deadline, to champion a radical idea—the balance is there, earned not declared.



The temptation to tell is the temptation of speed. It is efficient. It is the cliff notes version of your thought. Showing, by contrast, is an act of patience and craft. It requires you to step back from your own knowledge and inhabit the curiosity of your reader. It asks you to find the revealing detail, the resonant example, the humble anecdote that opens a door instead of just hanging a sign. It is the difference between describing a sculpture from a distance and handing someone a chisel and inviting them to feel the cool weight of the marble for themselves.



So the next time you feel that faint alarm as you write, that sense that your words are skating on the surface, stop. Don’t tell me your team is collaborative. Show me the shared document where ideas from the newest intern and the most senior architect are highlighted in different colors, a tapestry of collective intelligence. Don’t tell me a market is shifting. Show me the retired factory worker in Ohio who started a thriving Etsy shop selling 3D-printed replacement parts for obsolete appliances, a silent signal of a massive, unmet need. Unearth the evidence and let it speak. Your readers, your colleagues, your network—they are intelligent. They are capable of discovery. Your greatest power as a communicator is not to impress them with your conclusions, but to enroll them in the journey of reaching their own. And in that shared space of understanding, something more than information is exchanged. A connection is forged.",1,1758807084.0,u_Smooth_Effect4095,0,1.0,False

1nq6tte,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1nq6tte/water_flosser_blooding_problem/,water flosser - blooding problem,"This month, my dentist told me to use a water flosser. I’ve used it 6 or 7 times, irregularly. Every time I use it, the area between my upper left molars—teeth 6 and 7—bleeds a lot. It turns bright red and bleeds heavily. (To give context: tooth 8 was extracted. Tooth 7 has had two root canals and is crowned. Tooth 6 also had a root canal and is crowned. Tooth 5 is filled and crowned. Each tooth has its own separate crown, not a single piece.) When I visited my dentist recently, she just blew air on the area and it started bleeding again. Even air causes bleeding. He keeps saying “clean it well.” The X-ray shows no issues with the roots. But I’m worried.

Can a water flosser seriously damage a tooth? I’m using the machine on the lowest setting. No issues with other teeth. Would using it properly reduce the bleeding?

Could it be something more serious? I don’t have any pain or sensitivity, to be honest. I just don’t want to harm myself. I’m serious :D Is it the tooth that's bleeding (like from the root canal), or is it the gums?

adding: Recently, I experienced a lot of twitching in my left cheekbone and lower left lip. It even felt a bit numb at times, but those were stressful days and I was consuming a lot of coffee. I also kept touching that area with my hands, which probably caused some sensitivity. I don’t think it’s related to my teeth.

Also, there’s a slight bump between teeth 6 and 5, but it doesn’t hurt. My dentist saw it too. I assume if it were something serious, he would’ve noticed. There's a small bump there. What if it bursts and I get sepsis? I'm confused :/",1,1758807026.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

My Script Did It in 9 Minutes.,"So, I walk in on a Monday morning, and my manager, a classic non-tech guy who thinks 'algorithm' is a new type of workout, calls me into his office. He has a stack of printouts that could double as a doorstop. 'Big project for you,' he says, beaming. The task? Manually migrating about 5,000 customer records from an ancient, crusty database into our shiny new CRM. He estimated it would take me 'at least the full week, maybe more.'

I sat at my desk, clicked open the old system, and just stared. The UI was a beautiful shade of 1998 beige, and the export function was, of course, broken. His plan was for me to literally copy and paste, field by field. I could already feel my soul leaving my body and my fingers cramping up just thinking about it. Click, copy. Click, paste. For 5,000 records. No thank you.

So, instead of starting the 'work,' I spent the morning mapping out the old database's API endpoints, which, to my shock, still existed. I brewed a strong cup of coffee, put on my headphones, and spent the next three hours hammering out a Python script. It was a simple, beautiful little thing: log in, grab a record, reformat the data, push it to the new CRM's API, rinse, and repeat. The zone I was in felt like pure creative bliss. It was me against the machine, and I was winning.

I ran the script. The first record zipped over instantly. Then another, and another. My console lit up like a Christmas tree with success messages. The entire 'week-long' task was completed in just under 9 minutes. For the rest of the week, I sent my boss daily 'progress' emails like 'Just finished the first thousand records! Phew, this is tough work, but I'm on track!' while I was actually learning how to make a sourdough starter and catching up on my gaming backlog.

On Friday, I sent the 'All Done!' email. My boss was blown away by my speed and 'attention to detail.' I got a glowing mention in the team meeting for my hard work and diligence. I just smiled and nodded. They don't have to know the work was smart, not hard.

The sodium actually interferes with your tongue’s bitterness receptors, so instead of tasting sharp or burnt, the coffee comes out smoother.

It doesn’t make the coffee salty (unless you go overboard), it just balances the flavor. This trick is especially useful if you’re drinking cheap or over-brewed coffee.

Why YSK:
Because sometimes you don’t have access to fancy beans or gear, and a simple pinch of salt can turn a bitter cup into something way more drinkable.

While I was temping, I was entitled to two paid fifteen-minute breaks: one before lunch and one after.

Now that I am salary, it seems that has changed.

I went to the lounge one day to read a book for my fifteen minute break. I saw two other employees the entire time. When I returned to my desk, I had a message from HR explaining that as salary employees, we don’t take breaks.

The employee handbook says employees who work a regularly scheduled eight hour day receive two paid fifteen-minute breaks. I sent a screenshot of that part of the handbook. I was told that the handbook is dated and they are trying to update it and “thanks for pointing that out.”

No one had told me about this before except one coworker who warned me about a particular manager who took issue with salaried people taking breaks. That was one of the two people I saw while I was reading my book. 

I made sure HR knew I knew who exactly spoke out. Mainly because that person is notorious for taking fifteen to thirty minutes getting coffee with her buddies in the morning and afternoon. She and some other managers have an hour blocked off for lunch, despite only being entitled to thirty minutes. I don't like the double standard.

I’ve looked up labor law and found that no adult employee is required to have a paid break whether wage or not, but I don’t want to pull the nuclear option by offering that and ending up with no one getting breaks. I’ve been told there are “benefits” to being salaried like my hours not being watched as closely, but they seem to want to pick and choose when I should be requesting PTO.

So anyway, if it’s not in writing, do I have to follow it?

Bonus: There’s a rumor that HR is planning on putting “no coughing in the office” in the handbook, which I’m hoping was just a dumb joke taken too seriously. But if it’s in the new handbook, I’m screenshotting that with a reply-all and saying I’m not signing it and neither should anyone else.

TL;DR: Got told salaried employees don’t get paid breaks despite that not being a rule in the handbook for which I signed an acknowledgment. ",3,1758806110.0,AskHR,26,0.59,False

1nq6f84,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nq6f84/reveal_if_the_best_programmable_coffee_maker_from/,Reveal if the best programmable coffee maker from Bella is worth it,"The Bella 35203 programmable coffee maker caught my curiosity as someone who's perpetually on a quest for the perfect cup of coffee. In the time I’ve spent using this sleek little machine, there have been moments of realization and some quirks I wasn’t entirely prepared for. Designed for those who prefer a no-fuss way to enjoy their caffeinated rituals, it’s got key features many modern coffee lovers have come to expect, but perfection, as we all know, is a rare beast.

**Design That Stands Out**

Right out of the box, the aesthetics won me over. The coffee maker in its ""Surf"" color added just the right amount of pop to my otherwise neutral kitchen countertop. It is a mix of form and functionality; the matte exterior gives off a refined feel, unlike those glossy finishes that attract every fingerprint. Measuring 6.65 inches deep, 10.35 inches wide, and 12.24 inches high, it's compact yet sturdy enough to hold its ground. You’d assume something this lightweight (only 2.69 pounds) might feel flimsy, but surprisingly, it doesn’t. The thoughtful inclusion of a non-stick warming plate was a small win, keeping my coffee warm without making cleanup an ordeal.

**Ease of Use with Modern Features**

For anyone who loves waking up to the aroma of fresh coffee, this programmable machine will likely make you smile. You can set it up to brew up to 24 hours in advance, meaning my mornings now start without me fumbling half-awake. The display, while not fancy by today’s standards, is easy to navigate and straightforward. The “pause and serve” feature? Absolute genius. No waiting impatiently for a full pot to finish brewing—I’m now the proud owner of a few hastily-poured mugs mid-cycle, which I'm convinced taste better in their forbidden glory.

Check [BELLA 35203] price on Amazon.

**Highlights**

- Programmable settings simplify caffeine-fueled mornings.
- Compact and lightweight, a good fit for small kitchens.
- Reusable filter cuts down on waste and ensures I’m not endlessly hunting for paper filters.
- The auto shut-off feature after 2 hours has saved me from more than one “did I leave it on?” moment of panic.

**Performance That Delivers, Mostly**

This coffee maker runs on a 900-watt brewing system, which means the process is efficient and reasonably quick. With a 12-cup carafe capacity, it’s excellent for family breakfasts or caffeine-fueled brainstorming sessions with coworkers during late-night projects. The carafe itself pours well, thanks to the anti-drip spout. However, the brewing strength adjustment option, while useful, doesn’t bring about a dramatic difference. It’s noticeable, but subtle—you won’t exactly end up with espresso-level boldness here.

**Drawbacks Worth Considering**

Like every product, it isn’t without its flaws. For one, the reusable filter, while eco-friendly, doesn’t have the finest mesh. As someone who’s finicky about sediments in their coffee, I noticed an occasional fine grit that made me quietly wish for a paper filter option. Additionally, the warming plate works well initially but tends to overheat the remaining coffee if left too long, giving it a slightly bitter edge. Annoying, but manageable.

- The filter could be better at trapping finer coffee grounds.
- Warming plate might overheat if the coffee sits for extended periods.
- Adjustable brew strength options could use more potency.

**Product Contenders**

You’ll inevitably stumble upon fellow challengers to this programmable coffee maker, notable among them brands like Hamilton Beach and Black & Decker, which offer similarly-featured machines. Compared to Bella’s design, competitors often lack the stylish appeal or might feel overly bulky on smaller counters. In terms of performance, Hamilton Beach edges out slightly with better coffee-ground filtration, while Black & Decker’s drip trays tend to perform better in minimizing mess. However, neither manages to strike the same balance of affordability, useful features, and compact design as this product.

**Cost Efficiency**

Affordability is one of this coffee maker's standout features. Finding a coffee machine that ticks the programmable option box, offers a reusable filter basket, and includes features like an anti-drip spout at this price point isn’t easy. What’s impressive is that most bells and whistles you’d expect from larger, more expensive models are present without stretching the budget. If you’re a stickler for value, this feels worth every penny.

1nq67ir,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nq67ir,The real reason that you don't as many carbs as you think - Personalized nutrition guide,"I've seen a few people say the carb numbers on the personalized RoxHype nutrition plan look a bit low..

But honestly, I don’t think they are, especially not for most recreational HYROX athletes training once a day.

TLDR:for one quality session per day, ~3130 kcal with ~4–5 g/kg carbs and ~2.0–2.2 g/kg protein is right on target. Bump carbs slightly on very long or double‑session days and in race week, keep protein high throughout, and you will be fueled without getting heavier.

For context I am 6'2, 90 kg, training once per day. Using Mifflin St Jeor, BMR comes out ~2150 kcal. With one hard session and normal daily movement, an activity factor around 1.6 puts maintenance near 3000–3200 kcal. That matches the plan’s ~3130 kcal, which is appropriate for maintaining performance and body composition in intensification. If someone wants a slow recomposition, you would trim 150–300 kcal, not add hundreds more.

Why ~4.4 g/kg carbs (~390 g) makes sense for HYROX training:

HYROX is a mixed strength and endurance event. Evidence‑based ranges for hybrid or team‑sport style training are 3–6 g/kg/day on normal days. Pure endurance blocks or two‑a‑days often push 5–7+ g/kg.

At 4.4 g/kg, daily muscle glycogen is restored for a single quality session with 24 hours between workouts, especially when carbs are timed around training.

More carbs are not always better. Pushing far above need can force calories higher than maintenance, increase body mass you must carry on the runs, and crowd out protein and micronutrient‑dense foods.

Carbohydrate periodization is the goal: moderate baseline carbs day to day, then top up before and after key sessions. In the final 24–48 hours before a race, you can temporarily raise to 6–8 g/kg for a classic carb‑load.

Why the higher protein focus is a feature, not a bug

~2.2 g/kg protein (~196 g) is the upper end of the well‑supported range for athletes. It helps preserve lean mass, supports repair from sled and carry work, and improves satiety so you can hold calories steady without constant hunger.

Keeping protein high allows carbs to be targeted to the sessions that matter while protecting muscle during any small day‑to‑day deficits.

Macro balance check

~390 g carbs ≈ 50% of calories

~196 g protein ≈ 25%

~87 g fat ≈ 25%
This split supports glycogen for intensity, recovery, and hormone health, without unnecessary weight gain.

1nq65fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nq65fx/the_great_living_room_labyrinth_and_how_we_found/,The Great Living Room Labyrinth (and How We Found Our Way Out),"I swear, our living room was slowly transforming into a Pinterest board gone rogue, if that Pinterest board was for ""Hoarding Chic."" Every time I walked through, I felt a lowkey wave of anxiety. Leo, bless his tech-nerd heart, had his VR headset and controllers perpetually sprawled across the coffee table, next to a mountain of charging cables. Chloe, our aspiring fitness guru, used the armchair as a launchpad for her latest resistance bands and water bottles. I was no angel either, my stack of forgotten books and a perpetually shedding blanket adding to the chaos. It was giving ""abandoned storage unit"" more than ""cozy shared space.""

Tbh, I used to love chilling in the living room after a long day, but lately, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like an obstacle course. I'd nudge Leo's headset aside with my foot, try to find a clear spot on the couch, and just sigh. We'd planned a house movie night for weeks, a throwback to the days when we first moved into this urban apartment and the space was actually *usable*. But as Friday night approached, I looked around and realized there was literally nowhere to sit, let alone set up the projector. I was ready to declare a full-blown living room intervention. Ngl, I even considered just watching the movie in my tiny bedroom, which kind of defeated the whole ""shared living"" purpose.

That evening, I gathered everyone. ""Okay, so, movie night is tonight, right?"" I started, trying to sound calm, but my internal voice was screaming. ""But where are we even gonna *sit*? This room is kinda… taken over."" Leo looked up from his phone, seeing the mess with fresh eyes, ""Oh, wow. Yeah, it's a bit much, ngl."" Chloe, usually so focused on her gym schedule, looked genuinely embarrassed. ""You're right. My bad, guys. I just keep meaning to clear my stuff."" That's so valid, I thought. We decided we needed a system. We set a 30-minute timer. Leo gathered all his tech into a designated box in his room. Chloe took her fitness gear back to her desk, agreeing to keep the common areas clear. I even tackled my own book mountain. We vacuumed, threw the blankets in the wash, and transformed the chaotic dumping ground into a proper, cozy movie zone. We even pooled some cash for a giant pizza order and a ridiculously large bag of popcorn.

Sitting there, laughing through a cheesy action movie, surrounded by my amazing, slightly messy housemates, I realized how much better it felt to just talk it out and work together. The room was clean, the vibes were immaculate, and honestly? We love to see it. It wasn't just about cleaning; it was about reclaiming our shared space and remembering why we chose to live together in the first place.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Well im learning but its not like its very easy for me to be in this world where business owners and colleagues are damn super duper nakaka stress. I wrote a short story about how i experienced corporate world while im undergraduate and having but few experience. 


Got scolded by my boss.
The office lights flickered above me, humming faintly as if echoing the weight in my chest. My boss’s voice cut through the silence like a whip, sharp and unforgiving.
“Why is this report late again? Do you think excuses can cover up your lack of discipline?”

I kept my head low, swallowing the frustration rising in my throat. Inside, I wanted to shout back, Do you even know how much work you dump on me? Do you even care that I’m only human? But instead, I forced a quiet, “Yes, sir. I’ll get it done.”

By the time I returned to my desk, my body was already aching, the fever creeping in slowly. My temples pulsed, my skin felt hot, and every movement was heavy. Yet, the endless pile of tasks didn’t care about my state. They demanded to be finished—like machines programmed for output with no regard for the person breaking apart behind them.

And for what? A salary of fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand for nights without sleep, weekends blurred into deadlines, and a body running on nothing but coffee and stubbornness. It felt unfair, almost insulting, to give so much and receive so little in return. The tasks were nearly impossible, designed to drain, to push beyond exhaustion.

At times, I stared at my reflection in the office window, wondering how long I could keep going like this before I collapsed completely. The fever was my body’s rebellion, telling me enough was enough.

But even in the haze of exhaustion, a small ember burned in me—hope. Hope that one day, I wouldn’t have to answer to a boss’s anger or accept a wage that didn’t value my effort. Hope that I could open my own business, one I would build from the ground up. It would be hard, yes, but it would be mine. And with it, maybe I could finally breathe, finally live without being crushed under impossible demands.

For now, I endure. But in my heart, I keep whispering: One day. One day I’ll be free, and stable, and proud of what I built with my own hands.",2,1758805094.0,NonZeroDay,0,1.0,False

1nq5zg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nq5zg9/less_caffeine_less_reactive_the_best_unexpected/,Less Caffeine = Less reactive. The best Unexpected perk of giving up the coffee.,"i'll start this by saying that although I cut down from a pretty large coffee addiction almost a month ago (anywhere from 4-5 cups a day), I still have my one cup of green tea every morning which I don't plan to stop, so not completely caffeine free nor plan to be. the benefits i've observed just in the last month have been awesome + i personally love my little green tea ritual every morning. it feels meditative. 

the benefits have cutting my caffeine 95% have been honestly mindblowing. my sleep continues to improve nightly, yes i find myself sleepier at times throughout the day but i am leaning into that. i think i functioned so long cranked out on coffee, riding all the highs + crashes that simply being mellow feels weird to me. yawning midday feels weird. but it's not! that's our bodies natural cycle. my brain + body feels cleaner + calmer. i don't see myself ever going back. 

BUT. the best benefit by far has been my emotional regulation. i will pause again to note that I also started taking lexapro about two weeks ago, so this could have simply been the one-two punch I needed, but it boggles my mind how less reactive I am, especially as a parent. I have 4 year old twin boys and the shame +
guilt cycle of lashing out, yelling, then repair and hating myself has pretty much been a constant. I love my boys more than anything + have tried all the things to be a calmer, less reactive parent (parenting books, classes, therapy, meditation, etc). It felt like I was a rubber band held taut and about to snap at any moment at times. I know I'm a good Mom, but it often felt like a losing battle. 

It occured to me the other day that I hadn't raised my voice in a week. A week! I have navigated all the meltdowns, tantrums, the non-stop fighting, one literally screaming MOM nonstop as I was on a work call the other day, the whining, ALL the things calmly, with a soft voicr and with a patience I literally didn't think was possible for me. I am not as sensitive to sounds now + I don't constantly feel touched out. 

Is it ditching the coffee? Is it the lexapro? Is it that I'm finally sleeping well? Who knows. But I do feel like my nervous system is regulating itself and I am able to simply pause for that magic millisecond before reacting, which simply felt impossible before. 

It's funny, because there has been a lot of push back on Mommy wine culture the past few years as less and less people drink (which I think is great) but coffee was my vice 100% and I believe it can be just as harmful. As a twin Mom first staying at home full time and now balancing work + mom-life, I drank the kool-aid that I needed to be absolutely out of my mind caffeinated to function. But it only made me more burnt out. I feel like I've gotten off the hamster wheel
and can be the kind of Mom I dreamed about now. ",7,1758804844.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

My body wants to sleep at everytime of the day and this leaves me a very tiny window of energy each day to do stuff.

I started with glucose around 12 mmol/L (~216 mg/dL) and got a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. I also had high liver enzymes values. After ~6 weeks I went from ALT 197 → 53, AST 78 → 30, GGT 445 → 59, weight 100 kg → 91kg, and HbA1c 61 → 47 mmol/mol. This is my n=1, not medical advice.

--
What I changed (simple first, fancy later)

1) Food (2–4 weeks of boring consistency)

3 real meals/day. With some proteine (fish, chicken, meat), 1–2 tbsp olive oil, and plenty of veg.

Carbs earlier in the day. I keep most starch at lunch; dinners are smaller-carb or swap to sweet potato or legumes.

Fermented foods, small and cold: AM kefir (150–200 ml), lunch sauerkraut (1–2 tbsp), dinner kimchi (1–2 tbsp). If gassy/itchy/headache → halve or pause a day.

Coffee: I keep 1–2 cups filter coffee but before ~2 pm so sleep isn’t wrecked. No milk, and no sugar.


2) Movement (the quiet glucose lever)

15–20 min walk after dinner, daily. Biggest help for fasting glucose.


3) Minimal supplement stack (start here; don’t pile on)

Omega-3 (EPA+DHA 1400mg): daily with the fattiest meal (higher dose if no fatty fish that day).

Milk thistle (silymarin 70–80%): daily with breakfast (sometimes a second small dose with food later).

Magnesium (bisglycinate): at night.

Bitter melon: only with carb-heavy dinners; skip if you feel hypo-ish (shaky/sweaty).

Optional: Vitamin D3 (dose with your clinician; I aim blood level ~75–100 nmol/L).

I did not add NAC/TUDCA/Vit E up front. I’d only consider one at a time later if I stalled.

---

Sugar & condiment strategy (what I actually avoided and used)

Cut added sugars and sweet sauces (ketchup, sugary dressings, syrups).

Fruit: mostly berries (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry) and I pair them with protein/fat (e.g., yogurt/quark + nuts). Sometimes banana.

Snack: a couple squares of 85–90% dark chocolate, often with plain quark/yogurt.

My mayo/ketchup swap: a quick 0% fat quark sauce

0% fat quark (or plain nonfat Greek yogurt)

Dill, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder

Stir and use it on chicken/fish/veg.

This let me keep flavor while avoiding the sugar and seed-oil load in many bottled sauces.

---

Why this combo made sense for NAFLD/MASH/insulin resistance:

- Ferments support the gut barrier and make short-chain fatty acids that calm liver stress.

- Protein + fiber + olive oil = steadier glucose and less liver fat production.

After-dinner walk shuttles glucose into muscle with less insulin.

Omega-3 nudges the liver toward burning rather than storing fat.

Milk thistle is liver-supportive/antioxidant (I treat it as supportive, not a magic pill).

Bitter melon helped me on higher-carb dinners;
- It can lower blood sugar, so be careful if you start diabetes meds and discuss with a clinician!

---

My starter template (what I ate most days)

Breakfast: 300 g low-fat yogurt/quark + berries + 2 tbsp flax/hemp + ~30 g walnuts and some kefir.

Lunch: 2 whole-grain wraps with salmon/chicken, hummus, avocado, crunchy veg; sauerkraut 1–2 tbsp.

Dinner (rotate):

a) Fish/chicken + 2 fists veg + legumes

b) Fish/chicken + 2 fists veg + sweet potato

c) Lower-carb dinner twice/week (extra veg + olive oil/nuts)

1-2 times a week I added minced beef. 

Kimchi 1–2 tbsp on the side

Snack (if needed): kefir smoothie or a handful of nuts; sometimes 85–90% chocolate with quark.

DISCLAIMER: This is part 6 of a little series I'm writing about the founding of my mercs. I would put the link to the other parts here but there's a ""no self-promotion"" rule on the sub that I already tripped up once, so I'll just DM the links to anyone who asks.

=====

""Okay, so long-range comms are totally freaked. We can still receive transmissions, but not send them out beyond a couple kilometers.""

""Mhm..."" Dallen listened to Kaiya's damage report as he stirred the coffee crystals until they dissolved in the water cantine, heated up by the reactor on standby mode; he was still shaking away the sleep from his head after Kaiya had woken him up. ""And the leg?""

The 2 sat with their legs dangling down through the hatch into Defixio's cockpit, figuring they'd enjoy the afternoon sun while they still could; it was probably the only truly-calm moment that they'd spent together so far. Between that, the coffess, and the 5 hours of sleep, he was starting to actually feel a bit better... just a bit, though.

He didn't even object to not being behind his Rifleman's controls in case the pirates finally found them. They hadn't seen that scout VTOL on long-range scanners for a while, and if it came to it, they could just drop down right into the cockpit.

""Better news there."" Kaiya said with a smile; she held up a jagged piece of metal that had been sitting next to her, which on closer inspection was Kallon Royalstar armor plating. ""The myomer bundles are all intact. This shard of armor plate was just embedded between them, that's what was causing the limp, but as you can see I managed to get it out. Just, you know, don't get shot there again...""

""Heh, right..."" Dallen chuckled, but trailed off when he noticed her looking at his cantine. ""What, you guys don't get instant coffee packets?""

He offered it to her, which she accepted after a moment's hesitation. ""It's not exactly in the town budget...""

She took a sip, then a massive gulp before handing it back. ""You Feddies don't know how good you have it with shit like this.""

""Is that genuine praise?"" Dallen said before taking his own gulp with a chuckle. ""Almost seems like we're getting along.""

Kaiya looked off in the direction of the sun. Better than a straight up denial. Then she looked back. ""Hey, by the way, I was meaning to ask, what's up with that flag you have in the compartment behind the toilet?""

Dallen's brow furrowed, confused as to what she was talking about. ""Uh, what flag? There's no...""

Before Kaiya could question further, the 2 of them suddenly paused, as they heard the distinct sound of an open radio frequency from down in the cockpit.

=====

""Wait- Commander! Commander please!"" The Sergeant shouted as he was hauled off to the edge of the Opportunity's open VTOL bay by 2 of Mara's personal goons, and the Pirate could do nothing but watch from his chair. ""Please, do something! I was always-!""

The goons unceremoniously shot the veteran NCO, and then dumped him out of the bay; if the gunshot didn't kill him, the 50 meter drop would.

It hadn't taken long for many of the subordinates Will had once considered allies to be swayed by Dagger 1's words; she was angry, bloodthirsty, and promised the pirates a whole new era of plunder compared to the relative caution that their now-former commander clung to as dogma.

Not long at all... the last couple dozen holdouts were overpowered and rounded up here, for the rest of the group to watch meet their no doubt-deserved end. An abject waste of talent and manpower, punctuated with howling laughter and rapturous applause.

Will himself had been beaten, stripped down to his shorts and undershirt, tied to this chair and forced to watch. He hadn't said a word as the parade of what turned out to be his real allies were disposed of without any kind of sympathy or really efficiency. What had gone wrong, he wondered? He couldn't say.

Now that everyone else was gone, Mara, the new Pirate, turned to Will with a cruel grin. ""So then... now that just leaves you.""

Will just stared up at her. *One day, this will happen to you too... and you won't see it coming either.*

After a moment, and seeming incensed that she hadn't gotten a reaction from him, Mara struck him hard across the face. ""Take him to the brig, I'll figure out something extra special for him later. In the meantime, everyone mount up! We're going back to those settlements and this time we're taking everything and everyone not nailed down!""

But as her goons began to haul Will up, a runner from the command center ran into the bay. ""Si- uh, ma'am, we just picked up 2 contacts entering orbit, and they're opening a broadcast, all frequencies!""

Mara frowned while cleaning her pistol. ""Well? pipe it down here!""

Everyone grew quiet as the PA system crackled to life.

=====

Mason cleared his throat as he sat inside Rocinante, his new(old?) Marauder; the 'mech had by now been rotated around to face the bay door, and painted a dark shade of green. Either way, he now began his speech. ""Attention to the pirates currently on the surface of Gulch, this is Commander Mason Tombs of the Davion Militia.""

""And this is Captain Raemus Thorne of the TDF!"" Thorne added from his own dropship, the 2 Leopards currently flying alongside eachother. ""We've taken control of your aerospace assets. Now, we are going to take back our world. In order to accomplish that, we will bury you if we have to. Surrender by the time we land, or be destroyed!""

Mason couldn't help but smile at the Taurian officer's energy. He knew how to make a threat. And threats were, at this point, what was likely to be most effective, as the pirates would have picked them up on sensors around this time as they reentered Gulch's orbit.

""You have 2 hours to comply, and leave this world peacefully."" He finally added. ""This is your only warning.""

There was silence for about a minute afterwards, as every waited to see if the pirates would even give them a response. Surprisingly, they did.

""HAHAHAHA!!!!"" A maniacal female voice laughed. ""Oh... this'll be fun. Say goodbye to your friends and family. Not that I was gonna let them live much longer anyway.""

And with that, the channel was cut. Mason's teeth ground together. ""Captain, I would suggest that we get a move on.""

""Roger that! Begin final approach now!""

Everyone immediately felt the pull of gravity as maneuvering thrusters were fired on both Leopards and they split up; down below, Mason saw the militia he would soon lead into battle strapped into their own crash harnesses with their weapons, straining with obvious exertion on each of their faces to stop themselves from ejecting the comments of their stomachs. They would be stuck there in their seats until the ship ceased it's high-g landing maneuvers, the only one able to move at all being Paige, the dropship Medic being somewhat acclimated to this sort of thing. The Feddies and Taurians would each retake their own settlements, and then converge on the pirate dropsite located roughly halfway between the 2 of them.

They'd only managed to scrounge up about 100 men and women total, some completely untrained; the Taurians had a bit of a larger share, but the Feddies had the big 'mech. Still, both contingents would likely be outnumbered and outgunned. All they had on their side was the initiative, and desperation. Luckily, Mason had learned over his years as a merc that, more often than not, crazy made the difference when nothing else would...

Alright, a shorter, less action-y one, but like I said I had a test to study for and this is what I wrote during my breaks, I don't wanna keep people waiting too long. But the test is done now so I'll probably be able to get another full-length one up... soon-ish. Burnout watch still in effect.

Later you told me I shouldn’t show teeth when I smiled, so I closed my lips in every photo for years.

EGLINTON - In your apartment I sang while you cooked dinner. As we slow danced you hummed along with Elvis. Later when you ran your hand lightly along my body, I couldn’t bear to break your heart.

ST ANDREWS - You said we were kindred spirits while we stood in line for coffee. We measured our heights and glanced over our shoulders to see if anyone was watching. I laughed hard at your jokes late at night in the subway and didn’t think about my teeth. Later we slept back to back in Brooklyn and you said you needed to protect your heart.

SPRING ST - We walked through the city talking about nothing and everything. I noticed your tattoo in the subway and you told me about your broken heart. I was wooden in the elevator while goodnight hung in the air. Later you told me you loved me - or did you? The party was too loud, I smiled. You walked away, a fight, some broken glass, and we never spoke of it again.

ROYAL YORK - You made me feel beautiful. I imagined a slideshow with our yearbook pictures that I found in my parents’ basement side by side. Then I saw you in someone else’s picture, and had to protect my heart.

SHERBOURNE - You met me at the airport in your tiny car, and we slept on the floor of your new apartment. We snuck into a construction site where we admired the tiles and imagined our future. Later when you finally called, it was too late.

RONCESVALLES - We walked for hours through the city and you showed me your favourite spots. In your apartment on your grandmother’s couch we drank red wine and linked fingers. I liked you more than I should have, and when you moved to Montreal it felt like an escape.

HIGH PARK - You shyly cooked for me and taught me how to played video games. I told you I missed you, and it wasn’t too late. I have never slept so deeply as I did in your arms. I crept out in the morning and it was an escape. 

LANDSDOWNE - I took your cat’s place on your chest and we matched breaths to fall asleep. Later, after the cat and after the kid, we slept back to back and thought about what we missed.",1,1758804277.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

Putting myself out here to find someone genuine to share life with. I’ve spent most of my years focusing on career and personal growth, and now I feel ready to walk the journey with the right person.

About Me:

Age: 28

Height: 5'11""

Diet: Mostly healthy South Indian food (Kerala dishes top the list), but I enjoy trying different cuisines too.

Location: Working in Bangalore, home in Kerala. I do have WFH options, and I love traveling—especially backpacking and Himalayan trips.

I work as a Senior Hardware Engineer in the automotive domain. Work challenges keep me busy, but I make sure to maintain a healthy balance outside of it. Growth and stability matter, but so does living in the present.

I am 58, MTF, pre-HRT, recently divorced after 20+ years, now living on my own.

2+ years ago when my life came crashing down (redundancy after 35+ years of working, a tax investigation, son going to uni leaving empty nest) I felt utterly exausted. Exploring my wife's wardrobe led to euphoria and the rabbit hole.

This week I have decided to try and go full-time and it has been good, with some outings to the shops, etc.

Just today I crossed a threshold, meeting a pleasant but ""on fire"" Christian friend for our weekly coffee, but for the first time as the woman I am. He has known for a year and knew last night. I can't say he's ecstatic but neither is he rejecting me, perhaps hoping I will come back to ""normality"". This post isn't about him.  It's also important that today I met him in the town I lived in for 23+ years, where I am in the choir and reasonably well known. I feel pretty euphoric TBH and hope to push thru more hurdles this weekend - I don't want to switch back to acting as a man.

The coffee was fine; we sat in an outdoor garden off the high street.

But I am now back home and feeling exhausted, and wondering if this exhaustion is

1. An early start to get ready and too many times going to bed after midnight. I am 58 after all not 28!
2. A psychological response to crossing a very significant threshold; socialising with a friend who has known me for a long time, and in my old home town.
3. Underlying physical health; I do have a well-managed thyroid issue. I am otherwise healthy and active.

I \*hope\* it's a psychological response to the stress of moving forward and being seen and NOT that I have failing health. I hope that as transition progresses, and there's less turmoil in my head ""am I trans"" endless questioning and doubting, that my energy will rebound. At some point I need to get reliable energy to work again and stop spending my pension.

Thank you for reading x

1nq57em,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nq57em/ive_helped_build_a_portfolio_of_100m_in_saas/,I’ve helped build a portfolio of $100M+ in SaaS products for 13 years. This is how our clients are doing it:,"1/ To find a real problem to solve, look for people that are duct-taping solutions together and bitching about it daily. ""Nice-to-have"" features will earn you exactly $0.

* Look for workflows where people are using 3+ different tools to accomplish one task (like designers using Figma + Slack + Google Sheets + email for project approvals)
* Monitor industry-specific forums, subreddits, and Facebook groups where professionals complain about the same process repeatedly
* Pay attention to phrases like ""I wish there was a way to..."" or ""Why doesn't anyone make something that..."" - these are goldmines for product ideas

2/ Stop chasing ""revolutionary"" bullshit. The money is in fixing persistent headaches everyone just accepts as ""part of the job.""

* Focus on improving existing processes by 10x rather than creating entirely new categories. Example: MacPaw grew revenue 200% by simply moving CleanMyMac from a licensing model to SaaS subscriptions
* Look for industries where people say ""that's just how it's always been done"" - these are ripe for disruption with simple improvements
* Build better versions of tools people already pay for, rather than trying to convince them they need something completely new

3/ Once you have an idea, call 10 people who'd actually use this thing. Don't pitch them anything - just ask what makes them want to throw their laptop out the window. If they don't think your idea is that thing, keep digging.

* Start conversations with ""Walk me through your typical Tuesday"" instead of ""What do you think of this idea?"" - you'll get real workflow insights
* Ask follow-up questions like ""How much time does that waste?"" and ""What's the cost when that breaks?"" to quantify pain points
* Record these calls (with permission) and create a pain point frequency chart - the most mentioned problems are your best targets

4/ Write down everything your MVP won't do and stick it on your wall. Half your features are ego projects. Cut everything that doesn't get someone from frustrated/yearning to ""holy shit this works.""

* Create a ""Not Now"" list that's twice as long as your feature list - successful SaaS companies often cut 60-70% of planned features before launch
* If you can't explain the core value to your mom in 30 seconds, your MVP is too complex
* For each feature, ask ""If this was the ONLY thing our product did, would someone pay for it?"" - if the answer is no, cut it

5/ Ship when you're cringing. Ugly = good when you're early.

* Set a hard deadline of 90 days maximum for your first version - longer than that and you'll over-engineer everything
* Use tools like Bubble, Webflow, or even Google Sheets as your backend initially - perfect code doesn't matter if nobody uses it
* Launch with manual processes you can automate later - many successful SaaS companies started by manually fulfilling services before building automation

6/ You are customer service. No hiding behind chatbots or ""escalating to the team."" Every angry email lands in your inbox until you're big enough to hate yourself.

* Respond to support emails within 2 hours during business hours - early customers will become evangelists if you're responsive
* Keep a shared document of every customer complaint and the solution - this becomes your FAQ and feature roadmap
* Track response times and customer satisfaction, even if you're the only agent

7/ Make them pay something, even if it's $1. Free users will waste months of your life with feedback that goes nowhere.

* Offer a 7-day free trial instead of a freemium model - paying customers give better feedback because they're invested
* Use pricing tiers like $9/month, $29/month, $99/month - psychological pricing works and helps you understand value perception
* Track the ratio of free users to paid conversions - if it's below 2% after 30 days, your free tier is too generous

8/ Send cold messages that get ignored by almost everyone. The few who reply will save you from building something nobody wants.

* Send 50 LinkedIn messages per week with specific, personal details about their industry challenges - generic messages get 0% response rates
* Use subject lines like ""Quick question about \[specific workflow they posted about\]"" instead of pitches
* Follow up exactly once after 1 week with additional value (article, tool recommendation) - persistence without value is spam

9/ If nobody's touching a feature after 3 months, delete it. Your attachment to code you wrote doesn't pay bills.

* Set up analytics to track feature usage from day one
* Create a document listing what you removed and why - this prevents rebuilding the same mistakes

10/ Don't try to be the next Slack, Notion, Lovable, or any of the big guys. They have armies and ad budgets. You have coffee and credit card debt. Act accordingly.

* Target market segments too small for big companies but perfect for bootstrapping - think 10,000-50,000 potential customers max
* Compete on speed and personal service, not features - you can implement customer requests in days, they take months
* If you MUST be “the next xyz” - focus on one specific use case they ignore, like ""Slack for construction crews"" or ""Notion for restaurant managers""

11/ Create habits by solving daily pain. Users should feel a ""withdrawal"" from your product.

* Build around existing daily habits rather than trying to create new ones - integrate with tools people already use every day
* Use email notifications strategically - send daily summaries or reminders that provide value
* Track ""days since last login"" and reach out personally when someone hasn't used your product in 3 days

12/ Hire someone who can fix things when users say ""this sucks"", and who'll tell you when your grand vision sounds like nonsense.

* Your first hire should be technical if you're not, or business-focused if you are - complementary skills beat similar ones
* Look for people who've worked at companies similar in size to where you want to be in 2 years, not where you are now
* Use probationary contracts for 90 days with clear success metrics - cultural fit matters more than perfect resumes in early stages

13/ Write a lot of content and publish it where your audience spends the most time.

* Create ""problem-focused"" content like ""Why \[industry workflow\] is broken and how to fix it"" rather than product-focused content
* Repurpose one piece of content into 5+ formats - blog post becomes Twitter thread, LinkedIn article, YouTube video, and email newsletter
* Track which content drives trial signups, not just views - vanity metrics don't pay bills

14/ Start controlling your finances early. You have to know where your money comes from and goes to.

* Track MRR, churn, and LTV from your first paying customer
* Set up separate business accounts for different purposes - operating expenses, tax savings, and emergency fund
* Calculate your ""runway"" monthly - how many months you can survive at current burn rate, and track this religiously

15/ A good accountant and an HR contractor (if you get to build a team) will save you MANY headaches. Don't skimp on them.

* Find an accountant who specializes in SaaS businesses and subscription revenue recognition - regular accountants often mess up recurring revenue
* Monitor HR compliance once you hit 3+ employees - employment law violations can kill early-stage companies
* Budget 3-5% of revenue for professional services from day one - it's insurance against expensive mistakes later",3,1758802725.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

1nq5550,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1nq5550/why_does_the_uk_make_starting_small_businesses/,Why does the UK make starting small businesses way harder than it needs to be?,"I’ve just come back from holiday in Asia and one of the things that really hit me was how people could just pull up on the street and sell food, clothes, drinks. basically anything. A wok, a grill, a basket of fruit, whatever. No massive setup, no branding, just normal people hustling a living. It worked, it fed people, it gave the consumer options and it gave them a way to start small without needing a fortune behind them.

Then you get back to the UK and realise how impossible that is here. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against regulation. We need strict rules for construction, finance, healthcare, big-scale stuff where public safety is on the line. But why do we regulate everything else to the point where the average person can’t even try?

If I wanted to sell burgers from a home made trolley/stall tomorrow, I’d need licences, hygiene certificates, liability insurance, waste disposal agreements, council approval for a pitch (that I’d also have to rent), and probably another pile of paperwork. By the time I’ve done all that, I’ve already spent nearly a couple grand before I’ve even sold a £3.50 burger.

And it’s not like this kills off the big players anyway. Where I was on holiday, they still had massive malls, chain restaurants, multinationals, and they were still full of customers. Street stalls weren’t replacing them, they were just giving people more options. Cheap eats, quick bites, or a small business owner selling clothes for a few quid alongside the high-end shops. Everyone coexisted fine.

Meanwhile, here the system basically blocks it from the start unless you have the capital for the upfront investment. 

Want to run a mobile car wash? Drowned in water regs and permits.

Want a mobile coffee van? You need Vehicle inspections, street trading licence, food hygiene registration, liability insurance, parking/trading restrictions, PAT testing for equipment, waste disposal contracts.

Event catering? Multiple food hygiene checks, portable equipment safety, gas safety certification, liability insurance, transport permits, temporary event notices, alcohol licensing if drinks are involved 

Street clothing stalls? Street trading licence, liability insurance, designated pitches only (with high fees), restrictions on times and locations, waste disposal compliance.

In my opinion, the multinationals love this. They can afford compliance teams, lawyers, and expensive pitches. Councils love it too, because they get their fees. The people who lose are the ones who just want to try something small.

Why should a multi-billion pound McDonald’s care if I’m selling burgers on the street for £3.50? But they do. Because the myth of capitalism is “competition is great.” The reality is capitalism means you need serious financial backing just to even play the game.

Sometimes we just need common sense regulation. Protect people from actual danger, yes. But don’t make it so over-the-top that normal people can’t even try. Options are what make a place thrive, and we’ve killed that spirit here
