1gxjqed,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyAviationApplicant/comments/1gxjqed/wocs_fy25/,WOCS FY25 ,"Finally graduated WOCS!  I'm thankful for all the info and insight on here so figured I'd pay it forward.

**FY 25:** 

The course is in a period of change, the current objective is for it to be ""student led, TAC guided."" On a typical day we hardly even saw our TAC officers, student leadership is assigned to ensure accountability, we make it to the right place, right time, in the right uniform, and we are following our OPORDS. You'll take and end of course survey and this will also create change in the course. In the last couple days, an hour of mandatory study time after dinner was added because the previous class wrote about not having enough.

**ACFT:**

No explanation needed. If you can't pass or if you struggle on an event get right before showing up, do not want to get kicked out or recycled before you even start.

**Bag Relocation/ ""Bag Drag"":** 

It'll be a long day. Read and understand the OPORD, do rehearsals, and be prepared to get a spot report or two. All the student leadership in our junior class got put on TAC probation after bag relocation just be prepared to deal with it. You will have the opportunity to put some stuff in a laundry bag that will be pre-staged in the rooms before bag relocation. Do yourself and your friends a favor and put all the heavy stuff in there (but don't have an empty duffle)

  
**5k/ 10k Ruck:**

These are easy events if you're in shape. Make sure you can run and ruck well before showing up and you'll be fine. Rucks are 48 lbs dry and you'll do it with an ACH (either on or in your bag, counts for weight either way), and a rubber rifle. 

  
**4 Mile Run:**

Not a graduation requirement but can prevent you from phasing up to senior WOC at 2nd WOC advancement. Just run...

  
**Land Navigation:** 

This event recycles the most people!!!! If you fail the first time you will typically have a chance to retest and continue training with your class otherwise you WILL be recycled. Study up and practice before you come if possible! Prior to going out there you'll have a brief class and get to see the map of the training area. It is super easy if you do it right.

TIPS: 

* Avoid the swamp if possible! (You'll figure out later)
* 3/4 points is passing! At the end of the day, we all get the same dot, don't push time trying to find the fourth one. 
* Stick to the roads! There are tons of roads in the area, don't try to dead reckon, I didn't even need to use my compass during this course.
* Use the water points to your advantage. Some points are at water points and right on the road.
* It is a self-correcting course, check coordinates on each point!!!!
* Run! It will save you time and will pay off later.

**LRC:**

Low threat event. When it is your turn to lead a course, LEAD, take charge, don't let your subordinates step on you and you will pass, that's what they're looking for. Most of all: don't get injured.

  
**Academics:** 

Be ready to sit in a classroom from breakfast to dinner time on a usual day. Pay attention, take notes, drink the coffee. Be prepared to go over MDMP, mission command, and military briefings. There's also a few essays and discussion post you will be required to do. Don't waste time and get your homework done!

  
**Additional Duties:**

If you pick an S shop duty... good luck. HAZMAT, coffee, or road guard is definitely the way to go.

  
**Other notes:**

* Read the WOC SOP and Barracks SOP and make sure you're right.
* No one cares what rank you were before... let it go. 
* You'll do a capstone essay and board at the end, just be confident in your answers and you'll be fine, no one in my class failed it. 
* There will be an ASU/ AGSU inspection, be right and you'll have no issues.
* Don't stress the tests! Know your doctrine, and become friends with CTRL + F keys! Don't run out of time.

Hopefully I didn't miss anything and hopefully this helps someone! I'll be happy to answer any questions, and remember: ""IT GETS BETTER!""",1,1732313195.0,ArmyAviationApplicant,0,1.0,False

1gxjmwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1gxjmwy/is_the_doctor_wrong/,Is the doctor wrong?,"Hi MCAS community! First of all, I am almost 100% sure I‚Äôm reading too much into this. I already posted on histamine intolerance subreddit and the told me that it wasn‚Äôt it, but it might be MCAS.

I was at the doctor this week for a work checkup. I had to list which illnesses my close family members have and I wrote that my sister has home dust allergy. She has it pretty bad with flate ups and dermatitis. 

When the doctor saw that, she said okay you have problems with histamines. I was like ok that‚Äôs news to me, I had no idea. She then listed some examples like when I get stung by a bee or a wasp it‚Äôs worse than for other people, the skin on my hands and lips gets very dry and cracks easily in the winter if I don‚Äôt moisturize it frequently. And then she proceeded to rub my skin for a second and said look how red it gets, that‚Äôs because of the histamines. 

I protested a bit because that doesn‚Äôt seem related to my sister having an allergy, but the doc insisted it‚Äôs genetic and that I 100% have it. And to stock up in claritine because some insect might bite me and I might get like a really bad reaction and I might need to take the 4x dose of it just to function normally. (To be honest bee and wasp stings do affect me a lot more than most people - the part of the body swells up a lot and it doesn‚Äôt go away completely for up to two weeks, so if I could mitigate that with claritine, that would be perfect)

Of course I then asked chat gpt about histamine and it gave me a list of foods that are high in histamines.  

Chocolate, coffee, alcohol, parmesan, skyr, fermented cabbage, fresh citruses‚Ä¶ all the foods I really enjoy that have never caused me any problems. 

I‚Äôm kinda lost now. On one hand I have my own experience of not getting flare ups or any reaction from living my life without a care in the world and on the other hand I have a doctor insisting I have some vague problem with histamines. 

Again, all evidence points to me not having these problems. I just want to know what y‚Äôall think. I can provide more info. 

Thanks for reading all od this. I‚Äôm just really curious and want to come to the bottom of this. ",1,1732312935.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Jabra Elite 10 earbuds, and I'm impressed with what they bring to the table. These wireless buds pack some serious audio punch, making them a great choice for music lovers and fitness buffs alike.

The Elite 10s boast Dolby Atmos with Head Tracking, creating a rich, immersive sound that follows your movements. I found this feature really adds depth to my music, making it feel like I'm right in the middle of the action. Plus, the advanced noise cancellation helps me focus when I need to, blocking out distractions effectively.

https://preview.redd.it/z1j793dtyi2e1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f39ff85a734b5dd498c28c18a1975c8271a6446

One thing that stood out to me is the comfort level. The semi-open design felt great in my ears, even after hours of use. I didn't experience any pressure or fatigue, which is a big plus for long listening sessions. The IP57 rating also means I don't have to worry about sweat or dust during my workouts.

The smart case is a neat addition. I can plug it into various audio sources, expanding where I can use these buds. Battery life is solid too, lasting up to 36 hours with the case. This means I rarely have to think about charging them.

# Bottom Line

The Jabra Elite 10 earbuds offer great sound, comfort, and useful features. If you're in the market for high-quality wireless earbuds, these are worth checking out. 

# Exploring the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 Wireless Earbuds

I've been testing these earbuds for a while now, and I'm impressed. The sound quality is top-notch, with Dolby Atmos and Head Tracking creating an immersive 3D audio experience. I found the semi-open design comfortable for long listening sessions.

The smart case is a game-changer. I plugged it into my treadmill's audio jack and enjoyed wireless listening while working out. The IP57 rating gives me peace of mind during sweaty gym sessions.

Battery life is solid - I got about 27 hours with noise cancellation on. The earbuds switch seamlessly between my phone and laptop, which is handy for work calls.

While the sound and features are great, the price is steep. Some users might find cheaper options that meet their needs. The connection can be finicky at times, which is frustrating.

Overall, these Jabras offer excellent audio and useful features, but come at a premium price point.

# Versatile Connectivity with Smart Case

I was impressed by the Elite 10's smart case. It's not just for charging - it adds a whole new level of usefulness. I plugged it into my TV's headphone jack and instantly got wireless audio. This was great for late-night viewing without disturbing others. The case also works with USB-C ports and airplane entertainment systems. It's a clever feature that sets these earbuds apart.

The case provides up to 36 hours of total playtime with the earbuds. That was plenty for my long workdays and weekend trips. Charging was quick and easy. I liked being able to connect to multiple devices and switch between my phone and laptop smoothly.

While the smart case is handy, it does make the overall package a bit bulkier than some other earbud cases. But for me, the added functionality was worth it.

# 3D Spatial Sound with Dolby Atmos

I was blown away by the Elite 10's spatial audio. The Dolby Atmos with Head Tracking creates a truly immersive 3D sound experience. It's like being in a movie theater, but the sound follows you as you move. I tried it while working out and was amazed at how it enhanced my music. The surround sound effect is impressive, making songs I've heard many times feel new again. It works well for movies too, adding depth to action scenes. While it's a cool feature, I found it can be a bit much for casual listening. Sometimes I prefer to turn it off for a more natural sound. The spatial audio doesn't work with all content, which is a small letdown. Still, when it does work, it's a standout feature that sets these earbuds apart.

# Exceptional Comfort for Prolonged Use

I wore these earbuds all day and barely noticed them. The semi-open design really helps reduce pressure in my ears. I tried different eargel sizes to find the perfect fit. They stayed put during my workouts and didn't cause any discomfort. The lightweight build makes them easy to forget about. I could use them for hours without any soreness or fatigue. This comfort is a big plus for long listening sessions or busy workdays. The design also lets in some ambient sound, which I found helpful for staying aware of my surroundings.

# Water and Dust Resistant Durability

I took these earbuds out in light rain and they held up great. The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 has an IP57 rating, which means they can handle dust and water splashes. I felt confident using them during sweaty workouts without worry. The case isn't waterproof though, so I was careful not to get that wet. While they're not meant for swimming, I'd feel fine wearing them in a sudden downpour. The durability is a big plus for active users or those who live in rainy climates. Just remember to dry them off before putting them back in the case.

# Pros and Cons

These earbuds impressed me with their innovative features and sound quality. I found a lot to like, but there were a few drawbacks too. Here's what stood out:

# Pros

* The smart case is a game-changer. I plugged it into airplane entertainment systems and treadmills for easy listening.
* Dolby Atmos spatial sound creates an awesome 3D audio experience.
* They're super comfy. I wore them all day without issues.
* Tough enough for workouts. I didn't worry about sweat or rain.
* Great for calls. People could hear me clearly even in noisy places.
* Battery life is solid. I got about 27 hours with noise canceling on.

# Cons

* The price is steep. I'm not sure everyone will see the value.
* Connectivity can be finicky. They don't always pair right away when I take them out of the case.
* Sound quality is good, but at this price point I expected more of a ""wow"" factor.
* The app has a lot of features, which is nice, but it can feel a bit overwhelming at first.

While I enjoyed using these earbuds, they're not perfect. The smart case and comfort are big pluses, but the high cost and occasional connection hiccups are worth thinking about. For most people, cheaper options might do the job just as well.

# Natural HearThrough and Noise Cancellation

I found the Elite 10's sound control features really useful. The Natural HearThrough mode lets me stay aware of my surroundings when I'm out for a run or at the gym. It picks up ambient noise well without sounding too artificial. When I want to focus, the noise cancellation works great. It blocks out most background sounds, even in noisy environments like coffee shops or on public transit. I can easily switch between modes using the touch controls on the earbuds. The noise cancellation isn't perfect - very loud sounds still come through a bit. But for everyday use, it does a solid job of creating a quieter listening experience.

# Extended Battery Life and Convenience

I was impressed by how long these earbuds last. With up to 36 hours of total use time, I didn't need to charge them for days. Even with noise canceling on, I got 27 hours. The case is really handy too. I plugged it into my treadmill's audio jack and kept listening while I worked out. It's great to have that flexibility. The earbuds connect to multiple devices, so I easily switched between my phone and laptop throughout the day. This made taking calls and listening to music super simple. The long battery life and smart case features definitely add a lot of convenience to daily use.

# Superior Call Performance

I was impressed by the call quality on these earbuds. The six microphones work together to pick up my voice clearly. I tested them in noisy places and on windy days. People on the other end could hear me well. The noise-reduction tech filters out background sounds. I felt confident taking work calls even when out and about. The earbuds connect quickly to my phone when I need to answer. Switching between devices is smooth too. I can hop on a call from my laptop or phone without hassle. The battery life is solid, so I don't worry about them dying mid-conversation. Overall, these Jabras handle calls like a champ.

# Customer Reviews

I found a mix of opinions about these earbuds in the customer reviews. Many users praised the sound quality, calling it ""incredible"" and ""the best"" they've experienced. The Dolby Atmos spatial audio feature got positive mentions. Comfort was a strong point for several reviewers, especially during exercise.

Some users had issues with connectivity, noting the earbuds didn't always pair smoothly when taken out of the case. A few compared them to other brands, with mixed results. While some felt these outperformed competitors, others thought cheaper options were just as good.

Battery life got mixed feedback. The charging case's audio plug feature for planes was seen as a nice bonus. The companion app was described as easy to use with helpful features.

Overall, opinions varied. While many loved the sound and comfort, others felt the high price wasn't fully justified by the performance.

# Conclusion

The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds left me with mixed feelings. They shine in sound quality, especially with Dolby Atmos. The comfort is great for long wear, and the smart case adds versatility for travel. But at this price point, I expected flawless connectivity, which wasn't always the case. While they're a solid choice for audio enthusiasts, casual users might find better value elsewhere. The app is user-friendly and packed with features, which I appreciated. For workouts and daily use, they perform well, but they're not perfect. If you prioritize sound and comfort, these could be worth a look. Just be aware of the high price tag and potential connection quirks.",1,1732312628.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Looking for top-notch wireless earbuds? I've been trying out the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, and they're pretty impressive. These earbuds pack a punch with their spatial audio feature, which makes music feel more real and immersive.

I was blown away by the noise cancellation. It uses something called CustomTune technology to adapt to each ear, giving a personalized listening experience. The comfort level is also great - I tried different eartips and stability bands to find my perfect fit.

https://preview.redd.it/x9jjz6h8yi2e1.jpg?width=1002&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6a35f2156575f7fd5a06fdc3c0dd72b10b3a23f

The battery life is solid. I got about 6 hours of listening time, and a quick 20-minute charge gave me an extra 2 hours. The multipoint Bluetooth is handy too - I can switch between my phone and laptop without any fuss.

Call quality is good thanks to noise-rejecting microphones. The touch controls are easy to use for adjusting volume, skipping songs, and answering calls. I like that I can use just one earbud if I want to stay aware of my surroundings.

# Bottom Line

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds offer great sound, comfort, and features. If you want a high-quality wireless earbud experience, these are worth checking out.



# Explore the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds

I've been testing these earbuds for a while now, and I'm impressed. The sound quality is top-notch, with deep bass and clear highs. I love the spatial audio feature - it makes my music feel more immersive. The noise cancellation is really effective, especially in noisy places.

The earbuds are comfy to wear for long periods. I tried different tips and bands to get the right fit. Battery life is decent - I get about 6 hours of use.

One thing I don't like is how touching the earbuds to adjust them can pause the music. It's a bit annoying. Also, some users have reported sound cuts in one earbud.

The Bose app is helpful for updates and tweaking settings. I can easily switch between devices, which is handy. Overall, these QuietComfort Ultras are solid earbuds with great sound and features.

# Immerse Yourself in Spatial Audio

I tried out the spatial audio feature on these earbuds and was blown away. It felt like the music was coming from all around me, not just inside my ears. The sound was clear and rich. I could pick out each instrument in my favorite songs. It's not perfect though. The effect works best with certain types of music. Some tracks didn't sound much different. The battery also drains faster when spatial audio is on. I got about 4 hours of use instead of 6. Still, it's a cool feature that adds a new dimension to listening. Just don't expect it to transform every song into a mind-blowing experience.

# Experience Customized Noise Cancellation

I was blown away by the QuietComfort Ultra's noise cancellation. The CustomTune tech adjusts to my ears, making the sound feel tailor-made. I tried Quiet Mode in a busy coffee shop and it was like being in my own bubble. Aware Mode let me hear what was going on around me when I needed to. The Immersion Mode with spatial audio was cool too - it made my music sound more real and in front of me. Switching between modes was easy with the touch controls. I liked that I could use just one earbud if I wanted. The app helped me fine-tune everything to my liking. While the noise cancellation is great, the earbuds can get a bit warm after long use.

# Unmatched Comfort for Extended Listening

I wore these earbuds for hours and forgot they were in my ears. The QuietComfort Ultra fit snugly without causing any pain or pressure. I tried different eartip sizes to find my perfect fit. The stability bands kept them secure during workouts. Even after long listening sessions, my ears didn't feel sore or fatigued. The lightweight design makes them easy to wear all day. I appreciate that Bose includes 9 eartip options to fit different ear shapes. This level of comfort is rare for earbuds and makes them great for long flights or work days.

# Versatile Listening Modes

I really like the three listening modes on these earbuds. Quiet Mode blocks out noise when I need to focus. Aware Mode lets me hear what's going on around me. Immersion Mode pairs noise cancellation with spatial audio for an extra immersive experience. It's easy to switch between modes with the touch controls. I found Quiet Mode great for work, while Aware Mode was perfect for walking outside. The spatial audio in Immersion Mode made music feel more life-like and engaging. Battery life does drop a bit with Immersion Mode on, but it's worth it for the enhanced sound. These modes let me tailor my listening experience to different situations throughout my day.

# Battery Life That Keeps Up

I was impressed by how long these earbuds lasted. I got about 6 hours of use with noise canceling on. This dropped to 4 hours when I used Immersive Audio, but that's still enough for my daily needs. The case gives extra charges too. A quick 20-minute boost gave me 2 more hours of play time, which was handy when I forgot to charge them fully. While not the longest-lasting earbuds I've tried, they held up well for my everyday use. The battery life was solid enough that I didn't have to worry about charging them constantly.

# Effortless Bluetooth Multitasking

I found the QuietComfort Ultra's multipoint Bluetooth feature really handy. I could easily switch between my phone and laptop without missing a beat. This was great when I wanted to take a call on my phone while watching a video on my computer. The earbuds smoothly transitioned between devices. I didn't have to manually disconnect and reconnect each time. This saved me time and hassle during busy workdays. The touch controls also made it simple to adjust volume, skip tracks, and answer calls without reaching for my phone. I liked being able to use just one earbud when needed, which was useful for quick chats or when I wanted to stay aware of my surroundings.

# Communication Made Clearer

I found the mic quality on these earbuds to be top-notch. My voice came through crystal clear on calls, even in noisy places. The noise-rejecting mics filtered out background sounds well. I could easily take calls or join video chats without worrying about being heard. The touch controls were simple to use for answering calls or adjusting volume. I liked being able to use just one earbud when needed. This was handy for quick chats or when I wanted to keep one ear free. The Bluetooth connection was stable and switching between devices was smooth. Overall, these earbuds made communication easier and clearer in my daily life.

# Pros and Cons

These earbuds pack a punch in the audio world. I've been testing them out and have some thoughts to share.

# Pros

* Amazing noise cancellation
* Comfortable fit with multiple eartip options
* Impressive spatial audio feature
* Long battery life (up to 6 hours)
* Easy-to-use touch controls
* Clear call quality
* Seamless device switching

# Cons

* Pricey compared to some competitors
* Battery life drops to 4 hours with spatial audio on
* Touch controls can be too sensitive
* App required for full functionality

I found the noise cancellation on these QuietComfort Ultras to be top-notch. It really blocks out the world around you. The spatial audio is a cool feature that makes music feel more immersive.

Comfort is a big plus. With 9 eartip options, I could find a perfect fit for my ears. The battery lasted me through a full workday, though it did drain faster with spatial audio on.

The touch controls are handy, but sometimes I accidentally paused my music when adjusting the fit. Call quality was crisp, even in noisy areas.

Switching between my phone and laptop was smooth. But keep in mind, you'll need to use the Bose app to access all features and updates.

While these earbuds are great, they come with a hefty price tag. If you're on a budget, there might be other options to consider. But for those who want premium sound and features, these are worth checking out.

# What Buyers Are Saying

I've noticed mixed feedback from users of these Bose earbuds. Many praise the sound quality, highlighting the strong bass and customizable EQ through the app. The noise cancellation gets high marks, with some calling it ""next level."" Users like the Bose app and its customization options. But there are some downsides. Some find it tricky to adjust the fit without triggering touch controls. A few mention connectivity issues, with sound cutting out on one earbud. Comfort seems hit-or-miss - some find them very comfortable, while others struggle to get a good fit. Overall, buyers seem impressed with the audio and features, but there are some fit and reliability concerns to consider.

# Conclusion

The QuietComfort Ultra earbuds deliver on Bose's reputation for top-notch sound. I found the noise cancellation to be incredibly effective, blocking out distractions even in noisy environments. The app's customization options are a nice touch, letting me fine-tune the audio to my liking. While the fit can be a bit tricky to adjust at first, once I got it right, they were comfortable for extended wear. The sound quality is impressive, with rich bass and clear highs. Though pricey, these earbuds are a solid choice for anyone seeking premium wireless audio and powerful noise cancellation in a compact package.",1,1732312451.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Our opening day is scheduled for Sunday, December 1, 2024! At 139 Bank Street 

Please check our Instagram @epcafeottawa to follow for confirmed opening day details in case there are any delays. 

We have been working non stop for the past 75 days with the renovations team, food suppliers, and other partners to bring this idea to life.

\#storytelling, #adventure, #historicalfiction, #treasurehunt.

# ""You're not listening, Sam,"" Alex complained, her eyes glued to the ancient map sprawled out on the kitchen table. She tapped her finger on a spot with the intensity of a seasoned detective. ""This isn't just some wild goose chase. It's our ticket to a fortune!""

# Sam leaned against the fridge, arms folded across his chest, skepticism etched on his face. ""You really think that map is going to lead us to treasure?"" he asked, his tone laced with doubt. The room was cluttered with dusty books, half-empty coffee cups, and notes scribbled on scrap paper‚Äîevidence of the weeks Alex had spent obsessing over the map.

# Alex looked up, her eyes gleaming with excitement. ""I know it does. It's got to be worth a shot, right?"" She swept her hand over the map, tracing the faded lines with a trembling finger. ""Just think about it. If we find this treasure, we'd be set for life.""

# Sam sighed, his skepticism slowly morphing into curiosity. He stepped closer to the table and studied the map. It was old, the parchment brittle and yellowed with age. ""Where'd you get this thing, anyway?""

# ""It was my grandpa's,"" Alex replied, her voice filled with pride.

# ""Your grandpa, the historian?""

# Alex nodded, her smile widening. ""Yeah, he found it in some archive in Spain before he passed away. He was obsessed with pirates, remember?""

# Sam nodded slowly, recalling tales of their grand adventures and the treasures they sought. ""I remember the stories,"" he said, his voice softer now. ""But I never thought they were more than just that‚Äîstories.""

# Alex leaned in, her voice barely a whisper. ""But what if they weren't just stories? What if there was some truth to them?"" She paused, watching Sam's expression shift from doubt to consideration. ""Look at the details on this map, the symbols and coordinates. It's not like anything I've ever seen before.""

# Sam couldn't deny the allure of the mystery. He picked up a magnifying glass and began scrutinizing the map more closely. His eyes darted over the intricate drawings of ships, skulls, and crossed bones. ""Okay, okay,"" he said, setting the glass down. ""I'm in. Let's do this.""

# Alex's face lit up like a Christmas tree. She slapped her palms on the table, making the coffee cups jump. ""Yes! We'll need to plan this out meticulously,"" she exclaimed. ""We can't just waltz in unprepared. This is the real deal, Sam.""

# They spent the next few weeks preparing for their adventure. Alex researched the history of piracy and the possible locations of the treasure while Sam focused on the logistics‚Äîequipment, transportation, and the best time to set sail without raising suspicion. They pored over every detail of the map, decoding the cryptic symbols and piecing together the puzzle.

# The day they set out was brisk and overcast, a perfect match for their mood. The small fishing boat they'd rented rocked gently as they motored out of the marina. The salty scent of the sea filled their nostrils, and the spray of the waves cooled their faces. They had packed lightly, bringing only what they needed: diving gear, a metal detector, a few essential tools, and enough food and water to last a week.

# Alex checked the GPS coordinates she'd plotted from the map. ""We're getting close,"" she said, her voice tight with excitement. Sam steered the boat through the choppy waters, his eyes scanning the horizon. The map indicated a small, uninhabited island that matched the one they were approaching. As they drew near, the dense jungle grew more defined, the canopy a lush tapestry of greens.

# The engine cut out, and the boat drifted closer to the shoreline. They could hear the cries of exotic birds echoing through the trees and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks. Sam dropped the anchor, and they both grabbed their gear, adrenaline pumping through their veins.

# As they waded through the warm, shallow water to the beach, the sand was soft beneath their feet. The island was more beautiful than they could have imagined‚Äîwhite sand beaches, towering palms, and a mountain in the center shrouded in mist. They set up camp in a small clearing, the map spread out between them as they strategized their first move.

# ""The map says the treasure is buried at the base of the mountain,"" Alex said, her voice a mix of excitement and trepidation. ""We need to find the cave entrance.""

# Sam nodded, his eyes scanning the dense foliage. ""It's got to be around here somewhere."" He pointed to a spot on the map where an 'X' marked the spot. ""But we can't go in blindly. We'll need to search for clues.""

# They split up, Sam taking the metal detector and Alex with a handful of notes and a compass. The jungle was alive with sounds: the rustle of leaves, the buzz of insects, and the distant call of unseen animals. The air was thick with humidity, making their clothes stick to their skin. Alex felt the weight of the jungle pressing down on her, but she pushed ahead, driven by the promise of what lay hidden beneath.

# After hours of hacking through underbrush and navigating treacherous terrain, they reconvened at the base of the mountain. Sam looked disappointed, his shoulders slumped. ""I didn't get a single hit,"" he said, shaking his head.

# Alex, however, had a glint in her eye. ""I think I found something,"" she said, holding up a tattered piece of fabric snagged on a thorny bush. It was red and black‚Äîthe same colors as the pirate flag depicted on the map. She carefully untangled it, revealing an embroidered 'J' in the corner. ""Jack's Jolly Roger,"" she murmured, her heart racing.

# They compared the fabric to the map's drawings and realized it was indeed a piece of the pirate's actual flag. It was a sign they were on the right track. The cave entrance had to be nearby. They searched with renewed vigor, and eventually, the dense foliage parted to reveal a narrow, shadowy opening.

# Sam took the lead, shining a powerful flashlight into the darkness. The beam danced across damp walls etched with ancient runes. The air grew cooler, hinting at the depths of the cave ahead. The floor was slick with moisture, and the smell of earth and decay filled their nostrils. The silence was eerie, broken only by the steady drip of water from stalactites hanging from the ceiling.

# Alex followed close behind, her eyes darting around, trying to spot any sign of their impending fortune. The walls began to widen, and soon they found themselves in a chamber that seemed to have been carved by hands long ago. The air grew heavy with the scent of something old and untouched.

# ""This is it,"" she whispered, her voice bouncing off the stone walls. ""I can feel it.""

# Sam's skepticism had given way to excitement. He stepped closer to the center of the chamber, his light playing over a large, ornate chest. It was bound in iron and had a heavy padlock that looked like it hadn't been touched in centuries.

# ""This has to be it,"" Alex breathed, her eyes locked on the treasure chest. ""Jack's treasure.""

# Sam's hand hovered over the padlock, his heart thumping. ""What's the combination?""

# Alex pulled out a small leather pouch from her pocket, her hand shaking slightly as she untied it. Inside were three tarnished metal pieces‚Äîeach one etched with a unique symbol. She'd found them in her grandpa's notes, scribbled on a page with the words 'The Key to the Fortune.' The symbols matched the ones drawn around the padlock. ""It's these,"" she said, her voice filled with excitement. ""The map's clues led me to this.""

# Carefully, she inserted each piece into the corresponding lock holes. With a satisfying click, the padlock fell open. They shared a look of disbelief, and then, with a creak that echoed through the chamber, Sam lifted the chest lid. The light from his flashlight reflected off gold and jewels, spilling out onto the damp cave floor. They both gasped in amazement‚Äîit was real. The treasure of Captain Jack Sparrow lay before them, untouched by time.

# The chest was filled with gold coins, glittering jewelry, and artifacts that spoke of a time long past. Alex reached in, her hand brushing against cold metal. She pulled out an ancient-looking key, its intricate design hinting at the secrets it once unlocked. ""This could be worth a fortune,"" she whispered, her voice filled with awe.

# Sam couldn't help but let out a low whistle as he picked up a gold doubloon, feeling the weight of history in his palm. ""We've hit the jackpot, Alex.""

# Alex nodded, her eyes wide with wonder. ""But we need to be careful,"" she cautioned, her voice still hushed. ""We don't know what kind of booby traps or curses might be protecting this.""

# Sam chuckled. ""You've watched too many movies. But you're right, we should proceed with caution."" He reached into the chest and gently pulled out a handful of gold coins, letting them clink together in his hand. The sound was music to their ears‚Äîthe sweet symphony of their newfound wealth.

# They spent hours cataloging the treasure, separating the gold and jewels into piles and taking photos for their records. Each item was a story waiting to be told‚Äîa piece of history they'd unearthed. The excitement of their discovery had them talking in hushed, excited tones, their laughter bouncing off the cave walls.

# As they worked, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but the shadows remained still. ""Sam,"" she whispered, her voice tight. ""Do you hear that?""

# Sam paused, cocking his head to listen. The only sound was the distant drip of water and their own shallow breaths. ""What is it?""

# ""It's nothing,"" Alex said, though she didn't sound convinced. She shone her light into the corner of the chamber, but the shadows remained empty. They continued their work, but the feeling of unease grew stronger. The air felt thick and charged, like it was holding its breath.

# The ground beneath their feet began to tremble, and a low rumble echoed through the chamber. The walls vibrated, sending dust raining down from the ceiling. ""Sam,"" Alex called out, her voice shaking. ""I don't like this.""

# Sam looked up from his work, a flicker of concern crossing his face. The tremors grew stronger, and a crack appeared in the stone floor, zigzagging its way towards the treasure chest. ""We have to get out of here,"" he said, urgency in his voice. They frantically stuffed their bags with as much gold and jewels as they could, the rumbling growing louder by the second.

# They sprinted out of the chamber, their footsteps echoing through the cavern. The tremors grew so intense that the walls around them began to crumble. Stalactites fell like teeth from the jaws of a giant beast, shattering into a million pieces as they hit the ground. The path grew narrower, and Sam had to push aside boulders that had been loosened from the cave-in.

# As they emerged into the light of the island, the earthquake grew stronger, knocking them to their knees. Palm trees swayed violently, and the beach was a chaos of waves crashing into the shore. The sky had turned an ominous shade of purple, and the air was thick with the smell of rain. They could see their boat in the distance, the waves tossing it around like a toy in a bathtub.

# They had to get off the island, and fast. Alex clutched the heavy bag of treasure to her chest as they sprinted towards the water. The sand shifted beneath their feet, and the ground felt unsteady. ""The boat!"" Sam shouted, pointing at the incoming tsunami of water that was rapidly approaching the shoreline.

# They reached the water's edge, the waves now lapping at their ankles. The boat was being pulled out to sea, tied to a palm tree by a fraying rope. ""Hold on,"" Sam said, dropping his bag. He sprinted back into the jungle, searching for something to cut the rope. Alex watched the waves grow higher, her heart in her throat.

# When he returned with a sharp machete, they both knew they had minutes, maybe seconds. The rope was taut with the force of the retreating water. Sam hacked away, the blade slicing through the fibers. The boat jerked free, and the two of them waded into the surf, the treasure bobbing in their wake. The boat was already half-submerged, but they managed to climb aboard.

# They started the engine, and it roared to life. The waves grew higher, the water around them a frothy maelstrom. They steered the boat into the chaos, the wind tearing at their clothes and the spray stinging their eyes. The engine strained against the force of the water, but they held their course, the mountain looming behind them, a silent sentinel of the fortune they had just claimed.

# The tsunami crashed onto the shore, sending a wall of white foam towards them. They braced themselves, the boat bucking like a wild horse. Alex clutched the side, her knuckles white with the effort. Sam steered with all his might, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The water surged around them, swirling with debris and fish flung from their coral prisons.

# They climbed the towering waves, each one threatening to swamp the boat. The engine roared in protest, but they couldn't risk slowing down. The mountain was a blur behind the curtain of rain, a constant reminder of the danger they'd just escaped.

# ""Hold on,"" Sam shouted above the din, gripping the steering wheel with all his strength.

# Alex's eyes never left the horizon as she clutched the side of the boat. Her heart raced in time with the engine, the adrenaline coursing through her veins like the waves beneath them. They crested another monstrous swell, the boat's bow pointing to the sky, and for a brief moment, she caught a glimpse of the island, now just a speck in the distance.

# The waves grew smaller, the wind less fierce, and the rain began to ease. The engine's roar was the only sound that broke the silence of the vast sea. They had made it. The treasure, their treasure, was stowed safely in the boat's hold, the chests clinking together with each dip and rise of the water. They had braved the wrath of the island's guardian spirits and lived to tell the tale.

# Alex let out a sigh of relief and turned to Sam, her eyes wide with excitement. ""We did it,"" she exclaimed, her voice barely heard over the engine.

# Sam nodded, his grip on the steering wheel loosening. ""Yeah,"" he said, a grin spreading across his face. ""We really did.""

# They headed back to the mainland, the treasure chests filled to the brim with their newfound riches. The journey was long, but the excitement of their discovery kept them awake through the night. They talked about the adventures their ancestors might have had and the lives they could now lead with their newfound wealth.

# As they approached the marina, the first light of dawn peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the calm waters. The storm had passed, leaving only a gentle breeze in its wake. Sam steered the boat towards their slip, his eyes on the distant lights of civilization.

# ""We're going to be rich,"" Alex murmured, her eyes glued to the treasure chests. ""We can do anything we want.""

# Sam nodded, his eyes still fixed on the horizon. ""But we can't just flaunt it,"" he said, his voice serious. ""We need to be smart about this. Invest it, maybe even donate some to charity. Make it count.""

# Alex's excitement dimmed slightly at the thought of parting with their treasure. ""But it's ours,"" she said, her grip tightening on the bag. ""We earned it.""

# ""We did,"" Sam agreed, ""but think about what Grandpa would want. He was all about the stories, not the gold. And if we're smart, this treasure could give us a lifetime of adventures and help a lot of people along the way.""

# Alex nodded slowly, the reality of their newfound responsibility setting in. They had to navigate the treacherous waters of wealth and fame without losing themselves.

# ""You're not listening, Sam,"" Alex complained, her eyes glued to the ancient map sprawled out on the kitchen table. She tapped her finger on a spot with the intensity of a seasoned detective. ""This isn't just some wild goose chase. It's our ticket to a fortune!""

# Sam leaned against the fridge, arms folded across his chest, skepticism etched on his face. ""You really think that map is going to lead us to treasure?"" he asked, his tone laced with doubt.

They set up camp in a small clearing, the map spread out between them as they strategized their first move.

# ""The map says the treasure is buried at the base of the mountain,"" Alex said, her voice a mix of excitement and trepidation. ""We need to find the cave entrance.""

# Sam nodded, his eyes scanning the dense foliage. ""It's got to be around here somewhere."" He pointed to a spot on the map where an 'X' marked the spot. ""But we can't go in blindly. We'll need to search for clues.""

# They split up, Sam taking the metal detector and Alex with a handful of notes and a compass. The jungle was alive with sounds: the rustle of leaves, the buzz of insects, and the distant call of unseen animals. The air was thick with humidity, making their clothes stick to their skin. Alex felt the weight of the jungle pressing down on her, but she pushed ahead, driven by the promise of what lay hidden beneath.

# After hours of hacking through underbrush and navigating treacherous terrain, they reconvened at the base of the mountain. Sam looked disappointed, his shoulders slumped. ""I didn't get a single hit,"" he said, shaking his head.

# Alex, however, had a glint in her eye. ""I think I found something,"" she said, holding up a tattered piece of fabric snagged on a thorny bush. It was red and black‚Äîthe same colors as the pirate flag depicted on the map. She carefully untangled it, revealing an embroidered 'J' in the corner. ""Jack's Jolly Roger,"" she murmured, her heart racing.

# They compared the fabric to the map's drawings and realized it was indeed a piece of the pirate's actual flag. It was a sign they were on the right track. The cave entrance had to be nearby. They searched with renewed vigor, and eventually, the dense foliage parted to reveal a narrow, shadowy opening.

# Sam took the lead, shining a powerful flashlight into the darkness. The beam danced across damp walls etched with ancient runes. The air grew cooler, hinting at the depths of the cave ahead. The floor was slick with moisture, and the smell of earth and decay filled their nostrils. The silence was eerie, broken only by the steady drip of water from stalactites hanging from the ceiling.

# Alex followed close behind, her eyes darting around, trying to spot any sign of their impending fortune. The walls began to widen, and soon they found themselves in a chamber that seemed to have been carved by hands long ago. The air grew heavy with the scent of something old and untouched.

# ""This is it,"" she whispered, her voice bouncing off the stone walls. ""I can feel it.""

# Sam's skepticism had given way to excitement. He stepped closer to the center of the chamber, his light playing over a large, ornate chest. It was bound in iron and had a heavy padlock that looked like it hadn't been touched in centuries.

# ""This has to be it,"" Alex breathed, her eyes locked on the treasure chest. ""Jack's treasure.""

# Sam's hand hovered over the padlock, his heart thumping. ""What's the combination?""

# Alex pulled out a small leather pouch from her pocket, her hand shaking slightly as she untied it. Inside were three tarnished metal pieces‚Äîeach one etched with a unique symbol. She'd found them in her grandpa's notes, scribbled on a page with the words 'The Key to the Fortune.' The symbols matched the ones drawn around the padlock. ""It's these,"" she said, her voice filled with excitement. ""The map's clues led me to this.""

# Carefully, she inserted each piece into the corresponding lock holes. With a satisfying click, the padlock fell open. They shared a look of disbelief, and then, with a creak that echoed through the chamber, Sam lifted the chest lid. The light from his flashlight reflected off gold and jewels, spilling out onto the damp cave floor. They both gasped in amazement‚Äîit was real. The treasure of Captain Jack Sparrow lay before them, untouched by time.

# The chest was filled with gold coins, glittering jewelry, and artifacts that spoke of a time long past. Alex reached in, her hand brushing against cold metal. She pulled out an ancient-looking key, its intricate design hinting at the secrets it once unlocked. ""This could be worth a fortune,"" she whispered, her voice filled with awe.

# Sam couldn't help but let out a low whistle as he picked up a gold doubloon, feeling the weight of history in his palm. ""We've hit the jackpot, Alex.""

# Alex nodded, her eyes wide with wonder. ""But we need to be careful,"" she cautioned, her voice still hushed. ""We don't know what kind of booby traps or curses might be protecting this.""

# Sam chuckled. ""You've watched too many movies. But you're right, we should proceed with caution."" He reached into the chest and gently pulled out a handful of gold coins, letting them clink together in his hand. The sound was music to their ears‚Äîthe sweet symphony of their newfound wealth.

# They spent hours cataloging the treasure, separating the gold and jewels into piles and taking photos for their records. Each item was a story waiting to be told‚Äîa piece of history they'd unearthed. The excitement of their discovery had them talking in hushed, excited tones, their laughter bouncing off the cave walls.

# As they worked, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but the shadows remained still. ""Sam,"" she whispered, her voice tight. ""Do you hear that?""

# Sam paused, cocking his head to listen. The only sound was the distant drip of water and their own shallow breaths. ""What is it?""

# ""It's nothing,"" Alex said, though she didn't sound convinced. She shone her light into the corner of the chamber, but the shadows remained empty. They continued their work, but the feeling of unease grew stronger. The air felt thick and charged, like it was holding its breath.

# The ground beneath their feet began to tremble, and a low rumble echoed through the chamber. The walls vibrated, sending dust raining down from the ceiling. ""Sam,"" Alex called out, her voice shaking. ""I don't like this.""

# Sam looked up from his work, a flicker of concern crossing his face. The tremors grew stronger, and a crack appeared in the stone floor, zigzagging its way towards the treasure chest. ""We have to get out of here,"" he said, urgency in his voice. They frantically stuffed their bags with as much gold and jewels as they could, the rumbling growing louder by the second.

# They sprinted out of the chamber, their footsteps echoing through the cavern. The tremors grew so intense that the walls around them began to crumble. Stalactites fell like teeth from the jaws of a giant beast, shattering into a million pieces as they hit the ground. The path grew narrower, and Sam had to push aside boulders that had been loosened from the cave-in.

# As they emerged into the light of the island, the earthquake grew stronger, knocking them to their knees. Palm trees swayed violently, and the beach was a chaos of waves crashing into the shore. The sky had turned an ominous shade of purple, and the air was thick with the smell of rain. They could see their boat in the distance, the waves tossing it around like a toy in a bathtub.

# They had to get off the island, and fast. Alex clutched the heavy bag of treasure to her chest as they sprinted towards the water. The sand shifted beneath their feet, and the ground felt unsteady. ""The boat!"" Sam shouted, pointing at the incoming tsunami of water that was rapidly approaching the shoreline.

# They reached the water's edge, the waves now lapping at their ankles. The boat was being pulled out to sea, tied to a palm tree by a fraying rope. ""Hold on,"" Sam said, dropping his bag. He sprinted back into the jungle, searching for something to cut the rope. Alex watched the waves grow higher, her heart in her throat.

# When he returned with a sharp machete, they both knew they had minutes, maybe seconds. The rope was taut with the force of the retreating water. Sam hacked away, the blade slicing through the fibers. The boat jerked free, and the two of them waded into the surf, the treasure bobbing in their wake. The boat was already half-submerged, but they managed to climb aboard.

# They started the engine, and it roared to life. The waves grew higher, the water around them a frothy maelstrom. They steered the boat into the chaos, the wind tearing at their clothes and the spray stinging their eyes. The engine strained against the force of the water, but they held their course, the mountain looming behind them, a silent sentinel of the fortune they had just claimed.

# The tsunami crashed onto the shore, sending a wall of white foam towards them. They braced themselves, the boat bucking like a wild horse. Alex clutched the side, her knuckles white with the effort. Sam steered with all his might, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The water surged around them, swirling with debris and fish flung from their coral prisons.

# They climbed the towering waves, each one threatening to swamp the boat. The engine roared in protest, but they couldn't risk slowing down. The mountain was a blur behind the curtain of rain, a constant reminder of the danger they'd just escaped.

# ""Hold on,"" Sam shouted above the din, gripping the steering wheel with all his strength.

# Alex's eyes never left the horizon as she clutched the side of the boat. Her heart raced in time with the engine, the adrenaline coursing through her veins like the waves beneath them. They crested another monstrous swell, the boat's bow pointing to the sky, and for a brief moment, she caught a glimpse of the island, now just a speck in the distance.

# The waves grew smaller, the wind less fierce, and the rain began to ease. The engine's roar was the only sound that broke the silence of the vast sea. They had made it. The treasure, their treasure, was stowed safely in the boat's hold, the chests clinking together with each dip and rise of the water. They had braved the wrath of the island's guardian spirits and lived to tell the tale.

# Alex let out a sigh of relief and turned to Sam, her eyes wide with excitement. ""We did it,"" she exclaimed, her voice barely heard over the engine.

# Sam nodded, his grip on the steering wheel loosening. ""Yeah,"" he said, a grin spreading across his face. ""We really did.""

# They headed back to the mainland, the treasure chests filled to the brim with their newfound riches. The journey was long, but the excitement of their discovery kept them awake through the night. They talked about the adventures their ancestors might have had and the lives they could now lead with their newfound wealth.

# As they approached the marina, the first light of dawn peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the calm waters. The storm had passed, leaving only a gentle breeze in its wake. Sam steered the boat towards their slip, his eyes on the distant lights of civilization.

# ""We're going to be rich,"" Alex murmured, her eyes glued to the treasure chests. ""We can do anything we want.""

# Sam nodded, his eyes still fixed on the horizon. ""But we can't just flaunt it,"" he said, his voice serious. ""We need to be smart about this. Invest it, maybe even donate some to charity. Make it count.""

# Alex's excitement dimmed slightly at the thought of parting with their treasure. ""But it's ours,"" she said, her grip tightening on the bag. ""We earned it.""

# ""We did,"" Sam agreed, ""but think about what Grandpa would want. He was all about the stories, not the gold. And if we're smart, this treasure could give us a lifetime of adventures and help a lot of people along the way.""

# Alex nodded slowly, the reality of their newfound responsibility setting in. They had to navigate the treacherous waters of wealth and fame without losing themselves.",1,1732312226.0,JinxStorypage,0,1.0,False

So I stopped drinking caffeine 2 days ago and went to my doctor who did an EKG and said that I did have a palpitation but everything else looked okay. Today I started to feel more stress and I'm not sure if it's just self-inflicted anxiety or if something else has happened because I did have some coffee this morning so I might have triggered this.

1gxjaz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1gxjaz3/values_not_improving_despite_medication_and/,Values not improving despite medication and lifestyle imps,"Hey hey! 

I recently was diagnosed with high blood pressure. In a 24h measurement it was found that I had an average blood pressure of 146/96. I was prescribed 2.5mg Ramipril twice a day (5mg) which I have been taking for the past 3 weeks. I have been self measuring constantly and observed that my diastolic values went down and are typically somewhere between 70 and 80 while the systolic one is somewhere between 135 and 160. 

I am starting to get quite frustrated as apart from medication I don't see much room for changes in my lifestyle. I am 32 years old, eating pretty healthy (fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts, no red meat, little cheese) and working out 5 times a week with resistance training as well as cardio. I weigh 79kg at 183cm. No cigarettes, alcohol maybe one glass every 1 - 2 weeks. Low stress work from home job. I sleep as long as I need, usually waking up without an alarm after 6.5 - 8 hours of sleep. I eat salt but started reducing the intake. Checked if coffee is the issue but it seems not to make a big difference. Excercise lowers the BP for some hours though.

Family wise my father has (pretty) high blood pressure, while my older brother doesn't. Both their lifestyle is rather not the healthiest.

I'm honestly at a loss right now and not sure what to do. My doctor sent me to the cardiologist, angiologist and endocrinologist to cross out some possibilities but already said that from his experience it is unlikely they will find something out of the ordinary.

I recently got my hands on the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, and I'm impressed. These wireless noise-canceling cans are a step up from earlier models.

The sound quality is top-notch. I've been using them for music, calls, and even while working. The noise cancellation is great - it blocks out most outside sounds. The battery lasts a long time too. I got about 30 hours of use before needing to charge.

https://preview.redd.it/qv4yhf0awi2e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbccec0a064b96253cb51cd699092c447e74c497

These headphones are comfy to wear. The soft leather feels nice, and they're light enough for all-day use. The touch controls work well for adjusting volume or skipping tracks.

Call quality is good thanks to the built-in mics. People can hear me clearly, even in noisy places. The quick charge feature is handy - a short 3-minute charge gives 3 hours of playback.

# Bottom Line

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are a solid choice for great sound and noise cancellation. They're comfy, have good battery life, and work well for music and calls.



# Overview of Sony WH-1000XM5

I recently got my hands on the Sony XM5s and I'm impressed. These headphones take noise-canceling to a new level. With 8 mics and dual processors, they block out almost everything. The sound is crisp and clear thanks to the new V1 chip. I found the touch controls easy to use for adjusting volume and skipping tracks. Battery life is great - I got about 30 hours of use before needing to recharge. The soft leather earcups are comfy for long listening sessions. Call quality is good too, with 4 mics picking up my voice clearly. While pricey, I think the XM5s are worth it for their top-notch performance and features.

# Advanced Noise Cancellation

I was blown away by the XM5's noise cancellation. It's a big step up from older models. The headphones use eight mics and two processors to block out sounds. I tried them in a busy coffee shop and couldn't hear the chatter or espresso machines. Even on a plane, they cut out most of the engine noise. The auto-adjusting feature is cool - it adapts to your surroundings without me having to do anything. While they don't eliminate every single sound, they come pretty close. For anyone who needs peace and quiet to focus or relax, these are a game-changer.

# Hands-Free Calling Clarity

I was blown away by how clear my calls sounded with the XM5s. The four beamforming mics picked up my voice perfectly, even when I was walking down a busy street. Background noise was filtered out well, so the person on the other end could hear me clearly. I found it easy to take calls without reaching for my phone. The touch controls let me answer calls with a quick tap. While not perfect in very loud places, these headphones handled most environments well for calls. Overall, the XM5s are a solid choice if you need to take a lot of hands-free calls.

# Extended Battery Life

I was impressed by the long-lasting battery of the Sony XM5 headphones. They kept going for about 30 hours on a single charge, even with noise canceling on. This meant I could use them for days without worrying about plugging them in. When I did need to charge, a quick 3-minute boost gave me 3 hours of playback. That came in handy when I forgot to charge them before a trip. The USB-C charging was fast and easy. I liked not having to carry extra batteries or worry about running out of power during long listening sessions.

# Unmatched Comfort and Aesthetics

I was blown away by how comfortable these headphones are. The soft fit leather feels amazing on my ears, even after hours of wear. I hardly notice I'm wearing them. The sleek black design looks great too. They're lightweight and don't clamp too tight. I can wear them all day at work or on long flights with no issues. The touch controls are easy to use and let me adjust volume or skip tracks without fumbling for my phone. While they're pricier than some other options, the premium feel and comfort make them worth it for me. If you want headphones you can wear for hours on end, these are tough to beat.

# Seamless Touch Controls

I found the touch controls on these headphones incredibly intuitive. A simple tap on the right ear cup lets me play or pause music, while swiping up or down adjusts the volume. Swiping forward or back skips tracks. I like how responsive the controls are - they work even with slightly damp hands. The touch surface is large, so I don't have to fumble around to find the right spot. One small issue is that the controls can be a bit too sensitive sometimes, triggering accidentally when adjusting the headphones. But overall, I appreciate how easy it is to control my music without reaching for my phone.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using these Sony headphones for a while now, and I've got to say, they've left quite an impression. Let's break down what I found to be good and not-so-good about them.

# Pros

* The noise cancellation is top-notch. I can barely hear anything around me when I have these on.
* Sound quality is excellent. The music comes through clear and balanced.
* Battery life is impressive. I can use them all day without needing to recharge.
* They're really comfortable. The soft leather feels nice, and I can wear them for hours.
* The touch controls are handy. I can easily adjust volume or skip tracks without reaching for my phone.
* Call quality is surprisingly good. People can hear me clearly even in noisy places.

# Cons

* They're a bit pricey. You'll need to shell out quite a bit for these.
* The case is bulky. It takes up more space in my bag than I'd like.
* There's no water resistance rating. I worry about using them in light rain.
* The auto-pause feature when you take them off can be a bit finicky sometimes.
* They don't fold up as compact as some other models I've tried.

I found these Sony headphones to be a solid choice for everyday use. While they have a few drawbacks, the pros outweigh the cons for me. The excellent sound and comfort make them worth considering if you're in the market for high-end wireless headphones.

# What Customers Are Saying

I've noticed that users are really impressed with the XM5's noise-canceling abilities. Many say it's among the best they've experienced. The sound quality gets high marks too, with people praising its clarity and balance across different types of music. Battery life is another big plus - lots of users mention it lasts a long time between charges. Comfort seems to be hit or miss. Some find them very comfy for long wear, while others say they can get a bit tight. Call quality is generally good, but a few folks mention it could be better. Overall, most buyers seem happy with their purchase, even if they're upgrading from older models. The XM5 isn't perfect, but it looks like Sony has made some solid improvements over previous versions.

# Conclusion

I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Sony WH-1000XM5. These headphones offer top-notch noise canceling, great sound quality, and impressive battery life. The comfort level is high, thanks to the soft synthetic leather. While they're pricey, the XM5s deliver a premium experience that's hard to beat. Call quality is good, and the customizable sound profiles are a nice touch. They're not perfect - very loud noises can still sneak through sometimes. But for most everyday use, whether it's work, travel, or just relaxing at home, these headphones excel. If you're in the market for high-end wireless headphones and have the budget, the XM5s are definitely worth considering. They've earned a solid spot in my daily routine.",1,1732311779.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Looking for top-notch noise-canceling headphones? I've been testing out the Bose QC45, and I'm impressed with what I've found.

These over-ear headphones offer a great mix of comfort and sound quality. I noticed the plush ear cushions right away - they're soft and let me wear the QC45s for hours without discomfort. The sound is clear and balanced, with good bass that doesn't overpower the mids and highs.

https://preview.redd.it/rgzur5tuvi2e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f095f621827d7e607e8bf5c09818e10b46758e8

The noise cancellation on these is top-notch. I tried them in a busy coffee shop, and they blocked out most of the chatter and background noise. There's also an Aware Mode that lets in outside sounds when you need to hear your surroundings.

Battery life is solid - I got about 22 hours of use before needing to recharge. The Bluetooth connection stayed strong, even when I walked to another room. I liked being able to adjust the EQ in the Bose app to fine-tune the sound to my taste.

# Bottom Line

The Bose QC45 headphones are a great pick if you want comfy, great-sounding noise-canceling headphones. They work well for music, calls, and blocking out distractions.



# Overview of Bose QuietComfort 45

I've been using the QC45s for a while now, and I'm impressed. These over-ear headphones are comfy and light. I can wear them for hours without discomfort. The noise canceling is top-notch. It blocks out most background noise, letting me focus on my music or work.

Sound quality is great. The bass is punchy, and the highs are clear. I like that I can adjust the EQ in the Bose app to fine-tune the sound. Battery life is solid too - I get about 22 hours on a single charge.

One cool feature is Aware Mode. It lets me hear my surroundings without taking off the headphones. This is handy when I'm out and about. The touch controls are easy to use, and the mic works well for calls.

While not perfect, the QC45s are a solid choice for anyone wanting good sound and noise canceling in a comfy package.

# Active Noise Cancelling Experience

I was blown away by the QuietComfort 45's noise cancelling. These headphones create a bubble of silence, blocking out most background noise. I tested them in busy cafes and on public transport. They significantly reduced chatter, traffic sounds, and engine hum. The ANC doesn't completely eliminate all noise, but it makes a big difference.

I like that I can switch to Aware Mode when I need to hear my surroundings. This feature lets in some ambient sound without taking off the headphones. It's handy for quick conversations or listening for announcements.

The ANC doesn't cause any noticeable pressure or discomfort in my ears. I can wear these for hours without issues. While the noise cancelling is great, it's not perfect. Very loud, sudden noises can still be heard faintly. But for most everyday use, the QuietComfort 45 provides excellent noise reduction.

# Audio Quality

The sound on these headphones is clear and balanced. I found the bass punchy without overpowering the mids and highs. Vocals come through crisp and detailed. The QuietComfort 45s handle various music genres well, from classical to rock.

Their active noise cancellation helps enhance the audio experience by blocking outside noise. This lets me focus on the music without distractions. The sound stage feels wide and immersive.

While not the absolute best-sounding headphones I've tried, the QC45s deliver very good audio quality for most listeners. The sound profile is pleasant and works well for extended listening sessions. Music and podcasts both sound great through these.

# Battery Life and Charging

I was impressed by how long these Bose headphones last on a single charge. I got about 22 hours of use before needing to plug them in again. That's enough for a full day of work plus a long flight. Charging is quick and easy with the included USB-C cable. I like that I can get a few hours of playtime from just a 15-minute quick charge when I'm in a hurry. The battery life is solid for wireless noise-cancelling headphones in this class. I don't have to worry about running out of juice during my commute or workday. Overall, the QuietComfort 45s deliver reliable battery performance for my daily needs.

# Comfort and Design

I wore these headphones for hours and barely noticed them on my head. The ear cushions are soft and plush, covered in synthetic leather that feels great against the skin. The headband has minimal clamping force, so there's no uncomfortable pressure. Bose clearly put thought into the materials, using durable glass-filled nylon and metal hinges that should stand up to daily use. The clean, simple look is stylish without being flashy. At just over half a pound, they're light enough for all-day wear. The controls are easy to find and use by touch. While comfort is top-notch, I wish there were more color options beyond just white and black.

# Bluetooth Connectivity Features

I found the Bluetooth connectivity on these headphones to be really solid. They use Bluetooth 5.1, which gave me a strong and stable connection to my devices. I could walk around my house without any dropouts or audio glitches. Pairing was quick and easy - I just had to press a button and select the QC45s on my phone. The range was good too. I left my phone in one room and could still listen clearly in another. One nice touch is that you can connect to two devices at once. This let me switch between my laptop and phone without having to re-pair. The only small issue I noticed was a tiny bit of audio lag when watching videos, but it wasn't enough to bother me.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using these headphones for a while now, and I have to say, they've become my go-to for daily listening. Let me break down what I've found to be the good and not-so-good aspects of the QuietComfort 45.

I've found these headphones to be a solid choice for everyday use. The noise cancellation and comfort are standout features for me. While they're not perfect, the pros outweigh the cons in my experience.

I've been using these Bose headphones for a while now, and they've become my go-to for noise cancellation. Many users praise their comfort, with some saying they can wear them for hours without discomfort. The sound quality gets high marks from most buyers. People like the hard case for storage and travel. A few users mention they switched from other brands due to durability issues.

An incredibly moody note to begin with, and who wants to listen to a grown man whine about how misunderstood he is etc etc so I'll cut it short

essentially I'm just looking for somebody interesting, intellectually curious, perceptive, has a silly sense of humour (which I'm doing an awful job of demonstrating right now), an appreciation for the small joys and good music, a desire to see a lot in this world. Somebody I can wax lyrical to, mutually bully just a little bit (i'll grovel if I go to far), send dumb memes to (i'm too online (insert succession meme)), watch stuff or even read together? that'd be nice. And of course there's all the romantic stuff I'd like but it feels a bit cloying to talk about when it's for nobody in particular

After sometime she initiated to talk to me in classes and we talked and i asked her out. But she tell she can't come for coffee so we talked on a  play ground and i confesses that i like you and she replied that accha but seriously i like another boy she clearly stated it so i said ok fine and bye and that boy was her (ex bf).
After that my heart felt heavy but i accepted it but want to genuinely know the boy who she likes means i just want to look at who is he?
After few days i again approached her and said can we be just friends and she replied yes and i asked her insta but she was not using insta at that time we connected on snap on her brothers id and talked talked like months of months and she started showing the signs of gf bf traits on chat and by reading chat no one can tell we were just friends but we were.  After that i got frustrated and said lets be in relationship now but she denied denied and walked out her life that last time.


And i got connected somewhere else with someone who loves me and genuinely loves me, cares for me literally pray for me in everything. And we got in relationship and that relationship longed (1 year and 2 months ) the ideal gf for any boy in Today's time. Listens everything and just want me and  ignore everyone.
  We get into long distance relationship after my 12th as i shifted to college and we both were loyal to each other. But one day my roomate asked about the girl i used to like in coaching and i started missing her üôÇ now thinking ( it as biggest mistake fuck) and went to hometown to meet her again we talked again and got connected again on snap and i accept that i clearly cheated on my ex gf for 2 months cause she was unaware of me talking to her. Later she find out about us but still she was loving me she got hurt so worst but still wants me and i was unable to handle both and i have to choice between them and i choose the girl i liked rejecting gf and i don't clear out things with my ex gf and we breakup after my ex gf brother finds about us through insta..
After that the girl i liked proposed me on 14feb with cute lines written for me and we started our relationship. Fights are common not that worry for me after 4 months of relationship. Her brother finds about us through her phone and we didn't talk around 1.5 months no contact at all. That phase was the worst i was unable to decide what to do wait for her or leave. But i decided to wait and after 1.5 months she created a fake acc for me from her friend to talk to me. She describes what happened at her home only half things shared. And clearly stated that she don't want relationship now and if you want to talk she can talk to me on that acc for less time. 

Again she asked what you want i said that i can't move on directly so talk to me as a friend we started talking and talked 3 months again we get closed talked like bf gf but having no tag of relationship on it and we don't know what is our status.
We were doing it because we were having feelings for each other. But she is not my gf was hurting me from inside and i started getting jealous whoever she talk. She clearly tells me whom she is talking and she was just replying. But here i used to get angry and jealous why you talk this that, it was ok but for small things which should not matter were hurting me. It was getting toxic but instead of loving her i was just fighting which i done wrong i accept it. She done everything that shows she loves me. 
One day she talked to one boy from her med college and she was telling every details whatever they talk but i angrily asked for ss of chat she said u believe in me or chat i replied chat in angry tone and then she said she don't want to talk and i continuously called 20 times to her she was fallen asleep still she picked up the call and i was on my ego to prove her wrong what she is doing in angry tone very angry tone which i never used infront of her. After that she called me in morning but i was on ego i cutted call 2 time and after 3rd call she was taking but i cutted call on her mouth. After that she blocks me and after few hours she unblocked and wrote a note that she can't handle it anymore i don't want to live with you . After this also she called me 5 times but i was driving so i was unable to pick the call and i was in hurry to admit my friend to hospital due to his health and in that chaos i received her call and i read the msg of insta after 7 hrs and answered hmm to that long note üòÆ‚Äçüí® . I am seriously stupid one to this and she also asked on call what is your reply i said hmm üò≠ . And she blocked me.

She told not to contact to me she is going to block from wp, call and insta everywhere. On that same day i tried to apologise for whatever happened she was full cold which is obvious after that. She said she don't want to solve it bye.

I said lets be just friends she said i will not talk to you more than 10 min ok . I am totally confused what to do now?
 
She is behaving total cold like she don't give a fuck about me now is it the truth?

I am just calling her she is talking to her friends but not to me ignoring me whole way possible 
I am not able to understand to give up on her or not cause the way she is treating is hurting me and hurting so much that i am writing this 3 in morning cause i am not able to sleep .
If i don't contact her she will be distanceed from me and one day we won't be able to get the bond and i am fearful of that and dont want to loose it. What should we done in this situation pls i am suffering bit hard..",0,1732311091.0,relationship_advice,1,0.33,False

Sometimes I feel like he's interested as well: he touched my shoulder a couple of times while speaking 1 to 1 (in a very respectful and kind of shy way), we laughed a couple of times, and during our last class he came to talk to me, ask about my plans and kind of said goodbye.

He's the typical friendly and caring professor (I'm studying in a Master at university) so it's hard to tell if there is something more or not from his side. As far as I know he's not married (no ring) or in a relationship, as he mentioned having  a son or two in their twenties.

I won't have any more classes with him, by now he's not going to be my supervisor for the thesis, so I don't know if would be ok or not to make a move (perhaps waiting just a couple of months to be sure about the absence of professional conflicts... Even though my MA will last for 2 academic years, and the first semester isn't even finished). 

I thought about inviting him for a coffee, like casually if I meet him in the corridor... But I am also afraid of jeopardising my career or even worse his career.

\## The Challenge

Did you know that up to 90% of your website visitors leave without taking any action? That's a massive pool of potential leads slipping through your fingers. In 2024, over 40% of customers expect a live chat feature on business websites. How can SMBs meet this expectation without breaking the bank?

\## Enter the AI Chatbot

An AI chatbot serves as your tireless digital salesperson, working 24/7 to engage every visitor on your website. Here's why it's a game-changer:

1. Always On Duty: Responds instantly, even when you're off the clock.

2. Instant Engagement: Springs into action the moment someone lands on your site.

3. Intelligent Interactions: Answers questions, provides support, and guides visitors towards conversion.

4. Multilingual Support: Communicates in over 40 languages, expanding your reach.



\## The Benefits

\- Real-Time Engagement: Makes visitors feel valued and attended to.

\- Proven Results: Websites with live chat can increase lead generation by up to 67%.

\- Cost-Effective: No additional ad spend required.

\- Smart and Adaptive: Understands your content and visitor needs.



\## Impressive Statistics

\- 33% of consumers find their live chat experience to be ""very effective"" at resolving issues.

\- Chatbots saved businesses approximately 2.5 billion hours of work in 2023.

\- Some industries see chatbot conversion rates as high as 70%.



\## Beyond Chat

Modern AI chatbots offer more than just conversation. They integrate with CRM systems, automate SMS and email follow-ups, and even contribute to improved search engine rankings by enhancing user experience.

\## Affordable Excellence

For less than the price of a daily coffee, you can have a digital salesperson working tirelessly for your business. It's an investment that pays for itself by capturing leads that might otherwise be lost.

In conclusion, AI chatbots represent a significant opportunity for SMBs to level the playing field with larger competitors. By providing 24/7 availability, personalized interactions, and cost-effective lead generation, these intelligent assistants can significantly boost website conversions and drive business growth.

As we move further into the digital age, the question for SMBs is no longer whether they can afford to implement an AI chatbot, but rather, can they afford not to? The potential for increased conversions, improved customer satisfaction, and streamlined operations make AI chatbots an invaluable tool for any business looking to thrive in the online marketplace.

Are you ready to transform your website into a lead-generating powerhouse? The future of customer engagement is here, and it's powered by AI. Don't let another potential lead slip away ‚Äì it's time to embrace the chatbot revolution and watch your conversions soar.

Each one chewing the tail of the moment after it

Each one

Both a meal and a hunter, an arrow and a bow

I can see it all so clearly, in that second, the way it was, and then

The way it will be

The break in how you speak to me, the pauses getting longer, the slow

And inevitable fade

There were sparks on your tongue, in the beginning--

There are always sparks--

And now, when you pause for your coffee in the middle of the day

You glance at your phone, put it back in your pocket

Before the boss sees

You never settle back into your chair, shielding the screen from your office

To send me words tinged with fire.

I am a ripple, an ebb in the tidepool of things that happened to you

A glimpse at an alternative life

With a woman who eats embers and watches time crest and fall

Eyes back to the beginning

And ever to the horizon

Peace

Her only chosen stranger.

In two days

I'll send you a message from the past, scorched by my own tongue:

It was fun babe,

While it lasted.

Then I saw a super sale on a refurbished Jura Giga 10 and decided to go for it. The machine arrived three days ago, and when I checked the stats, I saw it had only made three coffees total‚Äîfelt like I hit the jackpot!

After a few drinks, I started noticing some milk splatter, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time. Then, today, I tried to make coffee and got an **Error 14**, instructing me to call Jura. When I reached out to customer support, the rep told me my only options were to return the machine or send it in for repairs. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt have another unit available to send as a replacement. When I asked about Error 14, they said it was an internal issue with the machine.

Upon further inspection, I found a plastic piece stuck underneath the machine where the coffee grounds tray goes, which made it impossible to reinsert the tray. At this point, I think I‚Äôll have to return it. üòî

I really liked the Giga 10, but I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with Jura‚Äôs quality control‚Äîbreaking down after just two days isn‚Äôt a good look. I was considering ordering another Jura model, but now I‚Äôm hesitant due to concerns about their QC.

For now, I guess I‚Äôll stick with my KF8. Not sure if that‚Äôs an upgrade or a downgrade, but at least it‚Äôs reliable! üòä",5,1732310662.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

This collection is based in Limerick and is owned by Gerry McManus, brother of billionaire businessman JP McManus.

Below is a list of as many of the cars that I could think of - I have no doubt there are more and a few of these may no longer be a part of the collection. Nonetheless, here it is: 
 

‚Ä¢1961 Aston Martin DB4 GT Jet (1 of 1)

‚Ä¢1964 Aston Martin DB5

‚Ä¢1959 BMW 507 Roadster (with hardtop, formerly owned by John Surtees CBE)

‚Ä¢2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4

‚Ä¢2014 Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (the final one produced)

‚Ä¢1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa (purchased in 2014, reportedly the most expensive car sale ever at the time, at ‚Ç¨26 million)

‚Ä¢2004 Ferrari Enzo

‚Ä¢2007 Ferrari 599 GTB

‚Ä¢2012 Ferrari 458 Spider

‚Ä¢1955 Maserati 300S (1 of 11 short nose examples)

‚Ä¢1967 Maserati Mistral Spyder 3.7 (1 of 13 RHD examples)

‚Ä¢1995 McLaren F1 (chassis 005, previously part of the famous Brunei Royal car collection)

‚Ä¢1955 Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing

‚Ä¢1955 Porsche 550 Spyder

‚Ä¢2004 Porsche Carrera GT

‚Ä¢2015 Porsche 918 Spyder

‚Ä¢1968 Toyota 2000GT

With the majority of these cars commanding seven figure price tags and some even eight figure price tags, it‚Äôs amazing that our little island has been home to them. 

The best thing is that these cars actually get driven, with frequent appearances being made at Cars & Coffee Limerick. Fair play to Gerry, this is truly a world class collection.

I really really disliked my samples of Incarnate and Drunk Maple, especially the dry down. Drunk Maple‚Äôs opening reminds me a lot of Vanilla Skin (Phlur) but stronger and more musky? The dry down of Incarnate and Drunk Maple is very similar for me in that I kind of read them both as bubblegum and incense together in a smell I really can‚Äôt stand on myself. Drunk Maple actually has a note that makes me sneeze (I‚Äôm wearing just one spray today and it started bugging me at hour 1 and is just plain unbearable now at hour 5).

I‚Äôve tried analyzing the notes but the only thing DM and Incarnate have in common on the dry down is sandalwood and I have other fragrances with sandalwood that I love albeit definitely more juicy like Victoria‚Äôs Secret Bare. I also believe that one might be a different sandalwood (Australian).

I‚Äôm attaching the note breakdown for each here:

Incarnate 
T: amyris, violet leaf, white pepper
H: vanilla, frankincense, labdanum
B: musk, patchouli, sandalwood

Drunk Maple
T: rum, davana, pink pepper,
H: coffee resinoid, suede, maple syrup
B: benzoin, sandalwood, vanilla, orcanox (I believe this is another word for ambroxan)

I've been thinking about telling my crush I like them. We work together. We're both in our late 20s but when it comes to crushes it seems like high school.

I'm unsure whether he likes me or is simply a nice guy. In general idk if guys know we like them? He's very introverted and discreet as well so it's harder to tell. 

So far we've gone out for one casual coffee, afterwards he congratulated me for my birthday, he also approached me after a presentation to ask me how I liked it and he had seen me being there. (It wasnt a mandatory work presentation but I showed up to give him a hint) He then also offered to have another chat about my work and to send me extra materials I could use... aside from that he's pretty swamped at work so we rarely see each other. 

I sometimes feel like he looks my way at meetings, or at least notes I'm there. 
I think I also caught him blushing whilst talking to me after the presentation. 

He however hasn't approached to hang out further or do something date like. All this has happened within a month so I guess we're quite fast. I'm not sure whether I should simply tell him I have a crush on him or if that would creep him out üòÖ

He then proceeded to tell me, in detail, about the night before and just how disgusted he is with me.

I was sick to my stomach. I told him I didn't remember any of it and if I was THAT drunk why the hell didn't he do something.

I got really unhappy with myself when I realized I weighed 252 and for the first time in my life I felt truly old. It hurt to walk and move. I just wanted to lie on the couch. 

The realization came when I attended a function and none of my decent pants fit anymore. I wound up putting on a pair of 40‚Äù waist pants that were terribly uncomfortable. 

I remembered I‚Äôd had good results with WW in the past and decided to give it a try. It really isn‚Äôt very hard, yes, I did come on here whining once about a weight spike, but overall it‚Äôs been positive. Today, on November 22, I have lost 32 pounds and about to buy some pairs of 34‚Äù waist pants. I still want to lose another 20 pounds but am pretty happy with where I am. 

I don‚Äôt drink soda and very rarely alcohol. I‚Äôve cut way back on carbs and fried food. Mostly I drink black coffee, unsweetened tea, or ice water. I used to have pasta or ramen several times a week but now they are just an occasional treat. Same with desserts. Generally the most I do are one or two ‚Äúfun size‚Äù chocolate bars.

My ‚Äúsecret‚Äù is vegetable soup. Every Sunday I make a big pot of soup with chicken stock, cabbage, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, Thai herb mix, tomatoes, several types of beans, corn, and peas. I season it well with salt, pepper, Maggi seasoning, and pepper flakes. I have this with a couple of pieces of fruit and baby carrots for lunch almost every day. This fills me up and gives me energy. 

By having this I have much more freedom with what I can have for dinner. And I rarely get tired of it. Another advantage is that I used to spend $10 - $20 a day eating out but now my lunch for the week costs around $25.

This way I can still have fried chicken or pasta or a hamburger for dinner. But now I‚Äôm also using work arounds such as sirloin steak, cooked rare, instead of ribeye, and developing a taste for chicken breast (still prefer the dark meat). Even with the ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods I find myself eating much less in quantity.

I was sitting there, waiting, wondering what meth was going to be like. But nothing happened. No high. No nothing. I was so confused. I asked my husband and her if they were just messing with me and asked if it was aspirin or something. She swore it was her stuff and my husband said he wouldn‚Äôt joke around like that with me. Time kept passing and nothing at all. 

I‚Äôve never been so confused. The meth didn‚Äôt affect me at all. I know for a fact it apparently works because each time the woman with us did one, you could see the dramatic spike in energy and everything.

Mystery Flesh Pit homebrew DND 5e adventure

The Heroes (Wizard,Archer,Barbarian,Assassin, Artificer NPC) make their way to the hidden CEO base 100 km away via the Pit Subway System. The rail line was finished 30 years ago. The system has not been maintained. 

The Pit is huge like this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FleshPitNationalPark/comments/y07sz2/the\_pbso\_visualized\_on\_earths\_surface/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FleshPitNationalPark/comments/y07sz2/the_pbso_visualized_on_earths_surface/)

Music is YouTube ""Liminal Spaces Dark Ambient Music Mix""

Not shown on the map above is the central subway train loop, and the spoke lines that radiate from the GRAND CENTRAL STATION. Basically most junctions have 3 options to choose from for safety/redundancy. In its heyday the subway system took visitors to the parks fabled destinations (in approved areas) like:

‚Ä¢ Walking/Hiking

‚Ä¢ Running Marathons

‚Ä¢ Camping

‚Ä¢ Fishing in the gastric sea and ponds

‚Ä¢ Fluid activities: Go fluid rafting, canoeing, kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, or tubing on the lazy river.

‚Ä¢ Mountain Climbing, Ice Climbing

‚Ä¢ Cave Exploring (spelunking)

‚Ä¢ Soak in amniotic pools, salt water steam baths, ‚Äòmud‚Äô baths. (hint: its not mud)

‚Ä¢ Exotic wildlife watching

‚Ä¢ Ranger-led tours: Take a tour led by a park ranger 

‚Ä¢ Junior Ranger programs: Participate in a Junior Ranger program and earn a badge 

‚Ä¢ Picnicking: Have a picnic (and store food properly so as not to lure predators) 

‚Ä¢ Nature scavenger hunts

‚Ä¢ Animal calls

‚Ä¢ Creature riding

‚Ä¢ Petting zoo

‚Ä¢ Lower Visitors Center ‚Äì Shopping

‚Ä¢ Lower Visitors Center ‚Äì Museum 

‚Ä¢ Lower Visitors Center ‚Äì Dining 

‚Ä¢ Lower Visitors Center ‚Äì Hotel and Convention Center 

‚Ä¢ Lower Visitors Center ‚Äì Concerts and Symposiums 

‚Ä¢ Watch the creature scare crow rodeo at the underground fairgrounds

From the Lower Visitors Center, the Heroes can go NORTH, EAST, or SOUTH via rail. Dice roll says NORTH line works. The Artificer NPC is able to operate a subway light rail car and proceed.

While navigating the Pit, the following Environments/Traps present themselves.

Roll a d 13 to determine damage type

‚Ä¢ (1) Acid. The corrosive spray emanating from glands in cave walls. It‚Äôs kind of like the acid from the movie ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ (2) Bludgeoning. Blunt force from constricting/spasm collapsing cave walls.

‚Ä¢ (3) Cold/Blizzard. Part of the creatures natural cooling system. Like air conditioning in a car. A large blast of -89.2¬∞C (-128.6¬∞F)

‚Ä¢ (4) Fire. Part of the creatures natural heating system. A blast of -360.2¬∞C (-680.5¬∞F). Believed to come from geothermal heat sources.

‚Ä¢ (5) Force or Flood or Windstorm or Sandstorm. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. The PBSO is magical.

‚Ä¢ (6) Lightning. Part of the PBSO‚Äôs nervous system. Like an electric eel. Capable of millions of volts of potential.

‚Ä¢ (7) Necrotic. The PBSO can drain life from visitors. Vampire style.

‚Ä¢ (8) Piercing/Slashing. The PBSO has various cave sections made of diamond hard devouring teeth.

‚Ä¢ (9) Poison/Medicine. The PBSO can release fluids that are natural to it, but have a variety of helpful/harmful effects on visitors.

‚Ä¢ (10) Psychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage. Illusions, deceptions, voices, impressions.

‚Ä¢ (11) Radiant. The PBSO can deal out Radiant energy

‚Ä¢ (12) Thunder. A concussive burst of sound that come from pistol organs. When the PBSO senses foreign movement, it stuns the intruders. 

‚Ä¢ (13) Magnet pulse. Sucks to be a person wearing metal armor or using metal weapons.

Part 1 of subway journey dice roll says minor encounter with HANGING MOSS/CREATURE. The subway is mildly impeded. When the pit was active, debris like this was routinely removed by park staff via a ticketing system. Heroes take a short rest during transit.

Junction 2 dice roll sends the heroes to the GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SWN/comments/1f9j6we/the\_abandoned\_warehouse\_factory\_45\_x\_32\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWN/comments/1f9j6we/the_abandoned_warehouse_factory_45_x_32_details/)

Heroes determine that they simply need to make their way across the map to get on the appropriate tracks. This map is a monster gauntlet. 

Music changes to You tube ""DND Battle Music""

First Monster is a CRIMSON MIST, The 2nd monster is a GHAST OF LENG. While sniping from above, a dice roll says the Hero Arakokra Archer is distracted and attacked by a STORM SPIRIT.

Heroes handily defeat the 3 monsters.

The 4th monster is encountered near the subway car they're heading for.

The monster waiting for them is an amorphous force of nebulous evil energy that is a by-product of the Pit's consciousness. The energy coalesces into a physical creature based on a fear of the players (like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man), but it is determined that the coalesced creature is a large/giant Merman from the movie ""Cabin in the woods"". The stats for this monster are from GOLEM WAR MACHINE.

The heroes make it into a subway car and close the door. The MerMan swings at the door and dents it. The car needs to be moved to another track. It is determined that there is a train office nearby. The Arakokra flys to the office, mashes a button, and fly's back to the subway car as the car is being moved to the appropriate tracks.

The Assassin nerfs the Merman and slows its speed.

The MerMan catches up to the subway car. The Heroes look in horror as the MerMan swings and destroys the door.

Dice Roll says the Artificer NPC is able to ram the throttle and yell LAUNCH (like the rebel alliance officer at the end of the movie ""Rogue One"") 

As the subway speeds away at 60 kph, the MerMan cant hang onto the car and starts running after the Heroes, terrifying style.

Heroes take a short rest during transit.

Random encounter dice roll is NECROTIC. As the subway passes this area, the heroes take necrotic damage.

Dice roll says Heroes proceed at a junction.

Dice roll (1 on a d20) says major bad encounter with (dice roll) Freezing cold. The subway car has hit a frozen section of tunnel. The train derails, heroes take fall damage. Heroes attack the ice blockage. Heroes manage to muscle the car back onto the tracks and proceed on wobbly wheels slowly. 

Heroes make it to the end of the line at the CEO hidden base. The Railway car collapses like the police car in the movie ""Blues Brothers""

Heroes discover an amazon style shipping warehouse with amazon style workers made up of various dnd races.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/m5fboz/ocpotion\_factory\_3\_floors\_battlemap\_40x30fg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/m5fboz/ocpotion_factory_3_floors_battlemap_40x30fg/)

The amazon style workers wear uniforms with back braces. Dice roll says they barely notice the visitors and look around nervously, but keep working to make their quotas. Dice roll says there are no managers/resistance present.

Professor Raven Shadow Walker is horrified and enraged. 10 years ago, CEO Cliche proposed to the board to return to mining/profiting. Raven participated in the environmental impact study. It was determined by teams of top experts, that the continued stress on creatures in the pit, and the pit itself were overwhelming. Approval was denied. CEO Cliche is on the verge of waking up the pit which would be cataclysmic for the entire planet. Rage.

With no resistance, Raven bluffs and pretends to be a tour guide, taking the heroes on a tour. She points out obvious things while the Heroes pretend to nod and point. Heroes discover cases of Ballast Brew, Coke Heart Throb, Vision Bracelets, Various Vita-Salves, and more......

This is just the evidence they're looking for to take to the Board Meeting to shut down CEO Cliche. There are expiration dates on the products. 

Raven bluffs/intimidates the employees and says she needs to collect various cases for sample testing. Cases of product are stowed in a bag of holding. 

Heroes safely traverse level 1 unharmed.

Heroes descend stairs to the assembly line packaging level #2. Raven casts DISGUISE to appear like an amazon warehouse manager. This level is being worked by a tougher crowd. Smells like coffee, cigarettes, and beer. It feels like a Waffle House at 2:00 AM. Heavy metal music plays in the background. Various races, no time clocks, no back braces, no uniforms, tatoos, beards, piercings. Many black concert T-shirts. Black biker vests. Head buffs. 

Oh.....This crowd sees the Heroes right away and knows something is up.......

I do want to buy the cold weather fragrance first though.  
I will just give a small breakdown on what she tested and her thoughts.

*  Ex Nihilo - Lust in Paradise: Liked, probably top 5 or 6.
*  Tiziana Terenzi - Cassiopea: She hated this one the most, said it smelt of a girl she would hate lol.
*  Electimuss - Persephone's patchouli: Liked, she mentioned it smelt more mature though (shes 26), said she can picture Bayonetta wearing it. 
* Electimuss - Vixere: She reaally liked this one, up there with empressa in the top 2.
*  Duchessa - Liked, mentioned she likes sweet fragrances but doesnt want to smell like dessert.
*  Instant Crush - Mancera: She liked it but she said she pitcures it for a younger girl, she did mention she would like it for her sister (shes 15).
*  Bal d'Afrique - Byredo: This one kind of surprised me because i thought she would like it a lot but she said it smelt good but not special.
*  Carioca Heart - Jusbox:  Liked but didnt have much to say about it. 
* The Ghost in the Shell - ELDO: She was intrigued by the scent but dissapointed by the performance.
*  Silky woods - G&B: Liked, also prob top 5.
*  Philosykos EDP - Diptyque: Said she liked it better as a home scent.
*  Orpheon - Diptyque: Said she liked the smell but she associated it with a sad memory. Sadder memory of the fragrance itself which didnt last more than 2 hrs though, dissapointed her.
*  Gris Charnel - BDK: Said it smelt very generic.
*  Portrait of A Lady - Frederic Malle: She liked it, but did mention it gave her a grandma vibe.
*  Ormonde woman - Ormonde Jayne: Liked, prob top 6 as well, but bottom of the top. She said it smelt of a nerdy girl, which is funny because that descriptions suits her. ",1,1732309635.0,fragrance,0,0.67,False

We have this large train table my son no longer is interested in, but he's obsessed with anything construction. My dream is to create a two-piece insert that can be stored under the table if he gets back into trains. My thoughts are as follows:

\- One side has the cliff/ramp. I imagine I would use styrofoam sheets to carve the basic shape. I have no idea where to go from there. I need some kind of material that can create the final detailed shape without weighing it down too much.

\- The other side is just the board with a textured coating on it. I have no idea how to make this textured coating. Initially, I considered spray paint but found that doesn't work well. I then want to create two removable ""trays' that have sides similar to the cliff, but have a rectangular indent in the center that I can add different materials to (sand, dirt, coffee beans, etc) as well as two ""ponds"", one blue and one brown. I first considered resin but figured that would be heavy and expensive. My idea is now to use acrylic sheets that will have the edges unsharpened (my neighbor said he can do this). The idea behind these four pieces is variability and creativity.

  
\- Lastly, I'd like some additional pieces to add to that creativity such as an archway, a ramp, and some large rocks. I was thinking styrofoam or spray foam?

  
I need any advice and ideas you may have. I have never built a model/diorama in my life, however I am very crafty (I've made props/costumes) and believe in my ability to do this for my son. I just don't know what's available. Also, I was going to build the two halves on corrugated plastic boards, possibly gluing a few together. I have no idea what I'm doing.

I usually go 3 or 4 times a week to get coffee from him. And he always gives me the huge discount and I love it. Sometimes I take a girlfriend and she'll get the discount too, and I'm so popularit's great.  

So anyways, I want to go get coffee today and my boyfriend was giving me the stink eye and he was trying to say something and I couldn't hear him and I was in a rush so I said hurry up. I gotta go and then he charged me the full amount. So I said I didn't even bring that so I said what's up? I need the discount and he's like xenay on the discount today and I'm like dude, come on. 

 So I noticed there's a manager over his shoulder and I was like. Are you? Are you the manager?

I‚Äôm currently revising this first chapter, about half-way done with the first draft of this novel. I‚Äôm unsure as to what genre I‚Äôd categorize it (most likely as horror), but it‚Äôs about crime, taking place in an alternate, future Earth.  I'm largely debating on whether or not the novel should start at this cafe scene or fast-forward to the nudist community where the situation is more hectic. Regardless, any general criticism would help immensely.

As for things I‚Äôm looking out for:

1. Is the introduction enough to hook your interest? Can you find any sort of conflict throughout the chapter?
2. Since the chapter is dialogue-heavy, how is the pacing? Do the characters have a distinct ‚Äúvoice?‚Äù
3. Is the prose easy-to-read or flows easily?

I‚Äôm seeking feedback on the Starseeker E55 and Starseeker Edge coffee grinders. Here are the key details I‚Äôve gathered so far:

# Starseeker E55

* **Price**: \~ 230 USD (AliExpress)
* **Power**: 72 W
* **RPM**: 312 RPM
* **Burr Size**: 55 mm
* **Designed for**: Espresso

This grinder seems to be built primarily for espresso, offering more power (72W) and faster RPM (312), which should make it effective for consistent espresso grinding.

# Starseeker Edge

* **Price**: \~ 290 USD (AliExpress)
* **Power**: 55 W
* **RPM**: 220 RPM
* **Burr Size**: 48 mm
* **Designed for**: Espresso and other brew methods

The Edge is a more versatile grinder, suited for both espresso and pour-over methods. It has a sleeker design and looks better built, but with a slightly lower power (55W) and slower RPM (220) compared to the E55.

**Context**:  
I primarily brew **high body, medium roast** coffee on a **Lelit Glenda** (portafilter espresso machine). Currently, I use the **Timemore C3 Pro**, but I‚Äôm considering an upgrade.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the E55 and Edge, especially if you‚Äôve used them with a Lelit espresso machine or similar setups. Appreciate your input!",2,1732309071.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1gxi52f,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1gxi52f/looking_for_hygiene_help/,looking for hygiene help,"Unfortunately, I (18 F) have been struggling with my hygiene for a while now. I find it really embarrassing to talk about, especially considering being at the big age of 18, so I thought I'd consult Reddit in hopes of getting help. I do want to start by saying you guys are allowed to be as critical as you want, I'm not asking for gentle answers. My biggest issue is my shower routine and my dental hygiene. 

I don't like to blame people for my own problems, but my parents never really taught me much about hygiene. I suppose it's not entirely their job, but they only taught me the absolute basics. How to clean myself and my hair, how to brush my teeth, and how to put on deodorant. However, they never taught me anything about how often to shower, how to do skincare, or anything more in-depth about personal hygiene. Anything I've learned in addition to what they taught me I had to teach myself, but I still have more to go.

Currently, I shower and wash my hair every two days. I wash myself with a bar of soap twice using a net sponge (everywhere, of course) and wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner (double shampoo). After I'm done I use aloe vera gel on any shave bumps and moisturize using a scented lotion on my legs, back, and elbows. I use a leave-in conditioner for my hair, put deodorant on, and then do my skincare (which isn't really related and isn't a problem). 

For my dental hygiene, I brush morning and night and that's pretty much it. Sometimes I brush my tongue but only when I remember. My teeth are probably what I'm most embarrassed about when it comes to hygiene because of how little I do for them, and I've struggled with having yellow teeth since middle school. It's gotten better but they're still bothering me. I also have the biggest pet peeve and fear of bad breath, which is really troublesome for me since I tend to be hungry throughout my classes which gives me bad breath. My only combat to this currently is gum and trying to eat snacks between classes. Additionally, I recently purchased a tongue scraper, which I'm hoping will help with the bad breath, and I've been attempting to drink less coffee to reduce staining.

Overall, I'm not too worried about my shower routine, it's mostly about how often I should be showering. I'm going to continue to wash my hair every two days, but should I be washing my body every day? Also, I've been struggling with shave bumps and body acne for a while. They've also gotten better but it's still annoying, so any tips for that would be greatly appreciated!! For my teeth, I'm going to try to get into the habit of using mouthwash and my new tongue scraper, and maybe purchasing a UV teeth whitener thing to help with the staining. A waterpik is also a thought I've had but it's not a priority. 

Any tips are greatly appreciated, and I'm hoping to better my hygiene soon. I've come a long way since middle school but there's still more to do.",3,1732308953.0,hygiene,16,0.67,False

I recently tried out the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds and was quite impressed. These little buds pack a punch when it comes to noise cancellation. I found they blocked out a ton of background noise, making my listening experience much more enjoyable.

The sound quality is crisp and detailed. I noticed a big difference compared to my old earbuds. The battery life is also great - I used them for several days before needing to recharge. The case gives extra battery power too, which is handy for long trips.

https://preview.redd.it/p0mc6fommi2e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ccc83c752fb9024c0f2086c8fafba066ad12c67

I like that these earbuds adjust to my ears and surroundings. The noise cancellation seemed to work better in different places. The app lets you change how they sound too. There are lots of preset options or you can make your own settings.

Phone calls were clear. People could hear me well even when I was outside. The water resistance is nice - I don't worry about a little rain or sweat.

One small issue - it took me a minute to figure out the touch controls. But once I got used to them, they worked fine.

# Bottom Line

The Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds are a solid choice if you want good sound and strong noise cancellation.

They have great battery life and useful features for the price.



# Overview of Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Earbuds

I recently got my hands on the Liberty 4 NC earbuds, and I'm impressed. These little powerhouses pack a punch with their noise cancellation. I found they block out up to 98.5% of outside noise, which is great for busy commutes or noisy offices.

The sound quality is crisp and detailed thanks to the 11mm drivers. I especially like the Hi-Res audio support and LDAC technology. It really brings my music to life.

Battery life is a strong point. I got about 10 hours of use from a single charge, and the case extends that to 50 hours total. That's plenty for long trips or daily use.

The earbuds are easy to use with features like auto-play/pause and quick pairing. They're also water-resistant, so I don't worry about a little rain or sweat.

Call quality is good too. The 6-mic system picked up my voice clearly, even in noisy spots.

# Advanced Noise Cancellation

I was really impressed by the noise cancellation on these earbuds. They cut out up to 98.5% of background noise, which is a huge improvement over other models I've tried. The Adaptive ANC 2.0 feature is pretty cool - it adjusts to your ears and surroundings in real-time. This came in handy when I was on a noisy bus ride. The earbuds have an in-ear sound sensor and a special noise isolation chamber. These work together to create a peaceful listening experience, even in loud places. I found the noise cancellation to be very effective for travel and commuting. It's not perfect, but it does a great job of reducing most ambient sounds.

# High-Resolution Audio Quality

I was blown away by the sound quality of these earbuds. The 11mm dynamic drivers deliver crisp highs and deep bass. Music feels rich and detailed, with good separation between instruments. I noticed nuances in my favorite songs that I hadn't heard before. The sound is well-balanced and not overly bassy like some other earbuds.

While not quite audiophile-level, the audio is impressive for the price. The built-in EQ lets me tweak the sound to my liking. Call quality is also clear on both ends. Overall, I'm very pleased with how these sound for music, podcasts, and phone calls.

# Personalized Sound Experience

I was impressed by how customizable the Liberty 4 NC's audio is. The HearID 2.0 feature analyzed my hearing and created a sound profile just for me. It made a noticeable difference in audio quality. I also liked being able to tweak the EQ settings. There are 22 presets to pick from, or you can adjust it manually. This let me dial in the perfect sound for different genres of music. The 11mm drivers deliver crisp, detailed audio. With LDAC support, I noticed more depth in my favorite tracks compared to standard Bluetooth. While the sound is great, audiophiles may want even more customization options.

# Long-Lasting Battery Life

I was really impressed with how long these earbuds lasted. I got about 9 hours of use with noise canceling on before needing to recharge. The case gives extra juice too, bringing the total up to 50 hours. That's plenty for a week of commuting or a long trip. I liked that I could quickly top up the buds or case with wireless charging. The battery life is a big plus compared to other earbuds I've tried. I didn't have to worry about running out of power during the day.

# User-Friendly Connectivity Features

I found these earbuds super easy to connect and use. They pair quickly with Android devices, which saved me time when setting them up. The auto-play and pause feature is handy - my music stops when I take an earbud out and starts again when I put it back in.

The Bluetooth 5.3 works great. I can walk around my house without losing the connection. Another cool thing is multi-point connection. I can switch between my phone and laptop without having to reconnect each time.

The touch controls are simple to use. I can adjust volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with just a few taps. It took a little practice to get used to them, but now they feel natural.

While the connectivity is mostly great, I did have a few small issues pairing with my Samsung phone at first. But after checking the instructions, I got it sorted out quickly.

# Durability and Comfort

I've put these earbuds through their paces, and I'm impressed. The Liberty 4 NC holds up well to daily use. I've accidentally dropped them a few times with no issues. They're built tough.

Comfort-wise, these earbuds are a dream. I wore them for hours without any pain or irritation. The different ear tip sizes let me find the perfect fit. They stay put during workouts too.

One small gripe - the case is a bit bulky in my pocket. But it's sturdy and protects the buds well. The IPX4 water resistance gives me peace of mind in light rain.

Overall, these earbuds strike a great balance between durability and comfort. They're built to last and feel great in my ears.

# Crystal Clear Calls

I was impressed by the call quality on these earbuds. The 6 beamforming mics and AI algorithm work together to make voices sound clear and natural. Background noise is reduced effectively, so I could chat without shouting or straining to hear. Even in noisy places like coffee shops or on the street, calls came through crisp and intelligible. The mics picked up my voice well without amplifying other sounds around me. For people who take a lot of calls on the go, these earbuds are a solid choice. The clear call feature adds real value for everyday use.

# Pros and Cons

After spending a few weeks with the Liberty 4 NC, I've formed a clear picture of what these earbuds offer. Let's break down the good and not-so-good aspects.

# Pros

* The noise cancellation is impressive. I was surprised by how much outside noise these buds blocked out, even in noisy environments.
* Sound quality is top-notch for the price. The audio is crisp and detailed, with a nice balance across frequencies.
* Battery life is excellent. I've gone days without needing to charge the case.
* The app is user-friendly and offers lots of customization options for sound and controls.
* Wireless charging is a convenient feature I didn't expect at this price point.

# Cons

* The earbud case is on the bulky side. It's not as pocket-friendly as I'd like.
* While the noise cancellation is good, it's not quite on par with premium brands.
* The touch controls can be a bit finicky. I sometimes activated them by accident when adjusting the earbuds.
* Call quality is decent but not outstanding. In windy conditions, callers mentioned some background noise.

I found the Liberty 4 NC to be a solid choice for everyday use. They offer a great mix of features and performance, especially considering their mid-range price. While they're not perfect, the pros outweigh the cons for most users looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds.

# Customer Reviews

I've spent a lot of time using these Liberty 4 NC earbuds, and they're a solid choice. Most buyers seem really happy with them. The sound quality gets a lot of praise - it's clear and balanced, with good bass that's not overdone. People like how easy they are to pair and use. The noise cancellation works well for many users, even in windy conditions. Battery life is impressive at 50 hours total.

Some downsides I noticed in reviews: The case is a bit large for some. A few users had issues with fit or comfort. The noise cancellation, while good, may not be quite as strong as top-end models.

Overall, these earbuds offer great value. They punch above their weight in sound and features for the price. Most users I've seen recommend them, especially if you want quality without breaking the bank.

# Conclusion

I've been thoroughly impressed with the Liberty 4 NC earbuds. They offer great value for the price, with sound quality that rivals more expensive models. The noise cancellation works well in most situations, even on windy bike rides. Battery life is solid at 50 hours total. While the case is a bit bulky, the overall build quality feels premium. Pairing was simple, and the companion app adds useful features. For anyone seeking high-performance wireless earbuds without breaking the bank, these are a top choice I can confidently recommend based on my experience.",1,1732308531.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

1gxhyoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1gxhyoi/our_loneliness_is_killing_us_and_its_only_getting/,Our loneliness is killing us and it's only getting worse,"Let‚Äôs talk about loneliness.

Not the kind of loneliness where you feel a little off for a day. I‚Äôm talking about the kind that creeps into your life slowly. The kind where you realize you‚Äôre seeing your friends less, spending less time with loved ones, and swapping real connection for likes, notifications, and incredibly imbalanced parasocial relationships.¬†

The¬†physical health consequences¬†of poor or insufficient connection include a 29% increased risk of heart disease, a 32% increased risk of stroke, and a 50% increased risk of developing dementia for older adults. Additionally, lacking social connection increases risk of premature death by more than 60%.

And the data from Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs,¬†The Anxious Generation¬†(incredible book) backs it up.¬†

Back in 1980s, nearly half of high school seniors were meeting up with their friends every day. These numbers held fairly constant throughout the next 20 years.

But something dramatic happened towards the end of the 2000s.¬†

2010 marked the moment when smartphones truly took hold. The App Store was in full swing, and social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter were starting to explode. Suddenly, it became easier (and more addictive) to connect online than to make plans in person.

By 2020? That number dropped to just 28% for females and 31% for males. And it‚Äôs not just teens‚Äîacross all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been tanking. We‚Äôre hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it‚Äôs starting to show.

And it‚Äôs not just teens‚Äîacross all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been¬†*tanking*¬†since 2010.¬†

While social media usage is skyrocketing‚Ä¶

We‚Äôre hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it‚Äôs starting to show.

Meanwhile, in¬†Blue Zones‚Äîplaces like Okinawa, Japan, and Sardinia, Italy‚Äîcommunity is everything. These are the places where people live the longest and healthiest lives, and one of their key ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù isn‚Äôt diet or exercise.¬†

It‚Äôs human connection.

**People in these regions spend real, meaningful time with friends, family, and neighbors. And those relationships aren‚Äôt just nice to have‚Äîthey‚Äôre literally saving their lives.**

Let‚Äôs contrast that with what‚Äôs happening here.

Social media promised us connection, but what it really gave us is a substitute. Instead of sitting across from a friend, we‚Äôre staring at a screen. We scroll through highlight reels instead of living our own. And while it feels like connection in the moment, it‚Äôs hollow.

And I don‚Äôt mean to fear-monger, but I can‚Äôt see a world in where this doesn‚Äôt get worse.

Not only are we spending less time with real people, but we‚Äôre starting to replace human relationships altogether.

Platforms like¬†Character.AI¬†are exploding in popularity, with users spending an average of¬†2 hours per day¬†talking to virtual characters.¬†

SocialAI¬†(which is¬†*such*¬†an ironic name because it‚Äôs the most dystopian, anti-social thing I‚Äôve ever seen), allows you to create an entire Twitter-esque social feed where every person you interact with is a bot, there to agree with, argue against, support, love, and troll your every remark.¬†

Think about that: instead of grabbing coffee with a friend or calling a loved one, people are pouring hours into conversations with bots.

These AI bots are designed to ‚Äòsimulate connection‚Äô, offering companionship that feels ‚Äúreal‚Äù without any of the work. They don‚Äôt challenge you, they don‚Äôt misunderstand you, and they‚Äôre always available.¬†

And that‚Äôs the problem. Real relationships take effort. They require vulnerability, compromise, and navigating conflict.¬†

But when your ""relationship"" is powered by an algorithm, it‚Äôs tailored to give you exactly what you want‚Äîno mess, no misunderstandings, and no growth.

If the platform decides to update its system or tweak how the chatbot responds, that ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù changes overnight. Imagine building your emotional world around something that could vanish with a software update.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs already had devastating consequences. Earlier this year, there was a heartbreaking story of a young man who reportedly took his own life after his interactions with¬†Character.Ai, who he had become deeply attached to (both emotionally and romantically), spiraled.¬†

Truly fucked up.

So, what‚Äôs the fix?

**It‚Äôs simpler than you think: prioritize connection. Call a friend. Meet up in person. Join a group, have dinner, or just go for a walk together. If you‚Äôre a parent, let your kids play without micromanaging every interaction. The small stuff‚Äîlaughing over a meal, sharing a story, or just being present‚Äîadds up in ways that matter more than you realize**.

And when you do, pay attention to how it feels.¬†

I promise ‚Äî no amount of likes, comments, shares or AI chatbot connection will be able to truly replicate that.¬†

I've been testing out the AirPods Max lately, and I'm impressed with what Apple has done here. These over-ear headphones pack a punch when it comes to sound quality and features.

The first thing I noticed was how comfortable they are to wear. The memory foam ear cushions create a nice seal, which helps with the noise cancellation. Speaking of which, the active noise cancellation on these is top-notch. I was able to block out most background noise and focus on my music or podcasts.

https://preview.redd.it/33ihrp2dli2e1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80ce11b779da2aba5a9c13b7d93e74ab0f02565e

The sound quality is excellent. I heard details in my favorite songs that I hadn't noticed before. The bass is rich without being overpowering, and the highs are crisp and clear. I also tried out the spatial audio feature, which made movies and TV shows more immersive.

Battery life is solid. I got about 20 hours of use before needing to recharge. The Digital Crown for controls is a nice touch, making it easy to adjust volume or skip tracks.

# Bottom Line

If you're looking for high-quality wireless headphones and you're already in the Apple ecosystem, the AirPods Max are worth considering. They offer great sound, effective noise cancellation, and seamless integration with other Apple devices.



# Overview of Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones

I recently got my hands on the AirPods Max and I'm impressed. These headphones are comfortable and sound great. The noise cancellation is top-notch, blocking out distractions so I can focus on my music. I like how easy they are to use with my iPhone. The battery lasts about 20 hours, which is plenty for my needs.

The AirPods Max aren't perfect though. They're pricey compared to other options. The included case doesn't offer much protection. But the sound quality makes up for it. Voices come through clearly on calls too.

I found the controls simple to use. The digital crown lets me adjust volume and skip tracks easily. Overall, these are solid headphones for Apple users who want great audio.

# Breathtaking Audio Quality

I was blown away by the sound quality of these headphones. The custom-designed drivers deliver rich, detailed audio that made me feel like I was in the recording studio. Bass is deep and punchy without being overwhelming, while mids and highs are crisp and clear. The computational audio technology really shines, adapting the sound in real-time.

I especially enjoyed the Personalized Spatial Audio feature. It creates an immersive 3D soundstage tailored to my ear shape. Listening to movies and music in Dolby Atmos took things to another level - I felt completely surrounded by sound.

The Active Noise Cancellation is top-notch too. It blocked out almost all outside noise, letting me focus on the music. When I needed to hear my surroundings, Transparency mode worked great. Overall, these AirPods Max offer some of the best audio I've experienced in wireless headphones.

# Advanced Active Noise Cancellation

I was blown away by the AirPods Max's noise cancellation. When I turned it on, the world around me faded away. It blocked out most background sounds, letting me focus on my music. I tested it in noisy places like coffee shops and busy streets. It did a great job cutting out low rumbles and constant noises. Higher-pitched sounds still came through a bit, but much quieter. The noise cancellation didn't cause any pressure feeling in my ears. I could wear them comfortably for hours. There's also a transparency mode that lets outside sounds in clearly when needed. Switching between modes is easy with the noise control button. Overall, the ANC on these headphones is top-notch and really enhances the listening experience.

# Transparency Mode

I found the Transparency mode on the AirPods Max to be really useful. With a quick press of the noise control button, I could easily switch from noise cancellation to hearing the world around me. This came in handy when I needed to have a quick chat with someone or listen for announcements without taking the headphones off. The sound quality in this mode was clear and natural, making it feel like I wasn't wearing headphones at all. It's great for staying aware of my surroundings while still enjoying music or podcasts. I appreciated how seamlessly it integrated into my listening experience.

# Personalized Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos

I was blown away by the immersive sound of these headphones. The Personalized Spatial Audio feature adapts to my unique ear shape, creating a custom listening experience. It feels like I'm in the middle of a concert hall or movie theater. Dolby Atmos support takes things up a notch, adding depth and dimension to music and films.

When I played some of my favorite tracks, I noticed subtle details I'd never heard before. Instruments and vocals seemed to float around me in 3D space. The dynamic head tracking is impressive too - as I move my head, the audio adjusts to maintain the illusion of sound coming from fixed points.

While amazing for music and movies, I found the effect less noticeable with podcasts or audiobooks. It also requires compatible content and Apple devices to work fully. But for supported media, it's a game-changer that makes listening much more engaging and fun.

# Pros and Cons

I've spent a good amount of time using the AirPods Max, and I have to say, they've left quite an impression. Here's what I found to be the good and not-so-good aspects of these premium headphones:

# Pros

* Amazing sound quality with Apple's custom driver
* Very effective active noise cancellation
* Comfortable fit with memory foam ear cushions
* Seamless pairing with Apple devices
* High-quality build with premium materials
* Precise controls using the Digital Crown
* Long battery life of up to 20 hours
* Cool features like spatial audio and dynamic head tracking

# Cons

* Very expensive compared to competitors
* Bulky and heavy for some users
* The included Smart Case offers minimal protection
* Limited functionality with non-Apple devices
* No power button - relies on Smart Case for low-power mode
* Can't be used wired when the battery is dead

I was blown away by the audio quality of the AirPods Max. The custom driver Apple designed really delivers rich, clear sound. The noise cancellation is top-notch too - it blocks out a ton of outside noise.

I love how comfortable these are to wear. The memory foam ear cushions create a great seal and the mesh canopy helps distribute the weight. But I can't ignore that they're pretty heavy compared to other wireless headphones I've tried.

The seamless pairing with my iPhone and other Apple gear is super convenient. I just wish they worked as well with non-Apple stuff. The lack of a simple power button is also a bit annoying - you have to use the Smart Case to put them in low-power mode.

While the 20-hour battery life is great, I wish I could use them wired when the battery dies. The Smart Case also feels a bit flimsy for such expensive headphones.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using these AirPods Max for a while now, and I'm impressed with the overall feedback from other users. Many people praise the sound quality and comfort. The noise cancellation is a standout feature that makes a big difference for many listeners. The seamless integration with other Apple devices is a plus for those in the Apple ecosystem.

Some users mention the high price but feel it's worth it for the build quality and expected longevity. A few noted that the case could be better designed. The comfort seems to be great for most, even those with smaller ears who struggle with in-ear options.

While opinions vary, most reviewers seem satisfied with their purchase. The AirPods Max have an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars from over 3,400 reviews, showing strong user satisfaction overall.

# Battery Life and Charging

I've been using these AirPods Max for a while now, and the battery life is pretty solid. I can get about 20 hours of listening time on a single charge, even with noise cancellation on. That's enough for a few days of regular use. When the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge gives me another 1.5 hours of listening time. That's handy when I'm in a rush.

Charging is easy with the Lightning cable. I just plug it in and let it do its thing. One neat feature is the Smart Case. When I put the headphones in there, it puts them in a low-power mode to save battery. It's a nice touch that helps keep them ready to go when I need them.

# Design and Comfort

I was impressed by the AirPods Max's sleek look. The knit-mesh headband felt light on my head. The ear cushions are soft memory foam that sealed around my ears. I could wear these for hours without discomfort. The Digital Crown on the side made it easy to control volume and tracks. The headphones have a solid, premium build. They're a bit heavy, but the weight is well-balanced. The Smart Case is slim for storage, but doesn't offer much protection. Color options are nice - I got the silver, but there are other choices too. Overall, the AirPods Max nail both style and comfort for long listening sessions.

# Ease of Use

I found the AirPods Max super simple to set up and use. They pair instantly with my iPhone - just bring them close and they connect. The digital crown on the ear cup makes it easy to adjust volume and skip tracks. It's smooth and precise. Switching between noise cancelling and transparency modes is quick with just a button press. The auto-pause feature when I take them off is handy too. The only tricky part is remembering which gestures do what, but I got used to it pretty fast. Overall, these headphones are a breeze to use day-to-day.

# Conclusion

I've spent a lot of time with the AirPods Max, and I'm impressed overall. The sound quality is top-notch, with deep bass and clear highs. Noise cancelling works great for blocking out distractions. They're very comfortable to wear for long periods too. The seamless integration with other Apple devices is a big plus for iPhone users. While the price is high, the premium build quality feels worth it. The case design could be better, but it's a minor gripe. For Apple fans wanting high-end wireless headphones, the AirPods Max deliver an excellent listening experience. They've become my go-to headphones for both work and leisure.",1,1732308109.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False
1gxht1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__Nachtschleicher_/comments/1gxht1e/to_a_lover_of_everything_pumpkin/,To a Lover of Everything Pumpkin,"Here I go again...being an idiot.  Watching the dark evening fog crawl out of the creek and envelope this dirt road neighborhood slowly.  And where does my mind drift to, but our mutual taste for the orange stuff.  I couldn't make it a whole month before once again dwelling on you.  Even after the mid-week conversations that left me a mix of comforted and unsettled.

In ramblings before, I foolishly tagged you as a crush.  The limerance is still relevant, I suppose...but realistically I should know I mean nothing to you.  Could I just chalk it up to CPTSD?  Maybe, but that doesn't absolve me of accountability for my own weaknesses.  We did have a moment connecting synopses of our similar struggles, and over this year I've seen your amused smile evolve into a prolonged, genuine grin.  A grin so bright that it nearly cinches your lovely brown eyes closed.  Aside from these things it seems friendly ""strangers"" is a better fit, as things stand.

If ever I made you feel uncomfortable, I'm sorry, and rest assured, I certainly wasn't looking to be interested in anyone.  Against all logic and constructs, you're still living rent free in my head no matter how many times I've tried to evict you.  I hope someday in the future you don't find it invasive if I work-up more small moments of courage to get to know you better.  When will there be another opportunity for conversation beyond surface level?  Of that, I have no idea.  It seems like I never get time to breathe, even when I leave work at work.  

Speaking of not taking work home:  I think you made me fucking blush the other week?!  I had no idea if you were pleading with me or scolding me about my overwork habits, lol.  The way you said my name and told me to stop it.  I was literally at a loss of a comeback, there.  So congratulations, I guess?  You really do throw me for a loop sometimes. 

Just as an example, that past Monday where you had to hit the road...why did you look mad?  Or inconvenienced?  I thought you liked travelling and the ""difficult"" sites.  Perhaps that face was because it fucked-up your routine.  Somewhere along the line I tried brainwashing myself to believe you were happy to get away from a creep like me, but you keep contradicting my assumptions. 

Then again, it wouldn't be the first time nor the last time someone's taken me for all I'm worth.  Hell, you might even be talking about me behind my back and I'm none the wiser.  People talk plenty about me; especially with the days now counting down until I go under the knife.  I hear the comments not whispered quietly enough that I'm not taking this seriously.  I wish it was that easy of an explanation. 

It's too much of an incumberance to others to have to wrap their minds around how the brain learns to shut down emotive responses in times of chronic crisis.  I very much take it seriously.  The gravity of the procedure doesn't escape me, but when you're broken in hard at age 10 to learn first aid, how to avoid Dad's Hep-C blood splatter, how to wake up your Mom when she OD's, how short to keep your nails clipped so you don't cut Grandma's skin, and using your learner's permit to memorize all the best bypass routes to get your dying family members to the tri-county ERs fastest...well...the risk percentage of getting cut up just doesn't phase you anymore.

I digress...deep down, I do want some opportunity to know more about you, now that your hunch proves correct: We are a lot alike.  And it's not even the medical anomaly you seem to be that catches my curiosity.  Everyone in that office is overly preoccupied with how much our bodies are falling apart, lol.  Without question, the complexities that come with the summary you gave me must have influenced a lot in your life, but it's the easygoing facts of you that I want to learn most.  Things like...well, is it music or a podcast you're listening to with those earbuds you wear, or do you just use them as a signal for others to leave you be?  I wonder a lot what music jives with you, as experience has shown me it tells you a lot about a person.

A plethora of topics come to mind that I wish to ask.  Mostly tame ones, but not all.  You've divulged crumbs, but all that has achieved is making me more intrigued.  Are you an odd duck like me and never had anyone teach you to ride a bike?  How far do you indulge the pettiness you poke fun at from time to time?  Or is that a way of goading others to see how far they'll take their own pettiness?  I'm not a very great judge of character...so for all I know, the only reason you've warmed up to me is because, for now, it's advantageous.

That probability has already been noted by another after they overheard me make a case for one of your suggestions.  If I wasn't prone to hear out and bring everyone's suggestions to the table, no matter how ridiculous, I might have been too obvious and called out.  It's a difficult dance I'm trying to learn and not step out of line too far.  So, if getting me to be your mouthpiece was the end goal, then well played, sir.  Just know though I would still like your ideas, regardless if I liked you as a person, or not. 

Whatever your ulterior motives or benign reciprocity, you're hiding a lot more behind those beautiful brown eyes...that much is crystal clear.  It's obvious I'm probably not thinking clearly with everything going on right now; a whole year of this pull towards you is hard to shake.  Deep down I really just want to burrito in a blanket, with a mug of coffee, and stay up all night reading the story of you.

Still...I have to remember my place in all of this.  Some desperate part of me thinks that if I can just meet her...see how happy you two make each other...then I can shut all of these feelings down and finally get back on track with my reality.  If we never, at most, become friends, then it'll be okay eventually.  I feel an ache in my chest at hearing that in my own head, but I can ignore myself and just deal with it.


P. S.: He finally helped clean up the house.  It took about two weeks of pleading, but I think he finally got sick of ignoring it and sick of me asking.  So that's a nice way to end a Friday.",1,1732308064.0,u__Nachtschleicher_,0,1.0,False
1gxhsyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeandtrust/comments/1gxhsyh/first_time_visit_recap_a_great_performance_plus/,First Time Visit Recap - A Great Performance (Plus Rush Tickets),"I went for the first time this week and I was overall very impressed.   Having been to Sleep No More three times I was very excited to come check out Life & Trust.  Admittedly with travel and general NYC nonsense I found myself forgetting about it until friends came to the city and wanted to visit.

**The Rush Tickets**

First, thank you to folks on this subreddit ( u/fig-eater ) who pointed out that there are now rush tickets available on select days with no fees ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeandtrust/comments/1g4jttg/rush_tickets_section_on_the_faq/)).  $80 out the door per person is an amazing value.   They were also fairly easy to secure, they go on sale at 3:30pm sharp inside of Conwell Coffee at the trusted teller (*far left side of the coffee bar*).   The number of tickets is variable based on how much the show has sold thus far, the trusted teller does not know the exact number for each day.  All tickets are for 7:15pm (first entry).

***‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è The section below contains details and spoilers - viewer discretion is advised.*** 

# 

Speaking of the entry, we arrived at 7:15pm sharp.   We were seated at the lenders table (the table names are simply to keep track of when people roughly arrive) - the host even told us things are available to purchase (cocktails, snacks, etc), but that we would be going in very soon, so maybe limit ourselves to a quick shot.   We entered after about 10 minutes of waiting (our group was very eager to go in, so nobody ordered anything).

# Our Route / Loops (High Level)

Post opening scene in old Conwell's office, we lucked out to find Mr. Conwell right in front of us.  I'm very happy I had read the [Life & Trust character reference sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2SbkKaVzxI9Df7CnxQOkJqezVlmmvN8p_U8U0vtrtE/mobilebasic) prior to entering.  I was able to identify him based off him wearing his yellow tie and vest (*the actor was the same as the reference sheet as well*).   Originally I had planned to wander a bit, find a character and latch on, so this was an unexpected surprise.   His loop took us to many amazing scenes mentioned on the subreddit in other recaps, additionally we felt it was great to see the story from his character perspective as everyone I went with agreed that we picked up a lot of the plot from the first loop (my friends did not want me to share my prior research/spoilers, so they were a good litmus test, they did however notice my excitement with discovering Conwell so early and followed along for his entire loop).

When we had the mixing of characters in the grand hall (*not quite a loop break?*) we continued to follow Conwell to see what else we had missed from when we joined and were rewarded with more intense scenes until his loop completed.

After completing Conwell's loop, we had traversed so many floors and spaces, interacted with so many characters that I felt I was ready to try and follow other characters.   I was really interested in following Mephisto for part of his loop and exploring some of the areas we had missed.    I again lucked out by wandering into the house of carnival area / house of mirrors and following two actors (unsure, maybe Emma?) .   They had a gorgeous dance scene on the lake (it's also one of the parts where the crowd is separated from the actors).   I then had a glance of Mephisto and tried to follow - but he entered the stable and went through a false door, and disappeared.  I then latched onto to Con Artist (while they were in their dress) - the scene felt a little slow and I happened to see through the window a huge scene taking place in the bar across the street.  I entered to see Isis handcuffing Sgt. F. Bryant to the table - followed her into a room where she locked the door behind a few of us (half of the group watching the bar scene was left behind).  Isis had a great scene with a small intimate group and started uncovering the dark side of the plot.   We followed her into a room where she shows Stanford Wagner (I think?) his suitcase of cash is worthless, and then into the Orgy scene.    This time in the Orgy scene we were there before the large group following Conwell arrived, leading us to have an even better vantage point and having brief interactions with Isis herself.   I then raced to follow Mephisto, however after running up some stairs behind a crowd, I discovered that I had instead followed an associate (Woland or Aleister) to a medical examination room where he caused chaos on Valentine by swapping his charts before Dr. Kellogg arrived.   We then followed them where we were lead to the mixing of characters in the grand hall for a second time - this time with slight changes to the performance and the addition of the minions.

# The Finale

I was lucky to have been in the center of the room (between the elevated stage & the jail) as I was able to soak in all of the performance.   The finale was wonderful with excellent choreography, slight of hands, tricks, and disappearances to give it a true broadway spectacle feel.   The ending has a lot happening in such a short period of time, but everyone in our group was in awe.

# Thoughts & Comparisons 

I'm content with my choice to do research beforehand (ultimately reading some plot spoilers, figuring out who is who, what's on the different floors, etc).  Life & Trust is on a scale much larger than Sleep No More with an even larger cast.  Rooms and sets are tucked away into every nook and there are many, many things you will not be able to see in a single performance.  Even having run around with Conwell who goes between many floors & hopping around character loops it felt like there was still a lot that I had not seen, looking at the reference guide I realize that I did not see many of these characters or locations.

Touching on some of the sentiment about set design / lighting being visible, I do agree that the set design of Sleep No More is much more intricate and higher quality.   However as mentioned above, the set has a scale that is astounding for a performance, thus some changes are required to make it financially viable.  I did however feel that the new lighting added a lot to the performances - several scenes take clear advantage of advanced lighting capabilities (ie the boxing fight scene).   I do agree it's not as dreamy or magical feeling as Sleep No More, but that usually seems to be the case for the second or third iteration for most things in life.

Carrying into the comparisons between this and Sleep No More, one of the things that stood out is how well the character lines are developed playing into the main narrative / plot.  It felt that regardless of who you followed, their character plays an important part in the story.   Additionally even if you're following a side character, they tend to naturally guide you towards scenes with larger main characters if you wish to switch who you're following.   It also felt more easy to find characters amongst the set - there was never a point where I felt where if I lost a character I would be without someone to latch onto.  In contrast, there are several sections in Sleep No More where a large area is only used once or twice per loop, leading to some frustrating experiences trying to find something to watch.

The public 1:1's are a mixed bag but I find it overall a positive change.  For the group watching, it's nice to have the ability to see them (so many in Sleep No More happened tucked away).  However for the person who is part of the 1:1, it's less intimate as everyone is watching as a group.   It's also worth commenting that the smaller characters in L$T had a lot of audience interactions and dedicated public 1:1's, while the large characters generally did not aside from maybe some eye contact here and there.  That being said I'm sure there are some private Sleep No More style 1:1's if you're in the right place at the right time (*I did not see anyone receive private 1:1's during my loops*).

Overall the performance was incredible and everyone in our group was immensely happy that we went.  I'll likely return (maybe solo) in the near future to follow more characters and discover more of the plot.

# Tips

\- Absolutely try for a rush ticket if you can.   Getting to see this for $80 flat was an absolute treat and makes me want to go back a few times for this price.

\- Ensure that you have 7:15pm entry.   By the time we were in, the first loop had just started.  Going later seems like a last case resort to attend as you'll miss part of the first loop.   The cocktail hour (if you're buying fully priced tickets) sounds appealing too, just to explore more of the set to try and orient yourself.

\- If you want to follow JG Conwell, I'd suggest doing it for the first loop.  When you reach the large ballroom scene (*before his loop resets*), everyone will latch onto him as it's now very clear he's the main character.   The group size following him 2-3x'd in size after that scene and remained this was for the rest of the show.

\- Absolutely wear running shoes and comfortable clothes.   The temperature (it's mentioned here a lot) was great inside - I wore a T-Shirt and some comfortable jogger pants knowing I'd be running around a lot.  It was roughly 45 degrees outside, inside was maybe 70ish.  Seeing a few girls in the audience dressed up wearing high heels was painful to witness (*one girl who was trying to follow JG Conwell kept getting left behind every single time*).

\- The show wraps at 10pm, you'll be out by 10:15pm depending on the coat check line.  Head over to The Dead Rabbit for some drinks / food.  If you're here during the holidays they have a fun Jingle Jangle holiday pop up going on.  (Or pick a bar nearby on Stone St)

# For Next Visit

\- Are you able to follow Mephisto?   It felt that every time I tried to follow he was able to escape through false doors, general trickery, and would migrate into a new scene without any followers.   I thought his character was so interesting to watch in all of the scenes.

\- Next time I go I plan on following characters that don't interact with some of the main Conwell loops.  I felt that it was hard to break away from characters who ultimately took me back to the scenes I had watched during my Conwell loop.  (Ie Isis taking me back to the orgy, the associate / Valentin / Dr. Kellog taking me back to the grand hall dancing scene).

\- I also plan on spending time to poke into some of the more intimate rooms.  Several I had noticed while passing by on a character loop.  These looked like these could yield very fun and intimate scenes.",3,1732308059.0,lifeandtrust,6,1.0,False

The battle finally ended...

I got so excited that I fell to the floor, finally able to sleep without worrying about being unable to wake up tomorrow. But sadly, after just a couple hours, I had to wake up due to the familiar sound of my holopad ringing... Looking at the number, it appeared that my boss was calling.

""... Hello?..."" I managed to mutter through my shackles of exhaustion.

""I LOVE this!"" The Smigli on the screen spoke.

""Huh?..."" I muttered. I couldn't tell whether or not it was the exhaustion or the fact that I just woke up, but I didn't understand what he meant by that.

""The story!"" He said, waving his nubs around. ""The interviews with those Arxur blasted our ratings through the roof! Especially with that metal one! Take a look at these comments from the first livestream you had with him!""

A second screen popped up that I immediately clicked on. It widened until I could properly read the lettering, allowing me to see that it was the feedback from Timofr's interview. It appeared that he was getting a lot of positive feedback!

*""Poor guy. How could anyone as sweet as him be subjected to such torture?!""* Said one person.

*""He may look scary, but he's just a lil' goofy!""* Said another.

*""His life sounds so sad! I just want to give him a hug!""* Said someone else before I decided to stop reading the comments.

""You see?"" My boss spoke again as I clicked off the screen. ""This is a hit! People are really eating these Arxur stories up like their lives depend on it! That's why I'm asking you to stay with the Arxur until further notice.""

My eyes widened. ""But Sir, I-""

""Good luck out there, Cholen."" He interrupted. ""And keep raking in the big bucks!"" He said before signing off of the call.

I let out a deep sigh, though not out of exhaustion, but out of terror. Not only did I have to go through a battle that almost ended my life, but I have to stay with the cannibalistic lizards for the time being!

I put my holopad back in my pack, letting out an exausted groan as I got to my feet and started walking back to rhe main bridge...

Finally getting to the main bridge, the ruckus of the crew celebrating began assaulting my ears. After the battle of Wriss, everyone decided to celebrate the survival of their planet. I saw many Arxur and Yotul partying like it's the last thing they'll ever do. I pushed my way through the crowds, hoping that they were all at least sober *enough* that they wouldn't accidentally step on me without noticing.

I managed to make my way through the crowd until I found who I was looking for: Tiny Tim, along with Hevro, conversing with each other.

Hevro grimaced as he noticed me. ""Damn Cholen! You look like shit!""

""I *feel* like shit..."" I muttered.

Hevro bounded over to a nearby table, filling a cup with a weird, brown liquid before hopping back over, handing the steaming cup to me. ""It's called coffee. It'll help you with waking up.""

I sat down on the floor, straddling the cup in my paws as I stared at the steaming liquid inside. I brought the cup up to my lips, giving it a taste...

It was very hot, but not hot enough to actually hurt me. It had a mildly bitter taste, but filled me with a surge of energy. What is this this heavenly substance?!

I greedily downed the rest of the cup, almost spilling the contents onto my fur. Both Timofr and Hevro looked at me with surprise in their features.

""I have news."" I said with new caffeine-induced vigor. ""My boss has like you're stories so much that he wants me to stay with you even longer...""

Their looks of surprise turned into joy as I told them this. ""IN THAT CASE, GET READY TO BE ON A NEW PLANET, BECAUSE WE WILL BE TOUCHING DOWN ONTO WRISS AS SOON AS THE DAMAGE IS ASSESSED."" Timofr stated.

""... Yay..."" I muttered, obviously unprepared for the journey ahead...

1gxhpwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1gxhpwq/m4f_bad_moon_rising/,[M4F] Bad Moon Rising,"The Northern California Wilderness was a sight to behold at this time of year with the autumn chill just biting on the edges of the flesh offering a chill in the night and pleasant breeze in the afternoon, the rains of winter and late fall having yet to begin. The great forest of Redwoods, Cypress, Conifers and Pines offers a matted collage of reds, oranges, browns, and greens. It was the prime time for camping just pleasant enough to be comfortable in the day, just cold enough to keep the Glampers away in their 5-Star Resorts.

Within these woods so far away from civilization far from traffic, cell phones, the internet, and the Media walked a lone figure amid the trees and wilderness... His tall lean form a dark outline dressed as he was in jeans, boots, a sweater, and backpack as he marched up the rough animal trail through the trees and rocks along the mountain side. The terrain was rough and the trail faint but the man moved with a smooth agility and familiarity of a Mountain Goat along the surface, his keen gaze shifting along the distant, intermediate, and near zone. The animals this deep into the wild were not exactly friendly. Coyotes, Wolves, Snakes, Mountain Lions, and even Bears roamed over these vast forests of Northern California and Oregon.

Few would know that the lone figure so deep and lightly geared was the head of a Multi-Billion Dollar Corporation, and one of the premier Businessmen within the World.... The Famous Patrick James Pierce IV...

Patrick was a complicated man... He was a renowned decadent, hedonistic, playboy. A constant face on TMZ as much as Forbes for his high profile parties, and relationships with the newest hottest starlet of the moment. He was a vocal member of the Civilian Economic Advisory Committee to the Trump Administration and a High Profile associate of the First Family. He had a reputation of a sex crazed, drug fueled, misogynistic frat boy trust fund kid douchebag and a vicious behind the scenes backstabber and snake in the grass predator among the Business Elite... Anything bad you could say about a wealthy white heterosexual American 1%er Patrick was the believed embodiment of.... And yet here he was alone in the wild with no butler, no harem of escorts, no luxury, no drugs, no sex, no rock n roll.... Just a man in the forest 10-miles every which way from anything resembling civilization or humanity.

Every so often.. At least once a year or so Patrick liked to slip away into the wild for a week and totally disconnect from it all. He had always had a passion for nature and was a survivalist by hobby. Going so far as to often in his youth disappear for weeks on end into the wild country and living off the land. Once even going so far as to be declared missing presumed dead when he left for the Dakota Badlands for over 6-weeks with nothing but the clothing he had on and a Bowie knife. The same Bowie knife he carried with him now.... He was front page news for the next week when he reappeared having lost 25 pounds and looked every bit a drifter but he survived and that was what he wanted to prove. He covered over 150-Miles in that time period and lived completely off the land eating rodents, bugs, roots, and carrion but he lived and if he could do it then he felt it was more than safe to do it with a whole pack of supplies on his back, a knife, and hatchet on his hips and a Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan 44 Magnum holstered across his chest for swift draw if a bear or cougar ambushed him.

The path he walked was familiar as he owned the land he was now on, in fact he owned the 100-Square Miles all around them in trust for the State of California under the Pierce Wildlife Preserve moniker. The location he ventured to was known only to him so deep in the wilderness no one would find it. A simple cave and overlooked outcrop that gave him a wide visual expanse of his surroundings, a warm, dry shelter to use, a nearby stream coming out of the mountain itself and therefore naturally filtered and clean drinking water that was fast moving enough to use as a latrine. It has direct lines of access to get to where the game trails were to trap, and there were multiple edible plants that grew along the mountain.... This was his secret sanctuary and he was sure if he ever had to go into hiding no one would find him here, and if they did he could booby trap the trails and make an easy escape.... Patrick always had a plan.

It was nearly dusk when he made it to his base camp. The location looked the same as when he left it over a year ago. Some nesting birds, and a Wasp's nest was closer than he wanted but for the most part all was undisturbed. He had little daylight left so he swiftly set to work filling his pots and canteen with water, unpacking his pack and gathering wood in the dying light. The pile of split wood he had gathered before sat in the back of the cave seasoned now a full year it was dry and would burn well. Just as the sun was setting beyond the horizon and the stars made their appearance in the heavens he had enough wood, and kindling to start his fire. The outcrop of the cave's mouth offered an awning to protect from the wind and rain but was open to let a light breeze through even in the wildest of storms that would take the smoke with it leaving only light and warmth... The fire was kept low enough to not draw bugs or predators to the perimeter but still bring the water in his pot to a boil so he could pour it in his MRE and coffee cup.

The crickets chirped and owls screeched by the time he was fully unpacked, his food was ready, and he was relaxed sitting on the ground looking up to the full moon waxing in the horizon on the rise... A bad moon rising... That means trouble's on its way.

If you enjoyed the prompt message me and lets discuss!

Perhaps we do some Primal (Predator/Prey) vibe?

Maybe mutual survivalists have a lovely time in the wild together after serendipitously finding one another and have their own Naked and Afraid style weekend?

Maybe your lass is an assassin hunting MC, or a criminal in hiding who just so happens to find the one man that has the clout to clear her name?

Imagine a world where you can walk into a convenience store, skip the overpriced snacks, and walk out with Bitcoin instead. Welcome to the age of Bitcoin ATMs‚Äîa magical portal to the decentralized world of digital gold. But wait! There‚Äôs one unsung hero making this futuristic experience seamless, and it‚Äôs none other than our [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Together, they‚Äôre the peanut butter and jelly of crypto convenience.

Let‚Äôs take a fun, wild ride through the universe of Bitcoin ATMs and see how they pair perfectly with our app to make crypto transactions as easy as grabbing your morning coffee.

# What Exactly Is a Bitcoin ATM?

For the uninitiated, Bitcoin ATMs are like traditional ATMs‚Äîbut way cooler. Instead of dispensing cash, they allow you to buy (and sometimes sell) Bitcoin. Think of them as a digital treasure chest in the corner of your local mall or gas station.

With over 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, they‚Äôre popping up faster than new coffee shops. These machines are bringing crypto to the masses, offering instant access without the hassle of signing up for an exchange or waiting for a bank transfer.

# How Do Bitcoin ATMs Work?

The process is simple, but the magic lies in the details. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Approach the ATM:** No secret handshake required‚Äîjust walk up.
2. **Select Your Transaction:** Want to buy or sell Bitcoin? Pick your adventure.
3. **Enter Your Wallet Address:** Here‚Äôs where the magic happens. The ATM needs your Bitcoin address, and the easiest way to share it is via a QR code.
4. **Insert Cash (or Crypto):** Pop in your dollars or confirm your Bitcoin sale.
5. **Receive Your Bitcoin or Cash:** Voil√†! Your transaction is complete.

And guess what makes Step 3 a breeze? That‚Äôs right‚Äîour [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

# QR Codes: The Unsung Heroes of Bitcoin ATMs

If Bitcoin ATMs are the rockstars, QR codes are their trusty roadies. These little squares of black and white hold the key to seamless, error-free transactions. Here‚Äôs why they‚Äôre a game-changer:

1. **Speed and Convenience:** No one wants to type out a 34-character wallet address while a line forms behind them. QR codes let you share your address with a quick scan.
2. **Error-Free Transactions:** One typo in your wallet address, and your Bitcoin could vanish into the crypto abyss. QR codes eliminate that risk.
3. **Universal Compatibility:** Whether you‚Äôre using a smartphone wallet or a hardware wallet, QR codes are the common language of Bitcoin transactions.

Enter our [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), the ultimate tool for generating flawless, scannable QR codes. Whether you‚Äôre a Bitcoin ATM user, a small business owner, or just someone who loves efficiency, our app has your back.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Enhances the ATM Experience

You might be wondering: *Why do I need an app if the Bitcoin ATM already generates a QR code?* Great question! Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Prepping Your Wallet Address:** If you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin, you‚Äôll need to provide your wallet address. With our app, you can generate your QR code in advance and breeze through the transaction.
2. **Selling Bitcoin:** Some ATMs require you to scan a QR code to send Bitcoin for a sale. Our app ensures you have a clean, ready-to-scan QR code every time.
3. **Custom QR Codes for Businesses:** If you‚Äôre a business accepting Bitcoin, our app lets you customize your QR codes with logos and unique designs, giving your payment setup a professional touch.
4. **No More Copy-Paste Drama:** Copying and pasting wallet addresses between apps can feel like defusing a digital bomb. Let the QR code do the heavy lifting!

# Bitcoin ATMs vs. Online Exchanges: Why ATMs Win the Fun Factor

Sure, online exchanges like Coinbase and Binance are great, but do they offer the same thrill as a Bitcoin ATM? Let‚Äôs break it down:

|**Feature**|**Bitcoin ATM**|**Online Exchange**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Speed|Instant|Hours to Days|
|Anonymity|High (cash buys)|Low (requires KYC)|
|Accessibility|Walk-in Convenience|Internet Required|
|Fun Factor|10/10|5/10|

Bitcoin ATMs are the arcade games of the crypto world‚Äîinteractive, intuitive, and downright exciting. And with our [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), you‚Äôre equipped to play like a pro.

# 1. Travel Like a Crypto Pioneer

Forgot to exchange your dollars for euros? No problem! Find a Bitcoin ATM, buy some Bitcoin, and pay with your wallet wherever crypto is accepted. Generate your wallet QR code with our app before your trip for extra convenience.

# 2. Gift Bitcoin Like a Boss

Want to impress your tech-savvy friend? Head to a Bitcoin ATM, buy some Bitcoin, and share your gift via a QR code generated with our app. It‚Äôs the modern-day equivalent of stuffing cash in a birthday card‚Äîonly cooler.

# 3. Set Up a Bitcoin Tip Jar

If you‚Äôre a content creator, artist, or musician, why not set up a Bitcoin tip jar? Use our app to generate a QR code linked to your wallet and display it at events or on social media. Pair this with Bitcoin ATMs to cash out tips on the go.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

Bitcoin ATMs are already evolving. Some are adding features like multi-crypto support, bill payment options, and even integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. As this technology grows, QR codes will remain a cornerstone of the user experience.

Regular fellow filters
Coffee: Sey, Ethiopia Hamasho traditional processed. 
Grind size: 540microns
Brew time 4min 20 seconds 
Bloom temp: 97c 
Pulses: 4 
Time between 23seconds
Ratio: 1:16 

Taste: clear florals coming through with notes of peach and melon and with a creamy finish 

Abaca filters 
Same grind size 
Same recipe  
Time: 3min, 12 seconds 

Taste: more focus on the acidity which was nice. Not as much melon more peach and notes of lemon and florals a bit muted. 

I‚Äôm gonna order some sibarist trapezoid filters and try them out as well but that would mean I‚Äôd have to grind finer.

However, I started dreading SEO and digital work in general. Sitting behind a computer every day is making me - or at least I think it does - more and more angry.

I got into SEO around 4-ish years ago, full-time for almost 2 years. Worked in an agency, now I am a freelancer. Transition was as unstable as you'd expect, but doing OK now.

My clients are all in the US and I am in Europe so I know none of them, or any of my partners, in person.

The feeling of dread has been there for probably 6 or so months. Constant cycles of 2-3 days of good work and then complete opposite, where I dread even waking up to do the work, putting stuff off as much as I can.

Every time I open ChatGPT or an excel sheet I want to break my computer. Content development is something I loathe the most for sure, either for self promotion and finding clients or for those same clients' websites.

I tried going to various coffee shops to socialize a bit, and now I despize that too.

Back pain, which is why I now workout almost daily, but it still doesn't go away. The workout gives a relatively short feeling of satisfaction, and then I remember I am late for this and that.

Any tips? I am having a bit of a hard time putting this to words, but hopefully it makes sense. Would love to hear from more experienced folks about what they'd do. 

Move on? Or just ""stick it out""? Is this just a phase normal in every career?
