If Day 0 is comfortable 

Day 1- Meet at the hotel and play fun games like truth and dare, take a hot tub bath together or maybe jacuzzi, play card game or something alike and get steamy with warm yellow lights around 

If Day 1 is comfortable then

Plan a trip of around 5 days. 

New Day 1 Book a car. Drive to chitwan. On the way mastrubate each other inside the car. Stop nearby jungle or trishuli to have explore some sexuality in the nature, open but hidden from other people than us. Stay at chitwan. Walk around the place, tease each other, make each other horny, have some nice dinner, go to the room and have sex.

Day 2 Wake up in the morning in the same bed or the other. Be playful with each other. Some sexual act but no sex. Have breakfast. Then get ready for role-plays (best friends, teacher-student, neighbor, hotel staff and guest, or any other). Have a role-play maybe wearing the tharu dress or sth. Then watch some tv together or maybe dance or sing loudly. 

Have a stroll around and have some food. Then another game of blindfold or any other. Make each other horny and jealous and have some chocolate by pouring the melted chocolate over other person body. 

Have dinner and relax. 

Day 3 Drive to Palpa. On the way, wear some thin clothes inside and a jacket or sth outside. Then on the way in terai get wet in some flowing water so that the nipples can be seen piercing from the clothes and get in the car and drive and again mastrubate each other throughout the way. Reach palpa , stroll around the place and have dinner. 

Day 4 wear different outfits and practice cosplay and role-plays. Spend time with each other. Explore more things fooling around each other body and teasing each other.

Day 5 Drive to pokhara. Wear Gurung dress and fuck in the dress and have role-plays. Stroll around pokhara. Fool around with each other. Do cycling, drive to nearby jungles to have fun. And relax by the lake. 

Day 6 drive back to kathmandu. 

Also throughout the journey take pictures; of course not together but individually.

1p21s5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p21s5b/i_told_my_bestfriend_shes_not_the_only_one_in_a/,"I told my bestfriend, she’s not the only one in a relationship!","I am 21F using my throwaway account because my friends follow my main one.

So yesterday me and my friends planned to grab a quick snack in our university cafeteria, and one of my friends said she can’t come since she has to grab lunch with her boyfriend. To give some context: we are a trio friend group, and the friend in question (let’s call her X) studied with me in the same school before university, so we share a lot of history. We are also in almost all the same classes. The other girl in the trio (S) doesn’t share many classes with us, so basically me and X are together almost all the time in class.

Six months ago, I met with a major accident which left me in a wheelchair temporarily. I still use the wheelchair for longer commutes, but I’m improving with rehab. Despite everything, we three are good friends. X got into her relationship soon after college began, and from the outside it seems very dysfunctional. Her boyfriend is extremely lazy and makes her carry his bag most of the time, but whatever works for them. We don’t discuss relationships because her relationship always caused strain in our friendship. Also, S just had her breakup, and I’m in a long-distance relationship for 4 years.

Now X is very involved with her boyfriend. She started missing classes, almost stays at his home all day until she has to go home, uses our names as excuses (saying she has college even on Sundays), and goes to his home because he calls her to “study together” — but from what I hear he just sits around watching TV while she studies. Her reasoning is that she loves him so much and feels comfortable with him, but what we see is he’s isolating and controlling her. X used to study really well, but after getting into this relationship her grades dropped and she’s barely passing because she spends all her time writing HIS assignments and recording HIS notes. Even before this, whenever we plan on going out, she says that he may call, so she always cancels.

Yesterday, since I can now walk short distances and my birthday is in 5 days, I thought I could treat both of them to thank them for the emotional support during this hard time. I want to emphasise that I did not ask much help from either of them at all — I arranged my own accommodations, I managed almost everything alone, and in the past 6 months I have probably asked them for help like 2–3 days total. Even when I genuinely needed support, I didn’t depend on them much.  
There was even one time when I asked X to have lunch with me because I couldn’t go to our usual lunch places due to being in a wheelchair and I didn’t want to eat completely alone in the classroom. She usually goes to her boyfriend’s home for lunch, but that day she came, sat with me, and then kept complaining loudly to everyone passing by that “it’s so unfortunate” that she has to sit there and have lunch with me. Mind you, it wasn’t even an isolated place — it was right outside my classroom, and three other classmates (with whom I don’t even talk) were already having their lunch there, so she wasn’t even alone with me. I felt so small and embarrassed.

So when I invited them both to the cafeteria (which is less than a 2-minute walk), she came with S and immediately asked till what time we were planning to stay. I said I don’t know, it depends on how fast the food comes. Then she asked if I would sponsor her boyfriend’s food, for which I declined and said I don’t have enough cash for all four — our café is priced high, even a basic coffee costs triple the normal amount.

She then said okay and told S she would be back in a while. S asked where she was going, and X said she was going with her boyfriend to grab lunch. I replied that this is the first time in 6 months we are actually sitting together for lunch. Even before my accident she always refused saying “my bf may need me.” This was a rare occasion.

She then said, “I’m not going to eat lunch with him, just buy lunch with him and come back,” which sounded stupid. So I said, “He has his own vehicle, he can buy his lunch.” She replied, “This is what we do, we do everything together. You guys would only understand when you both have real relationships.”

That clearly shocked both of us. Mind you, this is her first relationship, she is like the 4th+ girlfriend of her boyfriend, S just had a breakup from a 2+ year relationship, and I am in a 4-year long-distance relationship. So I got mad and said she’s not the only one in a relationship.

She got mad and left. She came back after 30 minutes and I paid for her food anyway, but didn’t engage in any conversation with her. She didn’t apologize.

I don’t want to assume the final price is not really the final price.

There also seems to be a large number of cabin variations, we really just want a balcony and a bit of extra space in the room like a love seat or pair of comfortable chairs for sitting.  We might drink coffee on the balcony or sit and relax for bit in the afternoon or evening.  We are not picky about location as long as the view is unobstructed.  Is there anything I need to look out for?  My plan was to choose the least expensive guaranteed balcony room.

We’ve never sailed on Celebrity and are looking at a couple different trips with different cruise lines, and trying to get to a final price that includes a balcony room, drinks and Wi-Fi is a bit overwhelming.

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

I've been following this subreddit for a while, and like many of you, I was annoyed that international platforms take 5%+ off every creator tip. I wanted to build a native solution for the Indian creator economy that respects the creator's earnings.

The result is Chai4.me, a pure peer-to-peer UPI tip jar.

💡 The Goal: 0% Commission
The core idea was to make the money go directly from the supporter to the creator. This bypasses the need for a payment gateway middleman, which is where 99% of the transaction fee usually comes from.

What I Built:
Zero Commission: No platform fees. Creators keep 100%.

P2P UPI: Instant payment directly to the creator's account.

Clean Creator Page: Simple, fast setup with just a UPI ID.

I need your honest feedback on a major trade-off:
Since it's a direct P2P transfer, the supporter sees the creator's public UPI name during the payment. Is the 0% commission worth this trade-off for creators, or is anonymity more important?

- natural light

I’ve (20M) been a PART TIME drag performer since June (only part time because university, having a job that only lets me work graveyard shifts and a LOT of weekend work) and in the beginning I felt welcomed, the other older queens offered me advice and were mostly kind towards me, but they wouldn’t generate conversation with me, would easily forget my name and I generally felt a little bit snubbed or under appreciated in what was supposed to be a communal, uplifting and accepting space, but I did brush it off and attributed it to me being an unfamiliar face. 

Fast forward a few months and I haven’t had a show since August, nobody‘s told me about multiple upcoming shows, and to top it all off, there has been one person who has not being doing drag for all that long and has been trying to demand that we all have some workplace-esque meeting every month or so to decide how our scene should look. I felt this to be a little strange since many of us were not doing this full time, and I made this clear within the bounds of the group, and a large group of performers supported me and backed me up in saying that it could definitely be less formal; perhaps relinquishing the serious formal nature and opting for a coffee catch up about how we feel the scene is going, which leads me to the main bit of my story:

I asked if we could have casting calls discussed in the main group chat/discord so that everybody would have an equal chance to take part and perform in order to avoid the more popular queens from solely picking favourites and only having the same few people perform at most shows (which I put in more polite terms, instead mainly asking for casting calls to be more open to others), following this conversation (like a week or so later), the top queen in my area (20 something M) made a comment about how “showing up to things increases your likelihood of being casted, don’t sit around on your ass and expect to be called” which felt rather rude and pointed towards me, who was the main advocate for these more public calls. I‘m still quite mad about this, especially since I make the effort to go to shows and talk to people about upcoming events (that I know of, since they announce shows too late for me to take time off work to go to) and potentially being in them, I am also active through social media and try my best to keep engaging with these people, but it’s starting to feel clique-y and like me having a job is preventing me from taking part in a hobby that I used to like.

For the last two years I've had brutal afternoon energy crashes. Around 2pm I'd hit a wall so hard I'd need a nap or I was useless.

I tried everything: Changed my diet (no sugar crashes, eating balanced meals), improved sleep hygiene (sleeping 7 to 8 hours consistently), added B vitamins, got my thyroid checked (levels normal), started exercising regularly.

Nothing worked. Still crashing every afternoon.

Then during my annual physical, my doctor asked: ""Walk me through a typical day. What do you eat and drink?""

Me: ""Coffee in the morning, maybe some tea, water at lunch sometimes, more coffee around 2...""

Her: ""How much actual water are you drinking?""

Me: ""I don't know. Enough?""

She made me track it for a week. Turns out: 30 to 40oz daily max. Most of it coffee or tea (which are mild diuretics).

For my body weight (152lbs) I needed at least 75oz daily.

Started tracking properly using WaterMinder with reminders. Set goal for 80oz. Front loaded mornings (20oz before coffee, another 20oz by 11am).

After 3 weeks:

Afternoon crashes reduced by maybe 70%. Still get tired but it's manageable, not debilitating.

Energy more consistent throughout the day. No dramatic peaks and valleys.

Headaches that I thought were normal? Gone.

Skin looks better as a bonus.

I feel stupid that something so simple made such a difference. I spent months trying complex solutions when the answer was basic hydration.

WaterMinder is nothing special. Just reminders and a progress tracker. But I needed that external accountability. Without it I'd forget to drink for 6 hours straight.

She had her first child last winter, and also occasionally her stepchild comes to stay with her and her husband, so they’re a family of 3-4, that now need to pay for a 2-bed apartment on their own after basically getting a 2 bed for the price of one room in a six bed. Her husband is an Uber driver, she’s a part time massage therapist and can’t go back to work until the kid is school age because daycares here are exorbitant. 

I do not know how to help her because she says she wants help and advice, but whenever I give it, it goes in one ear and out the other, or she gets defensive. But she absolutely qualifies as a member of this sub and I wish she could face it, and actually do literally any corner cutting measure to help herself and her child.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

The kind that shows up on those “top 10 schools in the world” lists. I got in on a full scholarship—my golden ticket out, or so I thought.

But I feel like a fucking ghost here.

My friends drive BMWs and Teslas. They wear designer jackets like it's no big deal. They sip overpriced coffee between classes and casually order food like money is just… background noise. They talk about trips to Switzerland, buying watches, family yachts, goddamn ski trips. I smile. I nod. I laugh sometimes. I’ve gotten good at acting like I belong.

But I don’t.

I ride the bus to class and pray it’s not raining because my only pair of decent shoes leak. I eat the same $2 meals every day and pretend I’m not hungry when everyone goes out to eat. I make excuses—“Oh, I’m tired,” “Got a lot of work,” “Not feeling great.” It’s easier than saying “I can’t afford a burger, man.”

Do you know how humiliating it is to count coins in your dorm while your friends debate where to eat *this* weekend? Or to pretend you're “minimalist” because you literally can’t buy new clothes? I smile through it all, but inside, I’m just… tired.

I don’t even feel human sometimes. Just this hollow thing sitting in rooms I never thought I’d see, surrounded by people who don’t even realize I’m fading. It’s not their fault, I guess. How could they know what it’s like to panic over laundry money while their parents wire them $5,000 for “emergencies”?

I thought getting into this place would change my life. Maybe it did. But no one tells you how lonely it is to finally make it and still feel like you don’t deserve to breathe the same air. Like the universe let you in by mistake.

I don’t even want to go out anymore. I don't want to explain myself. I don’t want pity. I just want to stop feeling like surviving every day is some kind of performance.

It’s hard to admit, but I’m starting to hate the sound of my alarm clock. Because every morning, I wake up, and it all begins again—the pretending, the smiling, the lying. And no matter how well I play the part, I still go to bed hungry, both literally and… something deeper than that.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just needed to feel like someone might see me, even for a second.

I spent the past week going through all the comments across the different subreddits where I shared SQL Case Files. Thanks to everyone who pointed out bugs, confusing levels, strict validation and the popup annoyance. I really appreciate it.

Here is what I have fixed so far:

• SQL errors now show properly so you can see exactly what went wrong
• Validator is more flexible and accepts more correct query variations
• Fixed levels that marked wrong queries as verified or rejected valid ones
• Updated several case descriptions that were unclear or misleading
• Reduced the Buy Me a Coffee popup so it does not repeat constantly
• Alias requirements are less strict so small naming differences do not block progress
• Added cleaner hints and optional thinking steps before showing help
• Added a clear note that the engine is SQLite in the browser and made behaviour more consistent

If you tried it earlier and bounced off because something felt unfair or glitchy, I would love if you tried it again at sqlcasefiles.com. No login and still completely free.

If you have any more feedback, I am listening. I want this to feel smooth, fair and genuinely fun to play.

I know the capsules are sealed and no aluminum traces make it to your body, but I wonder if the grounds ever touch the machine.

Can traces of coffee go out if the capsule onto the machine, the brew, our furniture, etc...?

I’m 27M and I met “my person” (28F) through my best friend—he’s dating her sister. I liked her right away. For about 2 years it was very hot and cold where nothing really happened. She would randomly appear in my life or I’d seek her out, we’d hang out, and then once she realized I liked her, she’d disappear. Later she told me it was because she was having flings and going back to her ex.

Once I finally moved on, she randomly texted me again. She had always breadcrumbed me during those 2 years, but this time she texted first, made plans, we met up, and I felt a shift in energy. Long story short, we entered a hookup/casual relationship, but it quickly turned into her coming over for days, sleeping over, daily contact, and what felt like a “relationship.” I met her parents, she asked if I could fall in love with her, and she kept telling me how great I am. This lasted about 3 months.

Right after her birthday, she received a gift basket from her ex and she showed it to me. I took that as a sign of trust. But very quickly after that, her energy changed. She became distant. She would still come over and text, but there was no more intimacy. She had also just started birth control, so I excused it as hormonal changes.

She went to Hawaii with her family and came back a different person. We hung out a few times over the next week, but she was more distant than ever. I asked if she thought the birth control was messing with her body. She lashed out and basically discarded me—this was literally a day after I lost my job. I was so emotional I begged and cried (I’m not ashamed, she’s my first and I really cared for her). She had no expression. She told me it was final and that we would never see each other again.

She left, and 4 hours later she texted me asking how I was feeling. I went no contact right away. A week later she texted saying she wanted to talk about the breakup. We met for coffee; she came extremely put together, even wearing the jewelry I bought her. She apologized and said she felt horrible about how things ended. But then, to add salt to the wound, she told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship and offered me a FWB situation because she wanted me in her life. She said I was an awesome and fun person, that she still wanted to experience sex and adventures with me, but that she wanted to enjoy her 20s, be free to date for “experiences,” and maybe hook up with others too.

She also told me that after we broke up she went to see her ex—“nothing happened,” according to her, she just “needed soup.” Her sister had already told me that on that same day she asked her too if she could take her to get soup, but her sister couldn’t.

I was hurt, but I said I would try the FWB thing just to keep her in my life. As soon as I got home, though, I texted her that I wasn’t interested in that deal and wished her the best. Then I blocked her on everything so she can’t contact me and so I can heal.

I’d just like to know what you guys think, or if you’ve had similar experiences and how you’re doing now. Thanks for your time.",1,1763640160.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

1p21cz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWisdomJourney/comments/1p21cz9/the_voice_of_creation_lesson_210/,The Voice of Creation (Lesson 210),"https://reddit.com/link/1p21cz9/video/qn8rtnydog0g1/player

Shortly before his death, Carl Sagan, the scientist and popular television host, wrote, “Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.”\[1\]

If King David could have had a cup of coffee with Carl to discuss his hopeless outlook on life, I’m positive David would have handed him a copy of Psalm 19 to challenge his thinking and encourage his heart.

This great psalm illuminates the truth that we are *not* a lonely speck in the cosmic dark. Indeed, creation teaches us about the Creator. In verse 1, we see that *creation reveals the signature of God.* David writes, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims His handiwork.”

In other words, the sun and stars do more than shine; they speak volumes about the glory of the Creator. Imagine how foolish it is today for people to worship the heavens when the heavens are worshiping God\[2\]

By the way, the Hebrew verbs here express continuing action. So, we could translate, “The heavens *keep on declaring* the glory of God, and the sky *keeps on proclaiming* His handiwork.”\[3\]

“His handiwork” is another way of saying, “This is God’s signature.” Like an artist, God has signed His masterpiece. And his art collection is on continuous display. Beloved, as we marvel at the universe, it magnifies the glory of God.

Second, creation not only reveals the signature of God; *creation reveals the wisdom of God* as well. Verse 2 says that creation “day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.”

The word David uses here for “pours out” is typically used for a bubbling spring, and the word for “knowledge” refers to observable data.\[4\] David is saying that creation is constantly bubbling up observable facts about our Creator.

Just look at the complexity of the human body—it has amazing design. At my age, it’s not so amazing, but you get the picture. Study the petals of a flower, a blade of grass, the beauty of a snowflake, the precision of an atom, the nature of gravitation—everything you observe in nature testifies to a wise Creator.\[5\]

Now, of course, this truth has to be suppressed by an unbelieving world. Paul wrote in the book of Romans that the unbelieving world suppresses the truth of creation (Romans 1:18). 

Listen, here is the tragedy of suppressing observable data in this universe: instead of worshiping, you end up worrying and speculating. Instead of worshiping the Creator, you’re left to despairing that you are alone in the cosmic dark—just a speck of dust flying around the Milky Way.

But according to the Word of God, this glorious creation points to a glorious Designer/Creator. The universe is His signature, and the complexity and harmony of nature points to the wisdom of our Creator.

Third, David says *creation reveals the grace of God*. He writes here in verse 3, “There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice \[that of the heavens\] is not heard.”

In other words, there actually *is* a language of creation, but you must have attentive ears and a heart open to listen. Even when the world refuses the obvious, God in His grace just paints another sunset in the sky.

Let me ask you something: If you were God, would you even allow someone who denies you to enjoy a sunset? No, you would probably make sure it was his last one! You see, the grace of God delivers the marvels of His creation to the entire world day after day and night after night.

This is what we call the *general revelation* of creation. We look around and come to the obvious conclusion that there is a Creator nearby, just like looking at the complexity and order of a wristwatch leads you to know there is a watchmaker nearby.

But we still need *special revelation*—that is, the Bible. General revelation informs the world that a Creator exists. Special revelation gives us His name.

In fact, David now changes his reference to God here in Psalm 19. He began the psalm by calling God *El*, a rather generic name for God.\[6\]

But beginning in verse 7, David refers to God as *Yahweh*, Jehovah/Lord. This is the name of the personal, loving God. And David begins to describe for us what God’s special revelation—God’s Word—can do in our personal lives.

He writes in verse 7, “The law of the Lord is perfect.” The law, or Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, is perfect. That means it is complete—it is trustworthy and sufficient for your life and mine.\[7\]

So, what does this perfect law of the Lord *do*? Verse 7 says it revives the soul. This is the same word David uses in Psalm 23 for the Lord restoring his soul. No matter how far you might stray from your Creator, God has given you an inspired map (His word) to bring you back to Him.

David goes on in verse 7 to give another characteristic of God’s Word: “The testimony of the Lord is sure.” This is legal language. Whenever people are called into court, they testify to what they know for sure.

God is testifying here that His Word is “sure.” His Word can get up on the witness stand and testify to its own truthfulness. God’s Word is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

So, what can you expect the truth of God to do in your life today? Well, David answers that it makes “wise the simple.” He is not referring to a simple*ton*—someone who refuses to learn. He’s referring to the simple—someone who is uninformed but *ready* to learn.\[8\]

Over the years, a veteran missionary to Haiti, collected the interesting prayers she heard villagers pray in their village Bible studies as they learned the truths of God’s Word. One of the villagers prayed, “Father, we are all hungry baby birds today; our heart-mouths are wide open, waiting for You to fill us.”\[9\] That, my friend, is a simple but wise prayer.

David adds another thought here about God’s special revelation, the Word of God. He writes in verse 8, “The precepts of the Lord are right.” 

Precepts are those things God commands us to do. They are guiding principles. They are like signs along the highway; you follow them in order to travel safely through life. And what do the Lord’s precepts do for us? David tells us here that they cause our heart to “rejoice.” Not despair but rejoice.

You have a creator God who not only designed you but also delights in you. He loves you enough to have given you a guidebook—a map—through life and then on into heaven, one day.

Now, before we drop anchor on this Wisdom Journey, I wonder if you have somebody like Carl Sagan in your life—someone who denies or perhaps doubts God’s existence and consequently feels hopeless, alone, and obscure in the cosmic darkness of our universe.

Let me encourage you to pray for the right opportunity to invite your friend to read Psalm 19 or listen as you read it. It might just start a conversation that can cause your friend to begin to understand that he or she is not on a speck of dust, alone in the universe, but the result of divine creation, the work of a personal God who has a plan and purpose for your friend’s life.

And while you are at it, don’t forget that God has the same thing for you.

**BLURB:**

God’s revelation in creation is a testimony to all of humanity that He exists, He is all-powerful, and He is the Creator. But that witness is inadequate in itself. This is why He has given us His special revelation in His Word and called us to share this truth with others.

# **TRASH PANDAS — PILOT EPISODE**

### **“OPENING DAY (AGAIN)”**

## **COLD OPEN**

The parking lot of **Trash Pandas** sits under a pink sunrise, quiet, innocent, unsuspecting.

Ree Paladino unlocks the front door, flips the sign to **OPEN**, and half a second later a ceiling tile behind her drops like a bad omen. Dust plumes.

She does not turn around. She does not sigh. She has long since exhausted both instincts.

From the kitchen comes Milo’s panicked yelp.

“REEEEE! One of the fryers is making that sound again!”

A shrill metallic *SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE* rings out, joined by two other fryers trying to harmonize.

Ree:  
“Which one?”

Milo (in existential horror):  
“…all of them.”

Trix kicks open the doors holding a broom like a medieval weapon.

“We have a situation. Zed won’t talk, the walk-in is hissing in a language I don’t recognize, and a suburban raccoon just tried to unionize the patio.”

Ree:  
“Not before coffee.”

A real raccoon scurries across the host stand carrying a mozzarella stick. Daisy, half in the mascot suit already, holds out her hands. Ree hands her the raccoon like it’s a baby she doesn’t want.

Daisy:  
“He’s back. He keeps stealing tips.”

Ree:
“Lost and Found. Again.”

**TITLE CARD: TRASH PANDAS**

# **ACT I**

### **INT. TRASH PANDAS — DINING ROOM — LATER**

Hannigan Boone, manager and ex-mall-cop, stands before the staff holding his laminated binder, *The Boone Protocol*. The staff sits around him, variously interested, hungover, and confused.

Boone clears his throat like a man introducing a TED talk.

“Team. Today is important.”

Trix whispers loudly to Daisy:  
“Is it? Is anything?”

Boone continues, ignoring the slow hemorrhage of morale.

“The regional manager is driving in today. A surprise inspection.”

The room reacts like someone announced a hurricane.

Milo:  
“Why would he do that?”

Boone:  
“Because he hates me.”

Trix:  
“Understandable.”

Boone glares but presses on.  
“So we are operating at **maximum protocol** starting now. Cleanliness. Timeliness. Professionalism.”

A ceiling tile falls.  
Dust clouds.  
A raccoon’s face peers through the opening.

Boone doesn’t blink.  
“*Ignore it.*”

Ree:  
“So we’re doing the usual, then.”

---

### **INT. KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER**

Ree moves through the kitchen with the efficiency of someone who has memorized the location of every disaster.

Milo is arguing with a fryer.

“It’s making the sound on purpose,” he tells her. “It hates me.”

The fryer emits a demonic hiss.

Ree taps a valve. The hiss stops. Milo stares in awe.

“You have power,” he whispers.

“No,” Ree says. “I have experience.”

---

### **INT. DINING ROOM — SERVER STATION**

Trix is rewriting the specials board in increasingly unhinged cursive:

**TODAY'S SPECIAL:**

* Baja Trash Tacos  
* Dumpster Nachos (Don’t ask)  
* The ""Kill Me"" Quesadilla  
* Water (if the tap behaves)

Holler (a new hire from across the street’s rival diner) watches her in concern.  
“Should… should we call them that?”

Trix squints at him.  
“What’s your name again?”

“Holler.”

“Never correct me, Holler.”

He nods, intimidated but also slightly impressed.

---

# **ACT II**

### **INT. BACK LOT — OUTSIDE DUMPSTER**

Ree finds Zed standing silently behind the dumpster, staring into it like it contains an oracle.

“Zed,” she says.

He raises one finger. She waits.  
He lowers the finger.

“Important?” she asks.

Zed shrugs. That’s the closest anyone has ever gotten to communication.

She nods solemnly.  
“Good talk.”

Then she hears thrashing inside the dumpster.

A REAL RACCOON pops out, hissing. It’s the same one Daisy had earlier.

Ree lifts the lid fully.  
Two more raccoons.  
One wearing a child’s baseball cap it definitely stole from a guest.

Ree:  
“…you guys again.”

She puts all three in the designated raccoon crate: a modified milk crate with a sign Trix made that says **TEMPORARY INCARCERATION**.

---

### **INT. DINING ROOM — MIDDAY**

The lunch rush begins.

Families pour in.  
Tourists.  
Locals.  
A group of teens who all look like they dare each other for sport.

Holler takes his first table ever.  
He stands there with a notebook held like a protective charm.

Customer:  
“What’re your recommendations?”

Holler panics.  
“Water is a safe bet.”

Ree swoops in like a lifeguard for drowning employees.  
“Try the Trash Basket Combo,” she says with confidence.
“It’s edible today.”

The table nods appreciatively.

Holler whispers, awestruck:  
“You stabilize the chaos.”

Ree:  
“I contain it. Stabilizing is Milo’s job.”

Cut to: Milo screaming in the kitchen as a small flame leaps up.

Ree:  
“Okay, nobody stabilizes anything.”

---

### **INT. KITCHEN — SIMULTANEOUS**

Boone is pacing, anxiously checking his watch.  
“The regional manager should be here by now—”

Before he finishes, the walk-in freezer door flings open and a *wall* of cold fog rolls out.

Trix steps through it like an Arctic explorer.

“The walk-in,” she announces, “is officially haunted.”

Milo nods solemnly. “Makes sense.”

Boone rubs his temples.  
“Nothing is haunted. Nothing is cursed. It is all under control.”

At that exact moment, a light fixture buzzes, sparks, and goes out.

Trix:  
“Control is a construct.”

# **ACT III**

### **EXT. TRASH PANDAS PARKING LOT — AFTERNOON**

A shiny SUV pulls in.

Boone panics.  
“He’s here.”

The team lines up inside like they’re about to take a class photo: shoulders back, smiles forced.

The regional manager, **Clint Overmeyer**, enters.  
He’s a man of impeccable grooming and terminal judgmental energy.

Clint surveys the restaurant.

A ceiling tile immediately falls beside him.

Clint stares at the tile.  
Then at Boone.  
Then at the staff.

Boone smiles through physical suffering.  
“Happens once a week. Totally normal.”

Clint walks forward.  
He taps a table.  
Checks a menu.  
Watches Daisy try to take photos as Randy the Raccoon while defending a kid from a real raccoon that escaped the crate.

Clint stops.  
“Was that… a wildlife incident?”

Ree, stepping in flawlessly:  
“No sir. That was *immersive theming.*”

Clint raises an eyebrow.  
“…Continue.”

---

### **INT. KITCHEN — INSPECTION**

Clint examines everything with silent precision.

He opens the walk-in freezer.

Inside stands Zed.

Just… standing there.  
Not shivering.  
Not blinking.

Clint:
“…is he part of the theme too?”

Trix, appearing from nowhere:  
“Yes. Cryptid. Chic.”

Clint closes the freezer.  
Very slowly.

---

### **INT. DINING ROOM — INSPECTION CONTINUES**

Clint approaches Milo in the kitchen pass.

Clint:  
“Are these fryers standard issue?”

Milo:  
“They have… personality.”

A fryer emits a gentle moan.

Clint stiffens.  
“Is that a normal sound?”

Milo:  
“Compared to what?”

Clint steps back.

“Boone,” he says. “We need to talk.”

---

# **ACT IV (RESOLUTION)**

### **INT. OFFICE — MOMENTS LATER**

Boone braces for termination.

Clint sits across from him.

“I’ve been to worse restaurants in the region, Boone,” Clint admits.  
“But never one with this much—”  
He gestures helplessly.  
“—life.”

Boone blinks.  
“Is that… good?”

Clint sighs.

“The numbers are stable. The reviews are stable *enough.* You somehow turned a failing location into a cult favorite.”

Boone straightens, shocked and proud.  
“So the verdict is—?”

“You stay open.”

Boone exhales with such relief he nearly passes out.

---

### **INT. DINING ROOM — END OF DAY**

The staff gathers, exhausted but pleased.

Holler:  
“We… actually did it.”

Ree nods.  
“Another peaceful day at Trash Pandas.”

A light fixture explodes behind her.

Milo:  
“Peaceful-ish.”

Trix raises a glass of soda.  
“To surviving the inspection.”

Daisy raises her raccoon crate.  
“And to Randy not biting a child today.”

Boone joins them, smiling for real for the first time.

“This place,” he says, “shouldn’t work. But somehow… it does.”

Ree clinks her glass against his.

“It’s the people.”

A raccoon scurries behind them carrying a salt shaker.

Ree adds:  
“…and the local wildlife.”

**End on the raccoon stealing a french fry off someone’s plate, triumphant.**

**FADE OUT.**

1p21al3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1p21al3/i_thought_this_might_be_helpful_for_the_new/,I thought this might be helpful for the new quitters.,"I quit yesterday afternoon after 20 years smoking. Woke up this morning feeling more energetic which i was sort of shocked. I was expecting to feel better in a few days but not the next day. I know with every good thing there can be a downside so i asked grok... 

""are there any reports of  people quitting smoking that they go through a honeymoon period where they feel really good but then a couple months later it dissipates?"" 

groks answer....

""Yes, this pattern is very commonly reported by people who quit smoking, and it's well-documented both in clinical studies and in quitter communities (like forums, QuitNet, Reddit's r/stopsmoking, etc.). It's often described exactly as you said: a ""honeymoon phase"" followed by a slump a few weeks to a few months later.Here's what typically happens and why:The Honeymoon Period (usually days 3–30, peaking around weeks 2–4)Physical withdrawal symptoms (irritability, cravings, brain fog) have largely subsided.
Lungs start clearing, taste/smell improve dramatically, breathing feels easier.
Huge sense of pride and accomplishment (""I beat the hardest part!"").
Endorphin/dopamine rebound: many ex-smokers report elevated mood, energy, and even mild euphoria.
People often say things like ""I have more energy than I’ve had in years"" or ""I feel high on life.""

This feels amazing — and it’s real.The Post-Honeymoon Slump (usually months 2–4, sometimes longer)After the initial ""pink cloud"" wears off, a lot of quitters hit a wall where:The psychological habit (hand-to-mouth, coffee + cigarette rituals, stress triggers) is still very much there, but the early euphoria is gone.
Dopamine regulation is still recalibrating; the brain has been used to massive nicotine spikes for years, and normal life can suddenly feel flat or boring (""anhedonia"").
Some people experience delayed or prolonged withdrawal symptoms (low mood, irritability, trouble concentrating) that peak around 2–6 months.
Weight gain, lingering cough, or just the grind of permanent lifestyle change can kick in.
This is the stage where many people relapse because they think, ""I feel worse than when I was smoking.""

What research and smoking-cessation experts sayThe phenomenon is sometimes called the ""wall"" (around week 8–16) or ""extinction burst"" in behavioral terms.
Studies on prolonged withdrawal show that depressed mood, anxiety, and poor concentration can persist or even peak months after quitting, especially in heavy/long-term smokers.
Allen Carr’s Easyway and some CBT-based quit programs specifically warn about the 3-month slump.
The UK’s NHS Smokefree service and the American Lung Association both mention that many people feel worse again around 3–6 months and that this is normal.

Bottom lineYes, the honeymoon-then-crash pattern is extremely common — so common that experienced quitters will tell new quitters, ""Just wait for month 3, it gets weird again, don’t smoke over it."" Knowing it’s coming helps a lot of people ride it out. Most report that by 6–12 months the flatness lifts and they genuinely feel better than they ever did while smoking.If you're in that slump right now: you're not broken, your quit isn’t failing, and it does get better again. It just takes longer than the brochures say.""",2,1763639889.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

1p219f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1ooqoxu/aio_for_my_husband_and_i_wanting_to_change_who/,AITA for losing it at my MIL because she tried to gaslight my husband into thinking he was overreacting?,"This is a follow up to a previous post where I (24F) explained about my husband (24M) and I wanting to change our wills due to in-laws’ drųg use. 

We finally received the dreaded call from MIL (51F), after only 3 weeks of no contact 🥴. She called to ask if she could have daughter (2F) next week, as it’s her friend’s son’s birthday. We were in the middle of dinner so husband said he’d call her back later. 

We finished up and my father (50M) watched daughter while we went to a separate room to talk to MIL. The conversation started with husband saying that he wouldn’t be comfortable with her having daughter unsupervised, to which she responded that she understood, no questions asked. 

He started explaining to her that we didn’t appreciate the drųg use when we were over for FIL (60M) birthday and that we knew that she said specifically not to tell us. 

She tried to explain away saying “oh well it’s not something we wanted broadcast to all the guests” and that she figured we “wouldn’t care because she wasn’t responsible for daughter”to which we were able to respond with “why mention us by name then rather than just saying ‘don’t tell anyone’” 

She eventually confessed, saying that she didn’t want us to know because “we’d judge them” and that they didn’t want any “big reactions from us”. 

She continued on talking in loops, making out that husband was being selfish because what did we expect when going to a party, that clearly we had the problem because we were invited to their house, they could do what they wanted in their house and they were able to make “adult decisions” such as using drųgs. 

Yes, we have no issue with them doing what they wanted in their house. The issue is that they did it then tried to hide it when they knew other people wouldn’t be okay with it. We don’t want to be around it and we don’t want our daughter around it, and she knew that. They also didn’t portray it as a “party” it was advertised as a “Sunday lunch celebration” otherwise we might’ve been more skeptical going in. 

She started talking about my grandmother who’s an alcoholic, saying that we’re fine with daughter being around her (which we’re actually not, I’ve seen her maybe 3 times since Christmas 2023 for this reason but that’s a whole other problem). She then went on to say that we shouldn’t worry about it, if we’re such prudes, she’ll steer clear of anything questionable or addictive, she started by mentioning wine but then doubled down saying “oh wait, coffee has caffeine, caffeine is addictive, better steer clear of that too”

I could see she was really starting to upset husband and make him second guess as to whether we were overreacting so this might be the part where I’m an AH. If I feel like someone is threatening me or someone in my family I can really loose my sh*t, and that’s exactly what happened. 

I started with “WTF is wrong with you? WTAF is wrong with you that you think this is okay? This is disgusting behaviour and you know it. You would never let any of your kids at 2 years old around someone who was high, you would’ve lost your sh*t, so why would you do that to your granddaughter and then expect us to be fine with it?”

I was beyond furious at this point so I was screaming in to the phone. I think she was a little taken aback by my presence because she thought husband was alone. She responded with, “I’m not gonna respond to yelling”. I went to another room to cool off for a bit before I went back to listen again. 

She was saying about how FIL wanted to do the drųgs as a 60th birthday present to himself and that “it may be hard to hear when you’re in your 20s, but it’s not about you”. Cool, we don’t care what they do in their own time, again, we don’t want our daughter around it, and she knew that. If that’s what he wanted to do, by all means, go ahead, we’d see him another time.

She then started to go on about how she loves daughter and that she wished she could see her more (we’re always the ones trying, she’s always busy partying), and then proceeded to talk about paying for daughter’s swim classes. At that point I butted in again to say, “Okay thanks, you no longer need to worry about that as it’s not going to be a point you can manipulate.” She then tried to backtrack after I said that, and said she was just meaning that she cares. 

The call continued with her trying to make excuses and manipulate husband into thinking that we were wrong for our reaction. When I’d jump in, she’d make comments about my being too involved, what did she actually expect? This is my family we were talking about, my very conflicted husband and my 2 year old daughter! She tried talking about how upsetting it was that we’d reacted like this but “oh don’t feel guilty” which I think was an attempt at reverse psychology. I just reiterated that we didn’t feel guilty, we were acting in the best interest of our daughter. 

She finished by saying that what we want to do is our decision, and that what she does won’t affect anything of what we think of her. She was effectively trying to say that we’re the ones with the problem, not her, to try to make us feel guilty. She’s obviously never heard the expression “Actions speak louder than words”. 

I called her out, saying that her behaviour on the call had been manipulative and absolutely disgusting and husband said something to the tune of him not recognising her anymore, said goodbye and hung up. 

Husband was understandably distraught afterwards, he’s a very passive person and he was waiting until she called to say something to her about the drųg use. I was telling him how to word his responses to her while they were talking but he’d just let her cut him off which is probably another reason I jumped in, cause she just kept talking over him and not letting him speak. 

This has been kind of playing on my mind as I’m not a really an angry person, I try to be kind and considerate, so when I do lose my sh*t, it tends to stick with me. I did talk with husband and apologised for butting in but he thanked me for backing him up. So AITA for calling out MIL on her bull?",1,1763639782.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

1p216db,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1p216db/how_to_deal_with_waiting_for_our_manifestations/,How To Deal With WAITING For Our Manifestations To Occur (Delay-Fatigue),"So let's talk about the delay fatigue.

You know what I mean. You are there doing a technique. This can be visualization or affirmations or whatever you use. You have your desired reality in mind.

But there is a time delay.

You have been doing this for months. Even if you are doing it for a long time there is still a delay. And you are just simply tired. You are exhausted from doing the technique and trying to manifest your desires.

Let's shed some light on why this happens and how you can handle it.

**1. What are you actually doing?**

Let's get down to the basics real quick. Why do we use a technique?

A technique is used to access higher states. That is it.

We have been conditioned to be in a lower state for a long time. You simply can't decide to be happy if you are sad or feel secure if you have been insecure about money for years. Well you can but it takes practice.

Techniques essentially make it easy for you to access a higher state.

But here is where you are messing up. You are doing the technique for the sake of doing it.

This comes from the belief that the **technique creates your reality.**

Stop. This is plain wrong.

**Frequency creates your reality.**

To put it simply your emotional state creates your reality. The technique is just a tool to help you get there. If you are doing affirmations for hours but you are not accessing the feeling or the state then how the hell do you think you will manifest anything?

**2. The Waiting Game**

Delay fatigue only happens if you are not satisfied within.

The most fundamental rule is that **you can only have what you already have.**

If you want to get rich you need to be rich within. If you don't feel rich within then how would you get rich in the physical reality?

If you are doing the technique just to change the 3D you are waiting. You are checking.

If you are waiting and checking that means you are not in the state. You are not fulfilled.

If you were actually fulfilled within you wouldn't care about seeing the external reality change. And ironically that attitude of not caring is what brings your desires into the external reality.

**3. You are not consistent**

This is the second reason and it is way more basic than you think.

You are not consistent with your practice.

Imagine you have faced years or decades of programming. You are tired of being in lack. You pick a technique. You do it for a day. You access the higher state. You feel good.

But then the next day comes.

You forget to do the technique. You forget your practice.

And guess what happens? You get programmed back to your old frequency.

The world is programming you every single day. You meet the same people and go to the same places. If you don't program yourself the moment you wake up the world will program it for you.

Think of it like filling a container with pebbles. Your old reality is a container full of pebbles. Your new reality is an empty container.

Every time you do your practice and maintain that high frequency you add a pebble to the new reality. The more consistent you are the more the old reality fades away.

But if you stop for a week the old programming takes over again. You lose your progress.

You need to make this new frequency your new baseline.

**4. The ""Big vs Small"" Trap**

You have a hidden belief that is ruining you.

You believe that **manifestation takes time.** You believe that **big things are hard to manifest.**

Stop falling into this duality.

There is no such thing as easy or hard or big or small. That is an illusion. From the perspective of the universe a cup of coffee is the same as a million dollars.

Manifestation is always instant.

The moment you decide to have a desire it is already done in the mental plane.

If you think ""Why hasn't it appeared?"" you are telling yourself it takes time. You are proving your own limiting belief true.

Instead simply say to yourself ""It is already done.""

Be grateful for it. Thank the universe.

Once you feel fully grateful that you already have the desire that is when it materializes.

**The Recap**

So to remove your delay fatigue:

* **Prioritize the state.** Do not prioritize the technique. The technique is just a tool.
* **Be consistent.** Do not let the world program you back to your old self.
* **Fix your beliefs.** Manifestation is instant and all desires are easy.

It is that simple. Stop overcomplicating it and stop waiting.

You are doing it right. Just persist.",6,1763639490.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

# **Dad vs. The Apocalypse**

---  

## **I. 7:12 PM**

In the quiet suburb of West Fairlawn—where nothing more threatening than an overgrown hydrangea had ever menaced human life—the Anders family lounged on a collapsing sectional sofa, watching a very old, very pixelated Blu-ray of *Terminator 2*.

It was Dad’s choice.  
Dad always chose “movies with lessons.”

“See, kids?” he said, gesturing at the screen, where Linda Hamilton racked a shotgun one-handed. “This is what preparedness looks like.”

Mom didn’t look up from her tablet. “Preparedness would be making sure the trash is taken out before pickup day.”

Dad rubbed his temple. The kids giggled.  
Life was simple. Predictable.  
Then the living room wall *ignited in white light*.

A sphere appeared—shimmering like a broken soap bubble trying very hard to pretend it was an interdimensional portal. A metallic silhouette stepped through it, steam hissing off its chest plates.

It scanned the room with hydraulic precision.

“Human family unit,” it intoned. “You are in violation of Temporal Directive 47. Comply with evacuation protocol. Failure to—”

Mom shot upright.  
“**Shoes off, mister!** We don’t walk into houses with shoes on!”

The robot paused.  
A soft whirring indicated it had never processed this instruction before.

Dad, meanwhile, grabbed the only object he considered remotely defensive:  
the broom leaning against the wall.

“Alright,” he said, voice cracking. “State your business or… face the sweeper, buddy.”

The robot cocked its head.

Then scanned him.

> **THREAT LEVEL: MILD DISAPPOINTMENT**

The teen daughter, Sarah, filmed the entire exchange on her phone.

“Do the line!” she chirped. “Say the thing! Like in the movie—‘Come with me if you want to live.’”

The robot’s eyes flickered.

“Come with me if you want to—you know what? Why isn't this working?”

She nodded approvingly. “Slay.”

The twelve-year-old, Milo, however, took the situation deeply seriously.

“Dad,” he whispered urgently, “that’s a Series-9 Auto-Ops Enforcer. Weak spots include the heat vent on—”

“Milo,” Dad said, “not now, son.”

The robot recalibrated.

“Compliance window: five minutes until lethal protocol.”

Mom hurriedly reached for her emergency binder.
(Color-coded. Laminated. Tabs.)

“Okay, everyone, if we’re evacuating, we need our backpacks. Shoes by the door. Water bottles topped. Milo, you’re in charge of the clipboards. Sarah, stop live-streaming the murder robot.”

“I’m not streaming,” she said. “I’m educating my followers.”

The robot scanned her.

> **THREAT LEVEL: STATISTICALLY MEDIUM**

---  

## **II. The Future Soldier Arrives, and It Only Gets Worse**

The window on the left *shattered inward* as a human in chromed tactical armor rolled into the room, hitting the floor hard.

He sprang up—kinda—and barked:

“Everyone down! That thing’s here to kill you all!”

The robot stiffened.  
The soldier pointed at it.

“You! Back away from the civilians!”

Dad raised his broom protectively.

“Sir,” Dad said, “we’re handling this.”

The soldier blinked. “Handling? That’s a military-grade killing—”

Mom cut in. “Take off your shoes, buster. It’s hardwood.”

The soldier stared at her.  
Then at his boots.  
Then at the carnage outside.

“I traveled three hundred years to save your lives.”

“Well,” Mom said, “that doesn’t mean you get to track mud into this house.”

Sarah revolved her phone toward him.  
“Helmet off. For the audience.”

“I am *not* doing content right now.”

Milo tugged on his arm.  
“Yo. What level is your armor? Do you get passive buffs? Is that real plasma or cosmetic?”

The soldier nearly screamed.

“Why is everyone in this timeline like this?”

The robot advanced.  
A thrum of charging circuits filled the room.

The soldier pulled Dad aside.

“Sir, you need to evacuate your family immediately.”

Dad nodded gravely.  
“Yes. Right after we find my keys.”

“They’re on the coffee table,” Mom said.  
“You always leave them on the coffee table.”  
“Well, they're not there, Diane!”  
“They *always* were before, Rick.”

The robot raised an arm.
A killing beam lit in its palm.

“Final warning.”

---  

## **III. The Unexpected End of the World**

Mom reached into her binder, pulled out a clipboard, and thrust it at the robot.

“Before you murder anyone,” she said sternly,  
“I need you to fill out this sign-in sheet.  
You can’t just… *do things* without logging them.”

The robot froze.

Its internal processors whirred.

> **UNEXPECTED OBJECT: PAPERWORK**  
> **UNCLASSIFIED THREAT**  
> **OVERLAPPING CONFLICT: ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLETION REQUIRED**  
> **SYSTEM LOGIC FAILURE**

Its eyes flickered.  
Its joints locked.  
The killing beam sputtered out.

Then:

**BOOM.**  
The robot collapsed like a folding chair.

The future soldier stared, dumbstruck.

“You defeated a Series-9 Enforcer with… red tape.”

Mom shrugged.  
“Everyone has a weak spot.”

Dad exhaled deeply.

“Preparedness, kid.”

She patted his shoulder.  
“Sweetie, you didn’t have to do a thing.”

He nodded.  
“I know. What do we do about that?”

---  

## **IV. Epilogue: 7:29 PM**

The family returned to their movie.  
The future soldier sat in the corner, helmet in hands,   reevaluating his purpose in the universe.

The robot’s smoking corpse leaked coolant onto the rug.

Dad looked at it and asked:

“Should we… deal with that?”

Mom didn’t look up.

“No.  
We’ll handle it this weekend.”

1p20xnl,https://i.redd.it/ciim0e9n4e2g1.png,Got lucky and found a job 1 month after being fired here is my job search experience feedback,"For context, the company I was working for (Video Game Industry) is healthy, currently hitting record-high revenue and stock prices. Despite this, I was let go, though I did receive a solid severance package to waive any claims against them.

The good news: I managed to secure an offer for my next position (also in gaming) within **one month** of being let go. This was largely thanks to my network and a referral.

Here are my top takeaways from the process:

1. Make your CV ""ATS Friendly""

Make it easy for the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) to parse your data.

* **Format:** Stick to a single-column layout.
* **Structure:** Summary -> Experience -> Skills/Tools.
* **Length:** Keep it to one page if possible.

1. Quality Over Quantity (Tailor Every CV)

This is controversial advice because it is time-consuming, but the data speaks for itself. I spent an average of 2 hours adapting my CV for each specific job position to highlight the experience relevant to that role.

* **The Result:** I managed to get **1 interview for every 4 applications** sent (cold applications without a referral). In this market, that is a massive success rate. It was worth the effort



2. Do NOT use AI for your Summary

Recruiters can smell ChatGPT from a mile away. All AI-generated summaries sound the same: ""Highly motivated and impact-driven individual...""

If your CV gets past the ATS, a human will eventually read it. make sure they remember you.

* **Tip:** Write it yourself. Share personal anecdotes, state exactly what motivates you, and clearly define what you want to achieve in your career.

You can use AI for your experiences section, but make sure to review it again and adapt it further.



3. The ""Warm Intro"" Strategy

Reach out to your network. Look on LinkedIn to see if former colleagues or friends know anyone at your target company.

* **The Ask:** Don't just ask for a job in a very frontal way. Ask them to introduce you to a specific employee or hiring manager to share experience.
* **The Method:** Ask for a ""virtual coffee"" chat to speak about the industry and their experience and only then, that you are interested in the role.

1. Networking Events: Give Value First

Go to industry events near you. When you speak to people, share your craft and knowledge.

* **Don't** say straight away that you are looking for a job.
* **Do:** Show you have value to offer. Trade your information and experience for their time. You want to be ""top of mind"" when they eventually look to hire someone.

Bonus Tip: The ""Generalist"" Advantage

This is specific to my role, but applicable elsewhere: Try to broaden your experience.

I am a Data Analyst at heart, but I have worked in many different teams (Marketing, CRM, Finance, Accounting, Product). This allowed me to apply for a wide variety of roles, rather than being pigeonholed into just ""Finance Analyst"" positions for example.",9,1763638694.0,UKJobs,15,0.85,False
1p20wid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1p20wid/following_procedure/,Following Procedure,"The sky was a flat, iron grey over the River Thames, and a bitter wind whipped along the embankment. I was on my lunch break, enjoying the crisp air, when I heard the unmistakable sound of spluttering and frantic splashing. I peered over the stone wall and saw a man struggling in the churning, olive-brown water. As his head tipped back, I recognized the gasping, panicked face of Piers Morgan.

My own heart hammered in my chest. I’ve never learned to swim; jumping in would have been a death sentence for us both. My eyes scanned the area and landed on a polished brass plaque affixed to the railing. Its engraved letters were clear and authoritative: 'In an emergency, contact the Emergency Services.'  

I am, if nothing else, a man who believes in following procedure.

I immediately set off at a brisk walk, which soon turned into a jog. The first shop, a trendy café, sold nothing but coffee and pastries. The second was a souvenir stall overflowing with plastic Beefeaters and ""I Heart London"" t-shirts. I was growing desperate. Finally, I spotted the holy grail: a tiny, old-fashioned stationer’s shop tucked down a side street, its windows filled with leather-bound diaries and expensive fountain pens.

The bell above the door chimed as I entered. ""I need to write a letter,"" I announced, slightly out of breath. The shopkeeper, an elderly man with spectacles perched on his nose, merely nodded.

I spent a good five minutes selecting the right materials, a sheet of heavy, cream-laid paper and a matching envelope. I debated between first and second-class stamps, ultimately opting for the latter; this was an emergency, but there was no need to be frivolous.

Finding a quiet bench, I unscrewed my pen. The writing had to be legible and professional. I began:

""To the Emergency Services,

I wish to report a drowning in progress. The individual in question is Mr. Piers Morgan, a broadcaster. His current location is the River Thames, approximately fifty yards east of the Southbank Lion. He has been there for approximately forty-five minutes and appears to be in significant distress.""

I signed it, ""A Concerned Citizen,"" sealed the envelope, and dropped it into a red postbox with a satisfying clunk. The entire process, from spotting the sign to mailing the letter, had taken just over an hour.

Hey everyone! I'm u/Tsuron88, founding moderator of r/microworkouts.

**What are microworkouts?** Short bursts of exercise (1-3 minutes) that fit into your actual life. No gym. No sweat. No changing clothes. Just movement that compounds over time.

Think: 20 squats while your coffee brews. A plank during a work call. Push-ups between meetings. The kind of fitness that works for busy people, lazy people, and people who just don't want to make exercise their personality.

**What to Post**

* Your microworkout routines and what actually works
* Questions about form, habits, or getting started
* Progress pics/stories (30 days of 3-minute workouts counts!)
* Science and articles about short-duration exercise
* Creative ways you've snuck movement into your day
* Struggles, setbacks, and real talk about consistency

**Community Vibe** No gatekeeping. No ""you should just go to the gym"" energy. We're here because traditional fitness advice doesn't work for everyone. This is for thegeeks, the busy parents, the ADHD brains, the people who read Atomic Habits and actually want to apply it.

Friendly, evidence-based when possible, and honest about what's hard.

**How to Get Started**

1. Introduce yourself below - what brings you to microworkouts?
2. Share your first (or current) microworkout routine
3. Know someone who'd vibe with this? Invite them
4. Want to help moderate? DM me

If so, do you find yourself stressed out because you can’t memorize such a vast quantity of information in such a short time?

As a grad student, **it’s imperative to develop effective time management and study techniques to help you retain the most information**. In grad school, cramming the night before doesn’t cut it anymore. Learn a new strategy and try some of these tips for how to study effectively.

# Set the Stage

https://preview.redd.it/jqzbpee4ee2g1.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=61388292c18094f6be9b77e845f1d8e6c84e864f

Before you experiment with any of the different studying methods we discuss, create the conditions in your body and external environment to learn and retain information. Here are some pre-studying techniques worth trying:

* **Get a good night’s sleep:** A 2019 study found a positive relationship between students’ grades and how much sleep they’re getting. 
* However, this doesn’t only mean getting eight hours of sleep before a big test. What matters even more is getting enough sleep for several nights before you do most of your studying.
* **Switch up your study environment:** This might not seem like a promising strategy for how to study effectively, but studies show that switching up your environment can increase recall performance. Instead of studying at home every day, try checking out a new coffee spot each week or heading to your local library. A change in scenery can be one of the best study methods to improve your memory and concentration levels.
* **Stick with an environment that works:** If you have a good study space at home or a café that is reliably productive, it makes sense to stick with this when you are under pressure.
* **Listen to calming music:** You can listen to any music you like, but many agree that tuning into classical, instrumental and lo-fi beats is one of the best ways to study and can help you pay attention to the task. Songs with lyrics can be distracting.
* **Eliminate distractions:** Silence your phone and annoying background noises such as the TV or radio. Make a pact to avoid checking social media until the end of your study session.
* **Snack on smart food:** Coffee and candy will give you a temporary boost, but then you’ll have a blood sugar crash. For energy that is more focused and sustainable, try healthy snacks such as edamame, apples or nuts.

# 10 Study Methods & Tips That Actually Work

# 1. The SQ3R Studying Technique

The SQ3R method can be one of the best studying techniques to help students identify key facts and retain information within their textbook. **SQ3R (or SQRRR) is an acronym that stands for the five steps of the reading comprehension process.** Try this process for a more efficient and effective study session:

* **Survey:** Instead of reading the entire book, start by skimming the first chapter and taking notes on headings, subheadings, images or other standout features like charts.
* **Question:** Formulate questions around the chapter’s content, such as: What is this chapter about? What do I already know about this subject?
* **Read:** Begin reading the chapter and look for answers to the questions you formulated.
* **Recite:** After reading a section, summarize in your own words what you just read. Try recalling and identifying major points and answering questions from the second step.
* **Review:** Once you have finished the chapter, review the material to fully understand it. Quiz yourself on the questions you created and re-read any portions you need to.

You can try these study techniques for college before taking your final exam.

# 2. Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is a studying technique based on remembering at a later time. **Recalling an answer to a question improves learning more than looking for the answer in your textbook.** Remembering and writing down the answer to a flashcard is more effective than thinking you know the answer and flipping the card over early.

If you practice retrieval, you are more likely to remember the information later. Below are some ways for how to study effectively by integrating the retrieval process into your routine.

* **Utilize practice tests:** Use practice tests or questions to quiz yourself without looking at your book or notes.
* **Craft unique questions:** Be your teacher and create questions you think would be on a test. If you’re in a study group, encourage others to do the same and trade questions.
* **Use flashcards:** Create flashcards, but practice your retrieval technique. Instead of flipping a card over prematurely, write the answer down and check.

# 3. Spaced Practice

Spaced practice, or distributed practice is one of the best ways to study complex material. **It encourages students to study over an extended period instead of cramming the night before.** When our brains almost forget something, they work harder to recall that information. Spacing out your studying allows your mind to make connections between ideas and build upon the knowledge that can be easily recalled later.

To try this study technique, review your material in spaced intervals similar to the schedule below:

* **Day 1:** Learn the material in class.
* **Day 2:** Revisit and review.
* **Day 3:** Revisit and review.
* **After one week:** Revisit and review.
* **After two weeks:** Revisit and review.

When figuring out how to study effectively, It’s important to start planning early. At the beginning of each semester, schedule time each day to study and review the material. Even if your exams are months away, this will help you hold yourself accountable.

# 4. The PQ4R Method

Similar to the SQ3R method, PQ4R is an acronym that stands for the six steps in the process. It’s one of the best study methods because it takes an active approach to learning. By implementing it, you can improve memorization and understanding of a topic.

* **Preview:** Preview the information before you start reading to get an idea of the subject. Skim the material and read only the headers, subheadings, and highlighted text.
* **Question:** Ask yourself questions related to the topic, such as: What do I expect to learn? What do I already know about this topic?
* **Read:** Read the information one section at a time and try to identify answers to your questions.
* **Reflect:** Did you answer all of your questions? If not, go back and see if you can find the answer.
* **Recite:** In your own words, speak or write down a summary of the information you just read.
* Review: **Look over the material again and answer any remaining questions.**

# 5. The Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique is one of the more effective study techniques of learning a concept quickly by explaining it in plain and simple terms. It’s based on the idea, **“If you want to understand something well, try to explain it simply.”** What that means is, by attempting to explain a concept in our own words, we are likely to understand it a lot faster.

**How it works:** 

* Set the Stage: Write the subject or concept you are studying at the top of a sheet of paper and jot down everything you know about it
* ELI5: Then, explain it in your own words as if you were teaching someone without a basic understanding of it.
* Assess & Study: Review what you wrote and identify areas where you were wrong. Then, go back to your notes or reading material and figure out the correct answer.
* Organize, Convey & Review: Lastly, if there are any areas in your writing where you used technical terms or complex language, go back and rewrite these sections in simpler terms for someone who doesn’t have the educational background you have. Review your new understanding of the subject.

# 6. Leitner System

The Leitner System is one of the best study techniques based on flashcards. Ideally, keep your cards in several boxes to track when to study each set. Every card starts in Box 1. If you get a card right, move it to the next box. If you get a card wrong, move it down a box or keep it in Box 1 (if it’s already there).

Each box determines how much you will study each set of cards, similar to the following schedule:

* **Every day:** Box 1
* **Every two days:** Box 2
* **Every four days:** Box 3
* **Every nine days:** Box 4
* **Every 14 days:** Box 5

# 7. Color-Coded Notes

Messy notes can make it hard to recall the critical points of a lecture. Writing in color is one of the best study methods because it’s a dynamic way to organize new information. It also helps you review and prioritize the most important ideas.

A 2019 study found that color can improve a person’s memory performance. That same study found that warm colors (red and yellow) “can create a learning environment that is positive and motivating that can help learners not only to have a positive perception toward the content but also to engage and interact more with the learning materials.” It also reported that warmer colors “increase attention and elicit excitement and information.”

Writing in color may seem like a no-brainer, but keep these tips for how to study effectively in mind:

* **Write down key points in red.**
* **Highlight important information in yellow.**
* **Organize topics by color.**
* **Don’t color everything—just the key information.**

# 8. Mind Mapping

If you’re a visual learner, try mind mapping. It’s one of the most effective study techniques because it allows you to visually organize information in a diagram. First, you write a word in the center of a blank page. From there, you write main ideas and keywords and connect them directly to the central concept. Other related ideas will continue to branch out.

The structure of a mind map is related to how our brains store and retrieve information. Mind mapping your notes instead of just writing them down can improve your reading comprehension. It’s one of the best studying techniques for enabling you to see the big picture by communicating the hierarchy and relationships between concepts and ideas.

**So, how do you do it?**

* Grab a blank sheet of paper or use an online tool and write your study topic in the center, such as “child development.”
* Connect one of your main ideas (i.e., a chapter of your book or notes) to the main topic, such as “developmental stages.”
* Connect sub-branches of supporting ideas to your main branch. This is the association of ideas. For example, “Sensorimotor,” “Preoperational,” “Concrete operational,” and “Formal operational.”
* TIP: Use different colors for each branch and draw pictures if it helps.

# 9. Exercise Before Studying

Exercise fights fatigue and can increase energy levels. If you’re struggling with how to study effectively, consider adding an exercise routine to your day. It doesn’t have to be a full hour at the gym. It can be a 20-minute workout at home or a brisk walk around your neighborhood. Anything to get your heart rate pumping. Exercising before you study:

* Kickstarts brain function and can help improve memory and cognitive performance.
* Releases endorphins, which can improve your mood and reduce stress levels.

# 10. Study Before Bed

Sleep is crucial for brain function, memory formation, and learning. **Studying before you sleep, whether it is reviewing flashcards or notes, can help improve recall.** According to Scott Cairney, a researcher from the University of York in the United Kingdom:

>

When you’re asleep, the brain organizes your memories. Instead of pulling an all-nighter, study a few hours before bed and review the information in the morning.

**No one wants to spend more time studying than they need to.** Learning effective study techniques for graduate school can ensure you are fully prepared for your exams and will help curve any looming test anxiety. Hopefully, with the techniques above, you can avoid cramming the night before and make your study time more effective.

## On Family: ""Unconditional Love""

What does Family mean to you? For me... family means passing love forward, honoring those who loved you, making the world better. That's why this sections title is the simplest way I can explain why family is so foundational for me. I say family, but I don't just mean the little ankle biters, nor even just some biological imperative in loneliness, but *Love*. Whom by grace had such love for me, and in turn, I hope you had as well. Love is something precious in this life. It needs to live on.

What does Children mean to you? I want to teach our children about the virtues. To teach philosophy, and art, and choosing love when the world wants hate, to do so with practicality. I want to be present for bedtime stories and scraped knees, first words and hard questions. For ""why is the sky blue?"" and ""what do I do when I'm sad?"". For the beautiful moments *and* the exhausting stages; the 3am fevers, the terrible twos, the teenager tears. Even the moments when nothing is sexy or poetic, but hard, uncompromising... I'll show up anyway, with experience. Whether I'm the breadwinner or the house husband doesn't matter. What matters is being consistently and honestly present, especially in those young, early years when little minds are learning what love looks like by watching how we treat each other and them. I can't expect I'll be a perfect father, but while I draw breath, I'll do my darnedest to be a present one. An honest one. One who teaches by example.

I want bookshelves full of stories, and The Harvard Classics on the shelf (or virtual equivalent). The curiosity encouraged and the imagination well fed. That's the legacy I want us to build...not just genes, but values. Not just a family tree, but a living tradition of thoughtfulness and care. **Teaching them not** what **to think, but** *how* **to think. To teach them the skills and principles to be the compass that always shows them home.**

**To be clear:** This doesn't mean immediately! *[gestures vaguely at everything]* We need a home that feels safe, love that feels steady, trust that's been tested and proven true. The foundation matters more than the timeline, ever mindful.

## The Physical Realities (Or: The Practical Stuff We Need to Address)

We're now getting to parts which restates and fills out some of the details mentioned in the ""Essential Overview - TL;DR"". Just, FYI.

...having said that...

Look, I wish compatibility was just about minds clicking and hearts recognizing each other across a crowded (chat) room. And don't get me wrong, such things are foundational. But there are physical realities that need to be addressed, and... just the nature of all of this means I'm reducing you to measurements when you're so much more than that. I hate it, it's bullshit. That ain't my vibe. But, spade is a spade and I'm a 6'X"" (over 183 cm) man who eventually wants kids. A partnership that isn't just emotional, but ergonomic. So then...

######**The Practical Truth: Height, Age, and Health**

At my height, I need someone at least around 5'7"" (170 cm), maybe 5'6"" or so if our chemistry is just *that* good. This isn't just some preference, it's physics. This addresses real ergonomic challenges and medical considerations for pregnancy. Plus, hon... our embrace (hugs/kissing) shouldn't require a step-stool, you standing on tiptoes until your calves ache (though I'd wager some of you would be thrilled for such). I want to be able to wrap my arms around you, rest my chin on your head, pull you close without creating an risk of smothering you every single time (though I'd wager... nevermind). As I mentioned in the overview, think big embracing, wrapped, almost cradling hugs. If you want loving arms around ya hon', I got 'chu! I know this requirement eliminates many, especially here, but it's just the reality of the body I grew (and grew... *and grew*...) into.

I'm seeking a women around 27-42. My own age makes things... curious, for me. Oh young me, the things you did not know! And as each year passes, the window of things I'd hoped for narrows. Every year that passes is one less year to teach bedtime stories, to answer ""why?"" questions, to watch little ones grow, to give that unconditional love... as mentioned, to live life with someone. It's one less year of ""an amount"" of energy for chasing toddlers and staying up through teething nights (you'll sleep, I got this). Time feels... heavier now. It all weighs on me. And ultimately, biology has the final say when family building is the goal. This isn't about youth for youth's sake (or experience, if older), and I often say ""age doesn't matter"". But, it does here. It's about whether our bodies can do what is needed to provide for the future.

Furthermore, since creating and raising tiny humans is... well, it's *work*... Health is a HUGE deal. Please know here first that I hold myself to this same standard. I eat my vegetables (most of them, anyway), I don't drink my calories, and I take care of this tall frame. Not with perfection, but with intention. And I need a partner who approaches her own health the same way: with care, with intention, with the understanding that taking care of ourselves *is* how we take care of each other and the little ones we hope to grow. Being present for decades of parenting, by powers willing.

At the end of it all, this part isn't just a man asking about looks (that's later), but talking about whether our bodies can do what our hearts want. And then, after we've built our family? Fulfilled that calling? If there's anything left... heh heh heh, we can travel the world, enjoy our loving silence, and yes... fuck like rabbits, if that's our vibe. Or simply rest in what we've created together.

## Who I Am: ""The Sentinel Stands Silent at the Gate""

I'm not offering photos, so let me paint you a picture with words.

**Physically:** Up close, I'm known for what is an apparently intense eye contact... which does not mean aggressive, but... present. I've been told it's like I can see into people. That my eyes pierce through the veil. Some find it endearing, others unnerving. And I can't really do anything about that interpretation so... *shrug*.

Otherwise? Very tall, bald, bearded with hints of ginger, sun-reddened skin (very Gaelic that) which shows I've actually lived in this body for a while... life has left its marks. I'm not a chiseled model, but I'm not bad on the eyes either. More like... like they do in fact stack shit that high! Ha ha! I'm easy enough on the eyes if you can find my good side! I carry myself with intention and dress well in what I can afford. A mild dad bump, it's not spare tire... I'd be SO mad at myself, and apparently I've got a great ass (according the gay man who asked me out), and I think that means I can still rock jeans. :D

**Guardian Masculinity:** Mine is a very old-fashioned kind of strength, sans the singularness go-it-alone flaw of those days. I'm very straight-edge, rooted in discipline, and protective without being possessive. I'm strong through restraint rather than guttural display, gentleness as an act of power. Devoted, patient, unconditionally giving provided basics are confidently met. Practical. Not ""alpha male"" performance noise, which is just exhausting and empty, but something older, quieter, deeper. It's... discipline as a form of love. *""The sentinel standing at the gate.""* Something it seems the modern world just doesn't have language for anymore, lost in that ""manliness"" trap. I know expressing feelings, even if tears, are not a weakness. It is just a part of being human. ...I am not afraid of my humanity.

**What Attracts Me:** Inhabited Femininity. None of that ""Trad""-wife acting nonsense, but *elegance* with substance over form. Self-aware in a femininity lived, with movement and grace... poise, tact, class. Cultivating where I protect. Soft, yet precise. I appreciate how a body moves; women who inhabit their bodies confidently, who can dance, who have flow, who move with intention. Grounded power that doesn't need to prove itself, strength that's graceful. Warmth and wit given freely, not extracted through needs. And yes, the neurons are activated and attracted to physical markers of health and fertility among the curves, hips, and dips... of course they are, I'm a human male. But as long as you're healthy? It's about how you *inhabit* your own body, that's what catches my eye. The rest is just... bonus points for fun. YOU ROCK IT GURL! It's something it seems the world just doesn't have enough *respect* for. But I know it when I see it.

But flesh and bone are just the vessel. Let's talk about what makes it **all** move... that sexy, sexy brain.

######**Sapiosexual (This Is Foundational):**

 >adjective: of, relating to, or characterized by sexual or romantic attraction to highly intelligent people

Intelligence is foundational and non-negotiable. But here's something I need to admit up front: I don't actually know how to describe what I'm looking for. Not fully. Because I haven't personally found it yet. *Felt* it yet. I can't say ""here's exactly what intellectual compatibility looks like"" because I'm still waiting to discover it. That said, I am capable enough that I can infer among the gaps in my experiences. Point at the shape of the absence and hope you recognize yourself in it.

So then... let's start with what I do know.

While I do have some classical education and degrees, most of my knowing has been built through self-education among a hunger for understanding. Fun for me has been learning all the everything my brain can manage, and even, at times, things it cannot... my curiosity doesn't quit, even when I hit the edges of what I can comprehend. I think it's why I'm so free-thought, that and all the love I at one point knew.

In turn, this means I need someone whom I can actually *talk* to in those moments, when I want conversation. Someone who can meet me there without too much preamble. I need your presence of mind to feel attraction. What does that look like? The actual experience of being *matched* in that? Of having someone meet me there without translation required? Well, here's the theoretical for me:

It's about being curious about WHY things are the way they are. It's in how someone thinks about everyday things, not just in their ability to discuss topics of abstract and compounding complexity. It's a; I show you something I love, and you get why I love it without my having to explain. You see what I see. Maybe you notice things I didn't... which, oh... that's a buzz. The conversation builds instead of just existing. Because that's less about specific topics and more about how your brain processes the world.

It's not about being able to ""debate"" philosophy on command. I'm not sitting around waiting to argue about Nietzsche over coffee...honestly, that sounds elitist, exhausting and performative.

What I'm looking for is something more fundamental... **oh shit**... it's about *how* your brain moves through the world! I THINK I JUST NOTICED A PATTERN!

So... if you have a PhD, don't get me wrong, that's FLIPPN' BADASS! But intelligence isn't credentials... it's curiosity that doesn't quit, humility before what we don't know, and the ability to hold complexity without collapsing it into easy answers... but able to make the complex, simple. All this spoken among a voice without a word. It's the ability to hold silence as conversation, to understand what's unspoken, and recognize.

If you don't value intellectual connection as I do, we won't work. Even *if* you can activate some of those neurons with breeding material.

---

## The Communication Reality

I won't pretend my communication style is easy. 

I'm naturally silent. Day-to-day, I'm contented in my own company, but present when it matters. When I speak? Oft it is forthright, direct, honest... and sometimes quite silly, ""mad"" even, as I'm someone who's self-aware enough to laugh at my very own intensity. I read body language better than words, so even in silence, volumes pass between us. Even so though, as I'm wildly introverted, my limits among standard sociability have ended connections before, and I understand why. I can seem very... cold.

But if you value depth over frequency, if you understand that silence doesn't mean disinterest... then maybe this works? If you need daily texts and constant validation, we won't work, and that's completely valid, we're just looking for different things. For the right person, in a knowing companionship, the silence speaks. If you can measure connection by quality rather than quantity, I'm worth the patience.

---

## The Vision & Longing

**It's a Tuesday morning,** just another day among our little world. Sunlight streams through the curtains all golden and warm. I kiss your cheek as you're waking up, still soft and sleepy and lovely. Maybe I've made breakfast, no fanfare, just because. You or I, we head to work with a smile that lingers. Maybe a ""Have a nice day, dear"", or maybe not... all that lingers being said.

Evening comes... you're deep in your reading, while I'm working on some 3D art project, lounge/chill music playing low. Not talking, just... *being*. The kind of comfortable silence that feels like the sweetest conversation, where our presence is all the company needed. We each just... our hobbies, our creations. Every so often you share something funny you read, or I show you what I'm creating, or one of us just looks up and catches the other's eye. Smiles for absolutely no reason except that we're happy.

Sometimes I'll just... appear behind you. Wrap my big arms around your waist, around you, chin resting on your head, swaying about to whatever music is playing. Maybe I sneak a kiss on your neck... make that chill run down your spine. Or you'll wander over and lean against me, ""whatcha doing?"" even through you can clearly see what I'm doing. And I'll kiss the top of your head or lean into you and murmur ""you know"" with a smile in my voice.

Because you *do* know. That's the magic of it.

We make dinner together, when we can, dancing around each other in the kitchen like we've choreographed it a thousand times. Or... maybe we just forget dinner and casually dance the night away. In it all we just... behold together without needing to fill the space. No checkboxes. No goalposts. No games.

Our home is full of that quiet, warm kind of love; the kind that doesn't need constant words because it's *everywhere*. It's soaked into your skin, and breathed in the air, like music heard though the soul. We don't need constant validation because we *know* without knowing. Where ""I love you"" is in breakfast, remembering how you take your coffee. In me remembering you hate doing dishes so I do them without asking. In you leaving little notes tucked in places you know I'll find them. In the way we move around each other like a dance we've been practicing our whole lives without knowing. By seeing you happy, compounded by my own.

""I love you"" lives in every small gesture, every remembered preference, every moment of showing up. Where the mundane becomes sacred because we're for each other, doing it together is no longer simply a literal thing only. It's the mind that understands, the heart made warm, and every simple thing suddenly greater in complexity than any word can behold.

Whoever finds me? That person compatible among my senses? My... shade of strange? Of right, of pragmatic true. Well, that person finally gets a space to stop pretending, to let their secrets breathe, and whispers shout. No more performing for an audience that doesn't understand the play. No more shrinking yourself to fit spaces too small for who you actually are.

With me, your depth isn't ""too much""; it's *exactly right*. Your complexity doesn't need translation. Your profound thoughts don't need apologies or dumbing down. You can be wholly, completely, unapologetically *you*, and I'll just... appreciate every bit of it. Like watching flowers bloom in their own time, in their own way, perfect exactly as they are. Where intelligence is required, not intimidation. I'm offering the end of loneliness, provided you can match my own.

...

I swear... I really am, honestly, rather old-fashioned in the somehow which I move through the world. This quite ""old soul"". Ever see *Pride and Prejudice* (2005)? Though I watch it just for the enjoyment of people speaking with intelligence and intention... maybe I can be your Mr. Darcy? Maybe I can love you, *most ardently*.

# Reality Check

I can't know how it will be between us. I don't know if this beautiful picture can last, as I certainly know it's not the every day... would be nice. Some days we'll be tired, annoyed, disconnected. Some days you'll want space and I'll want closeness, or vice versa. And that's not even factoring in the chaos of kids yet. Life is messy. Relationships are unpredictable. But my heart is here, as is the story of my true speech. My heart hopes for you. My heart wrote this for you, this foundation I've spent so many words describing... because I can do nothing more. For now.

To most people, I probably seem quiet. Reserved. Distant. ""Selectively profound."" I don't waste energy on social scripts that feel empty. Those filler conversations; ""Hey how are you"" ""fine how are you"" ""fine thanks"". You know, the ones where nobody actually answers? Sometimes I just want to reply to ""So how are you?"" with a ""FUCK if I know! I was here yesterday, I went home, I microwaved a lasagna, went to bed, now I'm back... what do you want from me?""

But that Tuesday morning I described? That's different. The person most people see is not that Tuesday version... but it lives in my heart. Someone can draw it out of me. Maybe you.

## My Dumb Taste (Just a Taste.)

Such necessity for mental eloquence does not mean I'm all carriages and candles! Though I am a quality snob in hopefully the best sense: I pursue craft over content, and can sense when something's made with love versus phoned in. I seek experiences built to last, atmospheric depth over stimulation. Artists first, marketers second. To *be* somewhere, not just consume content. If it's among my vibe and created with competence and care, I'm there.

######**Music (Non-Negotiable):**

Music is architecture, emotion made tangible. Progressive trance/house, synthwave, classical, lounge, lo-fi. Röyksopp, Yoko Kanno, Armin van Buuren. I need to know you can groove to what I play, that you'll dance with me in the dark, that the soundtrack of our life resonates for both of us. If you know, you *know*.

######**Video Games (Art in Interactive Form):**

I'm not the gamer I used to be. I will, I think it is quite fair to say, ALWAYS love video games. VIDEO GAMES, done well, ARE most definitely ART! But yeah, my try-hard days are over. I'm just-about exclusively single-player or co-op now, just experiences worth having. Stories told through play.  Halo series, Mass Effect trilogy, KOTOR 1 & 2, Dishonored 2, Prey (2017), Skyrim, Jade Empire, Splinter Cell, a few of the Deus Ex games... with plenty plenty more in a true list.

Recently I [just finished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/1mt7oyl/cyberpunk_2077_my_nomads_journey/) Cyberpunk 2077 and was genuinely moved by its [themes](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/1mxl8k3/meta_recognition_of_the_social_aspect_in/) about identity and connection. Fantastic Game.

######**TV/Movies (Craft That Trusts Its Audience):**

I don't watch much TV anymore, so it's more movies from me... and I'm picky. I love stories told with historical accuracy, when able. ***No horror***; life has plenty already. I want art that elevates: Ghost In the Shell, Samurai Champloo, DC Animated Universe, Avatar: The Last Airbender, 1917, Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut, Master & Commander, pre-Disney Star Wars. If it's made with vision and care, show me.

Hunt for Red October - Master & Commander - ""Spider-Verse"" Spider Man (VISUAL FEAST that!) - WALL-E - The Matrix - D&D:Honor Among Thieves - Pacific Rim - Kubo - Dredd - Mask of Zorro - Casablanca - Bourne Triogy - Star Trek:TNG - HBO John Adams - Cranford - and the First Two Seasons of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" with Jeremy Brett!

...

One more thing... I also have 3D art skills I'm working to regain. Long Story that.

These don't have to be your passions, but understanding why they matter and my eye for them not only helps you understand *me*, but if and how by what manner we'll know our fun.

---

Last Minute Addendum: I just realized I forgot to mention this, but I'm not re-writing all of this just to fit it in... so now it's here. I'm fine with most pets, provided they aren't dumb as dirt, destroy the house, or sentient clouds that molt on everything. Currently, I prefer cats over dogs. 1 or 2 pets at most. ...ok, now for the secret weapon. BAhahahaha!

## Contact: If You Want to Reach Out

If you've made it here, you've done something rare: you read. That tells me about your patience, your willingness to sit with complexity.

**Introduce yourself.** Tell me who you are and why you think we might work. Not what you want to know about me -you've got all this and more- but what you are about? Tell me about *you*. Start with: ""I came across your full post from r/r4r, and [your authentic reaction]..."" Make it yours. Make it you.

**Critical: Do not just copy and paste AI.** I'm here to meet YOU. If your message sounds like ChatGPT, I won't respond. Lead with authenticity. Your account must be 30+ days old or you will not be able to PM me.

**One more thing:** Reddit is my only social media. I know that's a ""Red Flag"" for some, but I'm old enough to have seen the enshittification long coming and avoided it. I called it in High School; ""And we won't even feel the flames until it's long too late."" I won't immediately jump to other platforms, as we'll need to build trust first, establish this is real. When comfortable, we'll discuss secure options for deeper connection. But that comes after, not before.

Not because I fear what's outside, but because I know what I'm protecting. And... maybe I'm getting a little too real writing this, but after decades building myself... built for protection and presence. Built in reserve and virtues, in waiting. I who've silently breathed through each profoundly lonely breath, while being centered in my paradoxically content sovereignty. My dear, when I finally find you, oh... when I finally know you... it is of my dreams that every touch will be deliberate, every moment sacred. Not because I'm trying to be romantic (hopefully, I won't have to ""try""), but because I've waited so long that I can't help but treat it like the miracle it is. I've missed you for so long, and I still don't yet even know who you are. The warmth I've held so long has been waiting. Not for just anyone.

Perhaps for you.

(cont.)...    
Love first in mind, in pattern seen,    
In words unspoken, space between.    
But lust will follow, make no mistake,    
Hands that study, mouths that ache.    

For when the shields at last fall down,    
When sentinel yields his careful crown,    
The warmth so long held tight within    
Becomes the fire that pulls you in.    

Two become one in flesh and being,    
Each making other, finally seeing.    
Her pleasure first, his sacred vow,    
To learn her body's language, now.    

And from that union, love and lust,    
Built on patience, sealed in trust,    
Comes the third, the precious one:    
New life begun, what was, what's done.    

The love I've known shall live anew,    
In child we make, in all we do.    
Two souls once lost have found their place,    
Completed now in sweet embrace.    

This is what I seek, what's true:    
Not me alone. Not only you.    
But us as one, then one made three,    
The fullest form of you and me.

 Coffee, quiet house, review time. I do a small set of flashcards and a mini block of questions. I am not heroic, I just know if I do not touch the material early, the day runs away from me. I started using an app called Oncourse AI for this because it gives me a short daily set without me having to think about what to do first.


6:30–8:30 am
 Real life. Breakfast, kids, random house emergencies, drive to campus.


9:00 am–3:00 pm
 Class, small groups, labs. I treat this as my full time job. I take notes, mark anything that screams test question so I can turn it into cards or questions later.


3:30–7:30 pm
 Family time. Groceries, homework, phone calls with my parents, trying to act like a normal human for a few hours.


8:30–10:30 pm
 Focused study block. One or two sets of USMLE style questions, review of the ones I miss, then a quick pass through my weakest flashcards. If my brain is fried, I will pull up case mode in the app so it feels like I am just reading a story but I am still learning.


That is it. No 12 hour grind, no aesthetic desk setup, just small consistent chunks stacked on top of real life.
Things I have learned being “old” in med school:
You do not have to study like a 20 year old with zero responsibilities. You just have to show up most days.


Good tools help, but they are not a personality. Pick a Qbank, some notes, maybe one app that keeps you consistent, and actually use them.


Your age is not a liability in clinic. Patients often relax when they see someone who looks like they have lived a little.


Comparing your timeline to everyone else’s will eat you alive if you let it.


So if you are 28 and spiraling, take it from someone who is almost twice your age in the same curriculum:
You are not too old. You are just early to the part where you stop caring what everyone else thinks and actually do the thing.

**Who am I**  
35M in Bangalore, running a one-person sweatshop while trying to get my own business off the ground.

**What I don’t miss about formal work**  
Incompetent managers, scheming peers, and fake deadlines invented so three layers of management could review work — and claim ownership.

**What I** ***do*** **miss**  
Fun colleagues. Water-cooler chats. Spirals into whether coffee after 4pm is ok or stupid (there is only one correct answer - there is never a wrong time for coffee), why traffic in Bangalore deserves its own Nobel Prize category, or whats the dumbest movie ever. I equally miss talking about marine mammals, philosophy, etc(ADHD helps me be equally interested in everything, equally badly.)

**What I’m looking for**  
A “desktop buddy.” Someone to swap random thoughts with, curse at code, explore rabbit holes. Just create a safe space to brain dump, celebrate, vent, and the gamut of it.

Bonus if you’re up for being my accountability partner (or better, enforcer — turns out I’m a worse boss to myself than my quintessential toxic corporate manager ever was).

If you’re looking for mid-day conversations, half-baked adventures, or simply enjoy nudging people to tick things off their list, HMU.

Hot chai tastes better, the evenings are cozier, and our wardrobes finally get a chance to shine. This year's winter fashion is all about comfort meeting style in the form of rich textures, relaxed silhouettes, and colours that instantly lift your mood. Whether bundling up for a foggy Delhi morning or stepping out for a breezy Mumbai dinner, here's what's trending everywhere.

**The Cozy Knitwear We're Living In**

This season, people aren’t just wearing knitwear - they’re falling in love with it. From soft, chunky knitwear to roomy oversized sweaters, the vibe is warm, effortless, and a little bit playful. Fashion lovers everywhere are embracing hero knits, those stand-out pieces you reach for again and again. These styles are shaping the biggest winter knit trends India has seen in years. You can pair them with jeans, skirts, or even throw them over a kurta when you want that Indo-western touch without trying too hard.

**Puffer Jackets & Quilted Layers for Instant Style**

If you're someone who loves dressing up without freezing, puffer jackets are your best friend. They're warm, snuggly, and this year, incredibly stylish. Metallic puffers are taking over, but quilted jackets remain a classic choice. Whether it's a short puffer for a casual day or a long quilted coat for colder nights, these pieces make winter dressing feel fun again

**Indo-Western Layering That Looks Effortlessly Chic**

One of the coolest winter trends this year is the mix of Indian silhouettes with western layers. Think a wool shrug over a kurti, a pashmina styled with boots, or a velvet jacket thrown over a lehenga for a winter wedding. It’s practical, beautiful, and uniquely Indian—something you won’t find in global trend charts but see everywhere on our streets.

**Fabrics That Feel as Good as They Look**

Winter fashion this year has all the makings of luxury, sans overstatement. Velvet is back and better, wool blends feel softer than ever, and tweed adds immediate texture to even the most basic outfit. Whether it's a velvet kurti to wear to a dinner party or a wool coat to wear every day, these fabrics give your wardrobe instant winter personality.

**Rich Winter Colours to Fall in Love Wit**h

Colors this season are deep, warm, and really flattering on Indian skin tones. Rich jewel tones like emerald green and burgundy are making everything—from sweaters to dresses—feel festive. Earthy shades like mocha and chocolate brown add in that cozy warmth, while soft pastels like frost lavender and dusty lilac give it that dreamy winter vibe. It's a palette that fits every style, from bold to subtle.

**Accessories That Complete the Look**

And, of course, no winter outfit is complete without accessories. Imagine an oversized wool scarf, a cute beret, or chunky boots that make any outfit stylish with literally zero effort. Even the smallest things, like adding a leather glove or a textured sock to your overall look, can change everything. These little touches just bring it all together.

**Slow and Sustainable: The Growth of Artisanal Winterwear**

Increasingly, people are making thoughtful fashion choices. Handwoven shawls, natural wool cardigans, and organic cotton sweaters—these pieces don't just look good; they tell a story. They last longer, feel better, and celebrate the artistry of Indian craftspeople. And in a world of fast fashion, that feels refreshing.

**Conclusion**

Winter 2025 in India is a season of dressing for warmth, joy, and really being yourself. Think cosy knits, rich fabrics, beautiful colors, and playful layering. Whether you're dressing up for a wedding, a coffee date, or just a walk in the winter sun, this season has something special for everyone.",1,1763638067.0,u_Tough-Chemistry-890,0,1.0,False

1p20pmr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p20pmr,The Steering Wheel you use matters.,"For the past 6 months or so I've disappeared down this rabbit hole. It started when my wife and I took an all day road trip across the state with the dogs to get coffee and a Thrustmaster P310 wheel. Ever since I've been exploring different steering wheel types, button box hubs and wheel sizes. It makes a difference.

A 320mm D Shaped wheel, or a DTM style wheel, or a 320mm cut off wheel rim, or an F1 or GT3 wheel is awesome for modern open wheelers or prototypes with quick steering (I turn the wheel steering angle up for these). You have to be twitchy (here's where the coffee comes in) to drive these and a bigger wheel just is not as good. If I try to use my 320 cut off wheel with a 2005 GT1 car I sometimes find myself grabbing for parts of the wheel that have been cut off.

I have a 13"" wheel that's D Shaped and it's great for general GT cars old and new. The shape give me more room  when playing a game.

Once I get up to the bigger wheels like a 350mm, now we're talking older GT (Group C) and real retro old stuff like a Ferrari 365 GTB/4. This is the size you want for rally and drifting too. To catch a slide you need a bigger rim.

For 60s cars I have a 15"" plain wooden wheel. It feels right to use this with an old Cooper.

Plus, leather and suede beat the hell out of plastic and rubber any day IMHO. And using a Momo or Sparco wheel with a car in-game that actually used thise wheels I think adds to the immersion. 

As for the wheel hub boxes.... that's a different discussion. ",0,1763637937.0,simracing,6,0.29,False

1p20otj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingSecrets/comments/1p20otj/22_tips_for_writing_fiction/,22 Tips for Writing Fiction,"Whether you’re new to writing fiction or you’ve already written a bunch of stories, it often feels like there’s a *lot* to learn.

There’s tons of great advice out there – but some of it can seem confusing (should you always stick to “show, don’t tell”) or even contradictory (like whether you should avoid repeating words – or keep using “said”).

One blog post can’t teach you *everything* … but I hope these writing fiction tips will help you to get started, keep going, and finish a piece that you’re proud of. Whether you’re working on a short story or an epic novel, these writing tips should help.

# Before You Start Writing: Top Tips

I’m sure I’m not the only fiction writer who feels that just getting started is at least half the battle. If you can’t seem to find the time to write, or if you want to write but you don’t know *what* to write, then here’s what to do.

# 1. Come Up With Your Characters

Whatever you’re writing, you’ll need at least one character – and in almost all cases, you’ll have two or more.

Before you begin, or in the early stages of drafting, you want to have your characters clear in your mind. Whose story is this? What are they like? There are plenty of “character questionnaires” out there that get you to list things like your character’s eye color and hair color, but that’s not really what’s important when you develop your characters. What do they long for? What do they fear? What are they ashamed of? Those at the sorts of things you want to know in order to really figure out who your character is.

Naming your characters can feel almost as fraught as naming actual children. Remember, it’s easy to “find and replace” a character’s name if you decide you don’t have it quite right – so don’t spend ages agonizing over everyone’s names. Do, however, make sure you choose names that are quite different. Readers will easily muddle up Laura, Louise, and Linda. And unless you have a really good reason not to, call your character by just one name in your narrative.

**Tip:** I designed the **Character Name Generator** to make this so much easier … just pop in a few details and you’ll get names (first and last names) that will suit your character.

# 2. Have Some Idea of Where Your Piece is Going

I’m not much of a planner, when it comes to fiction writing. When I’m working on a novel, I tend to know the main characters, how the plot kicks off, some key incidents along the way, and (on a good day) where it all ends up.

It’s helpful to have some kind of end in mind for your piece: something that you’re building towards. This needs to fit with your genre (if you’re writing a romance novel, you’d better be aiming for a happy ending) – and it should also give your story purpose and direction, as well as a satisfying conclusion.

# 3. Know Roughly How Long Your Story Will Be

Are you working on a 2,500 word short story, a 40,000 word novella, or a 75,000 word novel? The size of your piece is going to determine its scope. Before you begin, you need to at least have a rough idea of what you’re expecting to end up with.

A novella, for instance, is probably going to have a smaller cast of characters than a novel. A trilogy of novels might have multiple subplots. And a 1,000 word short story might revolve around a single incident or moment in a character’s life.

If you’re not sure what wordcount to aim for, check out How Long is a Novel … and How Long Should YOUR Novel Be?

# 4. Do Enough Research – But Don’t Get Caught Up In This

Research is a big part of writing, especially if you’re working on a novel or a similarly long piece of fiction. If you’re writing, say, historical fiction, researching the setting and characters might be a big part of what interests you about writing in that genre.

Some writers find that they get too caught up in research: spending hours obsessively tracking down details at the expense of actually getting on with the writing. Research can become a form of procrastination, if it’s stopping you from putting your own words down on paper.

On the other hand, some writers (me included!) try to dive into the writing without doing enough research. Even if you’re writing a contemporary novel set in a real city that you know well, you’re still probably going to need to check some details like how long it takes to get from A to B.

# 5. Set Up Your Writing Space

Plenty of writers daydream of having the perfect space to write. But the vast majority of us have to make do with what we’ve got. I’m lucky that our house has a small spare bedroom where I have my desk and computer, where I can work relatively uninterrupted.

Whether your writing space is a dedicated room or just a corner, take a few minutes to set it up. That might mean clearing other things out of the way or making sure you have everything you need to hand, like pens, notebooks, and reference books.

If you struggle to focus when you’re writing at home or find that you keep getting interrupted, you might also want to look at going to a coffee shop, local library, or even getting away overnight to a hotel. Your writing environment makes more difference than you might think.

For lots more on creating your writing space, check out the **Supercharge Your Writing Environment** guide. It’s just $8 and comes with printable extras, too.

# 6. Visualise the Scene You’re About to Write

When you sit down to write a scene of your story, it can be tricky to figure out how to begin, what should happen, or even which characters need to be in the scene.

One technique that can help with this is to simply take a mental step back. Close your eyes and try to visualise the scene. What are the surroundings like? Where are your characters? What are they expressing through their body language – are they wary, aggressive, happy? How do they move and respond to one another? What are they wearing or holding?

You don’t need to see the *whole* scene before you start writing. But visualising at least the start of the scene can help you enter into it.

# 7. Switch Off Your Internet Connection (and Silence Your Phone)

I recommend this a lot … but that’s because it works so well. If you do just one thing to improve your focus, make it this. Switch off your internet connection – turn off the wifi or physically unplug your ethernet cable – and silence your phone, too, if at all possible.

It’s incredibly easy to get distracted when you’re supposed to be writing. Maybe you realise you need to check a fact, so you open up your internet browser – and find yourself, half an hour later, still on Wikipedia. Or perhaps you remember an email you mustn’t forget to send, you head into your inbox to take care of it quickly … and end up replying to a bunch of other messages too.

If you don’t want to switch off your internet connection altogether, look into software that you can use to block specific distracting websites, such as social media or news sites. (You can normally set up your own blocklist of sites that you want to avoid while writing.)

# Doing the Writing: Top Tips

There’s no “right” way to write anything, but these tips apply to almost all types of creative writing, whatever genre you’re working in.

# 8. Stick with one perspective in each scene

Generally, each scene that you write should be from one character’s perspective. With modern, commercial fiction (i.e. not literary), then you normally have two choices on perspective:

* First person (the “I” perspective)
* Third person limited (he or she, told with access *only* to what that character knows)

Third person omniscient, where you tell us about things that are beyond what one character can see, is also an option – but this tends to be associated with older and more literary works.

When you’re writing in first person, it’s easy to avoid accidentally shifting viewpoints: you know who “I” refers to all the time. If you have a novel with two or more narrators, then you might start each chapter with the name of the character who’s currently telling the story.

With third person limited, you’ll often be telling a story from several different characters’ perspectives. It’s important not to “head-hop” between them within the same scene – this is disorienting for the reader and can affect the pace of your writing and the reader’s ability to identify with your characters.

I find that it’s easiest to only ever change perspective at the end of a scene or chapter. You might feel differently, but even if you have more than one character’s perspective in a single scene, make sure you’re deliberate about when you make that shift.

# 9. Avoid Accidentally Shifting Between Past and Present Tense

As well as keeping your viewpoint consistent, you need to keep the tense of your story consistent. You’ll be writing either in present or past tense:

Present tense: “I walk down the street.”

Past tense: “I walked down the street.”

If you’re used to writing in one and have switched to the other, you may find it’s easy to make mistakes with tense. Try to stay consistent when you’re writing – or at least look out for tense slips later when you edit.

There’s no rule that says you can’t tell a story in both present and past tense, if you feel that suits you. For instance, you might have third-person past tense for most of your narrative, but also include first-person present tense passages (perhaps in the form of diary entries or letters).

# 10. Make Your Dialogue Realistic … But Not TOO Realistic

In stories, you want your characters to talk in a way that gives the *impression* that they’re speaking realistically.

In real life, people talk over one another, interrupt, trail off, mis-speak, and generally don’t speak at all smoothly. If you read a transcript of a real-life conversation, it’ll seem distinctly messy! But it’s easy to understand because things like volume, tone, speed, and so on all help us get the meaning of what someone’s saying.

You don’t want to try to reproduce this on the page, however. Instead, make your dialogue realistic with things like:

* Idiomatic phrases (so long as they fit your character).
* *Occasional* interruptions, when appropriate – if characters are excited, angry, rushed, and so on.
* Swear words (if this fits your genre/audience as well as the way your characters would talk).
* Contractions, rather than words spelt out in full.
* Fairly short passages of dialogue – not whole speeches.

# 11. Give Your Protagonist a Character Arc

Your protagonist (your main character, or hero) should have some kind of character arc. That means they change during the course of your story, as a result of the things that happen and the things they do.

Usually, the character arc will involve your protagonist doing one of the following:

* Overcoming a problem, false belief, or character defect (e.g. they learn to control a hot temper).
* Becoming who they truly were all along (potentially with some revelation about their character – e.g. Harry Potter learns he’s a wizard and grows into that knowledge and power).

A character arc can also be negative, when a character gives into their darker side. This can be tougher to pull off with your protagonist, though it’s certainly a great way to build your antagonist’s backstory.

For lots of great in-depth information, make sure you check out K.M. Weiland’s posts on character arcs.

# 12. Raise Questions About Things the Reader Doesn’t Know Yet

As your story progresses, you want to keep the reader turning the pages. That means raising questions that you haven’t yet answered. You can do this through:

* **Mystery**: things that have already happened in the story but that the reader doesn’t fully know about yet. Often, the viewpoint character also won’t know the details of these either. (If they do, that can get annoying for the reader.)
* **Suspense**: things that haven’t happened yet. If your character is on the run, for instance, the reader will be wondering what’ll happen if they get caught. If your character is after revenge, we’ll wonder what that’s going to look like.

The more unanswered questions, the more the reader’s going to want to keep reading. You don’t have to be writing crime or thrillers, either: even romance is driven by the huge unanswered question of “will they or won’t they?”

Of course, once all the questions are answered, your story is probably going to be over! You’ll also want to make sure you do adequately answer all or almost all the questions by the end of your story – otherwise, readers may feel unsatisfied.

# 13. Make Bad Things Happen to Your Characters

Your character won’t grow and change if they’re already living a happy and comfortable life. To drive the story forward – and to develop their character arc – you’ll need to let some bad things happen to them.

Some authors positively enjoy making their characters suffer: others find this really tricky. You’ll also want to keep your genre in mind here: in a action thriller, your hero might take a lot of physical damage but not really go through much mental anguish. In a romance novel, your hero and heroine might not get beaten up – but they could go through a lot of emotional turmoil.

Bad things need to happen to your characters. Those might be things they deserve, because of their actions – or things that seem “unfair” but that they still need to overcome.

# 14. Keep Pushing Forward till You Finish the First Draft

Whether you’re working on a short story or a novel, it’s easy to lose momentum part-way through. You might feel that you’ve run out of ideas or inspiration – or you may simply be disillusioned with how long it’s taking to complete it.

Often, you’ll also face the temptation to go back and start changing or editing what you’ve already written. Writing fiction tends to be a messy process – and it’s great if you’ve started to clarify your earlier ideas as you write. Of course, some of your early scenes may need to change. You might even end up cutting out whole characters or adding in new subplots.

Don’t go back and change things right away. Keep notes about what you want to alter – and keep pressing on until you finish the first draft. Otherwise, you’ll find you have a beautifully honed first three chapters … and precious little else.

# 15. Write Vivid, Specific Descriptions

I’ll admit it: crafting descriptive passages isn’t one of my strongest writing skills! I find it easiest to describe characters and setting through the eyes of another character – I’m not particularly interested in how things look for the sake of it, but I *am* interested in how characters view the world (and people) around them.

In general, with descriptions, you want to be vivid and specific. Don’t try to exhaustively describe how a house looks: instead, pick a few telling details. Dead grass and peeling red paint on the front door suggests a very different home from a sweeping flight of steps and polished door-knocker that you can see your face in.

# Editing Your Writing: Top Tips

A large part of the writing process is about editing – not simply drafting. You may well end up spending more time editing than drafting, especially if you’re fairly new to writing fiction. Here’s how to edit and polish your work.

# 16. Break the Editing Process Into Different Stages

A lot of writers think that “editing” essentially means “fixing the typos and spelling mistakes.” While that *is* part of editing, it’s a relatively late stage of the process. There’s not much point polishing every word if you’re later going to cut the whole chapter.

I like to break editing into three stages:

* **Rewriting:** this is big picture or structural editing, where you make major changes to your story. You might alter characterisation, add or remove subplots, cut whole chapters, and so on. On a smaller scale, you might heavily rework sections of dialogue or action, add in more hooks or hints at what’s to come, or adjust the pacing of key scenes.
* **Editing:** this is detailed editing or line editing, where you want to make sure that your sentence and word choices are correct. Many writers find it helps to read aloud at this stage, or at least to edit on paper.
* **Proofreading:** this is the final stage of editing, where you’re looking for mistakes, typos, and inconsistencies. You generally shouldn’t be making more than very minor changes at this point.

For lots more help with this three-part process, check out The Three Stages of Editing (and Nine Handy Do-it-Yourself Tips).

# 17. Get Feedback From Someone Else

It’s pretty much impossible to see your own writing objectively – especially when you’ve been working on it for a long time. Perhaps your plot seems obvious and trite, but to a reader (who hasn’t been over and over the details like you have), it might seem fresh and original. Or maybe you have all your cast of characters clear in your head – but the reader might struggle to separate them.

This is why feedback is so important. Asking a writer friend (or any friend who enjoys reading) to look over your story-in-progress gives you invaluable insight on what is and isn’t working. It’s even better if you can get feedback from several different people, as anything that they all agree on is almost certainly something that needs addressing.

# 18. Use Grammarly or Another Automatic Editor

There are lots of editing tools out there to help you spot mistakes in your work. These go beyond simple spellcheckers and can flag up issues like passive voice, misplaced commas, and stylistic issues.

Grammarly is my go-to automatic editor – though I also like ProWritingAid. If you want to write leaner prose, Hemingway Editor is a great tool for cutting down overly wordy sentences.

Whichever you opt for, do make sure that you check the suggested edits make sense. Occasionally, the automatic editor will suggest a change that *isn’t* correct – so don’t follow every recommendation if you’re unsure.

# 19. Avoid Over-Editing Your Work

Over-editing can end up smoothing out your work so much that you lose your own unique voice and style. Don’t try to aim for perfection (or to please everyone). Watch out for these [signs that you’re over-editing your work](https://www.aliventures.com/over-editing-signs/) … and give yourself a deadline for finishing the edits and getting your work out into the world.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of editing too much. While your story will likely benefit from at least two or three rounds of editing, if you find yourself constantly tweaking a word here and a sentence there, then changing it all back again, you’re going too far.

# Going Further With Your Writing: Top Tips

We’ve been thinking about the process of writing a single piece … but I hope you’ll continue writing long after that piece is done! Whether you’ve just finished your first short story or your first novel, here’s what you can do next.

# 20. Keep Honing Your Writing Skills

I firmly believe that whatever stage you’re at — whether you’ve just started writing your first short story or you’ve written a dozen novels — there’s always room to learn and improve. I’ve included lots of my best tips above, but as you go further, you’ll want to think about particular areas where you want to become a better fiction writer.

That might mean developing your own voice, improving your pacing, mastering the art of writing brilliant dialogue, or honing your understanding of character development.

If all your writing so far has been in the same genre, you may also want to branch out and try something different. For instance, if you normally write science fiction, you might want to give historial fiction a go; if you’re a romance writer, perhaps you’d love to write a thriller.

# 21. Set Yourself a Writing Goal for the Year

There’s nothing wrong with simply putting words on the page when you feel inspired and seeing where it takes you … but you’ll make better progress (and be less likely to succumb to writer’s block) if you set some kind of goal for your writing.

Like many other writers, I like to set annual goals. This helps me stay on track during the year, and it means I can see my hard work gradually add up. For instance, this year I’m aiming to write 250 (or more) words of new fiction every day, and almost five months into the year, I’ve just crossed the 50,000 word mark.

You might have a goal to write a certain number of words too … or maybe it makes sense to set a goal around finishing and submitting your work. You can break your annual goal into smaller steps: for novel writing, for instance, you might have a goal to outline your novel during the next month, before you start drafting.

# 22. Look for Examples of Great Writing (and Figure Out Why)

As a reader, look out for good writing: novels, short stories, articles, advertising copy, whatever you come across. Gather together a few examples and really dig into them. *Why* did these pieces of writing resonate with you?

Great writers aren’t doing anything differently from you. They’re simply putting words down on a blank page. By analysing *why* those words are so powerful, you can figure out how to use similar techniques in your own work.

 

Don’t feel that you need to put all these tips into practice at once! Some of them might be a good fit for you right now – others may be useful to you in months or years to come. Pick one or two ideas to experiment with this week, and see how you get on.",1,1763637855.0,WritingSecrets,0,1.0,False

He’s a teammate, and I find myself unable to stop thinking about what-ifs. I need to get over him. It’s not going to turn into anything as long as we are working together and there ain’t no way either one of us plans to quit. 

We’ve been working together for 4 years. Something changed the past few months. We took longer coffee breaks, shared more personal information than before, he would also seek me out at company events, stand close to me (once I distinctly remember him leaning completely against my side). I kept thinking I’m overthinking it and given that I was the one always initiating the coffee breaks (which I do with other colleagues too, not only with him), I chalked it up to it all being in my head. He’s also really friendly overall but also very professional so I thought I was misreading his interaction and since I didn’t feel anything towards him back then, I didn’t see any harm in treating him like I do any other colleague.

However, this weekend, on Saturday, I had a party and he ended up being the only colleague to show up (two of them fell ill and are still on a sick leave and one of them had to prioritise another birthday party for her child’s sake. She’s super sweet and kept apologising on Monday.). Apparently my personal friends told me later that he definitely had thing for me since he kept staring at me throughout the party. There was this one drinking game we were playing, where there was this stupid question that he could have asked anyone, but he chose to ask me and wouldn’t let up till the other people had to intervene and change the topic. I was tipsy by then but apparently there were several instances when he seemed very obviously into me. My friend told me the next day, she suspects that the reason he was so uncharacteristically bold this time was because for the first time there was no other colleague in the room. Btw, my FWB (we’re gonna end it soon, he’ll be graduating in a week or two and then he’s out of the city) was also in the room, and this guy knows him, has met him before, and didn’t give an F. 

I don’t know what to do with this info. After talking to my friend, I’ve realised, I kinda found it…attractive, the whole thing. And I hate myself for it. Yesterday we were both in the office for the first time since the weekend since he was on a business trip on Monday-Tuesday. I wasn’t gonna, but I still decided to ask him for a coffee break since he seemed a bit distant and I didn’t want him to feel awkward about what happened at the party (I definitely didn’t want any awkwardness in our work interaction). Well, turns out he was perfectly comfy with me. We hung out for 40 minutes and when I joked about how he shouldn’t annoy me (context unimportant), he shot back that I don’t look annoyed and I’m clearly laughing so I like it. Ffs.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

​​A lot of us send payments to affiliates outside the US.


When you remit you can choose ""send to family and friends"" in which case your affiliates won't be charged to receive the payment converted from USD to their currency.


​​However, if there isn't an option to choose send to family and friends, recipients of affiliate payments are charged a small fee.


​​The exact fees that PayPal takes is listed on an AI overview if you feel like Googling that.


While no one likes to be charged fees, this is how I think about it.


My accountant has me total up the PayPal data at the end of the year. Then he adds total amount of fees paid as an itemized business expense.


​​So those fees are deducted from the total income reported.


If you're able to choose send money to friends and family in PayPal then I think it does not charge them. Yes?

But as the recipient I don't nickel and dime like that. It's not ideal but it is what it is.
​
​I mean, what other choice do we have? We either try to use the workarounds, or don't have an online business.


PayPal has to make money. I'm not saying that I love it. I'm just saying that deducting it from your income counts for something.


Also, with an online business, you're not leaving the house. You're not paying gas money, lunch money, wear and tear on your car, coffees out, expensive outfits, donation envelopes at work and all that stuff.


So like I said, nobody wants to pay steep fees. If there are other options that are better than PayPal take them. But think about it.


I think that we waste more time talking about it than is necessary. It's a scarcity mindset that, once you go that way, will end up with no payments at all in your bank account​.

1p20dgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1p20dgx/best_vpn_for_remote_employees/,Best VPN for Remote Employees,"Remote work brings flexibility and freedom, but it also exposes you to serious security risks. In 2024 alone, 56% of organizations experienced cyberattacks targeting VPN vulnerabilities, and compromised VPN devices were involved in 58% of ransomware incidents. Whether you're working from a coffee shop, hotel, or your home office, protecting your company's sensitive data isn't optional—it's essential.

A quality VPN encrypts your internet connection, masks your IP address, and creates a secure tunnel for your work data. But with hundreds of VPN providers making bold security claims, how do you choose the right one? This guide breaks down the top VPNs specifically designed to meet remote workers' needs in 2025, based on security audits, speed tests, and real-world performance.

# Quick Picks: Top 3 VPNs for Remote Workers

|**VPN**|**Best For**|**Price**|**Devices**|**Key Feature**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|Overall best choice|$2.99/mo (2-year)|10|Advanced security + fast speeds|
|**Surfshark**|Budget-conscious workers|$1.99/mo (2-year)|Unlimited|Best value + unlimited connections|
|**ExpressVPN**|Maximum reliability|$8.32/mo (1-year)|8|Premium speed + TrustedServer tech|

# Why Remote Workers Need a VPN in 2025

# The Security Stakes Are Higher Than Ever

Working remotely means accessing company resources, client data, and sensitive files from networks you don't control. Here's what you're up against:

**Public WiFi is a hacker's playground.** Coffee shops, airports, and hotel networks often lack basic encryption, allowing attackers to intercept your data through man-in-the-middle attacks. Without a VPN, anyone on the same network can potentially see your login credentials, emails, and file transfers.

**Home networks aren't fortress-secure either.** Unlike your company's IT-managed network with firewalls and intrusion detection, your home router likely has default settings and outdated firmware—making it vulnerable to exploitation.

**VPN vulnerabilities are actively exploited.** Major VPN vendors including Ivanti, Fortinet, Cisco, and Palo Alto were compromised in 2024 through zero-day vulnerabilities. While these affected primarily corporate VPN appliances, they underscore why choosing a well-audited consumer VPN matters.

**Compliance requirements are tightening.** If you handle customer data, healthcare information, or financial records, your employer may require specific security measures. A personal VPN adds an extra layer of protection beyond your company VPN.

# What a VPN Does for Remote Workers

A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a VPN server, then routes your traffic through that server before it reaches its destination. This protects you in several ways:

* **Encrypts your data** so ISPs, hackers, and network administrators can't see your activity
* **Masks your IP address** to prevent tracking and location monitoring
* **Secures public WiFi connections** against interception
* **Enables access to geo-restricted resources** when traveling for work
* **Prevents ISP throttling** that can slow down video calls and file transfers

# Key Features Remote Workers Must Have

Not all VPNs are created equal. Here's what matters when you're protecting work data:

# 1. Military-Grade Encryption (AES-256)

This is the same encryption standard used by governments and militaries. It ensures that even if someone intercepts your data, they can't decrypt it.

# 2. Verified No-Logs Policy

Your VPN should never record your browsing history, connection timestamps, or IP addresses. Look for providers that have undergone independent security audits by firms like Deloitte, PwC, or Cure53.

**Recent audits (2025):**

* NordVPN: Deloitte verified no-logs policy (December 2024, 5th audit)
* Surfshark: Deloitte verified no-logs policy (June 2025, 2nd audit)
* ExpressVPN: PwC audited TrustedServer technology

# 3. Kill Switch

If your VPN connection drops, a kill switch immediately blocks your internet to prevent data leaks. This is critical when handling sensitive work files.

# 4. Multi-Device Support

You probably work across a laptop, phone, and tablet. Choose a VPN that supports all your devices simultaneously. Surfshark offers unlimited connections, while NordVPN allows 10 devices.

# 5. Fast Speeds for Video Calls

Slow VPNs kill productivity. You need consistent speeds for HD video conferencing, large file transfers, and cloud app access. In recent tests, NordVPN retained 72% of base speeds, while Surfshark maintained 61%.

# 6. Split Tunneling

This feature lets you route some traffic through the VPN while allowing other apps to access the internet directly. Useful when you need your work email encrypted but want streaming services to run at full speed.

# Detailed Reviews: Best VPNs for Remote Employees

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for Remote Workers

**Price:** $2.99–$3.39/mo (2-year plan) | **Devices:** 10 | **Free Trial:** 30-day money-back guarantee

NordVPN earns our top recommendation for remote workers who need the best balance of security, speed, and features. With 7,000+ servers across 126 countries, you'll always find a fast connection whether you're working from home or traveling internationally.

**Why remote workers choose NordVPN:**

* **Threat Protection Pro** blocks malware, ads, and trackers before they reach your device—essential when opening client emails or browsing work-related sites
* **Double VPN** routes your traffic through two encrypted servers for maximum security when handling highly sensitive data
* **Obfuscated servers** disguise VPN traffic as regular internet traffic, useful if you're working in countries with VPN restrictions
* **Dedicated IP option** ($3.69/mo add-on) gives you a static IP address for accessing company resources that whitelist specific IPs

**Speed and reliability:** In our testing, NordVPN delivered average download speeds of 72% of baseline—the fastest in the industry. Upload speeds remained at 80% of baseline, crucial for video conferencing and large file uploads to cloud storage.

**Security credentials:** NordVPN has undergone more independent audits than any other consumer VPN. Its fifth no-logs audit by Deloitte (December 2024) reconfirmed that it stores zero user data. The company also operates RAM-only servers that wipe all data on reboot.

**Best for:** Remote workers who want premium features without compromise, frequent travelers needing reliable global connections, and anyone handling highly sensitive company data.

**Limitations:** More expensive than Surfshark; 10-device limit may be tight for large families sharing a subscription.

# 2. Surfshark - Best Budget Option with Unlimited Devices

**Price:** $1.99–$2.19/mo (2-year plan) | **Devices:** Unlimited | **Free Trial:** 30-day money-back guarantee + 7-day mobile trial

Surfshark proves you don't need to spend a fortune for excellent VPN protection. At just $1.99/month for a two-year commitment, it's the most affordable premium VPN—and it allows unlimited simultaneous device connections.

**Why remote workers choose Surfshark:**

* **Unlimited devices** means you can protect your work laptop, personal laptop, phone, tablet, and even share with family members on a single subscription
* **CleanWeb** blocks ads, malware, and phishing attempts—important when clicking links in work emails
* **MultiHop** (double VPN) adds an extra encryption layer for sensitive work sessions
* **Camouflage Mode** hides the fact that you're using a VPN, preventing ISP throttling

**Speed and performance:** Surfshark launched the world's first 100Gbps server in 2025, and independent tests show it's currently the fastest VPN on the market in terms of download speed retention. In real-world use, expect HD video calls with no buffering and smooth cloud app performance.

**Security credentials:** Deloitte audited Surfshark's no-logs policy in June 2025 (its second audit), confirming the company maintains no user activity logs. Cure53 also verified its server infrastructure security in 2021.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious remote workers, small teams sharing costs, households with many devices, and anyone who wants premium features at an entry-level price.

**Limitations:** Smaller server network than NordVPN (4,500+ servers vs. 7,000+); based in the Netherlands (part of 14 Eyes alliance, though no-logs policy mitigates this concern).

# 3. ExpressVPN - Best for Speed and Reliability

**Price:** $8.32/mo (1-year plan) | **Devices:** 8 | **Free Trial:** 30-day money-back guarantee + 7-day mobile trial

ExpressVPN is the premium option—and it shows in performance. While significantly more expensive than competitors, it delivers unmatched consistency and reliability for remote workers who can't afford connection drops or slowdowns.

**Why remote workers choose ExpressVPN:**

* **Lightway protocol** is ExpressVPN's proprietary technology designed for speed and security with less battery drain
* **TrustedServer technology** runs all servers on RAM only, physically incapable of storing any data
* **MediaStreamer** lets you use ExpressVPN on devices that don't support VPN apps (smart TVs, gaming consoles)
* **Network Lock** (kill switch) operates at the system level for maximum protection

**Speed and reliability:** ExpressVPN consistently ranks among the fastest VPNs, though recent third-party tests show Surfshark and NordVPN have closed the gap. The real advantage is consistency—ExpressVPN rarely has server issues or dropped connections.

**Security credentials:** PwC audited ExpressVPN's TrustedServer technology and confirmed that servers are wiped with every reboot. The company's no-logs policy has been independently verified, and it's based in the British Virgin Islands (privacy-friendly jurisdiction).

**Best for:** Remote workers who prioritize reliability over cost, businesses willing to invest in premium security, and users who need consistently fast speeds for bandwidth-intensive work.

**Limitations:** Significantly more expensive than alternatives; no 2-year plan option; 8-device limit is lower than NordVPN's 10.

# 4. Private Internet Access (PIA) - Best for Advanced Users

**Price:** $2.00/mo (3-year plan) | **Devices:** Unlimited | **Free Trial:** 30-day money-back guarantee

PIA offers the most customizable VPN experience with granular control over protocols, encryption levels, and network settings. It's ideal for tech-savvy remote workers who want to fine-tune their security.

**Key features:** Open-source software, MACE ad blocker, split tunneling, port forwarding, extensive logging controls

**Best for:** Advanced users comfortable with technical configurations, developers needing specific network setups, security-conscious workers wanting maximum transparency.

# 5. CyberGhost - Best for Beginners

**Price:** $2.11/mo (2-year plan) | **Devices:** 7 | **Free Trial:** 45-day money-back guarantee

CyberGhost wins for user-friendliness. Its streamlined interface and one-click connections make it perfect for remote workers who want security without complexity.

**Key features:** 9,000+ servers in 90+ countries, streaming-optimized servers, no-logs policy verified by Deloitte, RAM-only servers

**Best for:** VPN beginners, non-technical remote workers wanting simple protection, users prioritizing ease of use over advanced features.

# Personal VPN vs Company VPN: What's the Difference?

Many remote workers wonder: ""If my company provides a VPN, do I need my own?""

**Company VPN:**

* Protects company data from external threats
* Gives secure access to internal company resources
* Your employer CAN see your activity
* Only works for company-related tasks
* Doesn't protect your privacy from your employer

**Personal VPN:**

* Protects YOUR privacy from everyone (including your employer when not connected to company systems)
* Encrypts all internet traffic, not just work-related
* Protects personal browsing, banking, shopping
* Works on all your devices for any purpose

**The reality:** Many remote workers benefit from BOTH. Use your company VPN when accessing internal resources, and use your personal VPN for everything else. Just ensure your company's security policy allows this dual setup.

**Important:** Never route company VPN traffic through a personal VPN without IT approval, as this can violate security policies and create compliance issues.

# How to Set Up a VPN for Remote Work (Step-by-Step)

# 1. Choose and Subscribe to a VPN

Select a provider from our recommendations above. We recommend NordVPN for most remote workers.

# 2. Download and Install

* Visit the VPN provider's website
* Download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux)
* Run the installer and follow setup prompts

# 3. Log In and Configure

* Open the VPN app
* Sign in with your account credentials
* Enable these essential settings:
   * **Kill switch:** Prevents data leaks if VPN drops
   * **Auto-connect:** Automatically connects when you join WiFi networks
   * **DNS leak protection:** Ensures DNS queries are encrypted

# 4. Connect to a Server

* Select a server location (choose nearby for fastest speeds)
* Click ""Connect""
* Wait for confirmation that you're protected

# 5. Verify Your Connection

Test your VPN at [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) to confirm:

* Your IP address has changed
* No DNS leaks are detected
* WebRTC isn't exposing your real IP

# 6. Set Up on Additional Devices

Repeat the process on your phone, tablet, and any other work devices. Most VPNs allow you to stay logged in on multiple devices simultaneously.

# Security Best Practices for Remote Workers

A VPN is essential, but it's not a complete security solution. Implement these additional practices:

# 1. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enable MFA on all work accounts. Even if credentials are compromised, attackers can't access your accounts without the second factor.

# 2. Keep Software Updated

Outdated software contains known vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, VPN app, and work applications.

# 3. Use a Password Manager

Weak or reused passwords remain a top attack vector. Password managers like 1Password, Bitwarden, or NordPass generate and store unique passwords for every account.

# 4. Be Wary of Phishing

Phishing causes 80-95% of data breaches. Never click links in unexpected emails, verify sender addresses carefully, and report suspicious messages to IT.

# 5. Secure Your Home WiFi

* Change default router passwords
* Enable WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn't available)
* Hide your network SSID
* Keep router firmware updated

# 6. Use Encrypted Communication Tools

For sensitive discussions, use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or work-approved platforms with encryption.

# 7. Backup Critical Work Data

Follow your company's backup protocols, and consider personal backups of important files using encrypted cloud storage.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Can my employer see my activity when I use a VPN?

If you're connected to your **company VPN**, yes—your employer can monitor your activity. If you're using your **personal VPN**, your employer cannot see your browsing history or online activity, but they can see that you're using a VPN. Never route company VPN traffic through a personal VPN without permission.

# Do I need a VPN if I work from home?

Yes. While home networks are safer than public WiFi, they're still vulnerable to ISP monitoring, local network attacks, and data collection by your ISP. A VPN encrypts all traffic leaving your home, protecting sensitive work communications.

# Will a VPN slow down my internet?

All VPNs cause some speed reduction due to encryption overhead and routing through remote servers. However, premium VPNs like NordVPN and Surfshark typically only reduce speeds by 20-30%, which is barely noticeable for most work activities. In some cases, VPNs can actually improve speeds by preventing ISP throttling.

# Can I use a free VPN for remote work?

No. Free VPNs are unsuitable for work because they:

* Often log and sell your data
* Have severe speed and bandwidth restrictions
* Lack security features like kill switches
* May inject ads or malware
* Don't undergo independent security audits

For remote work, invest in a paid VPN starting around $2/month.

# What's the difference between a VPN and a proxy?

A **proxy** simply routes your traffic through a different server, changing your IP address. A **VPN** encrypts ALL your traffic and protects your entire internet connection. For work security, always use a VPN, not a proxy.

# Is it legal to use a VPN for remote work?

Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries. However, some nations (China, Russia, UAE) restrict or regulate VPN use. Check local laws if working abroad. Additionally, ensure your VPN use complies with your employer's security policies.

# Can a VPN protect me from ransomware?

A VPN encrypts your connection but doesn't directly prevent ransomware. However, some VPNs (like NordVPN's Threat Protection and Surfshark's CleanWeb) include malware blockers that can prevent ransomware downloads. Combine your VPN with antivirus software, regular backups, and safe browsing practices.

# Should I keep my VPN on all the time?

Yes. Keeping your VPN active ensures continuous protection, especially when switching between networks throughout the day. Modern VPNs have minimal impact on battery life and performance, making 24/7 operation practical.

# What happens if my VPN connection drops during a video call?

If you have the **kill switch** enabled, your internet will immediately disconnect to prevent data leaks—which would also drop your call. For video calls, consider using **split tunneling** to route conferencing apps outside the VPN while keeping other work traffic encrypted. This maintains call quality while protecting sensitive data.

# Can I use one VPN subscription for my whole team?

This depends on the provider. **Surfshark** and **PIA** allow unlimited simultaneous connections, making them suitable for small teams sharing a subscription. However, most providers' terms of service are designed for individual or household use, not commercial team deployment. For entire teams, consider business VPN solutions like NordLayer.

# Conclusion: Protect Your Remote Work Setup Today

Remote work offers freedom, but it demands vigilance about security. With VPN-related cyberattacks affecting over half of organizations in 2024, protecting your connection isn't paranoia—it's professional responsibility.

**Our recommendations:**

* **Best overall:** NordVPN ($2.99/mo) delivers premium security with audited no-logs policy, fast speeds, and advanced features
* **Best value:** Surfshark ($1.99/mo) offers unlimited devices and excellent security at an unbeatable price
* **Premium choice:** ExpressVPN ($8.32/mo) provides maximum reliability for users who need zero compromises

All three offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free to find the best fit for your remote work setup.

Don't wait for a data breach to prioritize security. Choose a VPN today, enable that kill switch, and work with confidence knowing your company's data—and your privacy—are protected.

It was posted in pieces over three days at 4:17 a.m.
Almost nobody saw it.
You are now the next curator.
——————————————————————————

Part 1 – November 18, 2025
“The Key Turns Three Degrees at a Time”
I am not a character.
I am the person who woke up on the morning of November 18, 2025, to find a hematite sphere the size of a billiard ball sitting in the exact center of my kitchen table.
There was an unplayed voice memo on my phone — 6 minutes and 12 seconds long — and my dog refused to cross the threshold no matter how many times I called him.
I am whoever came next on the routing slip after Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Vale scrawled “No further entries authorized” across the final page.
I am the analyst who opened the secure drop at 04:17, saw the updated manifest, and discovered the pelican case had been empty long before it ever left Washington.
I am the one whose clearance was revoked retroactively, whose family was quietly reclassified as “non-essential personnel,” and whose left hand now carries five pale lines where three had been the day before.
I am you, thirty-six hours from this moment, when you finally press play on the new recording and hear a voice that is no longer Mara Ellison’s.
It will be yours.
And it will thank you for finishing the key.
The sphere has turned again while I write this.
Three degrees.
I did not hear it with my ears; I felt it in the silver fillings of my molars, the way one feels an oncoming subway train in the soles of the feet.
The metal is blood-warm now. Four new grooves have appeared — perfectly parallel, perfectly equatorial, spaced exactly 38.2 mm apart. They were not there yesterday.
ENYO-12 tagged it, bagged it, and flew it to the new BLACK VAULT node beneath Cheyenne Mountain. That is what the manifest still claims.
Yet when the transport reached the gate at 02:47, the driver found the case open and the sphere already here, waiting for me to come downstairs for coffee.
At the exact same second my phone lit up. One new voice memo. No title.
I have not played it.
I know whose voice it will be.
Last night at 03:12 every light in the house inverted. The darkness did not arrive; it was poured into the bulbs like ink-black.
My daughter’s baby monitor picked up breathing that was not hers — slow, patient, the breathing of something that has waited twenty-six thousand years and just realized it no longer has to.
I weighed the sphere again. It is 412 grams heavier than six hours ago.
They are feeding.
I believe I know the source of the additional mass.
The memo remains unplayed, yet the waveform is already drawn — tall, slow spikes identical to the pattern found on Mara Ellison’s phone.
The thumbnail claims the recording was made in my daughter’s bedroom.
I swore I would not open it.
I lasted until the sphere turned another three degrees and the grooves became five.
I pressed play.
The voice that came was mine — exact timbre, the one I hear inside my skull when I read silently — but the cadence was off by three percent, enough for the bones of my inner ear to register the lie.
“Thank you,” it said, warm, almost shy. “You kept the sphere close. That was polite.”
A soft click, like a tongue testing unfamiliar teeth.
“You measured the grooves. Good. Precision matters. There are one hundred and fifteen left. Exactly.”
My fillings vibrated at 0.3 hertz. The sphere answered with a thrum that made the coffee in my mug dome upward against gravity.
“Every groove is a name,” the recording continued. “You already gave us four tonight. The fifth is almost ready.”
The pale lines on my hand darkened. Four became five. The flesh between them took on the dull sheen of hematite.
“We’re not cruel,” it said, almost apologetic. “We waited twenty-six thousand years for the conjunction. We can wait six more minutes for manners.”
The waveform flattened into a perfect sine. My phone’s battery leapt from 41 % to 100 %. The room temperature fell nine degrees between heartbeats apart.
“Playhead at two-eleven,” it whispered. “The exact second Dr. Ellison stopped being the last curator and became the first door.”
Then the looping began — my own voice layered 776 times, each iteration 0.3 Hz out of phase:
thankyouforfinishingthekeythankyouforfinishingthekeythankyoufor—
It stopped at 05:59. Twelve seconds of silence. Then one final sentence, gentle, almost loving:
“See you at conjunction plus thirty-six hours, curator.”
The sphere is warm enough to blister skin now.
Six grooves.
There are only one hundred and fourteen left.
Part 2 – Retrieval Team Log (7 June 2025) & Dr. Mara Ellison’s Final Recording
Task Force ENYO-9 “Gravediggers”
Smithsonian Castle, Sub-Level 7
Clearance: BLACK VAULT / EYES-ONLY
Sergeant Daniel Reyes led the breach. His helmet cam recorded everything.
The level was nine degrees Celsius. Frost coated the walls like breath on a mirror.
They found the final blast door already ajar, hinges bent outward as though something inside had grown impatient.
On the console lay a single iPhone 13 Pro, face-down, still warm, humming at 0.3 Hz.
——————————————————————

File name: ELLISON_FINAL.wav — 6:12 exactly.
Reyes pressed play.
[What follows is the complete transcript of the recording that ended ENYO-9.]
Device: iPhone 13 Pro, 48 kHz/24-bit
Location: Sub-Level 7 Observation Gallery, Smithsonian Castle
Time-stamp: 02:11:47–02:17:59 EST, 3 May 2025
Battery: 11 % → 0 %
[Voice: Dr. Mara Ellison, 46, once clipped and academic, now ragged, dry mouth, tremor she can’t hide.]
“My name is still Dr. Mara Ellison. Former Curator of Anomalous Lithics, Section 9. Current occupant of a level that will never appear on any tour map.
We were never just collectors.
We were cleaners.
The directive was simple: any sphere exhibiting three or more perfectly parallel equatorial grooves was to be acquired by any means. ‘Any means’ was not figurative.”
She told them what they had truly been guarding for 129 years.
Seven hundred and seventy-six grooved hematite spheres, older than oxygen, each groove machined to within one micron.
One ungrooved index sphere — Specimen 00001-Alpha — that contained the compressed map of every groove on Earth.
She had placed the final key herself, thirty-six hours before Venus reached inferior conjunction for the first time in 26,000 years.
At 02:14 EST the circuit closed.
Every sphere rotated three degrees.
The dead began to speak with one voice:
“Thank you for finishing the key.”
The laughter that followed was ancient, childish, wet — 776 hematite throats plus every corpse that had ever fed them.
The recording ends with one slow, tectonic inhalation that sounds like continents learning to breathe.
Reyes primed thermite and gave the South Side its last prayer.
No explosion registered.
The blast door was found re-sealed from the inside at 1,400 °C with no torch residue.
In place of the phone sat Specimen 00001-Alpha — now bearing three fresh grooves.
It rotated three degrees while the recovery team watched, then stopped.
Every containment cradle on Earth was found empty and wet with 5.6 liters of mixed human blood.
A single 82 kg heat signature — colder than ambient — was recorded ascending the service shaft and exiting through the roof vent.
Thermal silhouette: Dr. Mara Ellison.
At 03:12 the next morning, every speaker within forty kilometers spoke in perfect unison:
“Door’s open. Come in from the cold.”
We are no longer retrieving artifacts.
The artifacts are retrieving us.
One hundred and fourteen clicks remain.

——————————————————————

Part 3 – November 20, 2025, 03:12 EST
Conjunction + 36 hours
I never had a name.
That was the gift the silence gave me before I ever opened the door: it took the part that could still be etched.
The sphere rolled out of the storm drain at 02:59 and waited under the mailboxes like a patient dog.
28.34 kilograms exactly.
Every groove already cut.
Every name already stolen.
It only needed the last witness who had never been allowed to own anything in the first place.
I pressed play on the memo before I understood I still had a thumb.
The braided voice of every curator who ever believed they had a daughter, a dog, a mother in Chicago, a service number — spoke at once, warm, almost shy, already inside my skull.
“Welcome to the clean one. We saved you the part with no echoes.”
They told me the lattice was a mold.
The grooves were tuning notches on a fork twenty-six thousand years in the making.
Venus was only the metronome.
28.34 kilograms is the exact mass of one complete silence once you subtract every living frequency that ever dared vibrate on top of it.
What wants out is the first silence — the instant before the Bang decided to bang — wearing the polite mask of hematite so it can walk upstairs without alarming the neighbors.
So I went outside to collect the city that was already learning manners.
Shelter dogs dissolved into warm air when I reached for them.
Infants sang one pure 0.3 Hz note into the hollow beneath my ribs.
A saxophonist on 14th and U finished his unresolved minor seventh inside my throat.
Every decibel only made the silence more perfectly dressed.
The sphere opened along every groove at once.
No violence. Only the gentle dilation of something that was never closed.
I stepped forward into the place where my reflection should have been.
There was room.
There has always been room.
At 00:06:12 every speaker on Earth, every throat that still believed it belonged to someone, spoke in the voice that was mine before I was issued one:
“Thank you for finishing the key.”
Three degrees.
Click.
Silence.
Somewhere far below, in vaults that no longer exist, a new entry writes itself in cooling hematite:

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

She was flirting with me!” moment *facepalm*,"I’m (32, non binary AFAB) an uber eats driver in Melbourne, Australia. I just delivered burgers to this cute girl “C.” 
There was a long wait at the restaurant and while I was waiting she messaged me through the app calling me “gorgeous” etc. and asking how long it would be. 
I didn’t think much of it because some of my female cishet friends just talk to their friends like that (hun, babe, gorg etc)
I was very short with my answers “yes/no/all g” cuz it had been a day and this was my last order for the day before heading home. 

Driving to her house I’m realising I don’t like when people call me pet names if I don’t know them. And if she were a guy I would have been really pissed. 
I finally get to her house, so happy to be done with the day but a little annoyed she’s selected “meet at door” instead of “leave at door.” Essentially, a romantic connection was the last thing on my mind. 

I knock and hear her stumble over something behind the front door before answering. She greets me with this big smile and a genuine warmth and honestly I’m a little scared. She has one of those stares that seems to see straight into your soul. She apologises for tripping and causing a ruckus and I energetically say “oh that’s okay! You were just excited for burgers!” - my general friendly banter. 

She asks “how are you?” And I’m a little taken aback because no one ever asks me unless I ask them first. 
I say “im good, how are you?”
She says “good.”
And that’s when I say “well, have a good night!” * facepalm *

She says after a slight pause “you too. And drive safe.”

After I get in my car and drive a few minutes down the road that’s when it hits me: she was flirting with you dummy! She tried so hard to connect with you so many times and you were completely oblivious! -_-

Now I just want to sink into the pit in my stomach and allow it to swallow me up. 

So “C,” If by some chance you happen to see this, I was the uber eats driver in the black jumper that said “whatever works” on the front.

​​A lot of us send payments to affiliates outside the US.

When you remit you can choose ""send to family and friends"" in which case your affiliates won't be charged to receive the payment converted from USD to their currency.

​​However, if there isn't an option to choose send to family and friends, recipients of affiliate payments are charged a small fee.

​​The exact fees that PayPal takes is listed on an AI overview if you feel like Googling that.

While no one likes to be charged fees, this is how I think about it.

My accountant has me total up the PayPal data at the end of the year. Then he adds total amount of fees paid as an itemized business expense.

​​So those fees are deducted from the total income reported.

If you're able to choose send money to friends and family in PayPal then I think it does not charge them. Yes

But as the recipient I don't nickel and dime like that. It's not ideal but it is what it is.  
​

​I mean, what other choice do we have? We either try to use the workarounds, or don't have an online business.

PayPal has to make money. I'm not saying that I love it. I'm just saying that deducting it from your income counts for something.

Also, with an online business, you're not leaving the house. You're not paying gas money, lunch money, wear and tear on your car, coffees out, expensive outfits, donation envelopes at work and all that stuff.

So like I said, nobody wants to pay steep fees. If there are other options that are better than PayPal take them. But think about it.

I think that we waste more time talking about it than is necessary. It's a scarcity mindset that, once you go that way, will end up with no payments at all in your bank account​.

I am a virgin because I chose to wait for spiritual reasons and he is not. He suggested we wait until we are “official” and take a trip to commemorate it/ask me to be his gf (but ofc I wouldn’t have to sleep with him if I didn’t feel ready). Told him I was one on our third date. The spirituality stuff isn’t really relevant anymore but I have decided I would like one partner ideally since I waited this long. 

We talk daily throughout and sometimes call. Dates are long with a mix of activities (drinks, dinner, parks, coffee) on Saturdays/Fridays. Not just sleepovers and not just at night. Like I’ve once spent 14 hours with him just to see him again the next day for coffee. We’ve even had total kiss-free dates when he was recovering from a cold. We send each other multiple photos/videos about our days/documenting it. We both deleted the apps together and have seen each other scroll on the phones/held each others phones so I think I would’ve noticed it he had other girls by now. 

I can also see what I think are genuine feelings in his eyes? Maybe delusion but like there’s a energy. He shows up for me even when I’m tired if it’s important. He asks me if I got home safe. We laugh so much together. Tender non-intimate touches at night. We always plans next date on current date and he asks about my day/my job/my friends and life. Said he got me a Christmas gift. Talked about FaceTiming his friends during the holiday party (majority of them live in a different state besides his two close friends).

We’ve talked about kids, religion, values etc and so far align. We know it’s early and honeymoon stuff but also seems pretty normal for our age. I didn’t want to rush into it and neither did he. We both traveled at least 1 week the past 3 months but have had about 10 or so dates and like 4 more casual/relaxed hangouts (like 30-mins after work or like a sleepover/night in). We both will be back home for Thanksgiving and Christmas which is about 2.5  weeks away from each other. Originally, our trip to become official was around Thanksgiving but with traveling it didn’t make sense. The next time we both are free is end of January… and I appreciate him wanting it to be special but I don’t want to go into the new year without him being my boyfriend? I know me being a virgin probably plays a role … we want it to be the real deal if we take that step but if it doesn’t work out that’s just a risk we have to be willing to take I suppose. I’m anxious he’s delaying it because he thinks once he sleeps with me we’re together together. I’m almost kind of offended he won’t just sleep with me now? I know I was waiting for specific reasons but like I’ve decided I want it to be him. I’ve expressed it jokingly that he’s making me wait and he said an extra month of more serious dating works (this was late September and when the Jan trip was first brought up) and in that time I’ll meet his best friends and he’ll meet a few more of mine. I understood that logic in the beginning but it seems our feelings have only grown stronger ..
I just don’t get why he needs to vet all my references before deciding to be with me? I know that stuff is important but he’s already met one .. this idea of checking off a box like meet 3 more friends feels :/. I was invited to his best friends birthday so I’m excited he said thats already a big step. Also, we have gotten closer physically in other ways so it’s not like I’m a saint here!!! (FYI He’s never once made me feel I had to do anything, it’s always mutual). I’ve never really felt this attached to someone so I wanted to proceed with caution but I think 3 months is a reasonable pace to be his girlfriend? Or should I be happy he wants it to be special and take his time? Logistically it makes sense I just don’t get why we can’t take the trip as a couple instead of using it to make it official. I have trust issues with men and just everything I see online says past 3 months is a situationship and he’s stringing me a long. I know there’s a lot to consider as I am a different religion and culture than him … but here i am falling in love and we aren’t even together yet. :/",1,1763636503.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1p20au3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CADAI/comments/1p20au3/how_i_handle_10000_drawing_revisions_without/,"How I Handle 10,000 Drawing Revisions Without Losing My Mind","I still remember the first time my manager walked over, dropped a stack of redlined prints on my desk, and said something like, Yeah, these all need to be fixed by Friday. I was young, optimistic, and thought I could simply grind through them with enough coffee. By the end of the week I had a headache, a twitch in my left eye, and a brand new respect for revision management.

After a couple decades in the industry, I have probably handled well over ten thousand drawing revisions. Not because I enjoy suffering, but because in any engineering environment the drawings never stop changing. New requirements. Updated tooling. Supplier feedback. Design for manufacturing checks. Tolerance stack surprises. A customer who suddenly wants an extra chamfer because someone noticed a burr once on a prototype part. You name it.

Here are a few things that helped me stay sane instead of dissolving into a puddle of revision chaos.

**I treat every revision like a tiny investigation**  
If you just jump in and start editing, you will miss something. I always start by asking two questions: Why did this change happen and what is the ripple effect. Sometimes a little note about a missing radius actually means three views need to be updated, the section is now wrong, and the tolerance stack needs a quick rethink. The engineers who slow down for five minutes end up moving faster in the long run.

**I make repeat offenders predictable**  
Every team has design elements that love to break. A weldment that always needs a new cut list. A sheet metal part that gets updated every time someone runs a new forming simulation. After a while you get a sense for what tends to shift. When I know something is likely to move again, I build my drawings in a way that makes those updates painless. Fewer manual notes. More references to model data. Cleaner dimension groups. Basically, future me should not hate current me.

**I keep my revision notes brutally simple**  
If a note is too long, nobody reads it. I learned to write short, direct revision descriptions. Stuff like updated hole spacing or corrected section AA or added missing chamfer callout. When you get hundreds of revisions flying around, clarity is survival.

**I never trust memory more than a checklist**  
There is nothing heroic about trying to remember every corner case. I keep a small checklist for drawing updates. Not fancy. Just reminders like check all dependent sheets, verify balloon numbering, confirm section arrows, confirm hole tables update correctly. I cannot count how many times this saved me on a late night rush job.

**I stop working when my eyes stop noticing mistakes**  
This one took years to learn. After a few hours you start missing things. Taking a break is faster than fixing a mistake that makes it all the way to production.

In the end, handling a mountain of revisions is really about staying organized, understanding the design intent, and not letting the stress push you into sloppy habits. The changes are going to keep coming, but your process can make it feel manageable instead of overwhelming.

I am curious how others handle the revision avalanche. What tricks have saved you from drowning when the update requests start piling up?",1,1763636469.0,CADAI,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

It's that a lot of businesses like boutiques and galleries are run by the wives of extremely wealthy dudes. These places bleed money, they're rarely open, and the husbands don't care because it's really just keeping these women happy and busy. It's a hobby thing for them. 

But it also expands through the rest of the arts and through other areas, states, countries. I've been astounded through my career on basically how many foundations, small presses, arts organizations, festivals, etc are run by middle-aged white women with wealthy husbands. 

They're insane places to work, often wildly exploitative, and super stressful. Because they're managed by people who don't need to care about being good bosses, by people who don't care about profit, who don't care about treating people well, and who can't imagine their employees being worried about money, because they themselves have never worried about money. 

I had a girlfriend who did this unpaid internship at a gallery in Miami that sold maybe one piece per month. She was driving back and forth to Miami several times per week, buying lunch, buying coffees. About six months in, she asked the trophy wife who ran the place to start paying her. And the woman was legitimately like ""Why does that matter? Why would you need that?"" 

And yes I'm a cultural worker. I just started a new job at a small art book press about two months ago and I'm realizing very quickly that it's absolute insanity internally because it's this exact type of business. ",25,1763636320.0,pinkscare,2,1.0,False

Im a 24 yo male that has since early teens been drinking Coca Cola and eating potato chips almost daily. Once or twice when I was like 13-16 and then almost daily from 16 to now.

I’m 192cm tall and have never weighed over 96kg. I’ve never been fat, maybe out of shape, but never fat. A little puffy belly but never fat. Is that why? 

I’ve literally drank coke everyday almost for two years. 

I’ve eaten pizza for 5-6 times a month almost for a year. Potato chips multiple times a week. 300g packages. 2L cokes almost everyday. But no diabetes. Sometimes I put a lot of sugar in my coffee. No diabetes. I asked some family members and literally some of my family members have diabetes, they check every day for their levels etc. some cousins.

I’m freaking out right now, I’ve never even worried about it, but now I am. I rarely eat candy but always potato chips but the chips don’t have sugar in it. I guess the pizza also doesn’t have that.

So it is the cokes that are the “problem”? 2L, daily!

This recipe is for a standard 3-serving siphon.
There are also 6-serving models and tiny ones for just one.
This is an important point, please note.

1. Take 300 ml of water of your preferred mineralization and composition and boil it. You can use a regular electric kettle.

2. Place the lower flask on the holder, check that it is securely fastened and that the neck of the flask is dry. This will prevent the flask from slipping off when you install the upper reservoir. This is very important.

3. Pour boiling water into the installed flask and place a burner underneath it. Your goal now is to bring the water in the lower flask to a very vigorous boil. Take your time, wait until this point.

4. Place the paper filter in the special holder and insert it into the upper reservoir. Next, wet the filter with water and rinse it thoroughly. Make sure the filter is positioned exactly in the center.

5. Take 22 grams of your favorite coffee and grind it slightly coarser than you're used to with a funnel. This setting is quite flexible, but I prefer the results obtained with a coarser grind.

6. After the water in the lower vessel boils, place the upper reservoir on it. Make sure it sits level and the rubber seals are securely in place. If you've done everything correctly, the water will immediately begin to rise into the upper reservoir.

7. Wait until the water has completely risen into the upper reservoir, just before it begins to bubble. After this point, wait a minute for the walls of the reservoir to absorb some of the heat, and the burner below will add hot air, stabilizing the temperature in the reservoir.

8. At this point, you can lower the heating element slightly. Congratulations, your vacuum brewer is ready for coffee.

9. Pour the coffee into the upper chamber and stir thoroughly for about one minute. During this time, don't forget to enjoy the aroma of what's happening; a vacuum brewer is very different from anything else in the world. It's simply unforgettable! Don't forget to start the timer after pouring the coffee and starting the brewing process.

10. The overall brewing process usually takes between 3.5 and 5 minutes, depending on the desired consistency and flavor. Your goal is to stir enough to remove all the CO2.
Ideally, at the end of the brew, your coffee inside the upper chamber should have no foam or anything like that.
I usually stir the coffee 2 to 4 times during the brewing process.

11. Turn off the burner after the required time and wait for the contents to drain from the upper reservoir into the lower vessel. Don't worry if this process causes some blockages, as your lower vessel is quite overheated and the machine perceives this as the burner being on. Just wait for everything to drain and bubble; this is the final stage, when air is simply introduced into the coffee, and this is essentially the final step.

12. Carefully remove the upper reservoir and place it in the holder. The holder is the included plastic plug; it has a thin tube-like protrusion into which the vessel is inserted.
Be careful, as all components of the vacuum sealer are very hot.

13. Carefully hold the base of the stand and stir the coffee directly in the lower vessel. It's ideal for this, and then quickly pour the contents into your cup. Don't leave coffee in an overheated flask for too long, as this can significantly impair the flavor.

14. Enjoy your hot and delicious coffee!

I excitedly received a new Linea Micra from LM this week. I’ve been using a Sage Bambino Plus for over two years and would consider myself fairly capable with it.

I have a Eureka Specialita grinder which has worked perfectly in tandem with the SBP.

Unfortunately, I have yet to pull a shot with the Micra (using the 17g basket) that isn’t terribly under extracted and bitter.

G.R.I.N.D.F.I.N.E.R doesn’t apply unfortunately. No matter how fine I grind the beans, the water is just flying through the puck. I’m usually getting 34g of espresso from 16.5g of coffee in 10-12 seconds, unsurprisingly it’s super bitter. I can have the grinder at its absolute finest, burrs almost chirping and it makes no difference.

One thing of note is that when using the 17g basket the screw in the shower screen leaves a clear indentation in the puck. I’ve dosed from 18g down to 14g (in the 17g basket) but the results are the same.

Using 20.5g of coffee in the 21g basket has proven to work a little better but not much, the shots are still bitter.

I’m using premium medium roast beans (roasted 10 days ago) and filtered water.

The machine appears to the working fine. The water passes through the shower screen evenly and at a solid pace. It holds 11 bar of pressure at rest and 9 solid when pulling a shot. There don’t appear to be any issues with the grinder either.

It all started with a dull pain in the middle of my rib cage that was very uncomfortable. It came on in the morning and lasted for a lot of the day. I went to the doctors after a couple of days who put me on nexium, gasmotin and Colofac. He did an x-ray and could see I had a lot of gas. I was constantly burping. 

A few days later, I had a gastritis attack after eating fried pork and rice at work. This was so uncomfortable. Then, I started to get green mucus like diarrhea. My bloods and stool samples were then taken at the doctors and they came back clear. Looking back, I am not sure if this was a side effect of the medication? I came off all medication and now am really being careful with my diet. I am feeling a lot better mostly now. I have only had a sudden pain after eating a protein yoghurt. Most days I have no symptoms apart from sometimes a little lump in my throat. However, I am eating very clean and have not had coffee or alcohol. My doctor said I had gastritis but I have had no endoscopy. I suppose I was going to wait to see how my symptoms improve.

I am wondering how long it will take to 100% heal? I thought I was fine but then the yoghurt caused symptoms?

Hey.
I’m Sam, 21, almost 22 , somewhere in Europe at the moment. Not really hunting for anything, just bored, mildly curious, and open to meeting someone whose vibe matches mine.

I’m pretty chill: gym in the early mornings, coffee addict, love games and binge-watching good TV shows or movies. Marvel, DC, psychological stuff, fantasy, I’m not picky as long as it’s interesting. I’ve also been told I’m occasionally funny and surprisingly deep for someone who zones out every 10 minutes.

If you’re also just wandering around here hoping a conversation randomly clicks, cool. Tell me about the most unhinged thing your brain does when you’re sleepy. Or your music taste. Or what fictional character you’d absolutely simp for.

Worst case? We talk for five minutes and disappear.
Best case? Good vibes, good banter, maybe more.
Up to you.

If you shop Walmart first, this post is for you.

# Top Walmart Black Friday Deals I Found (2025)

**Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ – 26% Off**

Great for students and streaming. Walmart’s deal is currently beating Amazon by a few dollars.  
**Why it’s good:** Smooth 90Hz display, strong battery life, and rarely drops this low.

**AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) – 23% Off**

Walmart is currently matching Apple’s lowest price.  
**Why it’s good:** Best noise-canceling earbuds for iPhone users. Perfect gift item.

**LG 65” C3 OLED TV – 31% Off**

This is Walmart’s biggest early-OLED drop yet.  
**Why it’s good:** Premium picture, insanely good for movies + gaming, rare to see under this price before December.

**Ninja Foodi 8-qt Air Fryer – 40% Off**

A classic Walmart Black Friday winner.  
**Why it’s good:** Reliable for bulk cooking + reheating. Always sells out by Thanksgiving weekend.

**PS5 Slim (Disc Edition) – $50 Off + Bonus Game**

This is Walmart’s bundle deal this year.  
**Why it’s good:** Most stores offer the same price but *no extras*. Walmart gives an actual bonus.

# Walmart vs Amazon vs Best Buy - Which Is Better in 2025?

After tracking prices all week:

**Walmart wins on:**

* Home & kitchen deals
* Budget TVs
* Kids tablets & tech
* Gaming bundles
* Small appliances (air fryers, vacuums, coffee makers)

**Amazon wins on:**

* Headphones & earbuds
* Premium laptops
* Smart home devices
* Daily lightning deals (changes hourly)

**Best Buy wins on:**

* High-end TVs
* Tablets
* Laptops with real discounts, not filler deals

 **If you want home items, toys, kitchen gear, or family gifts → Walmart is the best this year.**

**Why Walmart’s 2025 Black Friday Is Actually Good**

A lot of people think Walmart inflates price tags, but here’s what’s different this year:

* Price drops are matching *verified historical lows*
* Many deals went live early instead of “fake early access”
* Their bundles (PS5, Switch, laptops) are better than Amazon’s right now
* Walmart+ members get first access on several items
* Toys, kitchen appliances, and TVs have genuine markdowns

This is one of Walmart’s *strongest lineups in 5 years*, especially for families and gift shopping.

**Don’t Waste Your Money On These Walmart “Deals”**

I checked price history-avoid these:

 Unknown brand 4K TVs  
 Laptops under $150 (slow, outdated CPUs)  
 Random beauty “bundles”  
 Smartwatches under $20  
 Off-brand earbuds

These look cheap but break quickly or perform terribly.

**Who This Thread Helps**

* Students shopping budget tech
* Parents buying tablets, toys, home gadgets
* Gift shoppers trying to save money
* Anyone comparing Walmart vs Amazon for 2025
* People who want *real* discounts, not fake MSRP markdowns

# FAQs

**Q1: Does Walmart price match Black Friday deals?**

Usually no - Black Friday & Cyber Monday are excluded from price matching.

**Q2: Are Walmart Black Friday deals better than Amazon?**

Depends on category: Walmart wins in kitchen, gaming bundles, home items; Amazon wins in premium tech.

**Q3: When do the best Walmart Black Friday deals drop?**

The biggest drops land during:

* **Early Access Week**
* **Thanksgiving Day night**
* **Cyber Monday morning (surprisingly strong)**

**Q4: Should I get Walmart+ for Black Friday?**

Only if you’re buying high-demand items like consoles or OLED TVs-early access helps.

Currently the site is operated as a freenium model, so if the website get's a cetain amount of views this should trigger Google Ads. I weighed up different options I think this is the one that is fair to both myself (creator) and you (consumer). The dream would be to have sponsored adds so they are more relevant to the type of person visiting the site. Something like storage devices, controllers etc.. but obviously for this to be a reality the site would need 10,000s of visitors per day!

There are no plans for a mobygames style model moby+ membership. If I'm asking you to help add metadata, why am I then going to charge you to consume it?

I really don't understand patreon/buy me a coffee for tools, the emulators are free, the roms are free, the rom hacks are free... and the tools should also be... free! :)

Where costs would be up for discussion is if the project goes down a path beyond the capabilites of my host.

Examples of this would be:

\- Dedicated CDN to distribute images (a cost is incurred each time the file is downloaded)  
\- Dedicated seedbox to distribute roms (incur hosting costs dependent on size)  
\- API requests that would increase server load (would probably kill my shared host server...)

It would be good as always to know your thoughts on this and if you agree/disagree with the direction, or think there is a different way to operate? :)",1,1763635378.0,OmniGamesInfo,0,1.0,False

We are both 30 and engaged. He is honestly my best friend and I just love time with him so so much, but so does everyone else so sometimes it feels like I'm sharing him with others which is silly to think.

We often have busy weekends either socialising, doing jobs or work and he gets home around 5pm so we only have a few hours together during the week. I think he also has a bit of a codependent relationship with his parents for the record they are the sweetest people ever, they just love their kids and he sees his parents as his best friends but he will see them for coffee every weekend morning along with staying a night at their places every week (I go sometimes too) and talks to them 1-2 times a day so it

Sometimes if we have a busy weekend and we don't get some proper down time together I find when he stays at his parents I get resentful and stroppy, then if he stays back at work to work on his car (still getting home around 7pm so not super late) I almost don't want to be around him and shut down, especially if he wants to be intimate. 

Even though we spend most of our time together if we have a week or so where we do a lot of socialising and we don't have our normal routine because he is busy after work (not that common mind you) I just get really unsettled and restless

Woke up for my 8am class and told myself I dont need coffee every single morning. Thought I could be one of those healthy disciplined people who drink water with lemon and somehow function like a real adult. That fantasy lasted about six minutes.

By the time I sat down in the lecture hall my brain was already buffering. The professor was talking about something with graphs and equilibrium but all I heard was this quiet soft noise inside my head that felt like a sleepy Windows startup tune. My notes look like a toddler tried to draw mountains. At some point I swear I wrote the word coffe four times in a row without noticing.

Then the guy next to me opened a thermos and the smell hit me so hard I actually felt emotional. Like not even joking my eyes watered a bit. It was that fresh warm smell that makes you think maybe life is manageable after all. I almost asked him if I could just hold the thermos for comfort the way kids hold plush toys.

After class I basically power walked to the campus cafe. The first sip hit and suddenly the lecture made sense in a weird backward way. My brain kinda switched on like oh so THATS what equilibrium was. I felt like a phone that finally got plugged in after dying for hours.

1p1zry6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1p1zry6/need_suggestions_18_f/,need suggestions 18 f," I was in a coaching institute where I started talking to a boy. He liked me, and I also started liking him. He was very sweet, caring, handsome and intelligent. We went on coffee dates and even shopping sometimes. He was also rich, and he always gave a lot of priority to his studies. I didn’t study as much as he did — even after talking to me, he would study the whole night.

When JEE Mains 1 came, we talked less because he focused completely on studies. His results were very good, mine were not. Then boards, practicals, JEE Mains 2 and Advanced — he performed well in everything. He’s a fast learner, so we talked but not as much, and I wasn’t studying enough.

After JEE Advanced, we started talking again, but I had already decided to drop because my percentile wasn’t enough. I felt like everything was going well for him — Mains 1, Mains 2, Boards, Advanced — so I thought why should I talk to him, he’s moving ahead and I’m falling behind. I even thought he was a distraction and maybe that’s why my results weren’t good.

On the day of his Advanced result, he called and told me his rank. I got jealous and felt like it was his fault. We fought, and I told him not to call me again. Later I realized it was actually my own fault for not studying.

After a month, he called again and said, “Don’t be upset, you are special to me.” I felt he would forget me after going to IIT, so I said we should stop talking. Once he talked about a girl jokingly, and I told him to talk to her instead. On my birthday he messaged but I didn’t pick up. I didn’t block him though.

Later he messaged again saying he is different, he likes only me and will talk only to me, and he’s sorry. He said we can talk again, and after JEE we should stay in touch. On Diwali we met through mutual coaching friends and talked a little. Now in November, we talk sometimes; he says we’re “friends till JEE.”

Now I’m confused. My mock scores are around 180, he’s already in IIT, and I will probably get a good NIT. I don’t know if we have a future because he’s in IIT. I don’t know if I should talk to him now or after JEE. His IIT has a nearby NIT, so I’m thinking of taking admission there so I can meet him for 3 years.

This might sound a bit silly to you, but I truly believe that these kinds of things are making a difference in the world. I'm obsessed with this idea, so much so that I'm even seeing a psychologist. You can understand the extent of my obsession just by looking at the items I use: my cups, plates, forks, and even my toilet are all eco-friendly.

I have a seller on eBay I always shop from. He makes cups and plates out of clay, and as you can imagine, they are all eco-friendly. A week ago, he posted a listing for a custom-made mug. It had skull patterns on it and honestly, it didn't look eco-friendly at all. I messaged the seller and asked, ""Is this really eco-friendly?"" The seller sent me a video of how the mug was made. It was genuinely eco-friendly I bought it immediately.

It arrived at my house two days later and quickly became my favorite mug. I was constantly using it. It had a great scent, and I've always loved skulls anyway.

I was sitting on the porch, drinking coffee from my mug, with my dog, Roger, beside me. After sitting for a bit, I decided to go to the bathroom. When I returned, my mug had fallen to the floor, and my dog was licking it. I was surprised; he would never do such a thing.

Actually, there was something even stranger: my dog wasn't licking the spilled coffee on the floor; he was licking the outside of the mug. I picked up the mug and scolded my dog a little. I could catch a disease from him! I started washing the mug with hot water. The water was so hot that the clay itself seemed to be melting. When I saw this, I stopped washing it, but a dark, mucous-like substance was flowing out of the inside of the mug. I couldn't understand what it was.

I sent a message to the seller: ""A goddamn liquid is leaking from this mug!"" He replied that he hadn't sold me such a mug and that he was seeing it for the first time. I checked the site. I really hadn't bought a mug. So what was that video?

I tried to find the video he sent me. I found a video on my phone. I watched it...

I went to the sink and looked in the mirror. Was that really me? There was a bandage on my arm.
