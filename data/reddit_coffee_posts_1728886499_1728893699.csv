I know that you have been saying that you hope that G is/gets pregnant but let’s just talk for a minute. You might want to consider that that would tie you to G longer. As of now, you have 15 years of hell. But, you would add 3/4 years minimum to that. 
If that’s not scary enough, you must have considered that G is going to have to top the drama and get fed up even more. That means more work for you. You would then be caring for 2 children the second you walk in the house after working so hard. A newborn is a lot of responsibility but when you add a child like C, whom is very active and undisciplined, and no routine, it would be more like you would be tripling your work. Actually, more. G is going to have more anxiety, more hysterics, need more of your attention. So, you have now doubled that! Did you consider all that? And, that’s if you have a normal, healthy baby with the coffee and addy addictions. 
And, imagine if I’m wrong. What if you two split? You would be giving her your whole paycheck for child support. You would have to get a second job!!! 
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure that you have thought this all out. Good luck!

If so, what does it look like?","I’m a mother of two and am basically full time with my 11 month old. I drop off and pick up my four year old from preschool six days a week and am with both of them the rest of the afternoon until we come home, where I usually cook dinner. Then there’s cleaning (myself, my baby and my home), perpetual laundry, grocery shopping, actually eating, the coffee ritual, odds and ends, occasional friends and outings. Oh, and then there’s me attempting to “get back to work.”  
  
So, when I add all that up, eight minutes is basically all I have left to do my practice.  
  
And whatever I do in those eight minutes better boost me the eff up so that I can get back to doing all the things I just mentioned. To be clear, I WANT do to those things. Yes—even the laundry.  
  
If I’m not choosing it, it’ll burn me out.  
  
The good news is that limits set me free. Turns out that eight minutes seems to be all that’s necessary these days to go deep and get what I need to be able to show up to all the things. To show up fully and not in a resentful, half assed and disconnected way, which would be waaay to easy 🙄

Short Bible Study with me about 2 Corinthians 13:5

Introduction
------------

Welcome! Are you ready to dive deeper into your spiritual journey? Today, we are exploring a profound verse from 2 Corinthians, inviting us to examine and strengthen our faith. In a world rushing past, filled with distractions and noise, it’s crucial to pause and reflect on our spiritual standing. Imagine the possibilities of a clearer understanding of your faith and the peace that comes with it.

This study will guide you in exploring and evaluating your faith with an open heart. It’s a chance to uplift your spiritual life by deepening your relationship with Christ. So grab your Bible, a journal, and a cup of coffee, and let’s embark on this transformative journey together.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?” – 2 Corinthians 13:5 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse is Paul’s exhortation to the Corinthians to pause and assess their spiritual health. Just as we have regular physical check-ups, spiritual self-examination is essential in our walk with God. It is less about self-doubt and more about nurturing the seeds of faith planted within us. Paul prompts us to test our faith, not for perfection but for authenticity.

At its core, this scripture is a gentle reminder that faith is not static. It’s alive and dynamic, requiring intention and awareness. Often, we get caught up in rituals and traditions, overlooking the relationship with Christ that thrives on personal reflection and growth. The presence of Christ within us is the ultimate test of our faith, encouraging us to embody his love and teachings genuinely.

This self-examination isn’t about judgment but rather about alignment. It’s about asking ourselves whether our actions, thoughts, and heart’s desires align with the teachings of Jesus. The verse invites a deeper connection, where Christ’s spirit shines through us, bringing transformation and testimony to His presence in our lives.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Set aside regular time for self-reflection and prayer, seeking God’s guidance in examining your faith.

– Identify areas in life where you might feel spiritually stagnant and take small steps to reignite your passion for God’s word.

– Seek accountability by sharing and discussing your spiritual journey with trusted fellow believers.

– Engage in service or outreach activities that reflect the love of Christ within you.

– Read the Gospel regularly to keep Jesus’ teachings fresh and alive in your heart and actions.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– What aspects of my faith feel strongest, and where do I sense a need for growth?

– How do I experience Jesus within me in my day-to-day life?

– Are there any areas or habits in my life that seem out of alignment with my faith? What changes might I consider to realign with God’s teachings?

– How do my daily actions reflect my belief in Christ’s presence within me?

– In what ways can I serve as a living testimony of Christ’s love?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, I come to you with an open heart, seeking your wisdom and guidance. Help me examine my faith honestly and deeply. Reveal to me the areas in my life that need realignment with your will. I thank you for your abiding presence and the strength you provide. May my life reflect your love and grace to those around me. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

Conclusion

Thank you for journeying with us through this short Bible study on 2 Corinthians 13:5. As we reflect on our spiritual lives, this verse encourages us to pause and ensure our faith aligns with Jesus’ teachings. Remember, it’s an ongoing journey of growth and transformation.

Background:

About me: Female, 35, was fitter in my youth but trying for a comeback. Was even pretty fit a few years ago, but I handled post-quarantine poorly and let myself go. Kicking myself for that, but I'm working to get back to where I was. 

I ran track when I was still in school, then fell off of the running wagon for more than a decade, but a few years ago I decided to climb back on and I fell in love with it all over again.

This was my fourth half; my first was 2019 with a 2:13, second was 2021 with 2:15, and an abysmal performance last year with a 2:43. 

When I was 17 I tore my ACL and had reconstructive surgery, so I battle that from time to time. It acts up during the worst times, but I try and push through. I was told that I would have arthritis come on earlier than normal due to the damage, and I feel like that time may be now. I have no medical basis for this conclusion, but sometimes it's been aching even at rest, and I do everything I can to stretch it and keep it loose.

I know my times aren't as great as most of the other posters here, but I thought that if I get more involved in the community instead of just lurking, maybe that will give me a push to get my act together and train like I should.

Training:

Last year I tried to follow Hal Higdon's intermediate half marathon training plan, but I found myself overwhelmed by it and bailed on it almost a month before race day. This year I took a more relaxed approach which didn't do me any favors, but my headspace was a lot better. 

I started training about five months out with four runs a week, on average. I aimed for a 5k at the beginning of the week, an 8k midweek, a slow 5 on Friday, and an 11k on Saturday or Sunday. As race-day came closer, I switched the 8k to an 11, and tossed out the 5k slow run, which was a bad idea in hindsight, but now I know.

The biggest gap in my training was the complete and total lack of strength training. I did basically nothing on that front, and I paid for it. I knew it was a mistake, I knew it would hinder me, but I was a brat and didn't do it anyway. Hopefully I learned my lesson, and I can get my act together for next year. 

My times during training weren't great, about 7:20 to 7:30 per km when I felt like cruising, but as I built experience back up, I managed to sneak some 6:50 splits in there. 

I use a FitBit Versa 3 to track, but I am DEFINITELY switching to a Garmin or something else because the new interface doesn't show individual kilometer splits on the app anymore?! It's diabolical. If anyone has figured out how to view them, please tell me. 

Pre-Race:

A week up to it I started my taper, with eeeeeeaaaasy 5ks spaced out up until two days before. They felt awful, honestly: hip pain, knee pain, out of sync breathing, the whole shebang. I just tried to stay positive and not psych myself out. I knew I wasn't going to break any PRs this year, so I just tried to focus on finishing and not stopping to walk at any point. 

The day before I carbloaded like a beast: spaghetti and meatballs made by my lovely boyfriend. I got to sleep early and woke up naturally, feeling very well rested; about 8 hours through in total, which was awesome.

Breakfast was granola, blueberries, and a banana all with soy milk, and I finished a Gatorade along with my coffee.

Race:

The weather was perfect, I thought: cool, overcast, slight breeze every now and then. The summer had been something like a middle circle of Hell, so it was a blessing that it was only about 9 degrees Celsius come race time. Made it so much more bearable. 

There was a crazy amount of people signed up for this race: the blocks were PACKED. My block couldn't even accommodate everyone, we were spilling out the sides of the guardrails. The energy was awesome though, I loved watching everyone warming up, getting ready, smiling for pictures with their families and friends who came to cheer them on. My boyfriend was a saint and came in with me, and he watched all my stuff while I trotted around, warming up. The man is a legend.

Finally the start kicked off, and I was away. My goal was to just survive the first 10k, and then worry about pacing. I kept an eye on my watch only to make sure that I stayed between a 7:45 and an 8 min per km pace for the beginning. It was so hard to stick to this as people were zooming by me left and right, but I knew I had to keep a lid on it if I wanted to be able to run the whole thing through. 

The first 10 actually went wonderfully: I felt strong and loose, and I actually got nervous that I felt this good. It honestly felt like a trick, if that makes any sense at all. My breath was on point, my arms were loose, my legs had some little aches but nothing that wasn't just part of the norm. 

I saw the 10k sign, and then I started to pick it up. I then aimed for between 7:15 and 7 minutes per km, but I did sneak one or two 6:45s in there. I made sure to reign myself back in though, since I wanted to finish strong. I was aiming for negative split times, but again, I can't see the damn splits thanks to the FitBit app changes, so I have no idea if I managed it or not, but I feel like I did stick to that based on keeping an eye on my watch. 

By km 15, I started ""fishing:"" picking a person ahead of me and reeling them in. This helped distract me from the mounting pain in my knee, which was getting harder to ignore. I caught a few, and then there was a big space between myself and the next pack, so I set my mind to cruise control and let the dulcet tones of DMX carry me through the next few kilometers.

By kilometer 18 I was in trouble. My knee was starting to really cuss me out, and my form was starting to break down. I hung on to an old trick my coach taught me about a hundred years ago, which was to focus on your arms and let them carry you forward: if your arms are going, your legs will follow. This got me through the one baby hill the course has (thank the stars for flat courses) and I made it to km marker 20. 

At this point, I was a mess. Whatever I was floating on during kilometers 14-18 was long gone: I just hope to god a photographer saw me then, and not only when I was struggling to remember what breathing was. 

As I was coming down the home stretch, the only thing keeping me running was spite and the promise of beer and pizza afterwards. When I saw the finish line, I ripped my earbuds out of my ears, flipped my visor backwards into ""turbo mode,"" and harpy-shrieked my way across the finish line. I may or may not have cried on the shoulder of a friend who met me at the line, but they were tears of elation that I had made it.

Post-Race:

My knee was done. Shot. Kaput. Walking was pain, but I was just so damn happy that I had finished the whole thing without walking that I didn't care. I had a small hope that I may have made it sub 2:30, but I wasn't all that put out that I was over. 

Me and my little group that had patiently waited for me to finish went and got pizza after I was done, and I proceeded to celebrate with multiple pints of Guinness. For the iron, you know. Very important.

Today I am dead, but beyond happy that I made it. Time to put together a plan for next year! My ultimate goal is to get sub 2 hours, so we'll see...",3,1728892267.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False

I (31nb) work a lot, as many of us do. My boyfriend (33m) does less hours than me and doesn’t have to work weekends if needed. 

I am also autistic, think high masker, no one would ever know because I mirror so well. Recently I started a new job and got to know my manager. His kids are autistic and he is incredibly good with it, most supportive parent I have seen. So I was honest about my diagnosis with him and explained for me, alone time is how I reset. It gives me time to unmask and relax so I can deal with work and life in general. 

He suggested giving me 2 Mondays off a month so I have the time to do this. Which is hella supportive and appreciated. 

Here is the problem. 

Every time I have had a Monday off, my boyfriend will call in sick or take annual leave. This throws me every time. He knows why I have the Mondays and he knows I need real alone time. Completely by myself. Yet he does it 3 out of 4 times. 

If we had a bigger home it might not be a problem, alas we live in a tiny 1 bedroom. You can hear the front door from the bedroom and anyone in the living room. 

These Mondays have become a sensory nightmare for me. He likes to play music when home, cannot stand to be in the quiet. He’ll start a random project and leave it half finished. He walks around with his work boots on so the floors are filthy. He comes and interrupts me if I am in the bedroom for some me time (as in, comes in every 20 minutes). He invites himself along if I go out for a walk, to grab coffee or to the gym. I am pushing him to talk to the doctor about an ADHD diagnosis, a lot of the signs are there. 

Basically I am asking…. 

Am I wrong for being annoyed at my partner for taking over my quiet day?

He does know why I need them and says he understands but continues to do this because “he needs time off too”. Despite the fact he has all weekend off work and I work them 🤦‍♀️",2,1728892094.0,amiwrong,3,1.0,False

A bit of detail about me: I’m F(22), NBSB, 5’5-ish, fair, chubby, and have a powerful aura with an RBF. I’m not your typical ligawin type of girl, maybe because of my strong looks and personality kaya no one even dares to try? It’s just so frustrating because I know for myself that I’m happy being alone and single since all my life naman I stayed that way. But I can’t help but get jealous of my friends who are happily in love and living their lives to the fullest. Mind you, these friends that I’m talking about are the only friends I really have. That’s why most of the time, I can’t reach them because, again, they’re busy with their other halves, which only leaves me alone and without someone to talk to or hang out with.

Madalas nga, I question myself if I’m ugly because wala talagang nagpaparamdam. Though I know for myself that I’m pretty despite being a little bit overweight due to PCOS (and also one factor why I don’t make landi because I’m very insecure about my weight), I also regret na hindi ako nag-e-explore during my teenage years because bahay at school lang ako. Ngayon naman, di naman ako maka-explore sa mga bar or whatnots dahil I don’t drink. I enjoy coffee dates, road trips, picnics, or anything relaxing, pero wala naman akong nami-meet, usually may mga jowa na.

I’m actually scared nga na hindi ko maranasan ang ma-in love and have someone be crazily in love with me.

I’ve tried almost all dating apps na nga, and recently, may nakausap ako but he wasn’t really interested sa’kin, and obviously, sex lang habol sa’kin. 2 months din kaming nag-usap and na-attach na nga ako sakanya kaso I ended up our conversation dahil mukhang wala naman siyang balak seryosohin ako.

1g3adb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1g3adb5/being_ghosted_really_sucks/,Being ghosted really sucks,"Writing this just to let this out of my chest. 

Last September, I started using a dating app (Bumble) out of curiosity then I matched with this girl from UE, at first we vibed a lot - we almost have identical interests, sense of humour, and background (parehas kaming engineering graduates, but Im from Mapúa). When we were chatting, I got know a lot about her and here's what I noticed, she's lonely - she does not find fulfillment sa life nya being sandwiched between work sa family business nila and review sa Mech Engg. boards; She doesn't even have that much friends, she's always alone. To make matters worse, earlier that month, someone broke in her house and stole her laptop. When I put all these pieces together, I really felt sorry for her and saw myself in her position so much that I really cared for her.

We've been chatting for weeks, familiar na kami even to our daily routines to the point that we moved to Facebook and Instagram to chat. I deactivated my bumble profile na din. Everyday kami naguusap, pati mga problems namin nashashare na namin and everytime that I feel like she's being hard on herself I always remind her to take a break and relax. To keep her mind at ease sa past trauma nya, I helped her pick security cameras for her place and gave guidance on how to secure the data in her stolen laptop - and to lock it so it's location can be tracked.

We then decided to meet-up for the very first time. I suggested places pero she's always busy until one day I offered that we could just hangout sa coffee place near her place in QC so she won't be wasting her time on commute - I live in Manila and her place is about 10km away from me. She told me I am the first guy that ever offered that to her and she really appreciated it.

However she compromised and we hang out in SM North instead where we had coffee. When I met her in person for the very first time I fell in love with her - I never had this feeling toward someone, like ever. She would mean everything to me. May point din na nakita nya mom nya sa mall and she's super uncomfortable and nervous about it na makita sya ng mama nya with her friends. I never want her to feel that way so we moved to Ayala Malls Vertis North then doon kami gumala, naglaro ng arcades, kumain, and chatted until di namin namalayan gabi na pala. And at the end of it she thanked me kasi she never had that chance to be happy and hugged me before taking the angkas.

And that day forward, we chatted more, we even update each other saan kami pupunta, work stuff, review stuff. And I am planning sana that we go to a firing range kasi she has never been there before, then have coffee but her schedule is very cramped. But it's okay, I always understood her and I always want the best for her. I always cared for her. I loved her.

Then, out of nowhere she became quiet bigla. I'm sending her messages pero hindi na sya nagrereply, hindi na nya nababasa. I'm so worried. Ano na nangyari sa kanya? Is she safe? Nilooban ba sya ulit? Does she need space? I don't know, Im worried. May nasabi sya sakin na minsan nawawala sya sa socmed but she's been silent like this for more than one week. But then I noticed something, she's still sharing posts and viewing my stories pero hindi nya binabasa ang messages ko. Weird right? I'm in denial at first pero my friends told me na she ghosted me na. I felt heartbroken, disappointed, and ashamed.

It took me days for this to sink-in. Pero why!? Why do I deserve this? Why do I deserve na maiwan sa ere ng ganito? Ano ba ang ginawa Kong mali to be treated this way? I loved her, I always cared for her and ginawa ko ang lahat just to make sure of that pero bakit nya ako inabandon. It's fucking painful and I'm suffering because of it. I would cry sometimes thinking about it.

Hindi na ako sinasagot sa mga socmeds nya, and now deactivated na ang accounts nya, pero I remembered na nasa akin pala yung email na ginamit nya to notify her in case somebody accesses her stolen laptop. It like a message in a bottle thrown in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, I don't know if mababasa nya or magreply sya but I just want to let her know na I truly cared for her and hope that she's alright. Maybe this is my only way to take this weight off my chest. I can't help but shed tears when I made that email on my phone. I don't know if she's going to read it or if she's going to reply.

No matter what it is I hope she's okay and I wish her all the best sa board exam and sa career nya. She ghosted me siguro due to it or maybe may nahanap syang iba na mas interesting. Maybe she will come back to me? God knows.

It's been weeks na pero I'm still struggling to move on from it. Pati mga songs na narecommend nya, interests namin like choice of food, even the place we first met brings back sad memories. Oh well, time will tell. I have given myself time to quietly grieve. I still have a life to live din.

I'm not posting this in hope na mabasa nya ito. I'm doing this to help myself in dealing with this experience. And to sympathise to those who had this similar experience.",1,1728890661.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

This is also the best room for the city view, and I highly suggest to watch the sunset, especially since we have a lovely weather today. I’m sure you will be amazed by the spectacular sight that you can’t see anywhere else.**

BF: I see. Well, that’s neat.

\[Elevator ding sound\]

**Yandere: Alright, we have arrived at 120th floor**

**Your room is on the right, at the corner of this corridor.**

BF: Okay, great!

\[Footstep, hotel door open\]

**Yandere: Welcome to your room.**

**Here’s your bag sir, all is still safe.**

\[Giving bag sound\]

**If you ever need anything, I will be your special room service for your entire stay at this hotel. Feel free to call me using that phone inside your room and press the room service button to summon me.**

**We also already prepared the welcome greeting letter and the welcome gourmet food for the two of you!**

**We have the heater and air conditioner ready in separate room, and the hot water is already filled inside the bathtub. So if you feel tired and want to dip in that bathtub, you are free to do so.**

**You can also find the wine inside the cabinet, karaoke room besides the living room and all the foods and drinks are on the house, so you can enjoy everything for free without worrying about anything at all.**

**If you ever want to order a different kind of food, there will be a menu book near the telephone, just say the word and we will bring them here to you.**

**Also here’s your room key sir. You might see the door doesn’t have a door latch, but it’s actually intended that way. We use the highest security system so when you lock the door, you don’t need any manual door latches anymore, the door is as strong as military grade solitary door. Only you who own this key card can lock and unlock the door, so please don’t lost this key, okay?**

**That concludes all the information. Is there anything you would like to ask?**

BF: Oh wow, that’s really thorough and complete. Thank you \[yandere's name\], everything is good.

**Yandere: I’m glad to hear that. Now then, sir and lovely madam, if you would excuse me, please enjoy your stay at our hotel today. Have a nice day!**

BF: Thank you, and have a nice day too!

\[Door close\]

BF: Mmmm, this room smells so nice, I wonder what perfume or aromatherapy they used, must be a luxury one. Oh wow, what a greeting! Am I right sweetheart?

\[Listener footsteps and window curtain open sound\]

\[Chuckles\] Oh, you really interested in the city view huh? I can see you running happily towards the window. Aww, that’s really cute of you \[Laugh\].

…

BF: Well, I mean, it’s really a beautiful sight to behold, it’s really beautiful. Look, isn’t that where your house is?

…

BF: Yeah, it is! Oh, I remember that bookstore and bakery store around your neighborhood!

…

BF: \[Chuckles\] You really are so happy huh? \[Sigh\] I really wish time could stop, There’s nothing more beautiful than seeing you smile and happy like this.

…

BF: You want time to move faster? But why? \[Chuckles\] I would rather time to move slow if I was you.

…

BF: Oh right! The sunset! You really love sunset that much huh. I was surprised when the hotel staff mentioned about seeing the sunset from this floor. I can see you holding your grin face in the elevator back then \[Chuckles\].

BF: Actually, I don’t really like that staff, it might be just me, but it feels like he always wants to praise you and hit you. I know he offered to help whenever we needed, but I’d rather we not so that we won’t see him anymore.

…

BF: I shouldn’t worry about that? Well, I don’t know, I have a bad feeling whenever I saw him, but oh well, you’re right. We should just think about our time here and enjoy everything that we can.

…

BF: But you know, speaking of time, like it or not, time will pass normally despite I want it to be slow and you want it to be fast. But anyway, \[sniff sniff\], oh, isn’t the food smell so amazing? C’mon, we should enjoy the food while it’s still hot!

…

BF: \[Chukles\] You know me, I love to eat, hahaha.

I mean, when else can we enjoy this high-quality gourmet food? I bet they even have Michelin star chef cooked this for us.

BF: Now that I think about it, this is such a luxury date for us, right?

…

BF: Hehehe, yeah, let’s just say it that way. The universe is really on our side huh.

Anyway, c’mon, let’s enjoy this food!

\[Cutlery sound, After eating\]

BF: Oh wow, the food is amazing. I can’t believe we really eat everything on the table.

Ohh, but for some reason I’m kinda sleepy, maybe I’ll lay down on the bed.

…

BF: You’re feeling sleepy too sweetheart? Oh wow, you immediately jump on the bed huh. \[Chuckles\], look at you, you usually said that we shouldn’t sleep after eating, we will become a cow, but look at you now hahaha.

I guess, just for today, we both will be a cow huh.

Ohh, but with how fluffy and comfortable this bed is, I think I don’t mind being a cow for a day.

What am I saying anyway?

Sweetheart, are you still awake?

Oh wow, you already sleep.

Well, I will go to sleep too, good night sweetheart.

…

\[door unlock, footsteps\]

The yandere who’s watching everything using the camera finally sneaks in into the room after knowing they both fell asleep soundly\*

**Yandere: \[Yandere laugh\] Ahahaha, finally.**

\*Proud emotion\*

**After waiting all this time, I know this day would come. I can’t wait to make you mine and mine alone.**

\*disgusted emotion\*

**Yandere: I know you two will stay asleep no matter what I do, so get lost you filthy trash.**

**I don’t want to see your disgusting face.**

\[Yandere pushes \[BF\] away from the bed and he fell, and Yandere gets on top of the bed\]

\*Soft emotion\*

**Yandere: Oh precious darling, look at how beautiful you are. Ohh, your hair is a little bit messy tho. Tch, this disgraceful trash of a person didn’t know how to treat you well. If only you lived with me, I would take care of every inch of your hair, I’ll give you the best skin care and I’ll definitely give you the smoothest silky dress you could wear so it won’t scratch your body skin.**

\[Sniff\]

**Yandere: Mhmm, you smell so good, darling.**

**\[Yandere laugh\] Oh hahahaha, you really are so beautiful and I’m so happy I can enjoy this masterpiece at this close range. I can already imagine living with you and seeing you smile, while we eat your favorite food together. Or, we sit at our garden bench, admiring your favorite flowers while drinking coffee and just talk about how many children you want to raise with me. Oh, I know you will become such a great mother and a housewife of mine.**

\*Very excited\*

**\[Yandere laughter\]**

**Yandere: Oh my gosh, I can’t contain my laughter, I really cant!**

**C’mon, control yourself. All you need to do is hypnotize them and everything will be in your hand! You have subconsciously given suggestions to them when they arrive, you also already put aromatherapy in this room to empower the hypnosis effect. You got this.**

**Don’t ruin your one and only chance!**

\[Inhales and exhales to calm yourself\]

\[We start by hypnotizing the listener, since \[BF\] is still fell down from the bed\]

**Yandere: Okay, okay. Let’s do this.**

**Remember the voice that you hear right now.**

**Let this voice be the only melody inside your dream and unconscious realm as you sleeping peacefully right now.**

**Just pretend that this is your boyfriend and future husband.**

**You know that “your new boyfriend” keeps telling you how lovely you are when we met at the receptionist's desk a few minutes ago.**

**That’s because your new boyfriend really loves you. He is your boyfriend after all.**

**Remember my voice carefully and let this deep voice be eternalized inside your heart and your mind.**

**I got you, you are mine and mine alone. Nobody can take you from me and you don’t need anyone else except your boyfriend.**

**I am your boyfriend.**

**You will only care about me and only love me.**

**When you wake up, you can’t see people’s faces clearly, but that’s normal.**

**Because you have been like that since you were born, it’s a common thing for you.**

**You always live your life knowing people from their voices.**

**The only voice you recognize is this deep loving voice, your boyfriend’s voice.**

**You will only remember my voice and you will obey everything I said to you.**

**You love me and your love language is obedience to your boyfriend.**

**The more you obey your boyfriend, the more your boyfriend loves you.**

**You can not live without your boyfriend’s love.**

**The more you listen to your boyfriend’s voice, the more you fall deeper and deeper in love with him.**

**When you wake up and you listen to someone’s yelling at you, you will build more and more hatred towards that person. To the point where you will feel disgusted about them.**

**But don’t worry, when you feel scared, your boyfriend will protect and comfort you. So you can trust whole your body and soul to your boyfriend.**

**If you understand what your boyfriend just said, slowly open your mouth and close it again.**

**…**

**\[Yandere laugh\]**

**Ahahahaha**

\*Excited maniac enjoyment emotion\*

**I can finally own you now!**

**Oh, it feels so good to finally have you as mine. But before I enjoy you thoroughly, let me clean this trash real quick first.**

**…**

\*Irritated tone\*

**Hmmm, I really want to kill you and torture you on the spot. I mean, look at you, you’re pathetically sleeping under the bed, looking very worthless. I don’t even want to step or kick you because you will bring filth to my feet. I don’t even want to think about ordering you to lick my feet to clean them from your filth, that’s how disgusting and low you are.**

**Argh, thinking about you just boiling my blood. I know for the fact that all your families and MY Girlfriend’s family and peers all know about both of your relationships. If suddenly you went missing and the police and investigator tracked everything, that would bring a bad taste to my mouth. There’s a reason I still stayed clean up until now. If there’s a single chance this could also taint my darling, I would rather not do it.**

**…**

**Hmm.**

**Oh, I know!**

**\[Evil sinister laugh\] Hahaha, I know exactly what should I do.**

**Ohhh, I want to see your expression too, I can already imagine what your face would look like and how you would react to that.**

**Ahh, nothing beats the pleasure of seeing someone’s life being destroyed like that. I can also come clean without needing to kill you myself.**

**\[Yandere laugh\]**

**Well then, let’s start by restraining your movement so you won’t harm me, or my girlfriend.**

\[**Yandere** hypnotizing BF\]

**Listen to my voice.**

\[Add a random whisper noise, just to add suspense curiosity, so that the listener will wonder what will the Yandere do or say to the boyfriend\]

**Psspspspspsps \[Any whisper noise\]**

…

\[Few minutes later\]

BF: \[Groan\] Ugh, what happen to me? It feels like I’ve been hit by a truck.

**Yandere: Oh, it seems that you have been awake \[chuckles\]**

BF: H-huh? \[Yandere's name\]? What are you doing in my room?

\*Manipulative tone, baiting BF to get angry\*

**Yandere: Isn’t it obvious? Can’t you even process what’s happening right now?**

**\[Sniff\] Ahh, she smells so wonderful.**

BF: Wait. Hey! What are you doing with my girlfriend?

Get. Off. From. Her. Right. Now.

**Yandere: Your girlfriend? This girl? The one I’m cuddling right now?**

**\[Evil chuckles\] You think I would just listen to you like that huh?**

**Aren’t you being delusional? She IS my girlfriend. She is mine. MINE.**

BF: What the hell are you talking about?

She’s definitely not yo-

H-huh? Why can’t I move?

**Yandere: \[Satisfied evil laugh\]** 

**Hahaha, can’t even use your pathetic idiot brain to comprehend what’s happening huh?**

**Well then, allow me kiss my darling right now. Aren’t I being so kind to you right now?**

**You should be grateful and thank me.**

**\[Kiss on the cheek sound\]**

PS: If you’re uncomfortable with kissing, you can say “let me caress her hair real quick”

BF: DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH HER!

**Yandere: Oh yeah, I forgot.**

**This is an order, be grateful and thank me now.**

BF: T-thank you for your kindness \[Yandere\].

\[Inner thought\]

H-huh? Why did I say that?

**Yandere: \[Satisfied laughter\]**

**Ahahahaha, I can’t believe it actually working!**

**Ahh, all my masterplan really paid off.**

BF: STOP SCREWING WITH ME.

HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!

**Yandere: Whoa chill, dude, you’ll just tire yourself screaming like that.**

**Did you forgot? This room is soundproofed. Nobody will hear you scream.**

**Besides, if you keep yelling like that, you will wake up my darling.**

**You don’t want to disturb my darling, would you?**

BF: I HAD ENOUGH WITH YOUR CRAP. SHE’S MY GIRLFRIEND!

GET AWAY FROM HER RIGHT NOW!

**Yandere: Or what? What can you even do? \[Evil chuckles\]**

BF: \[Inner thought\]

Ah, dang it. Is there really no way I can move at all?

How the hell is all of this happening?

**Yandere: \[Chuckles\] Yes, there really is no way you can move at all.**

**You must be wondering how the hell all of this happening huh?**

BF: \[Inner thought\]

Wait what? How did he know what I was thinking about?

**Yandere: Well, let me use this chance to explain everything to you.**

**In summary, I have hypnotized you.**

**Even though you are not chained or tied up, you can’t move a single muscle right?**

**I did that.**

**I also make you say out loud whatever you were thinking inside your mind.**

**So I will know everything about you. \[Evil laugh\]**

BF: \[Sigh\] But why?

Why would you do such a horrible thing?

What did I do wrong? I don’t even know who you are!

\*The background story begins\*

**Yandere: Exactly!**

**I don’t care about you at all. I only care for this sweet beautiful lovely darling besides me.**

BF: What do you mean?

What do you want to do with her?

**Yandere: That hurt my feeling, you know. Don’t think bad about me. I just want to take care of her.**

**You did a bad job taking care of your, \*ahem\*, ex-girlfriend.**

**I can’t take it anymore, that’s why I did all of this so that I can claim her and take care of her.**

BF: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY!?

**Yandere: Hey, chill dude. Relax. Let me tell you a story.**

**It all began when I met her randomly at a cafe. I can’t really explain it, it’s not only like love at the first sight. I do feel a strong feeling whenever I see her. I can’t even describe this weird feeling, like it’s a fate that I met her, and I must own her and make her mine.**

**With her smile, her beautiful eyelashes, her cute outfit, the way she walked, that glowing skin, the silky hair. Oh, she is so perfect. I can still remember all the details about her.**

**So anyway, I followed her because I want to get to know about her more. About where she lived, what activities she did, what is her hobby, her favorite food, and so on. The more I get to know her, the happier I became, and I need to know her more.**

BF: Did you stalk her? What the hell?

That’s a crime you know! 

**Yandere: Shh, what do you know about crime. You can’t even move and you don’t even have any proof don’t you?**

**Tch, be smart for a moment, won’t you? You keep wasting the earth’s oxygen just yelling unimportant stuff.**

**Anyway, let me continue.**

**Long story short, it pains me to know that she got a boyfriend already. You.**

**That irritates me a lot.**

**What’s the charm she saw in you anyway? I really don’t get it. If only she knows me, I could make her happier and have better life quality than what you did.**

**…**

**Oh, you’re not gonna say anything huh.**

**Oh well, anyway. You know those annoying ads that keeps popping out randomly when you browse the internet?**

**Yeah, I got those things when I explore more about my darling sweetheart’s social media.**

**Would you believe it? \[Chuckles\] One of them is about hypnosis!**

**…**

**Hahaha, even if you won’t say anything, I can see your expression clearly!**

**You even thought it’s such a scam right? Yeah, that’s what I thought too! There’s no way that would work.  At that time, I just try it on a whim, if it doesn’t work, at least it was free. But hey, look at me now. I have both you and my sweet darling in my hand now.**

**Do you thought that hotel lottery ticket was a coincidence? \[Yandere laughter\].**

**What if I told you everything that happened today, even all the thing before this too, all because of me?**

BF: Huh? What do you mean coincidence? What are you talking about?

**Yandere: \[Sigh\] I guess nobody can appreciate a genius, unless they’re a genius themselves.**

**Fine then, let me elaborate.**

**What if I told you I manipulate the hotel’s owner to make a lottery event?**

**What if I also hypnotize the owner to assign me as the event director?**

**Where I set it in a way that the winner is already predetermined?**

**Then I give it to a stranger and also hypnotized him so he gave the ticket to my lovely darling?**

**That the winner will be assigned to the 120th floor room, where only VVIP member can enter this floor?**

**That I would be assigned as the personal room service for the winner so I can intentionally bring the welcome food and drug it?**

**What if I told you, when we first met at the receptionist desk, I have already conditioned both of you and my sweet darling, and with just a little bit more push, I can hypnotize you when you’re unconscious?** 

**\[Satisfied laughter\]**

**Hahahaha, I’m such a genius masterplan, am I?**

**Ohh boy, it feels so good to see your speechless reaction.**

**We teach kids to not take candy from stranger, and what’s the difference between that and this lottery ticket? It’s basically the candy! I just get creative with the food choice here.**

\*After knowing all of it, BF lost his energy\*

BF: \[Gasp\]

I… I…

H-how could you…

You shouldn’t manipulate people like that!

It’s, it’s…

It’s not right to do what you have done!

**Yandere: Oh, why would you even bother with that.**

**\[Sigh\] You know what,**

**Hey darling, it’s time for you to wake up.**

**C’mon darling, wakey wakey.**

BF: What did you do to her?

Tell me!

What suggestion did you implanted inside her!?

**Yandere: \[Yandere laugh\] Oh, you’ll see soon.**

**Hey darling, finally you wake up.**

**Where’s my good morning kiss?**

**\[Kiss sound\]**

BF: HEY, STOP CORRUPTING HER!? YOU’RE NOT HER BOYFRIEND

GET AWAY FROM HER!

**Yandere: Whoa, take it easy man, don’t yell.**

**Don’t you see she just awake? Don’t scare my darling like that.**

BF: STOP SAYING HER AS YOUR DARLING.

YOU SHOULD-

\*broken hearted voice\*

H-hey…

Y-you’re…

You’re kidding me right?

H-hey sweetheart, sweetheart?

D-did you just say “stay away from me?”

H-hey, it’s me!

I’m your boyfriend.

We have known each other for a long time.

I mean, look, you have that ring on your finger, it’s matching with my-

**Yandere: \[Evil chuckles\] Ahahahaha, you mean this ring?**

**Oh, you’re right, she is already in a relationship.**

**Here, look, her ring and mine is matching.**

**Hey darling, do you know who this person is?**

**…**

\*On verge of tears\*

BF: Y-you, you must be joking, right?

Hey, sweetheart, please.

Please, stop saying that.

Stop giving me that disgusting look.

I- I…

…

**Yandere: \[Satisfied laughter\] Ahahaha, you should look at how pathetic you are right now.**

**Oh wow, I could enjoy this moment all of my life.**

**But hey, it’s gonna be sunset soon and I don’t want to ruin the sweet moment between me and my girlfriend with your existence here.**

**…**

\*BF crying and broken\*

**Oh don’t you worry, I’ll make you forget everything that happened today, including the memory about the lottery ticket.**

**Then the next day, I’ll make it so “your girlfriend” will break up with you out of nowhere, saying bad things about you, despite it’s a lie, and convinced all of your peers and family to see how horrible of a person you are. That way, you will suffer for the rest of your life without even knowing why is all of that happening.**

**Oh, I can already imagine the confused look on your face, how heart broken you will be again and how you will suffer this for the rest of your life.**

**\[Chuckles\] Everybody will think that you’re delusional and crazy, meanwhile, I will have the best time of my life here, enjoying this luxury five star hotel stay with my darling, and spend the rest of my life alone with “My Girlfriend”**

BF: Y-you’re a monster!

I, I swear…

I swear I’ll get my revenge, and I’ll rescue her from you.

Mark my word!

**Yandere: Ahahahaha, oh, be my guest.**

**You just all bark and no bite anyway.**

**How can you do things that you don’t even remember what you should do?**

**Here’s my order.**

**Forget about everything that has happened today.**

**Also forget about everything related to this hotel and the lottery event.**

**Starting tomorrow, you will live your life normally, settled a date with her tomorrow evening, and spend all of your savings to buy the most expensive ring for her.**

**Now go, go away from this room and go home.**

**I have a personal date with my girlfriend that I want to enjoy.**

**\[Satisfied yandere laughter\]**

**Ahahahaha, I can’t wait to see your life crumbles**

\[Inner thought\]

BF: Sweetheart, I promise, I’ll reach your heart again.

My psychiatrist put me on Elvanse because Ritalin was really awful for me (it only worked for 1-2 hours, then I'd crash really hard, I would shake and cry and feel extremely miserable lol) and Elvanse is weird because if I take it for a few days it starts to really mess with my head. I was started on 30mg but had to go down to 20 after a few weeks because I started getting really paranoid as soon as the meds started to wear off. They would last around 6 hours and I'd spend the rest of the day feeling like someone was standing behind me, or that I'd catch a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye that wasn't there. 
Unfortunately, 20mg didn't work so well for me either because it would work maybe 4-5 hours and I'd be extremely exhausted the rest of the day, and now it doesn't really work at all anymore (2-3 hours and I get very irritable/angry afterwards). 
I started taking 30mg again and now I've started feeling paranoid again and I don't know what to do! I need these meds to work, when I'm unmedicated I make mistakes and get in trouble with my boss, I'm still in my apprenticeship. 
I've been doing all the things you're supposed to do, I've been eating the proteins and I don't have problems with eating when I'm on my meds (it's actually easier than when I'm unmedicated), I don't drink coffee or caffeine, I don't smoke cigarettes or weed or drink alcohol, I try to exercise once a week and I sleep at least 6-7 hours a night. I've taken Elvanse and the Ratiopharm generic pills. While the generic feels better I'm still getting paranoid when on them. 


What can I do? Is there any other option out there? I live in Germany, where there aren't as many options as in the US. My psychiatrist wants me to try Ritalin again but because it was so horrible the first time I obviously don't want to do that. ",2,1728890319.0,ADHDmeds,1,1.0,False

""With the love that I am shown in Narcotics Anonymous, I have no excuse for loneliness.""

.

Addiction is a lonely disease. We may be surrounded by people but, sooner or later, our addiction drives a wedge between us and even our closest loved ones. Many of us are driven to Narcotics Anonymous by a desperate loneliness.

Though we may approach the rooms of NA with caution and suspicion, we are welcomed with a hug, a smile, and a warm ""keep coming back."" This may be the first place where we have felt welcome in a long, long while. We watch other members talking and laughing, leaving the meeting in groups for more talk at the local coffee shop. We wonder if we, too, could become a part of this loving bunch.

Our pattern of isolation can make it difficult for us to join in. Over time, however, we begin to feel ""a part of"" rather than ""apart from."" Soon, when we walk into the rooms, we feel at home. We begin to make friends and our lives start to change.

NA teaches us how to overcome our isolation. Through our first tentative friendships formed in our home group, we start to find that making friends isn't hard. A sense of belonging comes when we share ourselves with others.

I’m currently studying and living alone for the first time in my life, not doing that much exercise and just started to eat better food. That’ll not help that much.

The thing is that everytime I drink coffee or mate I just start to have this horrible anxiety/palpitations, no matter if I eat before. I noticed a lot of people go through this, but they never say if there are a way to drink it after some time of if they have to cut the mate drinking definitely from their lives

* **Day 18-19:** Explore Medellin and day trip to Guatapé.
* **Day 20-21:** Overnight trip to Jardin via public buses for Coffee plantation visit, returning to Medellin.
* **Day 22:** Fly Medelling to Pereira, then bus to Solento.
* **Day 23-24:** Solento, Cocora Valley, Coffee plantations.
* **Day 25:** Morning bus from Solento to Pereira, then flight to Bogota. Explore Bogota.
* **Day 26:** Explore Bogota.
* **Day 27-28:** Flight Bogota to UK (arriving the following day due to timezone differences).

**Notes:**

* I have the time off to add in one additional day anywhere to this trip. If day 1 is a Saturday this has me arriving back in the UK on a Friday. I am happy to return 1 day later on a Saturday, allowing for recovering on Sunday before returning to work. I feel this is maybe best added to Medellin or Jardin, but I'm not sure.
* On day 12, depending on flight times and exact tour used, it might be possible to start the tour on that same day, freeing up one additional day.
* Debating skipping Guatape entirely. I know I'm doing the tourist trail this entire trip but this one feels egregious.

[ Are you ready to go skiing in one of the most popular resorts on the planet? When planning the best off-piste skiing in Europe, St. Anton in Austria has to be part of this tour. ](https://www.alpenature.com/services/off-piste-guiding/)

Before you do so, though, allow us to forewarn you that managing jet lag and altitude can be a bit complicated and challenging if you are from Singapore.

# Jet Lag: What is it, and Why Does it Happen?

Jet lag is when your body clock is out of synchronization and results in disruption when you travel. When you move from Singapore to Austria, the time difference will wreak havoc with your body clocks. But you may feel drained, lack sleep, or even feel grumpy. This may ruin the rest of your holiday, especially if you stay at a **St Anton ski resort**.

# Tips to Beat Jet Lag

* **Start Adjusting Before You Fly:** Three days before the, start adjusting your time for Austria so that you arrive during the night or early morning. Take one hour forward or backward to sleep. For instance, if you plan to arrive in Austria at 8 AM, start waking up and going to bed an hour earlier each day. This gradual adjustment will make the transition smoother.
* **Stay Hydrated:** Be sure to drink plenty of water before taking the flight. Cabin air is very dry, and dehydration can worsen jet lag. Staying well-hydrated can also help your body adjust to the new time zone more easily.
* **Avoid Alcohol and Caffeine:** Of all the things that they can do to your health or affect you, they can mess with your sleep. Eating cheese, crackers, cookies, or even having coffee or wine on the flight is a lure, but it is best to stick to water.
* **Get Some Sunlight:** When you get to St. Anton, come out in the open to take pictures in natural light. Natural light helps regulate the body clock, which can be disrupted by jet lag. It also increases energy levels, helping you feel more awake and alert.
* **Take Short Naps:** If you get the urge to rest, take a power nap, which should be between half an hour and an hour. It can help you rebuild energy without disrupting your night's sleep.

My husband is a junior doctor and his parents have helped him along the way but like all Asian parents do.

His dad works a low level job despite having a PhD 
and the mum doesn’t work.

They were all living together in a home my husband paid for and is held in his name. This was then separated into a town house  as I refused to live with them.

I really and getting annoyed with them. They are lazy, there house is dusty and gross and they keep trying to get my husband to help and speak to random relatives overseas. The mum watches tv all day every day and the dad comes home from work and does the same.

They are also very cheap and when we go anywhere my husband always pays for a car etc.They also bring their own coffee from home and food and eat it in cafes. I find this super embarrassing and do not like it at all. I feel they just lack all social class and manners.
They also lack all awareness of money. My husband is looking for a car and they keep suggesting things way over the budget, despite making no financial contribution at all.

We are planning to move in two years and again I see issues. Like I don’t mind giving them half the sale price to buy something but I don’t want to make any financial contribution personally to them but also they can’t be unreasonable with expectations. We can’t buy them a house for that price only a unit 

How can I set boundaries with my husband re this
I am currently working virtually overseas but will also look for a local job so that I can obtain a loan for the purchase. I am a professional btw and should be able to secure a decent income although not as high as my home country at the start. ",1,1728889665.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

1g3a3qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1g3a3qa/need_advice_about_custody_agreement/,Need advice about custody agreement,"Long story short; My husband left me to pursue a polyamorous relationship with another woman. We separated, I got my own apartment, we shared the kids (teenagers, 50-50). He regretted his decision after just a few weeks, asked to come back, I stupidly said yes, thought we worked on reconciling, but it turns out that he's doubting his decision to come back and we're heading for divorce. 

  
Meanwhile, the other woman has shown som really unhinged behavior. She faked a pregnancy while they were together, showed up at his job, she apparently tried to commit suicide, she was committed in a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks, she sent me and my husband's parents messages claiming that I'm keeping him ""hostage"" by threatening to take the kids away from him. She also brought her psychologist friend who works in child protective services along for a coffee with my husband to tell him that the kids will be fine even if he leaves me. The whole poly thing has also been super unstable with partners coming and going. All this has happened over the last six months. 

I really don't want this person in my kids' life. I've accepted that my husband might leave me, but I'm worried about the instability and craziness that comes with her. So I wanted a clause in the custody agreement saying that she is not allowed to have anything to do with the kids for a year. But then I talked to my friend who pointed out that our kids are teenagers, and they probably don't want to have anything to do with her anyway (they didn't last time he left). And that having this clause will only increase the conflict between me and my husband and also giving the new woman reason to be even more unhinged. Both kids are old enough to basically decide for themselves where they want to live, and will have a say in how the agreement will look like, according to the law where we live.

• My energy has been significantly higher whilst fasting
•I no longer need crutches to get through a fast like black coffee, tea etc…

Context: 

Me and him used to have a pretty long history. We used to like each other but then it got super toxic and only sexual. I lost feelings and wanted to move on. We stopped talking a month ago and I had him blocked. Weeks later, he randomly messages off a new number and we start talking again on snap. He says he misses me, wants me, all that BS. And it sounded genuine. Like he truly missed ME, not just my body. I sort of softened and thought maybe he’s changed. We agreed to hang out but he wasn’t rly taking any initiative to plan it which confused me since he kept telling me how much he missed me. He started to take forever to respond and his messages became dry.

We finally agreed to meet up today at a coffee shop at 4 pm. He didn’t text me at all this morning to confirm or to check in (which he said he would) so I ended up texting him around 2 pm to confirm. I asked if we could meet at 5 pm instead cuz I was finishing up an assignment that I’d been working on since early morning. 

His response was really rude. He said no and that I shouldn’t waste his time and kept asking if I was coming at 4pm or not. I told him that I was coming but that I’d be ready by 5pm. 

I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since we were only meeting at a coffee shop then possibly going back to his place to watch a movie. He then said he wanted me over at 4 pm before his parents came home, which I did NOT know about. I even asked him the night before if today was a good day to meet (since it’s thanksgiving the next day) and he assured me that it was fine. 

Anyway, we argue a little abt that and he ends up saying it’s still okay to meet up and to leave as soon as I can. At this point im rushing to finish my hair and makeup. I did feel bad for being late and I would’ve gotten ready earlier but I wasn’t certain if our plan was still happening or not since he hadn’t texted or said anything this morning. He was also barely communicating w me this past week. 

Now this is when all goes to shit. I finished getting ready and as i was about to leave he randomly tells me that he only wants to meet to smash. I got upset and stopped responding. I was already dressed up and didn’t know what to do w myself. I did have a feeling he was gonna make a move on me at his place but I didn’t think that was the SOLE reason he wanted to see me. Maybe I would’ve been fine w it if he’d been more respectful. 

He ends up saying he’s joking and to leave soon. I tell him I don’t wanna go over to his place anymore and that im okay w just hanging out at the coffee shop. I was super uncomfortable but still wanted to see him (idek why). He then proceeded to tell me to stay home because it was too late to hang out and that we can hangout tomorrow (on thanksgiving when his family is over???). At that point I got really upset. I spent 2.5 hours (2:30 pm to 5 pm) getting ready and was updating him the whole time. I put a lot of effort into my makeup and used all my high end products. 

Our entire conversation happened on snap btw and I ended up blocking him on it after our argument so I can’t show it unfortunately. He was blaming me for cancelling and I was fed up. 

I felt like an idiot after for thinking that he liked me for more than just my body. I admit I cried. I ended up going out by myself and getting a hot chocolate at a cafe bc I didn’t want my makeup and hair to go to waste

I’m sick and tired. I was doing fine before he reached out again. It’s like he purposely did all of this just to torture me.
