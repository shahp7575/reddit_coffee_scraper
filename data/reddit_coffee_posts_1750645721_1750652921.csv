I feel hopeless and I feel sometimes like I just wanna cry and cry, I wonder all the time why this happened to me, and the depression and loneliness I feel is something else. 
I have loved coffee my entire life, now I don’t drink coffee because it spikes my T, before this condition one of my favorite plans to do was going to a coffee shop and talk to my friends and relax enjoying a good cup of coffee, I miss my old version where I didn’t have to worry about how loud the place I hang out was, and the list can go on… I guess what upset me the most was the way I got T, I used eardrops ciprodex because a not confirmed infection and the Doctor I went to see in ER told me to use the eardrops he said it would prevent an infection just in case, he said it shouldn’t caused me T, I asked him like Twice and he said I was good to go, now I find myself here feeling miserable, if I wouldn’t have put those eardrops in my ears 👂 I would be pretty much the same happy and positive girl I always was, now there is not much left to me about happiness and positivity. 
Sorry for venting like this I just really feel alone. The feeling of guilt is also everyday in my mind for going to ER, I had itchy ears and I went the same day  just to make sure everything was fine, I should have waited and not going to Er so probably I would not have this T and sensitivity. 
For all T sufferers, you are strong and tough people.

(AKA: Loading) (Pt.1/4?)","***Introduction by Dr. Charles V. Irrinquist***

The following story is a tableau, told in the science fiction genre, of an alternate reality, in which the government has passed and enacted a law to attempt to deal with human vulnerability to the deceptions of deepfakes and other AI-generated imagery. The law states that, if all of the persons depicted in an AI-generated image or video (called “Aimages,” for shorthand) “hang” that Aimage in their own, respective Encrypted Accounts, then what is depicted in the Aimage is considered to be legally “real” (i.e.: to have “actually” happened or to  “actually” be happening), and society at large has accepted this. Society and law do recognize that the depicted events “really” happened, but not in our world, rather “real” in whatever virtual reality world the Aimage was created with.

Developed by various, major techcorps, in conjunction with US government departments identified as “Interested Parties,” Encrypted Accounts (EA) serve as “digital safes,” where users (i.e.: citizens) store important and sensitive information, such as social security numbers, digital birth certificates, bank records, digital family pictures, Aimages, etc. They are similar to social media profiles but are specifically designed to be nonpublic. These accounts are said to be unhackable and are insured. Each United States citizen is entitled to their own EA; it is just a matter of signing up, a process which they have made so simple it would be foolish not to set one up. The vast majority of citizens of the ensuing story’s world have set up their EAs. 

One of the features of EAs is the “Gallery,” which, just as the name suggests, looks like a digital art gallery, with white walls that have spaces to “hang” images/videos/Aimages (users are able to customize the look of their Gallery). When an Aimage is hung, an ovular icon appears on the white wall below it, called an Indicator, which turns a bright green when each of the subjects portrayed in the Aimage have also hung the same Aimage in their EA, indicating not only the Aimage’s legally “real” status but also the implication that each participant is wanting to (continue to) participate with the others performing whatever activity is being portrayed in the Aimage. 

Further, the government imposes a tax on these hung Aimages, which then naturally governs the amount of Aimages that are (and stay) hung. Not only does this limitation have the effect of maintaining the integrity of the “real” legal designation, but it helps to deal with the incredible amount of power required to keep these Aimages hung in the EAs (said to be several levels higher than what is required for mining Bitcoin, and even Titgroin), and also to curb the use of resources required to tax assess Aimages by the Department of Auditing.

We will look at how these policies were developed, and what such a world, in which humans and AI robots live together, may look like. The main narrative revolves around the generation of an Aimage involving our protagonist known only to us as Narrator and his escort neighbor, Caramel. 

However, a word to the reader: though portrayed in narrative form, as mentioned above, these scenes may be most appropriately considered as tableaus–-these are not works of criticism or satire but rather intended to evoke an impression or feeling about whatever-it-is that is being presented. As such, base language is used in order to most efficiently attempt to express that whatever-it-is.

This baseness is reflected in the logic of the story’s world. For example, the childish insult of calling someone or something “gay,” whether in the homophobic or just generally derisive sense, is in the story’s world not so much an insult but something holding serious rhetorical heft. In the story’s world, the term has been largely stripped of the nastiness it carries in our culture, instead denoting a general (unspecified) negative quality (and that which has been evaluated as such). Despite this “stripped” meaning in the story’s world, it is intentionally understood that (hopefully) the hypothetical reader would be reading it in this world’s “unstripped” context.

Another word (and perhaps warning) to the reader: this piece contains graphic sexual content. Sexual-drive motivates much of the action in the story, but in the story’s world this isn’t just perverts running amok. In our real-life world, sexual motivation is primarily related to pathos, whereas in the story’s world, it is primarily the story world’s ethos. The characters are speaking through these base, sexual acts and language; it may be useful to think of the characters’ actions as metaphors for the whatever-it-is mentioned above. 

Conceptually, what connects this baseness to the AI concerns mentioned above? It may revolve around the notion of the “real;” due to the tax constraints imposed to have an Aimage considered “real,” it is likely the only type of Aimages people would be willing to keep hung in their EAs would be those portraying enactments of great devotion, and at least in the story, these are of a religious or sexual nature. The motivations behind belief/faith and sexual impulses may be described as “base.” If, as represented in the story, the religious/sexual is “real” and also “base,” it may be deduced that the “base” is “real.”  

The story begins with a seemingly unrelated prelude, revolving around a real-life incident about Swedish twin sisters who came to national attention in the United Kingdom in May 2008 after an apparent episode of *folie a deux* (“shared psychosis”), when the twins ran across the M6 motorway, as captured by a small television crew. 



The main focus of this opening sequence is on an unnamed police officer’s experience on the scene, who is woken from a daydream and unsuccessfully restrains one of the twin sisters from running into traffic. Shortly thereafter he experiences an odd, phantom force physically pulling him by his testicles toward the accident site (the writer seems to be making a reference to pairs: the character’s “balls;’ the seemingly random paragraph noting embedded base*ball* references; the Swedish twins (possibly a reference to the Minnesota Twins baseball team–particularly because of the history of Swedish and Scandinavian immigration to that area)).

 Let us begin the story.



**Prelude**

 Ursula Eriksson, a Swedish tourist, ran into traffic on the M6 freeway in Britain, right into the side of a Mercedes Actros 2546 lorry. This was caught on not just CCTV but also the cameras for the television show, *Motorway Cops*, an English analogue to the American programme, *Cops*. 

Ursula received aid and survived; the interest here though is in the lorry. Its cargo wall had imprinted on it the 32ndth-inch outline of what would be a crazed Swedish woman’s face. This indent, too indistinct and unformed for friends or family to identify, didn’t miss Admiral Group’s Herman Waylight, an expert on lorry damage and claim spoilage assessment, and seemingly a giver-of-deal.

Yet one Motorway Cop possessed bold claims. 

Taken out from the clouds by Meechum Peenis and Craig Morjaggs’s sudden verbal commands to “get back!”, and sensing only the pitches of fellow officers in need of backup, he shook out of his daydream and instinctively moved toward attendance for support; he flew by all the other officers without thinking like a wave and just moments before her accident, he found himself here standing 2 to 1.65 meters closer to Ursula than the next nearest chaperone: he had just assigned himself the task of restraining what would surely prove to be a wriggling villain. 

During the physical struggle, he erred in judgment, yanking only a sandal out from the exchange and in so doing he freed her foot to spring her toward her journey through the overground railroad. In the sign of impact (the “strike zone” as it is called in the auto insurance field), he recognized her and now could not shake Ursula in the outline. “Fielding Urs-,” as he would later call it (he would see his balding—*out, out, and out it goes*—increase in pace starting around then basically), would make its presence here known to him (at least in, what he called, its “four sack,” or most developed, form).\*\*\*

Bill Stoneham, our man here, shares a name with an obscure American painter, who produced a work called, *The Hands Resist Him* (1972), notable for being known as being considered one of the most haunted paintings in the world. In Bill’s pocket was a sterling, whose ridges rubbed gently against a grocery receipt for glassware, cereal, pork, and liter bottles of mineral water, the latter of which stood in for the hose water, packaged in gallon jugs, he wished was commercially available. Stoneham noticed an odd pressure in his groin. 

“Get your hands out of your pocket,” Veronica passed by, doing her job, and he needed to do his job, and everything was occupied, and he stood there, his head, full of blood. Veronica knelt to attend to Sabina, Ursula’s twin sister, and who had in fact charged the freeway right before Ursula, and fortunately for Sabina, despite some nasty bruising and contusions, her round trip left her with no truly serious physical ailments. These Swedish sisters, as troubled as they seemed to be, were not insignificantly resilient, and he thought he felt compelled to write home to tell someone about these extraordinary women.

Veronica squatting near Sabina sent his hand from his coin, zippering briefly with his other hand on the front of his pants then abruptly finding home at his sides as if shocked. Now erect and mobile, Stoneham surveyed the scene and sought the spot to most appropriately unload his assistance.

Stoneham meant to see it for years, and now he was thinking about it. Tomorrow he wasn’t working, so maybe tomorrow was the time to do it, at least not now with this scene, the one sister Sabina had run into traffic again, but this time she made it across to the median. She’s standing basically still facing back toward the police officers halted temporarily by their efforts that seem to be retarding the vehicular flow impeding their own path to her, and her hand reposed upon the median, her other hand idly policing her leg that thigh from my angle probably not actually touching and it dangles thanks to the gravity and all things considered calm breathing, she’s still screaming and I have to consider what is going on. Bragging about an unaffectedness, I stopped considering what I saw as being inaccurately described as a “drone,” it was clearly more shrill in bursts.

That novel pressure in his groin area was growing. It was a particular sensation he hadn’t felt before, and because of all of the foregoing excitement with the Eriksson twins, he hadn’t had time to pinpoint exactly where this force was primarily honing in on. It was not in his penis, it was not in his taint, and, then, as soon as he thought, “gonads,” as if gripped, Stoneham is being led somewhere by his fucking nuts: “My fucking nuts….where are we going?” Being pulled along by his bag by some invisible apparition as if on one of those flat escalators at the airport, and despite being relatively agnostic to ball play, he felt this erogenous pressure was beginning to cause reflexive and unintentionally disrespectful thoughts about his friend’s sister’s weight serving as an appropriate test case for the load-bearing capacity of his face as a pedestal or a swing. 

(If this is a cute chick ghost guiding his sack along, even if a little more forceful than ideal, I feel like you can’t be that pissed if you are him, especially if this ghastly handler is a thick one or athletic-looking or an art-style chick or whatever it is that bewitches you.)

	It became clear it was pulling him toward the lorry’s indent. Earlier in the night, shortly after the accident, he thought about putting his face in that receptacle he felt was customized by and through his dereliction and a place he ultimately could not inhabit. In consolation, he laid the back of his head there, with his eyes closed he thought he was indicating a hopefully sufficient sense of guilt. Whether or not in response to this display, the ghost slammed him, balls-first, against the damaged lorry with such force that one of his testicles was crushed. In response to the sound of the crash against the lorry and Stoneham’s subsequent moans, Officer Peenis ran over to the site of the noise, where Stoneham indicated the location and nature of his gonadal injury. It was at this time that Peenis had conceived of the nickname, “Monad,” for Stoneham, but he wouldn’t start referring to him by that name to his face until he returned to work after recovery from his injuries (Coincidentally, Officer Morjaggs had devised a nickname for Stoneham, “Sackless,” earlier that same night, after Stoneham’s losing effort against Ursula—Morjaggs, like Peenis, respectfully waited until Stoneham returned to work from recovery before he started exclusively referring to him by the nickname).

What Stoneham had meant to see for years was Robert Smithson’s 1974 landmark piece, “Yo-yo,” a land art piece which sits only 72 miles from the site of the accident, on the shore of Moreton Bay on Moreton Beach in Merseyside, Borough of Wirrel, and, though smearing in an ongoing game of chicken with the bay’s adjusting water levels\*, it’s still visible enough to attract a fair amount of tourists who have been made aware that it is a work by a notable artist and is on the beach and doesn’t cost anything extra to view. Smithson, strongly opposed to the elitism he saw in the contemporary artworld, felt that everyone should be able to experience art and, in a sophisticated move, after a brief, uncontentious meeting with the local planning board, clarified that legal authority prohibited any current or future would-be impresario from charging to see the piece. 

\*This “smearing” may be seen as an example, or indication, of the “natural process of retainment,” a key concept to Smithson’s theory of “‘true art’” (the idea of correspondence between the processes of animate and inanimate matter)--it describes a “resistance against ‘phenomenal pressure’\*\*” (Smithson, 65). As an example, the subject artwork mentioned above, “Yo-yo,” “plays” an endless game of chicken with the tides of the bay; the artwork and water are not “playing” in the sense humans do, however if we continue this analogical strategy, we may see additional layers. Tides are almost wholly influenced by the movements and positionings of the moon. In classical mythology, the moon is typically associated with the feminine, and in contemporary times, the moon is commonly associated with “mooning,” the act of showing one’s butt. Given these connections, “bay’s tides” is not so far verbally from “bey’s (or babe’s) tits”. We may then see this “game of chicken” as a sort of ritual of endurance of undulating tits-and-ass for which the subject must not break.

\*\*Regarding the phrase “phenomenal pressure”: in the first published edition of Smithson’s essay he does not designate any quotation marks, writing “phenomenal pressure;” but the adjective, ‘phenomenal,’ (and I think he’s right) may suggest an *extraordinary* or *exceptional* “pressure;” in contrast to what he intended to indicate simply as *occurrent;* in subsequent editions he would put “phenomenal” in quotes, but this he thought seemed to have an opposite effect: the “pressure,” being ‘“phenomenal,”’ (e.g.: “‘phenomenal’ pressure” (Smithson 173, ed. 3-6)), suggested that he may have been suggesting that the pressure was actually ineffective or at least not as effective as advertised. He eventually landed on putting both words in quotations.

**1.)**

The building’s water butt, though more than half-full from the generous morning rain (and with scattered showers forecasted for the afternoon), is still now playing host, attending to the dripping stragglers still remaining and now slipping intermittently from the eave flashing and recently unclogged gutter. About a third or a fifth or so of those drops are landing on the ground well outside the container, and honestly the closest ones of those maybe tag the outside of its bottom exposed wooden panels with what is essentially humidity that no one would even give a shit about if you didn’t point it out. 

An audible crash inside influenced him to investigate what may have caused the crash by going inside toward where he thought where the crash may have originated, and it led him to the lobby where he saw Caramel with one side of a huge box of what he assumes is a widescreen in her hands and her dad with the other end of the box resting near his feet. He walked over to see if he could help, but they were already back on their journey carrying it up the stairs, thankfully her dad leading and she manning the back. 

He noticed some pieces of styrofoam that must have escaped from the downed box corner and knelt to pick them up. He could hear her faint grunts of struggle on the stairs and so he was there asking if he could help as he put his hands on her end of the box, and her hands slipped from it with a tandem cutoff, “it’s O(K)–”. She walked up the stairs behind him and her dad, and on her floor he swung out to make room so she could lead us to her room, he couldn’t see her ahead behind her dad defending the bow.

We got to her room and set down the widescreen box and her dad received some chirps and he said I had to “help her out with the TV I’ve got to take care of this” and he left not in a rush but she shut the door behind him and then she said she’d help me once she changed into something more comfortable, and while she went to her room I removed the thin and wide unit from the packaging and lifted it first on the dresser below where her current-and-soon-to-be-previous monitor was hanging, leaning it against the wall, and then unscrewed the old monitor from the mount but realized the new monitor was in the way, so I tightened the old monitor back in slightly and set the new monitor on the ground and then unscrewed the old monitor carefully from the mount and carried it not very far, setting it on the ground near the couch. I picked the new monitor back up to fit it in the same mount, where one side snapped in place and turned the monitor on, the other side didn’t snap in and the monitor said, “Almost,” so I jostled it a bit before hearing, “What a success,” and the full blue screen menu lit up even though I didn’t hear the other side snap in but I guess it must have. 

“Thank you!” Caramel said smiling toward me from her room with a hug in a wifebeater and dolphin shorts. “Want a drink?” she asked, I did watch her turn and walk toward the cabinet and bend over to pull the bottles out, I knew her cameras were seeing me do it and she knew I knew she knew. I asked for a glass of the Scotch that I always ask for that she deliberately forgot to grab and had to bend over again to pull out and I watched her do it. She knew I knew it was a sales pitch and her phone buzzed against a hard surface from her room and she let it buzz a few more times because she caught me looking at her butt one time and also one time she invited me over before I knew she told me she overheard me and a neighbor’s drunken evaluations of the female tenants’ looks while we were outside smoking cigs.

She came back from her room without her phone and grabbed a bottle of champagne from her refrigerator and started pouring a couple glasses, she asked, “What’s good?” I turned toward the screen to investigate the stock of apps and as soon as I saw some potential options, the menu suddenly changed with a  “Welcome, Caramel,” and I could now identify, even through this more innovative design interface, a more familiar set of choices from which we usually select. 

I was, I’d say, a regular patron of hers (both in real life and online), and there was no denying this dynamic. I forgot to check my pockets earlier because I just recently decided that I should keep my crypto invested instead of using it for payment, I reached in my right front pocket where I felt a receipt and some bullshit dust that I wasn’t looking for and checked my right ass pocket and then she giggled as I felt the rolled cash in my left.

But even knowing I am always willing to exchange, she walked a little closer and planted as if to clarify, exaggerating her lordosis and employing a slightly pigeon-toed stance, and I thought this was the appropriate moment to explain my idea and I told her the way she was standing made me think this was the appropriate moment to explain my idea (Narrator’s idea is to create a generative AI video of Caramel standing naked with him kneeling behind her with his tongue affixed to her asshole in perpetuity; he claims there is some poetic value in creating an AI-generated video of this), with the intention to keep her in that stance as I set the cash on the dresser beneath the widescreen and to give her body time to remember all its parts’ positions here (though the lordosis did end up being exactly what we wanted, we realized during production that the pigeon-toes were too suggestive of a vulnerability that would be more useful for a certain type of pornography but was ultimately not appropriate for our project (we also experimented with her in a wider, sturdy stance, with her ass pushed out in a more exaggerated, presenting manner, but we thought this posture seemed to indicate an active desire on her part to have her ass eaten—again, more suitable for pornography—-my constant boner during these tests attested to this, and we decided it would be necessary for me to keep clothes on for the shoot so I could “invisalign” (i.e: tucking my boner in my waistband for the purposes of making it not as visibly apparent))).

She agreed to it but was concerned she would lose a regular. I was honest with her and told her that I would probably beat off to it for a while but after breaking it in, the more poetic aspects will be able to sing more freely, and stroking your shit while eating the *real* thing could never be replaced.



**The History of the Development of the Law that Allowed Aimages to Be Considered Legally Real**

Generative media software, like Aimage Generator 3, uses machine learning, especially deep learning, to create or manipulate audio, images, video, and text in ways that simulate or fabricate reality. These systems rely heavily on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), transformers, or diffusion models to synthesize media that appears convincingly real. The ease of production and corresponding prevalence of Aimages, such as deepfakes, digital doubles, and text-to-image/video, have long been cultural discussion points. This material’s capacity for deception is part and parcel of its appeal and has certainly exacerbated our cynical attitude toward what we see and read online, where everything is by default considered to be fake and often deceitful, unless proven otherwise.

Interestingly, this has not led to general apathy but to an increased sensitivity toward issues of trust and betrayal. and there is no better example of this than the fallout from the Ida Leak, an infamous data breach from multi-platform accounts of the massively popular content streamer, Ida Gnoe, that indicated that the vast majority of material she had been releasing (for “dozens of months,” it was reported) on her Fansly account had been, in fact, AI-generated. 

Prior to the leak, Ida Gnoe (Christian name: Wifida Vergobagidov) was a hugely beloved figure online: she held the record for most received cum tributes of all time (and while undisclosed to the public, the NSA had performed several significant studies on online masturbation patterns, which revealed Ida as the subject having motivated not only the single highest number of ejaculations over the course of their multi-year set of studies but also the causer of the largest collective amount of jizz produced by volume attributed to a single individual during that same period—-while it seems like these categories should typically beget analogous results, this has not shown to bear out in the recent decades: the tributed-to subjects that are most commonly associated with higher-T’d men did note being not unimpressed with the collective weight of tribute produced during this period but did raise concerns about the declining jack numbers. One of the hottest tributed-to subjects and also her extremely hot friend and also her friend’s sister and also her own sister that are both honestly really hot and both have big or actually really big tits, and actually looking at this data right here, it actually appears that also all of her sister’s really hot friends that are also pawgs and also have tits, and, if I am reading this correctly, it looks like it actually says here that the entire Milk Brigade have declared that they are not impressed by the low jack numbers among high-T’s, and that the categories that indicate the overall and unique number of vaginas that high-T’s have entered during that time don’t even matter or impress them, and that guys that jack off and are low-t are actually cool and they would want to be their girlfriends.  

The Ida Leak prompted Liberal-Humanist congressman, Michael “Greasy” Greventreziou, to take action on deepfakes, and in a bi-partisan effort, working with Traditionalist Party congresswoman, Hot Whitetrash, they developed what would eventually become the Aimage/EA bill. Prior to their research, they both had thought that any Aimage should be required to embed a disclosure on screen if a piece of visual media is, in fact, AI-generated. Through their preliminary testing, using a mixture of Whitetrash’s authentic, pre-Congress OnlyFans and personal videos, and also Aimages of Whitetrash performing similar acts, and then affixing the AI disclosure to a random selection of these videos, they did determine the disclosure significantly affects the jackability of these videos. 

More importantly, however, they thought the labelling requirement might be a form of tacit encouragement for further production of fake erotic material (they thought about how the introduction of the Parental Advisory sticker on musical albums in the 1990’s actually encouraged intrigue for and sales of the labelled albums). Even if the AI disclosure label did not encourage further production of fake material, it didn’t dissuade the production nor consider the ethical concerns of Aimage production. As a Liberal-Humanist, Greasy wanted to masturbate to people, not robots. 

(Greasy had previously introduced a bill to outlaw the practice of tit-fakery—when Congressman Jugg Larger brought up Pamela Anderson as a counter to Greasy’s suggestion that fake tits have never made a positive impact on society and that nice ass fake tits simply don’t exist, Greasy thought this was dirty politics. He admitted that he could see if someone would choose to categorize Home Improvement Pamela Anderson or Baywatch Pam Anderson as having nice ass fake tits, but these examples are extremely rare. In a fairly sophisticated rhetorical move, he asked Congressman Larger to identify a single other nice-ass-fake-tits-haver that Greasy had actively chosen as a subject to masturbate to and where actual jizz had been produced in the last 2 years. Congressman Larger couldn’t come up with a single example).



One of our boys was actually talking with God:

	“God, why did you make thick cheeks so nice? Could you make them a little less nice? It would be nice to not have to think about them all the time.”

	“That is a fucking gay ass suggestion,” said God. “You are gay.”

	He said, “No, I am saying they are *too* nice.”

	And God said, “Your mom is too nice, She is sucking my shit way too good right now, And straight up I am going to blow a God-style load in her goddamn mouth once you stop yapping.”

	He replied, “You are gay.”



It wasn’t until one fateful night that Greasy had a change of heart about Aimages. He and Whitetrash’s research sessions typically had been conducted in the same hotel room, where they could verify each other’s reactions to the videos, but this session was occuring remotely over Zoom and so they were using the Genital Sensor System (an early version of the GSS that the Tax Assessors would use (this will be explored later in the text). Regarding the Genital Sensor System, males wrap a thin strap sensor around the thickest part of their flacid penis; female auditors insert a short, thin cylindrical sensor into their vagina—the sensors measure the hardness/wettness of its users. 

To get a baseline reading of the G-Sensors in response to Aimages, protocol instructed they view something they both know not to have happened in real life, so they generated an Aimage of a threesome with both of them and Whitetrash’s political rival, Social-Communist congresswoman, Vanessa Garcia-Flores, who had spent a large part of her first term fighting against allegations of being young, big-titted, and hot, just as Whitetrash had the previous year, and despite having diametrically opposite political views, for which both passionately advocated, Whitetrash begrudgingly admitted that Garcia-Flores likely, like herself, was possessed with a “really wet, tight pussy,” and when Greasy asked how she knew, Whitetrash said, “because women can sense these things.” 

While they observed the threesome Aimage, Greasy’s sensor did register what would have been some of the highest levels of hardness he would have registered throughout the entire research process had they been using the arousal readers from the start of their studies. It wasn’t just the content of the Aimage that aroused him (though, given how close AiWhitetrash’s wet, tight pussy, for example, resembles Whitetrash’s real-life wet, tight pussy, it didn’t seem like a stretch that Garcia-Flores’ real-life pussy was as wet and tight as AiGarcia-Flores’ appeared to be). 

Greasy gets particularly aroused by seeing the indicator on the GSS reader showing that Whitetrash is aroused (this is coupled with seeing her face on Zoom that reads the same but also can’t he see her playing with her pussy which he suspects she’s doing —this inspires what would eventually be the Aimage/EA bill).

Greasy, Whitetrash, and Garcia-Flores do end up having a threesome in real-life and Greasy thinks the generation of the Aimage threesome probably (“must have”) played a role in making it happen; this makes him believe that Aimages and the humanist perspective are not antithetical (i.e.: by generating Aimages, it “concretizes” or “snatches” events from the realm of infinite-potential-events; these events are put in the catalog of activities that can be decided to be enacted in real-life). 



**AiRitual**

	Narrator is looking at the Gallery in his EA and sees the playing thumbnail of the Nar/Caramel Aimage and the green Indicator lit below it. He starts masturbating as he makes the Aimage full screen. Narrator notes that he knows that he noted how convincingly realistic the Aimage was the first time he watched it, how it looks exactly like the reference footage, but AiNarrator and AiCaramel have been performing this ritual for much longer than practically possible for Narrator and Caramel to have performed (even if Narrator (and/or Caramel) wanted to try—sleep, eating, jobs, and other obligations would be factors that would make it virtually impossible to enact in real-life)). The slight movements of the AI subjects, the slightest changes in posture, are like the Narrator and Caramel in the reference footage, but the Aimage continues to generate novel slight movements. 

	He thought about the young woman he’d met, Sofia, who he had met for coffee, where he explained the concept more fully to her and she was at first enthusiastic to work on it but kind of cooled on it it seemed, and his sense was that she wasn’t that into the idea itself, just wanted to work with a real artist, but she moved away, and he thought it was an amazing, conceptual piece. He would have done it in a second.

“What? No, that’s a lie. I was totally into the idea. And I told him that. We even developed the concept, like some really cool shit. It wasn’t until I mentioned I was getting into tarot that I could tell he started getting turned off, which I’ve had other men also show a similar disdain toward it because they see it in the same category as astrology (which I mostly don’t think is real). I would have done it, on the spot. I didn’t see him after those times we met in the coffee shop (especially the last one), and then I moved to Venice, and the art scene is crazy here. I am wondering what it would have been like if he and I followed through with the idea. I was young at the time, but I thought he really figured it out.

1li7hug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1li7hug/aitah_for_shouting_at_my_fiancé_and_his_friend/,AITAH for shouting at my fiancé and his friend during our camping trip after feeling disrespected by their behavior?,"I (33 F) recently returned from a 3-day camping trip with my fiancé (41 M), my son, my best friend (31 F), my mom and her friend (mid-50s). To give some context, my fiancé is a former chef and avid outdoorsman who tends to take the lead in outdoor activities, while my mom is more passive and introverted, but agreed to stay behind and cook for the group.

Here’s where the trouble started: When we began planning meals for the trip, my fiancé kept interjecting, turning down ideas and saying my mom was trying to bring too much food. While I do agree to an extent, we ignored him because he made it clear he’d be out on the lake with his friend most of the time, so the rest of us were planning for meals that we could enjoy at the campsite in their absence. My mom tends to cook a lot (we’re talking 2 lbs of food per meal), but we figured that was perfect for a group of our size. We did have to waste some, but the intention was good and useful on high activity days in the summer heat.

We also had issues with parking when we arrived at the campsite. I had called ahead to confirm the parking situation, but when I got there, I was told I had to pay a $30 daily fee for my car. I was frustrated, especially since my fiancé had reassured me this would be a non-issue, but I eventually worked through it and had to unload a car that was packed to the brim with food, gear, and my friend’s belongings. I was growing increasingly frustrated as I saw that the car my fiancé traveled in had so much less than mine. I expected an equal distribution and felt like  our comfort on the trip was ignored to appease his fishing partner who drives a Lexus. After a grocery pickup, our ride up the mountain had no open space. Every spot was filled.

When we set up camp, it quickly became clear that my fiancé and his friend hadn’t planned for how close the tents were to one another. My fiancé is ex-military and should know that people don’t want to be packed in like sardines, but he set them up side-by-side, leaving no privacy or space for anyone to be comfortable. I let that slide and got to work organizing the campsite and setting up camp chairs and food. My fiancé and his friend left to go fishing, which helped the mood a lot. I needed a project to focus on and calm down.

That night, my fiancé was upset that I didn’t want to sleep with him right away. We usually don’t sleep together due to different schedules and me being a light sleeper, but he seemed upset by declining to join him. I stayed by the fire with my friend and didn’t go to bed until later. He flapjacked around the air mattress in our tent for 20 minutes before dozing off. It would have been no good for my rest to be there.

The next day, things took another turn when my fiancé mishandled an inflatable kayak I’d bought for him as a birthday gift. He and his friend shoved it against the car, which damaged it. I was really hurt by that, especially since money was tight for me, and I had worked hard to get it for him. I ended up calling them both ""idiots"" because I couldn’t believe they’d treat something so fragile with such disregard.

After that, we went swimming for hours and were invited to join the boys on a boat trip that turned out to be a disaster. We were in a tiny boat that felt unsafe due to high winds and choppy water, and it took several requests for my fiancé to slow down the boat so we could feel safe. My friend and I grew up around water sports and boats, if we weren't comfortable it was for good reason. We weren't on a barge, or even a pontoon, it was a dingy motor boat that could be relatives with a Planter's peanut can. When we got back to camp, my mom had prepared a huge meal, but my fiancé and his friend didn’t eat much and ended up wasting a lot of food. They seemed more focused on drinking beer and leaving trash everywhere.

My friend and I are experienced campers, so we were really annoyed by the littering and made multiple requests for them to clean up after themselves, but they didn’t seem to care. I follow a strict no trace rule and do not tolerate littering around me. It is one of the pillars of who I am ethically. When it came time to break camp, my fiancé got frustrated because he thought people were being lazy sitting around camp. I had already done a lot of the heavy lifting, but had help so I had no patience left for his attitude. He and his friend woke up last and were throwing a blind accusation. He snapped at the group but meant to target my mom in that statement about washing some pans, even though she’d already done a lot of cooking and catering for the group. I yelled at him in response, telling him he was being disrespectful, and things got heated. My mom ended up leaving the campsite in tears, and my son, who has autism, started getting upset too. My mom left one pan unwashed as they fried catfish they caught on the lake. The two other pans we had were on the stove with breakfast she had just cooked. One pan with pancakes, the other with eggs. We ran out of plates and left them there to serve ourselves buffet style in a coffee cup or a plastic lid of tupperware. We all made do without complaints, but he snapped with no understanding of what camp was before he woke. Instead of asking tenderly or considerately of his future mother in law, he kept saying ""this is absurd"" and bringing the mood of everyone down.

After all this, I spent some time talking to my mom and my friend, both expressing my concerns about my relationship. I’m wondering if I overreacted. I did a lot of the physical labor on the trip (setting up camp, cleaning, and breaking down camp), and I don’t think it’s fair that my fiancé and his friend treated my mom like a maid. He also disrespected my kayak, didn’t take safety seriously on the boat, and let things get out of hand with their littering.

I’m at a point where I’m seriously considering ending my engagement because of how things went down. My fiancé feels that my mom’s friend should’ve helped with the breakdown, but I don’t think she should’ve had to since she was the only one who slept in her car both nights. My friend has a bad shoulder injury so I wouldn't have elected them to do the physical labor.

Am I the asshole for shouting at them? Did I do something wrong? AITAH for feeling like the weight of this trip and these issues could be a dealbreaker for my relationship? I should be unpacking, but instead I am here, disgruntled and my peace disturbed over the blatant lack of consideration. I will be active in the comments if you have any questions for me.

I understand that in order to be in a secure relationship, I need to be a secure, non-needy person myself.

I used to have terrible anxiety with women, because on an unconscious level, I saw it like a performance. Whenever I sensed a spark or met someone attractive, I’d just forget about it and later regret not doing anything.

I’ve since practiced becoming less invested in what people think of me, and being comfortable in my own skin.

For the first time, I actually went up to someone and chatted with her. Not from a cheesy place of “picking up” but simply curiosity, and wanting to know who they are as a human being. 

After chatting for a bit I told her something like “hey this might sound a bit random but I honestly find you attractive. I’d love to get to know you more over coffee if you’re up for it.”

Unfortunately, she said no, she wasn’t in the right headspace for it. She did say that I seemed like a “really thoughtful, genuine person”. 

I told her it’s completely understandable and wished her well.

Not gonna lie, it did sting quite a bit. Because I was quite hopeful it might go somewhere. 

It made me think though, is it possible that the universe is preparing me to be the person I’d need to be, in order for my potential to manifest? 

Is it possible that the girl might not be the match the universe has in store for me, but this rejection is teaching me to let go of my old anxiety-ridden reality — and to slowly embrace my new one, where I’m comfortable opening up and being vulnerable? So when my potential does finally manifest, I’m not “pretend” ready, but “truly” ready?

Anyways, sorry for this ramble. I’m mostly thinking out loud.

1li7dcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1li7dcw/slept_with_my_friend_whos_married_twice/,"Slept with my friend who’s married, twice.","I’ve known a friend of mine for about 10 years now. She’s now married and so am I. Shes 8 years younger than me, I’m 35 now. 

Let’s start from When I was 27 and she was 19. We’ve know each other for a few years. I’m a film director and she wanted to learn my craft and very open about admiring me and my work. I also generally date very beautiful women and I think me having her in my presence made her feel good about her self on some leveI. She was very open and eager for a deeper emotional intelligence that she would often pick my brain about - I ended up mentoring her to some extent. She’s been with the same guy since they were 16. He’s a very small, about 5’4, same as her, and he’s always felt noticeably intimidated by me and her friendship with me. 

One night she came over to watch a movie. I don’t know where they were in their relationship or if he didn’t have a location thing on her phone, but she had been coming around more often than usual for a few months, and I had seen her almost once every week leading up to this night. 

So we’re watching a movie on my couch, I have a sectional and I’m on one side she’s on the other section, like 3 cushions away from me. We end up talking, and for whatever reason, I just decided to try to fuck her and see what happened. I knew she was into me, and also had matured faster than her bf and she’d been wanting more but felt very guilty about ever breaking up with him, since they’d been together for so long and he’s a very nice guy actually. But she’s out of his league. But anyways. 
So I don’t remember exactly how i worked the conversation to shift to this topic, but i essentially started making it open an opportunity for me to tell her I had feelings about her, but in a way of like, you turn me on and I want it. 

Now, I do find her very attractive. She’s petite, fit, pretty Hispanic short girl. She’s super hot. But I am way older than her and she’s just 19 at this point so I’m not at all interested in her. And as this story will eventually explain, I had a very toxic trait back then of fucking married women. Like the thrill of getting a wife to fuck me, that was my thing. More on that later. So I really just wanted the ego boost. 

So whatever I said last, was a real direct hit letting her know where I was at. She sat there taking in all this , hearing this for the first time after knowing her for a few years. Then, almost comically, she crawled very quickly over to me across the couch on her hands and knees, and straddled me and started kissing me. We made out and I felt up her sundress that she wasn’t wearing any panties. Which I thought was interesting for the good girl she actually is. I end up picking her up and walking her to my bedroom with her legs around me. I lay her down and start fingering her. So I’m sucking in her it’s and she’s really feeling the heat of the shock of all this and she’s extremely wet and into the hand, but then she abruptly stops me, and explains she feels guilty and we have to stop. We talk a lot it for like 30 mins, and I think she just wished I grabbed her and fucked her, but I wanted to respect that it was a serious, and just let that be the end of the night. So that’s that. I don’t hear from her again, until about a month and a half later, she comes over. I open the door and see the look in her eyes like she had spent the last month getting over her guilt, getting comfortable about the act, and getting excited about getting fucked by someone other than her bf. She’d never been with anyways else, btw.  

As soon as she stepped in I closed the door, and we started making out. I asked her if he knew where she was and she just started kissing me and undressing me. We end up in my bed, and you know the details. Notably, she had expressed a lot through our sex at about being amazing at my size. Which to be honest I’m about 8 inches or so, but she just had only been with her very small current bf and I guess didn’t know what she was missing. 

After our first round she started stroking me and said she wanted me again, which is always a boost to my satisfied ego when I hear that lol. So o fucked her again and this time I finished with her and her stomach and just really went in for the deep penetration, which I knew she hadn’t felt before. And that was the first time she had came so hard that she happy cried. And I could tell she had never even heard of that happening and didn’t understand it’s a powerful emotional release. 

After that she disappeared for about 3 years. Intentionally avoided communication, which I understood as I knew she felt very guilty. But she didn’t unfollow or block my socials. She wanted to stay connected. 

So now about 3 years later I’m 30, we reconnect and are back to friend again. We hang out a few times and the reconnection is back to normal, we’re tuned into each other. This leads to that, and I end up getting a hotel so she can come over as we’ve insinuated that we’re going to meet to hook up. She ends up texting me that she feels bad and can’t do it. The next day, I get a text asking if I’m still at my room. I get another room. She comes over in the middle of the day and we go right back to it. Sweaty and nasty like she’d been saving it all up for me for 3 whole years. She leaves and we never speak about it. 

I knew for years that she feel very guilt about it all, and I think it contributed to her health issues on a metaphysical level. Since then we’ve stayed distant friends as she’s told me her now husband, senses something off between me and her. Years have gone by and just two Months ago, I saw her for a coffee. That conversation is what prompted this post. 

I think she always felt I loved her. I think she loved me simply because I was more experienced in life and I gave her the respect that her creativity needed at that stage in her personal journey. As I mentioned before, it was more of a game for me to fuck other men’s women. There’s a girl I was madly in love with when I was younger and we never got the chance to hook up, who’s now married with children that I have fucked twice over the years when her husband was out of the country.


Now that I’m 35, and in a healthier space as a man, I  also feel residual guilt for the original girl’s husband.  She was young and wanted more physically than he could give her, which is tough for a man, especially if you’re a small build. And she felt bad that she even felt the desire to look else where.

I went to Kansas in July of 2024. I was hoping to pitch in front of MLB coaches and I thought I was ready. I was squatting 350 pounds, doing 30 pull ups in a row, doing 200 pushups in a row, etc. I was in great shape and felt even greater. Well, on my way up there, I had a severe nervous breakdown. I had people in my ear telling me I would break down on the car ride and have no money to get back. Once I made it to Jackson, I took a wrong turn and lost it. I was fully convinced everybody telling me not to go was right. I started crying uncontrollably all the way to Missouri. After I stopped crying, I had an energy crash. I had to pull over and close my eyes for a few minutes, then I pushed through despite being extremely tired. I made it that night and felt fine considering I survived the 14 hour drive. 



I had no immediate symptoms, but I went to the gym after a week of me being there, and when I tried to squat, I noticed my legs were severely weak. I couldn’t get all the way down without shaking violently (with no weight). I didn’t think anything of it and carried on. Then, after another week, I decided to come back home and skip the showcase. I got no sleep the night before I left. I slept maybe 2 hours. So, I drank a strong coffee my host family made and pushed through once again. On the car ride, I experienced the same sudden fatigue where I almost fell asleep behind the wheel. 



When I made it to the Jackson area, my feet went numb. They fell asleep so I got out of the car and walked around for a bit, but every time I sat down, they kept falling asleep immediately. Fast forward 2 weeks, they were still asleep. Every time I tried to walk, my legs would give out. When I laid down, my legs would jerk randomly. My feet to my calves twitched and were weak. Then, the fasciculations traveled up to my head. My whole body was twitching and I developed severe vertigo. Then, I developed weird symptoms like light sensitivity, hypersalivation, trouble swallowing, my jaws became weak, the muscles of my thumbs became weak, and both would fatigue immediately upon use. I had a stroke like an episode one night where half of my face went numb and I couldn’t speak without slurring. I then started checking my blood pressure and it was rising all the way to 190/135. I started having severe presyncope and very blurry vision. Of course, this sounds neurological, however, I started developing things like extreme GI distress, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, dysautonomia, etc. Everyone told me it was anxiety. So, I started begging for tests and documented everything. 



For months, I had presyncope and other neurological symptoms, but in December-January my symptoms cleared up almost completely. I gained a lot of weight and felt very good. However, at the end of February, I woke up with another stroke-like episode. I woke up with tingling in the bottom of my feet, vertigo, different pupil sizes, unilateral weakness and tingling, severe nausea, etc. I also had a severe prickling sensation in my feet and upper back. Once again, I was told it was anxiety. I got put on Prozac and Klonopin, but nothing helped. I developed foot drop and atrophy in my right leg and the neurologist thought it was ALS. Right after this episode, my quads started cramping when I tried to use them, and my chest muscles did the same. Quickly, I lost the muscle mass I had gained over the prior months. 



I haven’t seen them since, but my foot drop went away. I have since developed severe cardiovascular symptoms and the neuromuscular symptoms on the right side of my body switched to the left side. Cardiovascular symptoms like blood rushing to legs, I can’t sit or exercise anymore, and more. I have weird sensations in my head, I have spontaneous trouble swallowing, my pupils will be the same and then be dramatically different, my chest always hurts and feels full, and more.



I have bad exercise intolerance. I will feel faint, dizzy, or like I’m having a heart attack. When I try to run or something, I get dizzy and my heart feels like it is cramping. I will randomly get weird sensations of weakness in my spine. It travels down and feels like I am losing control of my body but it is short lasting. There are more things I have not mentioned or forgotten about, for example, when this all started and the twitching travelled all over, it felt like my body was shutting down. All muscles felt paralyzed until I tried to use them. 



My lungs are not functioning properly, my chest hurts, I have dysautonomia, weird sensations in my head, etc. My quality of life is absolutely horrible and I am 21. I could see why people thought this was anxiety, but my visit with the pulmonologist and atrophy and foot drop confirm this is very real. My lungs are over inflated 148%, and when I exhale, only 70% comes out.

I’ve been clean for 2 years and when I started I was forced to go to meetings. I don’t like being forced to do anything but I reluctantly went. I was told I would find a community and people would wrap
There arms around me and carry me into recover bliss. 

That did not happen people ignored me and only talked to me when they wanted to bum a cigarette. 

The message, single moms mad at the world because their addiction left them with a marb menthol habit and strange men convincing them that they’ll stay sober together. 

I could not stand listening to people complain about every day stuff and never do anything to change it. It was like the same hypocrisy of sinning all week then praising the lord on Sunday. 

This is a spiritual program we don’t push a god on anyone then we all hold hands in a circle and say the Lord’s Prayer… like ???..ok?

And I’m absolutely not going to get a 60 year old sponsor and do a 4th step where I tell my deepest darkest secrets to a guy I met 6 months ago trying to get coffee at meeting 

Then they push this narrative that is if you leave the program you will 100% relapse and die. So my options are listen to you miserable fucks for the rest of my life or relapse. 

I ended finding my own way though without the program. I lean on the side of medicine and science. 

I am med managed by a doctor I go to therapy and work on my mental health everyday and doing this my life has gotten better and better and right now I’m in an amazing place. I understand that 12 step programs have saved peoples lives and maybe some people need them. But it’s not the only way to recover it’s not work the 12 steps for the next 70 years or go back out and die. Recover means whatever it means to you and if you have found a way that works keep doing it and fuck what they say, it’s not their story it’s yours. ",1,1750652253.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,1.0,False
1li7a4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1li7a4s/whats_worked_for_me/,What’s worked for me,"In case it helps anyone else!  

Background/context: I got Covid for the first time (as far as I know) last July. I still don’t know how I got it, because I mask everywhere all the time, but I suspect it was at a drive through where they come to your car. My window was down, I was literally in the process of putting my mask on when someone suddenly appeared with their face in my window. 24 hours later I got hit with extreme fatigue and low grade fever. 24 hours after that, worst migraine of my life and sore throat, tested positive. I immediately called telehealth and got Pax, did the vitamin D thing. The acute phase lasted three weeks for me, mostly fatigue and severe upper respiratory stuff. Within a month, I knew I had LC. I have POTS, ME/CFS, MCAS, a bunch of new gastro and skin symptoms, and had a flare of fibromyalgia, which has been in remission for a decade. I kept working because I had to, but had severe brain fog, cognitive impairment, brand new depression and anxiety, extreme and persistent fatigue, plus all of the symptoms associated with the conditions listed above. I couldn’t stand long enough to make my own coffee in the morning. I was sleeping all the time. Started using a cane and a walker. Couldn’t eat anything without extreme bloating. Couldnt be in the sun at all. Couldn’t make it through the day without multiple naps. Lots more but you get the idea.  

Then, a few weeks ago, I turned a corner. I don’t feel a lot better but I do feel better. I can do more without crashing, crashes seem milder, cognitive functioning seems a little better, and my mood is better. All of my other symptoms have gotten milder.  

Here’s what I did that finally helped:       -finally titrated up to 6 mg of low dose naltrexone a day and got to baseline (it took me forever to titrate up, because I’m so sensitive to everything, I had to go up .25 at a time and then wait at least 10 days to get back to “baseline”).  
-started eating oily tinned fish every day. 
-nicotine patches: 5.5 mg worn 9am to 9pm.  

I also take the following supplements daily: Xyzal allergy pill, vitamin D, CoQ10, quercetin 2x daily, probiotic, NAC (3x daily), omega 3 plus curcumin, fermented B complex, magnesium glycinate, GABA.  

I know this may not help lots of people but if it helps even one, it matters. Like I said, it’s only been a few weeks. I’m curious to see what happens overtime but the wild thing is that when you feel like you’re on death store every single day, even tiny improvements make a huge difference.

She seemed like a nice girl and my family knew their family. I had plans to move back to India this year.
I did talk to her for about 3-4 times on phone before despite my parents complaining to talk to her for more. She was also not a message person abs expected me to call her. Usually the norm is you start chatting through texts to get into the comfort of talking before hopping on the call. I had to get out of comfort zone to call her awkwardly. She didn’t seem to open up much on phone. I’m also more of an introvert but i did make an effort to bring up interesting questions. I honestly didn’t see her make an effort to get to know me more. She was also not from a tier 1 city and I could kind of understand her perspective. 
Every-time we called she only talk about general said and not something that gives an idea of the other person in. While i still did ask interesting questions to know about her personalities.
After coming back to India we had a date set up. She picked up a restaurant which was mid way b/w us. Like 40mins of travel for me.  I did book a cab which was initially 40 mins from my home but arrived around 7 mins late. 
We had food and didn’t talk much. So I insisted we can go to a coffee shop to talk more which was 400m from the restaurant. 10mins by walk. While walking she was so slow, I was walking fast to get rid of afternoon heat 33C. It was a narrow alley where we can’t walk next to each other and I sort of missed looking at her as I was concentrating on the directions on my phone. We had a decent conversation. I figured out she wasn’t the right match for me.
After coming home I told my parents that I’m not interesting in her as she seemed different than anticipated. My parents got angry on me: “what are you saying? How can we reject them?, they are so close to us” 
After a few days my parents got a call from her parents stating that she’s not interested, she waited so long on the date day. Also that i left her while walking. For all the petty issues.
Then my parents got humbled as they didn’t seem as nice as they anticipated either as who rejects someone for these silly reasons.

1li734c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1li734c/the_villains_redemption/,The Villain's Redemption:,"# Chapter 1 Li Yue



The last time Li Yue was in this world, she killed the female lead without having seconds thoughts.

\[Host, I would like to remind you that you are not allowed to kill the villain, the female lead and the male lead of this world.\] The robotic voice echoed inside her head. Like an alarm clock, it kept on repeating its words until she acknowledged them.

""I know!"" she hissed, clearly irritated.

\[You said the same thing in the previous- \]

""The female lead tried to kill me!"" Frowning, she continued walking down the stairs, the sound of her footsteps made by her high heeled boots echoed against the marble tile beneath her. ""Are you saying that I should have let her kill me?""

\[Negative. You are not allowed to kill anyone with your own hands.\]

She sealed her lips, dissatisfied at the script the voice always followed every time they argued.

""Stop disturbing me."" She eyed the huge family portrait which sat in between two huge statues her parents got from Rome.

In this world, she was in possession of the body of a woman named Li Yue, the beautiful secondary female lead who will die a miserable death because of her stupid obsession. Such thoughts were swirling in her mind as she walked down the perfectly twisted spiral stair, its smooth banister guiding her towards the huge living room of the mansion.

""Young miss,"" A voice called out from behind her

""Butler Zhi,"" she nodded at the man in his sixties who had served her family before she was even born.

""Where are they?"" she asked.

""I would not advise meeting— ""Seeing the meaningful smile on her face, the butler halted and sighed. ""They are at the back, in the garden.""

""Wonderful."" She beamed a beautiful smile at him.

Li Yue and the female protagonist of this world, Li Weiwei, were switched at birth. And today would be the day the rich Li Family would confirm this with the help of a DNA test. The test which proved that they were raising the wrong daughter after all.

In the original timeline, Li Yue never witnessed this meeting as she was dead drunk the previous night; she spent the day cooped up in her bed, recovering from intense hangover.

""Young miss, I don't think this is a good idea."" She heard the butler's aged voice behind her.

""Why not?"" she asked as a cold gush of wind greeted her. Surprised, she instinctively took a step back before shivering and closed the door almost immediately.

""It's too cold. Why are they even outside?"" Despite wearing a turtleneck sweater dress paired with tights and comfortable boots, the bitter onslaught of the cold January still licked her skin, numbing her face and extremities.

The butler did not respond, instead, he handed her a knee-length velvet coat to help her with the cold.

""Thank you, Zhi."" Beaming, she immediately covered herself and walked out of the mansion.

""I heard that they are meeting the real heiress today?""

It was not a secret that she had lost her position as the Li Family's heiress. In fact, her grandmother, the matriarch of the family, always reminded everyone of this fact. Her grandmother always told her of how it all made sense then. Li Yue does not look anything like members of the Li Family. She was too pale, the shade of her brown eyes was too light and even her hair colour was lighter than the Li Family's usual charcoal black hair.

""Young miss— ""

""Zhi,"" she interrupted him. Li Yue did not miss the worry in the eyes of the butler. ""Don't worry. My bags are already packed."" She smiled. ""Meeting her would not affect me in any way.""

""Young miss, your father told you not to leave the mansion. Why would you— ""





She shook her head as she continued treading towards the garden, interrupting the butler. ""It's for my own peace of mind.""

In the original timeline, Li Yue never left the mansion and witnessed the changes in the way her parents treated her take place. From the way they directed cold gazes at her to their clearly deteriorating relationships, Li Yue could only watch as reality hit her like the solid hit of a brick to the face.

She was no longer favored. That was the harsh and cold truth the original Li Yue refused to accept.

A heavy sigh escaped the old butler's lips. ""Then… I will help you bring them downstairs.""

""Hmmm. Thank you.""

Everyone knew of how she never changed her mind once she is set on something. Trying to convince her otherwise would be useless. She heard the butler leave her side as the beautiful garden ornate with various flowers, all of which blossomed in winter welcomed her. Smiling, she eyed the outdoor seating in the middle of the flower garden. Its bamboo canopy shone against the sun, making it look even more relaxing, alluring even. To add to its organic feel, the seating inside was made of wood which complemented the craggy volcanic rock that was used as a coffee table in the middle.

""Yue!"" surprised flashed in her adoptive mother's eyes. She awkwardly looked at the three people sitting to her opposite.

""Mother."" She smiled at Tang Ruyi. ""It's cold out here. Would you like me to ask the servants to bring some hot drinks for everyone?"" She turned her light brown eyes at the two older people sitting opposite to her parents. The longing in their eyes were apparent. Slowly her gaze turned towards the young woman sitting in between them. As expected, Li Weiwei looked just like Li Gue, the man who raised Li Yue as his daughter.

""Please… please… don't worry. We already asked someone to bring it for us."" Her adoptive mother said. ""I — um— we are having an important conversation, would you mind waiting for us inside?""

""Li Yue, go inside. It's cold out here."" Her adoptive father, Li Gue added, his usually stern voice was undeniably softer this time. She wondered if this was because of Li Weiwei's presence.

""I'm here to tell you that I'm going to stay in an apartment outside of the university. I've already packed my luggage and my ride is currently waiting outside. I thought I should just come here to let you know that I am leaving.""

She did not miss the changes apparent in her parent's facial expressions.

""You— why would you leave?""Tang Ruyi asked, confusion written all over her face.

""I've decided to give everyone time to adjust."" She said in a firm tone.

She then met the eyes of the woman sitting opposite to her mother. A small smile broke into Li Yue's face. While these people are technically her biological family, she was not very open to the idea of getting to know them. Of course, this was because she already knew that they only wanted to squeeze the money out of her.

In the original timeline, Li Yue ran to her real family when she finally accepted the fact that she had lost the favor of the Li Family. That was her biggest mistake.

""Li Yue…"" Li Gue's stern gaze met hers. However instead of quivering under the man's stare, she smiled a beautiful smile.

""I will see you soon father."" She uttered and did not wait for anyone to react. She then walked out of the garden under everyone's surprised gaze. In this world, her mission is to find and save the villain from the fate of falling madly in love with the female lead. Why would she waste her time associating herself with these people?

# Chapter 2 Li Family’s Heiress



News regarding the real identity of Li Family's heiress immediately reached the ears of the socialite in Yin City. The Li family rarely showed themselves in public, but many knew them as one of the richest in the city. With lots of mining operations all over the country, the Li Family is revered for the diamonds, sapphires and other rare stones they showcased in a yearly auction.

""I heard in this year's auction, the real heir will be revealed."" One student in the cafe stated. Her malicious eyes darted towards Li Yue who was calmly sitting a few tables away from her.

""What do you think will happen to the previously declared heir?"" she asked the person sitting in front of her.

""No idea."" The other person shrugged.

""Well… that Li Yue used to act so high and mighty, looking down on everyone just because she thought her family was better."" The woman sneered, the volume of her voice increased each time she spoke.

""What is she going to do now?""

Hearing the malice hidden within the woman's voice, Li Yue let out a sigh before she turned her gaze away. The original Li Yue was a proud woman who would not hesitate to bully others. She looked down on everyone who doesn't have the same status as her and all in all, she was just a really nasty person, someone you would not want to be associated with.

""Yue?""

Li Yue immediately turned towards the man who sat in front of her. She gave him a sweet smile.

""What took you so long?"" she asked. In response, a sad smile broke into her fiancée's face.

""My parents…""

""So, you've heard?""

""Everyone did."" Just like every perfect male lead, Xia Jin was the epitome of beauty. With his long eyelashes sitting on his pale skin and his brows which were sculpted by the gods, the man looked just like a perfect Adonis. No wonder the female lead liked him immediately after seeing him for the first time. ""So… you wanted to talk to me?""

""I want to break up."" Li Yue said with a straight face.

He stared at her for a few seconds. ""Is it because of her?""

""She's your real fiancée."" She started digging into her cake. ""Not me.""

""But— ""

""Jin… I don't think it is fair for her. She had already grown up in a different household. She needs someone to be there for her."" She feigned another smile.

The female lead is nothing but a clumsy woman who would always accidentally spill her water or whatever she is holding onto the male lead's head. With this level of clumsiness, she won't survive in this world without the male lead's help.

""Are you serious about this? Yue… we've been in a relationship for over a year now. Are you really going to leave me because— ""he let out a sharp sigh before continuing. ""Did aunt and uncle Li force you into doing this?"" he frowned. ""I'll talk with them. If you want— ""

""No. I've decided to stay away from them. I won't be living in the mansion and my bank cards are already with them. From now on, I'll be living on my savings until I graduate from high school in a few months— ""

""What?"" he furrowed his brows. ""When did you move? And why didn't you tell me about this?"" his dark complexion turned even darker.

She pursed her lips in response. Xia Jin might sound really sweet and caring now. However, in the original world, he would still betray her for Li Weiwei. This made Li Yue furious, turning her into a horrid person who was then used by the villain to break up the two. In the end, she died in the hands of Xia Jin's subordinate while he and Li Weiwei peacefully enjoyed their honeymoon on a remote island somewhere.





Of course, she does not hate Xia Jin for this; her rational mind would not allow it. After all, the original Li Yue was really horrible to Li Weiwei. This constant bullying made Xia Jin hate Li Yue and sympathize with Li Weiwei instead.

""They're still trying to contact me."" Li Yue said. ""They're the ones who raised me and I'm completely grateful for what they did, but I didn't want to ruin their reunion with their real daughter so I left a few days ago. I'm staying in a small apartment just outside the campus now."" She let out a sad sigh. ""I'm sorry Jin. I can't do this anymore. I'm sure your parents will insist that you marry her. I just want to save you the trouble.""

A flash of guilt became apparent in his eyes. Just like what Li Yue said, his parents were already discussing this matter. In fact, that was the reason why he was late to their meeting today. ""I'm sorry… Yue…""

""Why are you sorry?"" she smiled. The original Li Yue might have been a bully to others but none sweeter could she be towards this man. However, the real Li Yue is long gone, she could not maintain this sweet charade any longer. That was one of the reasons why she decided to break up. Playing sweet with this man… stressed her out to no end, it's making her irritated!

She feigned a sad sigh. ""I understand, Jin. Don't worry about it. I hope you will find your happiness with her.""

Xia Jin returned her sad smile. ""I truly care for you Yue… if… Don't worry, I'll try to convince my parents— ""

""No need."" She interrupted him. ""Don't get into an argument just because of me. I'm fine. I will move on and… I will forget about you soon."" Seeing Xia Jin nod, Li Yue did not waste any more time. She immediately left the cafe after paying for her cake. After all, there are still a lot of things she needs to do— like looking for the villain of this world. Chapter 3 ‘Cry, Cry, Cry’



The moment she walked out of the cafe, the cold air of January swept through her, making her shiver. With her hands tightened around her coat, her head lowered, she walked a few blocks away. The place she was staying at is actually not that far from the cafe.

Upon arriving at her new two-bedroom apartment, Li Yue's face immediately turned indifferent. ""Acting is hard,"" she grumbled. In every world, she would be forced to act just like the original owner of the body would or the world will detect her presence and take her out, thus rendering her mission a failure. This had already happened on the first world she visited.

""It is a necessity to survive in each world."" The robotic voice responded to her remark.

""Do you know where the villain is now?""

""That is not how it works."" The voice answered. ""You are on your own.""

""Yeah… figured as much."" She shrugged and plopped her body onto the bed. What did she expect? She had been to a few worlds before this and not once had this robotic voice given her any helpful output.

""Of course, you can use the points you earn to buy an item in the system store. You can use it to find the villain.""

""And how many points do I have?""

""None."" The voice answered. ""You did not accomplish any mission. And even when you did, that was only because you killed the villains, which in turn voided the mission.""

Li Yue turned silent. She does not need to examine her system to know that the voice was right. Before this, she had been on four other missions. Each time… she failed.

Firstly, she is struggling when it comes to acting. Secondly, for some reason, she doesn't like it when someone bullies her and she ends up hurting them. This serves only to get her into trouble, therefore making her mission more and more difficult. And thirdly, she thought killing the villains would end it.

NOPE. She could not have been any more wrong.

Apparently, villains are valued. They are created to sharpen the lead of the world, preparing them for other terrible people in the world. They are useful!

""Alright, then…"" she jolted up and opened her laptop. The first thing that she needed to do was to find something that could help her earn some money. She instantly tapped into Li Yue's memory and checked if she had anything useful that she could use — ""Eh?"" A smile broke in her face. Li Yue was actually a painter! In fact, she was very good at it. Unfortunately, she was forced by her mother to hide this talent of hers because her grandmother would not like it.

For context, it’s been at least 2 years since having a period, with occasional spotting, but never as consistently as recently (which is why I decided to have a period). I woke up feeling fine and drank a 20oz coffee, along with a breakfast sandwich. However, since then (~10am—it’s currently midnight) I have had absolutely horrendous nausea and cramping, alongside multiple bouts of diarrhea. The only other food I’ve had today has been some watermelon because I was feeling so bad. I have forced myself to throw up once to try and get some relief, and mainly threw up bile and semi digested watermelon. However, for the past hour, my diarrhea has been nothing but clear mucus.

First off, most suppliers here don’t speak English. Like, at all. So unless you’ve got a local contact, be ready to do some translating or just power through with Google Translate. It’s doable, just takes patience.

Research which region makes your product. In Vietnam, different regions specialize in different things, and within each region, there are tons of factories. But it’s not just factories — there are also small business households that make the same products. In fact, some factories even buy from them. If you take the time to dig deep, you’ll find really good suppliers.

If you cannot go directly to Viet Nam, use the yellow page of viet nam to search for suppliers. You can go to facebook groups to find them. Use the keywords xuất nhập khẩu to search for good groups because Vietnamese people are very active on Facebook, but againt they dont speak english so you need a little bit of translation

Many factories here are owned by the Chinese. They move their factories here because labor are at least 15% cheaper than in China and tariffs are lower. Plus our ports are really convinient. For highly complicated products, China is the priority but there maybe some good factories in Vietnam (which are owned by the Chinese, sometimes Vietnamese) as well. But for furniture, handicrafts, or agri stuff like coffee, cashews, pepper—Vietnam’s hard to beat. Good quality, good prices.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/PqL4y8pGrl)  **March 14, 2015**

I'll try to make this brief.  My husband, Jonah, passed away unexpectedly a month ago from a stroke.  I don't want to get specific about that part, it's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still not sure how I'm ever going to move on.

We were married for 5 years, together for 7.  The past 2 years we've been trying for a baby, but were just getting to the point of considering IVF when he died.

Jonah had a close friend in high school named Marjorie.  Marjorie also ended up going to the same university as he did, and they spent a lot of time together during those college years.  Jonah said that he liked Marjorie's company, but never felt anything beyond friendship with her -- which I totally believe.  

Jonah dated other women during that period, but told me that several times Marjorie hinted that she wanted him to ask her out.  She also ""joked"" about wanting him to be her ""plan B"" in case she didn't meet someone and get married by 30.  

By the time I'd started dating Jonah, he had moved a couple hours away from his hometown (and Marjorie).  Despite this, Marjorie immediately began finding excuses to come to our town and ""hang out"" -- which usually involved her encouraging us to go drinking, and then her passing out on the couch at Jonah's apartment.  I didn't mind her for the most part, but she had a habit of saying things like, ""you know you ruined our marriage pact, haha!"" and pointing out all the things that she knew about him (like what he took in his coffee, his favorite bands, etc).

Over the course of our relationship, and especially after we got married, Jonah definitely put some distance into his relationship with Marjorie.  He confided in me that he felt he had ""outgrown her"" and that they really had little in common anymore.  He stopped responding to her invitations to hang out as often, though he would occasionally call to catch up out of guilt (especially when she would text him or leave messages saying she was ""so sad he was ignoring her"" and the like).

But now he's gone.  I had him cremated, like he wanted.  We haven't done the memorial service yet -- it was too hard for me to even imagine the first couple of weeks, and I also wanted to give time for some out-of-state people to make travel plans.  The memorial is this weekend.

However, two weeks ago, I received an email from Marjorie -- sent to around sixty people, including Jonah's family -- saying that she was holding a memorial service for Jonah in the town where they grew up (the day before his memorial here).  I was completely blown away, seeing as she hadn't mentioned anything to me or even attempted to call.  Along with the details, the email said that she was ""planning the memorial in light of the fact that no other service had yet been held in his memory, and he deserved to be laid to rest with honor"".  For the record, she was invited to the memorial which I've been planning, and knew it was happening.

I called her, of course, and told her that while I appreciated her willingness to help with Jonah's goodbye, I was already planning a service for him that would involve all of his family and friends.  She immediately went on the defensive, and said that she had ""only started to plan a service when she realized I wasn't willing to do it in a timely manner"".  I told her that the timing wasn't her choice to make, but that if she wanted to have a memorial of some kind, to please just add on the invitation that his ""official"" memorial was going to be held this weekend.  She said fine.

I sent a message to all of Jonah's invited friends/family to make sure that they knew the real service with both of our families was going to be here, and then just washed my hands of the whole thing.  

This week I received a message on facebook from Jonah's cousin, saying that Marjorie (who has apparently blocked me on facebook) created an ""event"" for Jonah's ""official"" memorial service (her memorial) and invited everyone she possibly could.  I've been getting blown up with emails asking which day the memorial is, and where.  I'm honestly furious -- I don't have the emotional energy to deal with this.  

I ended up putting a post up on my wall, reiterating the date of his service here, and asking people to please share it.  Thankfully I think the older members of the family don't use facebook or email very often, so most of them haven't been confused, but a lot of people now think that Marjorie's service is the real one.

I called Marjorie again, asking her to add an addendum to her event saying that his actual memorial was going to be here.  She told me that ""Jonah would have wanted it this way"" and that ""if I couldn't appreciate her efforts, I wasn't invited to say goodbye to Jonah.""  I told her that was fine, seeing as I'd already said goodbye to Jonah when I held him as he died.  She hung up.

Apparently she's now spreading information to her mutual friends with Jonah, saying that he was planning on leaving me because I wasn't able to conceive.  She also said that we had approached her to carry a baby for us -- all absolute lies.  His cousin sent me a screenshot of a text where she said that ""Jonah always thought we would have the cutest baby together"" and that ""AngryWidow doesn't understand how much he wants children"".

I'm at a loss as to what to do.  I don't care what she says about me, but she's now tarnishing my husband's memory -- especially saying that he wanted to divorce.  Jonah would never have left me, and anyone that knows him at all knows that we were committed to each other above all else.

I need to figure out how to tell this woman to fuck off without encouraging her to spread more lies.  And I also want to just forget the whole thing and crawl in bed and never get up again.

Help me, please.

   
**tl;dr**: My husband's former ""best friend"" is trying to plan his entire memorial service and is tarnishing his memory.  How do I get her to stop?

**TOP COMMENT**

**[deleted]**

>I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the pain you must be in right now.

>Marjorie sounds completely fucking insane and malicious. If I were in your shoes I'd be very tempted to go scorched earth on her ass, but that wouldn't be the most constructive approach here. So here's what I'd do instead:

>- Send an email to all of the guests you've invited to attend the actual memorial service stating, ""Just to reiterate, the service will be held at [location] on [date]."" Do not mention Marjorie, her lies, or the second service.

>- Contact the funeral home per /u/ThomasBeckett's suggestion and see what can be done to pull the plug on Marjorie's service.

>- Delete and block this woman on all forms of social media, email, your phone, everywhere.

>- UNLESS AND UNTIL somebody comes to you asking about Marjorie's lies, resist the urge to set the record straight. If you try to publicly address her claims on Facebook or elsewhere, it will almost certainly get back to her and she'll be even more fueled by the attention and the knowledge that she's getting under your skin. Cut off her supply by ignoring her.

>- If she crosses the line into character assassination against you, contact legal aid.

>- Content yourself with the knowledge that if any of Jonah's and Marjorie's mutual friends have half a brain, they'll understand she's out of her fucking mind or at least being outrageously inappropriate.

>EDIT: Almost forgot!

>- Do you have a picture of Marjorie? Get one, and deputize someone at the real memorial service to guard the door and refuse her entry should she show up.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/bPAtPz6BzB)  **March 16, 2015 (2 days later)**

I apologize for not updating sooner, but a lot happened the last couple of days.  Thank you to everyone who offered help and advice.  For those that offered monetary assistance, Jonah and I were in a stable position financially -- I'm going to be comfortable until I decide to go back to work.  Your willingness to help was deeply appreciated, however, and I'm truly bowled over by your kindness.

I took the advice of the majority of comments, and called the chapel where Marjorie was planning her service.  I spoke with the pastor, who immediately told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me regarding the service -- apparently both Jonah and Marjorie had grown up in that church (I am not religious, and neither was Jonah as an adult).  My voicemail has been flooded, so it's definitely plausible that I overlooked his call. 

He immediately expressed how sorry he was to hear of Jonah's loss, and said he had received my contact info from Jonah's great-aunt who still attends there.  He said he was surprised when Marjorie asked to have a service for Jonah, but she had claimed that Jonah and I were separated and I didn't want to be involved.  He had been trying to follow up with me, but obviously that didn't happen.

He was very apologetic, and said that we could cancel the service, or move forward in any way that felt right to me.  He said that he knew the church members would appreciate the service, since many of them remembered Jonah as a boy, but obviously Marjorie would no longer have a role.  I agreed that the service could go forward.

He called to speak with Marjorie after our conversation, and informed her that she was no longer welcome to participate in the organization of the service after her behavior.  He wouldn't tell me all that she said, but says she was distraught, and he recommended some mental health/spiritual services to her that he hopes she accepts.  She apparently apologized for lying, and asked to speak with me -- but I declined.  I feel bad if she's truly contrite, but I just have too much on my plate right now.

We had two beautiful services for my husband -- first the one at his hometown church, and then the non-religious one that I planned.  Everyone that came wanted to honor Jonah, and that's all that really matters.  I was told a dozen stories about him that I'd never heard before, and I laughed so hard I cried, then cried some more.  My cousin was on the lookout for Marjorie, and I honestly didn't think about her the whole weekend.  She turned up for the first service, and the pastor ended up speaking with her (unbeknownst to me).  My cousin says he was sympathetic but firm, and told her that her presence there would be inappropriate.  Surprisingly, she left without fuss.

I'm still not sure this situation is entirely resolved, but I got to lay my husband to rest in the way he deserved, and that's the most important thing to me right now.  

Thanks everyone for your support.


**tl;dr**: Called the chapel, spoke with Marjorie, and had two wonderful services for my husband.

[Edit 1]. I debated whether or not to even mention this, but this community has been so awesome I thought I might as well -- I realized this weekend that I'd missed my period, and I'm usually like clockwork.  It could just be stress, but I'm going to take a test later.  Can't decide if I'm incredibly hopeful or absolutely terrified.

[Edit 2]. Not pregnant.  It was a long shot.  Thanks for your support.

>I'm glad the pastor is such an awesome, compassionate person and that you were able to memorialize your husband with people who cared about him.

**OOP**

>>I definitely expressed my heartfelt appreciation to him.  I tend to be uncomfortable in religious settings, which is why I immediately told him that I'm not religious, but I was really moved when he said, ""That part doesn't matter right now.  You loved your husband, and there is always a place for love here.""  I teared up, I admit.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/f9VUeGTrv6)  **July 26, 2015 (4 months later)**

I'm not sure if anyone will remember this post, but I thought I would update since it's been a few months.  I haven't been checking my inbox, and I'm sort of amazed I remembered the password at all, but I appreciate all of you who sent encouraging messages.  It means a great deal to me.

It's been around five months since Jonah died, and honestly it still feels like I'm waking up and living the same day over and over again.  I'm in therapy, but the feeling of grief has not subsided whatsoever.  Everything reminds me of Jonah and I still feel like half of me is gone.  I'm considering moving out of the country, or at least to a different state, but I also feel like a piece of Jonah is here in the house where we lived.

Even worse, Marjorie has still not disappeared.  I deleted my social media a couple of months ago in an attempt to simplify my life, but my cousin, who also knows Marjorie, let me know that she has been recently posting photos of herself on Facebook -- with Jonah.  Some were from several years ago, but she was saying things like ""I still miss my man every day"" and ""I can't wait until Jonah's baby arrives"".  She is apparently pregnant and claiming that the baby is my husband's.

She has also photoshopped his face onto several photos -- some on another shirtless male posing semi-suggestively with her.  The photoshopping is pretty good, but it's obviously not my husband's body.  People have been saying things like ""Congratulations, we know you'll be a great mother to Jonah's child"" (nobody I knew, thankfully).  It honestly made me feel sick, and I went and laid in bed pretty much all day.  I hate that she is getting to me like this, but I can't stand the thought that she's claiming my husband was unfaithful to me, and that people are believing it.

One bright note is Marjorie's brother, who also knew Jonah.  On one of her recent posts, he commented, ""WTF Marjorie?  I spoke to Jonah like two weeks before he died and he said he was trying for a baby with angrywidow...you guys were just friends...this is fucked up and you know it"".  The post was deleted a couple of hours later.

I don't know what to do anymore.  I don't have the energy to battle with this woman, but I'm infuriated and hurt by this blatantly disrespectful pack of lies that she's spreading.  My cousin called her and asked that she remove the photos, but she apparently said that ""AngryWidow can go to hell, she just doesn't want to accept that Jonah wanted a baby with me more, and she couldn't give him one"".

I'm lost, guys.  What can I do about this?  It seems like all I can do is sit and watch this crazy woman try to convince Jonah's friends and family that he never loved me.

Update:  I just spoke with Marjorie's brother, who called to tell me that Marjorie is NOT pregnant, but seems to truly believe that she is.  He asked her how far long she is, and she said five months, but she is still completely flat.  He isn't sure if she's lying, or she actually believes she's having a child with my husband.  He asked her when they conceived, and she mentioned a date that he knew we had been on vacation.

   
**tl:dr** The troubles with Marjorie continue.

A lot has happened since my last update.  Hopefully this will be the end of the story.

Marjorie's brother became very concerned after speaking to me, and apparently questioned Marjorie extensively about her behaviour.  She continued to claim that she was pregnant with Jonah's baby, and that they had had a lengthy affair -- but the details didn't add up (the brother knew Jonah pretty well, and was generally aware of his work schedule, etc).  She said they were meeting at a hotel at lunchtime three days a week, but he knew that Jonah came home for lunch with me every day.  Stuff like that.  He went home late that night to sleep on it.

After he went home, Marjorie came over to see me at 3AM.  She started screaming at me to come outside, saying that I had ruined her relationship with Jonah, and how happy they were before me, etc etc.  I called the police and her brother, who both arrived around the same time.  She pushed the police officer who tried to ask her what was going on, and was immediately arrested.  I felt bad for her brother, but he just apologised to me repeatedly.  Marjorie yelled expletives and tried to demand special treatment because the police were apparently ""hurting her baby"" by keeping her in the car.  I gave a statement, and they left.  

Not exactly sure what happened after, but her brother says she is now under psychiatric evaluation, and is apparently struggling with a mental disorder that he wouldn't name (she has apparently not taken her meds in two years).  I didn't ask for details, but it seems she is going to get some help.  I'm not pressing any sort of charges.

Her brother also linked me to his post on social media, where he made it very clear that Marjorie has been having some difficulties, and absolutely none of what she said about Jonah is true.

I'm glad this seems to be over, but I've decided I need a fresh start no matter what.  I'm looking for a job out of state, and I'll be doing my best to leave my life with Jonah behind.  

Thank you all for your help and encouragement.

   
**tl;dr**: Marjorie is getting psychiatric help, and I'm moving away to start my life over.

I notice that through the day I am ok, but when I lay down at night I get palpitations and on my Apple Watch they get captured - to me that feel like thumps and flutters.

1li6w3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1li6w3e/bf_of_1_year_cheated/,Bf of 1 year cheated,"My boyfriend and I were dating for one year before all of this. I try not to make him sound like the bad guy but. We dated senior year of high school and were not the healthiest couple. I’ll admit, I was mean and controlling. He was also mean to me and used me. All we did was fight and argue, sometimes getting physical. Even after all this, we still stayed together and now looking back, I’m not surprised it ended this way.

In the middle of our relationship, at the 6th month mark, I started asking about his past. He told me about his first girlfriend and how he HATES her now…okay we all know where this is going. 4 months later, I started to feel a shift. At this point we were on a “break”. Nothing changed and we never stopped doing what we do. So I finally decided to break up with him. I wrote him a letter and dropped it off. He came to my house and insisted we don’t part. I agreed because at the time I thought it was really sweet and thought maybe he would change. Nope. It only worsened. A month later I wished him a happy 11 months, I didn’t get one back. Instead, I got a “do we really have to this every month?” 

By the next month it was one week before our 1 year. We were on a walk (arguing ofc) and towards the end he goes, “well what if I want to be single?” I obviously made him repeat it. And he did. I had him walk me home as we talk about it. A couple days pass and we’re still sorting it out. He claims he’ll always love me and this is for the best. He was just as upset as I was. He was crying and saying he can’t unlove someone like me. I believe him, thinking this is hope that we will get back together someday even though he kept confirming we were never going to. 

A couple days go by and he invites me to go to a cafe. That morning we were acting like a couple. We went out for coffee, we were being touchy, cute, laughing, etc. I had so much hope on us getting back together. After being comfortable with him, I asked to go through his phone. That’s when his mood completely shifted. He got so mad and defensive. After a couple of minutes practically begging, I finally got it. I look through it and see him texting his first girlfriend he told me he hated. I completely broke down. The messages were so flirty and started at the beginning of the month from when we were still together. They were sexting, sending nudes, meeting up, all while I was with him. I was crying badly and he snatched the phone back with “see, this is why I didn’t want to give it to you.” He then told me how every time he gets out of a relationship, he goes to her :/ I found out he’s been telling her and his friends that we broke up about two months ago because I was, “annoying, controlling, and too emotional” 

This happened about two months ago and I still don’t understand anything or why everyone decided to take his side.",2,1750650743.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False
1li6vu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1li6vu5/im_embarrassed_and_ashamed/,I’m embarrassed and ashamed,"I am trying really hard to move on but I am having a bad time. I’ve been really upset.

My story is that I met someone through a retail job where we both worked. Knowing everything I now know I think I was love bombed and then discarded by a narcissist.

One time at work John Mayer’s song Your Body Is A Wonderland was playing and she started pointing at me and saying some of the lines. 

She asked me out to a movie and then cancelled at the very last minute claiming she had a project for school to finish. 

I remember her once saying she was in debt to credit cards and laughing it off.  That night explain why she eventually dumped me for a rich sugar daddy.


A girlfriend of hers invited us to her house on New Year’s Eve. It was basically two couples and that’s it. At least that’s how I felt and I even overheard her telling her girlfriend nice things about me in the kitchen while I was hanging out with the friends boyfriend.

She left the company we worked for to teach English in Korea but never told me when she was leaving. 

Her girlfriend came to the store one night and told me and acted all surprised that I didn’t know. 

I surprised her at the airport which was one of many stupid things I did. 

The same year we went to the friend’s  house we had exchanged presents and I wrote her a song. I’ve never written a song before in my life.

I’ve since found myself writing and composing songs. 

Long story short a “friend” as she called him showed up in Korea and eventually she dumped me claiming she was an independent woman who didn’t know what she would be doing when she got back from Korea. She also claimed she thought we were friends. 

During her time in Korea, the girl from New Years came to my work and told me my girlfriend was cheating on me.

Well when she got back to my city she ended up bringing her boyfriend as she called him to the store and threw him in my face. 

They got engaged but broke up because he cheated. I have a mutual friend and the story I was told was he proposed hoping the relationship would progress in other ways  but when it was obvious she wasn’t really invested in the relationship he met someone else and left her.

I made the mistake to ask her out for a coffee some time after he’d dumped. her and she said yes but then the excuses started coming.

I stopped contact and blocked her on all social media but then things got worse.

I found out she moved about 10 blocks from me and works at a place very close to where I live so I had to see her almost every day when I left for work. 

On top of that one of my friends has a sister in a law who is best friends with this girl as they work together.

 If that’s not enough another friend who does psychic readings gave me a free book he wrote with other people that’s like a bunch of short stories and he’s talking about this woman who wrote a story in the book about manifesting going to a famous talk show as an audience member. I had done the exact same thing but I had a pretty big story that involved me  meeting a famous singer I really liked.

It turns out this woman is the mother of the guy she dumped me for. 

And also at my current job this friend of hers that invited us to New Years Eve is now a client in my building and I’ve helped her out on several occasions. I’ve been tempted to ask her if she remembers me but I never have.

I am trying to move on but it’s so hard when it’s like she’s being put in my path through these six degrees of separation type things as well as my not being able to go out in my area without running into her.

Part of me feels like she got played and maybe I should feel better knowing what the guy did to her but I can’t seem to let go of the anger and shame for what I went through.

I’m truly embarrassed at myself for falling for such a horrible person.
My family thought she was hot and I think they were surprised I’d get a girl that pretty so to be played like I was really stings.

I was addicted to sweet coffee — the kind with flavored creamers and whipped toppings. It made me feel alive… then drained me by 10 a.m.

Switching to **bulletproof coffee** felt radical at first. But once I tried it, I never went back. It didn’t just keep me full — it made me *sharp*.

# ☕ What You’ll Need

* 1 cup hot brewed black coffee (fresh and strong)
* 1 tbsp unsalted grass-fed butter (like Kerrygold)
* 1 tbsp MCT oil (or coconut oil)
* Optional: cinnamon, collagen powder, or a pinch of Himalayan salt

# 🌀 How to Make It (Properly)

1. Brew your coffee fresh and hot.
2. Add coffee, MCT oil, and butter to a blender.
3. Blend on high for **20–30 seconds**, until frothy and creamy.
4. Pour into your mug, sprinkle cinnamon if desired.

*Don’t skip the blending!*  
It creates that latte-like texture without sugar.

# 🔋 Why I Keep Coming Back

This is more than caffeine.  
It’s a **fat-fueled rocket** that gave me back control in the morning.

No jittery crash.  
No sugar spiral.  
Just clarity. Hunger gone till lunch.

1li6gog,https://i.redd.it/ac9deit7jl8f1.jpeg,The Billionaire Backs Me Up,"The pale morning light filtered through my curtains as I admired the wedding dress sketches scattered across my desk. Six years of loving Julian, and in three days, I'd finally be Mrs. Grayson. I traced my fingers over the intricate lace design I'd spent months perfecting—my masterpiece as both a bride and a designer.
My phone shattered the peaceful moment, vibrating violently against the nightstand. Cherry, my assistant at Ashworth Bespoke, rarely called this early.
""Hazel, I'm so sorry to disturb you,"" she said, her voice tight with tension. ""Julian just came by the studio and took the wedding dress.""
I sat up straight, confusion clouding my mind. ""What? Why would he do that?""
""I don't know. He just said it was urgent and that you knew about it."" Cherry's voice quivered. ""I tried calling you first, but he insisted it was fine.""
A cold sensation crept up my spine. Julian knew the tradition—the groom shouldn't see the dress before the wedding. ""It's okay, Cherry. I'll handle it.""
I immediately dialed Julian's number, my heart pounding against my ribs.
""Julian, where are you? Cherry said you took my wedding dress.""
The silence on the other end stretched painfully before he finally spoke. ""I'm at Memorial Hospital.""
""Hospital? Are you okay?"" Panic surged through me.
""I'm fine, but... Hazel, we need to talk.""
Something in his voice made my stomach twist. ""What's going on?""
""The wedding... it's canceled.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. I gripped the edge of my bed, suddenly dizzy. ""What are you talking about?""
""It's Ivy. She's been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Stage four. The doctors say she has three months at most.""
Ivy. My half-sister. The daughter of the woman who had destroyed my mother's life.
""What does that have to do with our wedding?"" I whispered, already dreading the answer.
""Her dying wish... she wants to marry me, Hazel."" His voice cracked. ""How can I deny a dying woman her last wish?""
The room seemed to spin around me. Six years together, countless blood donations to help Julian with his rare blood disease, and he was throwing it all away for Ivy?
""You're canceling our wedding to marry my stepsister?"" I could barely force the words out.
""Half-sister,"" he corrected gently. ""And yes. I'm sorry, Hazel. I never meant to hurt you.""
Memories flooded back—Ivy's mother, Eleanor, seducing my father while my mother was pregnant with me. My father abandoning us, my mother spiraling into depression until she took her own life. Ivy and Eleanor moving into our family home while I was relegated to the servants' quarters. My father using my mother's family business as a dowry to win Eleanor's hand.
""This isn't just about a wedding, Julian. You know what she and her mother did to my family.""
""People change, Hazel. She's dying."" His voice hardened. ""Look, I know this is difficult. I'm prepared to compensate you—fifty percent of Grayson Enterprises.""
""Compensate me?"" I choked out. ""Like I'm a business transaction?""
""Be reasonable. Think about what that stake could do for your fashion line.""
Something snapped inside me. The tears that had been threatening to fall dried up, replaced by a cold, clear fury.
""Where is my wedding dress now?"" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady.
""At Ivy's. She's having it altered.""
Of course she was. Ivy had spent our entire childhood taking everything that was mine—my father's love, my inheritance, my home. Now she was taking my fiancé and wearing my handcrafted wedding dress while doing it.
""I see."" I hung up without another word.
I sat motionless, staring at the wall. The dress I'd poured my heart into, the wedding I'd dreamed of since I was a little girl, the man I thought loved me—all snatched away in an instant.
My phone buzzed again. My best friend Victoria.
""Have you heard?"" she demanded without preamble.
""Just now.""
""That absolute piece of garbage! And Ivy—using cancer as an excuse to steal your man? Classic her.""
""He offered me half his company as compensation,"" I said numbly.
""Half? That cheap bastard should give you the whole damn thing! After all you've done for him?""
Victoria's outrage ignited something in me. She was right. For six years, I'd been Julian's blood donor, literally keeping him alive with my rare Rh-negative blood type—""panda blood,"" as the doctors called it. I'd nursed him through his illness, built my career around our future together, and this was how he repaid me?
I thought of my mother, how she'd withered away after my father's betrayal. How Eleanor had paraded around in my mother's jewelry, slept in my mother's bed, while my mother faded into a shell of herself.
I would not become my mother.
""Hazel? Are you still there?"" Victoria's concerned voice pulled me back.
""I'm calling him back,"" I said decisively.
""Good! Tell him exactly where he can shove his fifty percent!""
After hanging up, I dialed Julian's number again. He answered on the first ring.
""Hazel, I'm glad you called. I know this is a lot to process—""
""Julian,"" I cut him off, my voice cool and steady. ""I've considered your offer.""
""You have?"" Hope tinged his voice. He'd expected me to fall apart, to beg and plead.
""Yes. It's unacceptable.""
""Hazel, please be reasonable—""
""Give me the entire company, and I'll give up the position of bride."" The words flowed with surprising ease. ""If you agree, come back tonight, and we'll sign the agreement.""
Silence stretched between us. I could almost see his shocked expression.
""The... entire company? Hazel, that's my family legacy.""
""And marrying me was supposed to be your future. You've made your choice. Now I'm making mine."" I paused. ""Tonight, Julian. Either come with ownership papers, or don't come at all.""
I ended the call before he could respond, surprising myself with my newfound steel. The devastated bride was gone. In her place stood a woman who refused to be discarded without extracting a proper price.
The ball was in his court now.
2- The Fiancé's Final Insult
I spent the day in a haze of anger, meticulously packing Julian's things into boxes. Six years of shared life reduced to cardboard containers lined up by the door. His favorite coffee mug. Those hideous plaid pajamas I'd always threatened to burn. The silver cufflinks I'd given him for our first anniversary.
With each item, I unearthed memories I was determined to bury. My hands worked mechanically while my mind kept replaying Julian's betrayal over and over.
""Your wedding dress looks better on Ivy anyway,"" I muttered sarcastically, tossing his prized golf trophy into a box with less care than it deserved. The satisfying crack it made as it hit his college diploma frame brought me a fleeting moment of joy.
Just before seven, the doorbell rang. I smoothed down my black dress—deliberately chosen to look like I was attending a funeral—and opened the door.
Julian stood there looking haggard, but it was the woman behind him who caught my attention. Mrs. Landon, Julian's mother, her lips pursed in disapproval as she surveyed me.
""Hazel,"" Julian said, his expression a practiced mix of guilt and resolve. ""You remember my mother.""
""Mrs. Landon,"" I nodded coolly, stepping aside to let them in.
""I thought we'd moved past the formality, dear,"" she said with a thin smile. ""You used to call me Mom.""
""That was before your son decided to marry my sister instead of me,"" I replied sweetly. ""Please, come in. The boxes by the door are Julian's things.""
Julian winced. ""Hazel, I know this is difficult—""
""Is that the agreement?"" I cut him off, pointing to the folder in his hand.
He nodded, following me to the dining table. His mother trailed behind, her heels clicking disapprovingly on my hardwood floors.
""I can't believe you're doing this, Hazel,"" Mrs. Landon said as we sat down. ""After everything our family has done for you. Julian gave you your start in fashion, introduced you to all the right people—""
""Mother, please,"" Julian interrupted, but I was already leaning forward.
""What your family did for me?"" I asked, my voice dangerously soft. ""You mean besides Julian using my rare blood type to keep himself alive for the past six years? Or perhaps you're referring to how he's currently wearing the wedding tux I designed while planning to marry my sister?""
Mrs. Landon's face flushed. ""You're being unreasonable. Ivy is dying—""
""So you keep telling me."" I turned to Julian. ""The agreement?""
Julian slid the folder across the table. I opened it, scanning the documents that transferred ownership of A&G Bespoke entirely to me. Our jointly founded fashion company would now be mine alone. It felt hollow—a business victory that couldn't patch the hole in my heart.
""It's all there,"" Julian said. ""As you demanded.""
""Not quite everything,"" I said, placing the documents down. ""There's the matter of my wedding dress.""
Julian blinked. ""What about it?""
""I want one million for it.""
Mrs. Landon gasped. ""One million dollars? For a dress? Have you lost your mind?""
I kept my eyes fixed on Julian. ""That dress took me six months to design and create. Italian silk, French lace, hand-sewn crystals. It's an Ashworth original worth every penny.""
""This is extortion,"" Mrs. Landon hissed.
Julian held up his hand to silence his mother. ""It's fine. I'll transfer the money.""
""Julian!"" his mother protested.
""No, Mother. She's right."" He pulled out his phone, making the transfer with a few taps. My phone dinged with the notification, and I checked it before continuing.
""Now,"" I said, leaning back in my chair, ""I believe we're done here.""
Julian shifted uncomfortably. ""Actually, there's one more thing.""
Of course there was. I raised an eyebrow, waiting.
""Ivy... she was hoping you might let her have the wedding jewelry set as well. The one you had custom-made to match the dress.""
I stared at him in disbelief. The jewelry set—a diamond and sapphire necklace, earrings, and bracelet I'd designed myself. The sapphires matched my eyes exactly.
""She's dying, Hazel,"" Julian added quietly. ""It would mean the world to her.""
""What exactly does she want my jewelry for when she's going to be dead in three months?"" I asked coldly.
Mrs. Landon gasped again. ""How dare you speak about your sister that way!""
""Half-sister,"" I corrected, just as Julian had done to me on the phone. ""And she's made my life hell since we were children.""
Julian leaned forward, his eyes pleading. ""Hazel, I know things haven't been easy between you two, but people can change. Ivy has changed. The illness has made her reflect on her life.""
I almost laughed at his naivety. ""Has it? Or is she just continuing her lifelong hobby of taking what's mine?""
""Please,"" Julian whispered. ""I'll make it up to you. After... after Ivy passes, we could still have our future together. An even grander wedding, I promise.""
The silence that followed was deafening. I stared at him, unable to process what I'd just heard.
""You think,"" I finally said, each word sharp as glass, ""that after you marry my sister in my wedding dress, I'll just wait patiently for her to die so we can pick up where we left off?""
Julian had the decency to look ashamed, but he pressed on. ""I still love you, Hazel. This doesn't change that. It's just... it's the right thing to do for someone who's suffering.""
I felt something break inside me—the last thread of affection I'd been clinging to. This wasn't just betrayal; it was delusion of the highest order.
""Julian,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady, ""you are truly the most pathetic man I've ever known.""
""Now see here—"" Mrs. Landon began, but I silenced her with a look.
""Fine,"" I said, turning back to Julian. ""Another million for the jewelry set.""
""Two million dollars for jewelry and a dress?"" Mrs. Landon sputtered.
""Two million dollars is a small price to pay for stealing someone's fiancé and wedding,"" I countered.
Julian nodded, making the second transfer without argument. My phone pinged again.
I signed the company transfer agreement, pushing it back across the table. ""You pay me the money, and tomorrow, I will personally deliver the full set of jewelry to the hospital, and visit my good sister while I'm at it.""
A flash of uncertainty crossed Julian's face. He knew my relationship with Ivy well enough to be concerned about what such a visit might entail.
""Hazel, maybe I should—""
""No,"" I cut him off firmly. ""You've made your choice, Julian. Now live with it."" I stood up, signaling the end of our meeting. ""Take your boxes on the way out. I won't be home tomorrow to let the movers in.""
Mrs. Landon looked like she wanted to say more, but Julian took her arm, guiding her toward the door.
""Thank you, Hazel,"" he said quietly. ""I know this isn't easy.""
I didn't respond, just watched as he awkwardly gathered the first load of boxes. At the door, he paused, looking back at me with those eyes I once thought were sincere.
""I really do love you,"" he said. ""I always will.""
I met his gaze steadily. ""Goodbye, Julian.""
After the door closed behind them, I sank onto the couch, staring at my phone. Two million dollars. A small fortune that did nothing to fill the void his betrayal had left.
Tomorrow, I would see Ivy. My half-sister who had spent her life trying to take everything from me. Who was now supposedly dying, yet still found the energy to steal my wedding, my fiancé, and now my jewelry.
I picked up the small velvet box containing the sapphire set, opening it to see the stones gleaming in the lamplight. They were exquisite—and perfect for what I had planned.
I smiled for the first time that day. If Ivy wanted my jewelry so badly, I would be delighted to give it to her personally. And unlike Julian's ridiculous fantasy, I had no intention of waiting around for her to die before reclaiming my life.
Tomorrow, the real reckoning would begin.
3- A Wedding Stolen, A Fury Unleashed
The satisfying slam of the door behind Julian and his mother wasn't nearly enough. The moment they stepped outside, I sank to the floor, my body trembling with rage. Six years. Six years I had given Julian Grayson, and this was how he repaid me.
My dog, Bentley, a gentle golden retriever who usually avoided conflict, sensed my distress and padded over. His warm body pressed against mine, offering silent comfort.
""You're the only male I can trust,"" I whispered, burying my face in his soft fur.
The doorbell rang again. I jerked my head up, fury rekindled.
""What now?"" I hissed.
Through the peephole, I saw Julian standing there alone, shifting nervously from one foot to another.
""Hazel?"" he called through the door. ""I forgot my watch collection.""
I glanced at the expensive box sitting on the side table—the one containing the luxury watches I'd gifted him over the years. Something dark and vengeful rose inside me.
""Oh, you want your watches?"" I shouted back.
I grabbed the box, yanked the door open, and thrust it into his startled hands. Then I reached for the papers we'd just signed.
""And here's our agreement,"" I snarled, flinging the papers in his face. ""Take it all and get out of my life!""
""Hazel, please—""
""Bentley,"" I commanded, pointing at Julian. ""Sic him!""
My usually docile retriever, picking up on my rage, started barking furiously. Julian stumbled backward in alarm as Bentley lunged forward, stopping just at the threshold.
""You're crazy!"" Julian gasped, retreating down the steps.
""I'm crazy? You're marrying my dying sister in my wedding dress!"" I screamed after him. ""Get off my property before I let him loose for real!""
I slammed the door again, hearing Julian's hasty retreat. The adrenaline coursing through me was both exhilarating and exhausting.
""Good boy,"" I whispered to Bentley, who immediately returned to his gentle self, licking my hand as if in apology for his brief ferocity.
Sleep eluded me that night. By morning, I was operating on pure vindictive energy. The two million dollars sat in my account like blood money. I dressed carefully in a crimson blouse and black skirt—war colors. My makeup was flawless, armor against the day ahead.
My phone rang as I was gathering my purse. My father's name flashed on the screen. I contemplated ignoring it but decided to face him head-on.
""Hello, Father.""
""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" Harrison Ashworth's voice boomed through the speaker. ""Julian called me. You set your dog on him?""
I laughed coldly. ""Bentley didn't touch your precious almost-son-in-law. Unlike Julian, he knows the meaning of loyalty.""
""You listen to me, girl,"" my father growled. ""Ivy is dying. The least you can do is show some compassion.""
""Compassion?"" The word tasted bitter. ""Where was Ivy's compassion when she stole my fiancé? Where was your compassion when you let your new wife drive my mother to depression?""
""Don't you dare bring your mother into this! Eleanor has been nothing but good to you—""
""Good to me?"" I interrupted incredulously. ""She's been trying to push me out of your life since day one! And now her daughter is marrying my fiancé, and you're defending them?""
""Ivy deserves some happiness in her final months,"" he insisted. ""And Julian's doing the honorable thing.""
""The honorable thing would have been for him to stay faithful to me,"" I snapped. ""But don't worry, Father. I'm coming to the hospital today to give Ivy my blessing—and my wedding jewelry.""
""You are?"" His suspicion was palpable.
""Four o'clock. Don't be late."" I hung up before he could respond.
At the hospital, I marched through the sterile hallways with purpose, the velvet jewelry box in one hand and another, larger bag in the other. I paused outside Ivy's private room, hearing voices within.
""She's always been jealous of you,"" Eleanor's unmistakable voice drifted through the partially open door. ""Even as a child, she resented that you were prettier, more talented.""
I bit back a laugh. The delusion was astonishing.
""She's probably celebrating that I'm dying,"" Ivy's weak voice replied. ""She never wanted a sister.""
""That's not true, darling. But she's always been difficult, just like her mother. Harrison should never have married that woman.""
My blood boiled at the mention of my mother. I'd heard enough. I pushed the door open with more force than necessary, making Eleanor jump.
""Hazel!"" she exclaimed, her hand fluttering to her throat. ""We didn't hear you come in.""
""Clearly,"" I said dryly. ""Please, don't stop on my account. You were saying something about my mother?""
Eleanor at least had the decency to flush. Ivy lay in the hospital bed, looking pale and thin, but her eyes still held that calculating light I knew too well.
""I brought you something,"" I said, approaching the bed. I placed the velvet box on her lap. ""Your fiancé paid quite handsomely for this.""
Ivy opened the box, her eyes widening at the sapphire and diamond set. ""They're beautiful,"" she murmured, lifting the necklace.
""Yes, they are,"" I agreed. ""Custom-designed to match my eyes—not yours. But I suppose that's fitting. Julian never could see clearly.""
The door opened again, and my father entered, followed closely by Julian. Their expressions shifted from surprise to wariness when they saw me standing by Ivy's bed.
""Hazel,"" my father acknowledged stiffly. ""I didn't expect you so soon.""
""I had another gift to deliver,"" I explained, holding up the second bag. ""A traditional Chinese custom to drive away bad luck.""
Before anyone could react, I pulled out a string of firecrackers from my bag and lit them with a small lighter. The rapid popping filled the room as I tossed them onto the floor.
""What are you doing?"" Eleanor shrieked, jumping back.
The smoke detectors wailed in response, and seconds later, the sprinklers activated, drenching everyone in the room. Ivy screamed as water soaked her hospital gown and bedding. Julian lunged forward to shield her, getting equally drenched.
""Hazel, have you lost your mind?"" my father roared, his expensive suit now ruined.
I stood calmly in the downpour, water streaming down my face. ""Just bringing good fortune to the happy couple,"" I said sweetly.
Nurses and security rushed in, evacuating patients from nearby rooms. In the chaos, I was escorted out, but not before catching Ivy's look of pure hatred. It warmed my heart more than any firecracker could.
Two hours later, after Ivy had been moved to a new room and everyone had changed into dry clothes, I returned. This time, hospital security eyed me suspiciously.
""I'm just here to talk,"" I assured them, hands raised in mock surrender.
Inside the new room, the atmosphere was frigid. My father stood protectively by Ivy's bed, while Julian sat in a chair, head in his hands. Eleanor glared at me from across the room.
""You're lucky they didn't arrest you,"" my father hissed.
""It was an accident,"" I replied innocently. ""Chinese weddings traditionally include firecrackers. I was just honoring the cultural significance of marriage.""
""This isn't funny, Hazel,"" Julian finally spoke, looking up with bloodshot eyes. ""Ivy could have gotten seriously ill from that stunt.""
""Oh? I thought she was already seriously ill,"" I countered.
Ivy reached for Julian's hand. ""It's okay,"" she said weakly. ""She's just upset. I understand.""
""Don't pretend to understand anything about me,"" I said, my voice dangerously low. ""Let's get one thing straight—I know exactly what you're doing, Ivy. You've been trying to take everything from me since we were children.""
""That's not true!"" she protested, tears welling in her eyes. ""I've always looked up to you!""
""Is that why you're marrying my fiancé?"" I asked coldly.
""It just happened,"" Julian interjected. ""We didn't plan it—""
""Oh please,"" I scoffed. ""Nothing just happens with Ivy. Every move is calculated.""
""She's dying, Hazel!"" My father's voice cracked. ""Can't you find some compassion?""
""Like the compassion you showed my mother?"" I fired back. ""Or the compassion Ivy showed when she cut up my prom dress? Or when she spread rumors that I slept with my design professor to get good grades?""
Ivy had the audacity to look shocked. ""That was years ago! I've changed!""
""Have you?"" I pulled out my phone, showing them the screen. ""Then explain this Instagram post from last week, where you're posing in my wedding venue—with my wedding planner!""
Julian paled. ""What?""
""Oh, didn't she tell you? Ivy's been planning this for months. The cancer diagnosis just gave her the perfect excuse.""
""Is this true?"" Julian asked Ivy, whose face had taken on a calculating look.
""Of course not,"" she said quickly. ""I was just... exploring options. I never thought—""
""She didn't just steal my fiancé,"" I interrupted, addressing the room. ""She's taking my entire wedding. Same venue, same date, same dress design—even the same damn cake flavor!""
A heavy silence fell over the room. Julian looked confused, my father uncomfortable, and Eleanor defiant. Ivy's mask slipped for just a moment, revealing a glint of triumph in her eyes.
""Well,"" she finally said, her voice soft but unmistakably smug, ""it seemed a shame to waste all your hard work. And since we're family, I thought you wouldn't mind sharing.""
Julian squeezed her hand, nodding. ""That's right. We're keeping it in the family, Hazel. Your efforts won't go to waste.""
I stared at him, incredulous at his blindness. My fingers curled into fists at my sides as I fought to maintain my composure.
""What's it like?"" I asked, my voice dripping with contempt. ""Keeping the benefits within the family?""
4- A Slap, A Call, and the Unthinkable Proposition
The room fell silent at my question. I could see the gears turning in Julian's head as he processed my words, trying to determine if I was really suggesting what he thought I was.
""Hazel,"" Julian finally said, his voice strained. ""You're upset. I understand—""
""Do you?"" I interrupted, taking a step closer. ""Do you understand that for six years, I gave you my blood? That I watched you suffer through your illness, held your hand through treatments, and postponed my own dreams to support yours?""
Julian's face paled. He couldn't meet my eyes.
My stepmother Eleanor stepped between us, her perfectly manicured finger pointing at my face. ""That's enough! You've caused enough trouble today. How dare you come in here with those... firecrackers and soak my daughter? She's fighting for her life!""
""And I was fighting for mine for six years,"" I countered. ""But none of you seemed to care about that.""
The door opened, and my father stormed in, his face flushed with anger. He must have stepped out earlier and just returned, drawn by the commotion.
""What's going on here?"" he demanded, taking in the tense scene.
Eleanor immediately turned to him, her expression morphing into one of distress. ""Harrison, Hazel is upsetting Ivy again. After everything she's already done today!""
My father's eyes hardened as he looked at me. ""I warned you to behave yourself.""
""Or what?"" I challenged, feeling reckless in my anger. ""You'll disown me? Cut me out of your will? Been there, done that.""
His jaw clenched. ""You ungrateful—""
He raised his hand, and I braced myself for the slap that had been years coming.
But the blow never landed. Julian had moved between us, catching my father's wrist mid-air.
""Harrison, don't,"" Julian said firmly. ""This isn't helping anyone.""
My father yanked his arm free, pointing at me. ""Get her out of here. Now.""
Julian turned to me, his expression pleading. ""Hazel, can we talk privately?""
""There's nothing to talk about,"" I said coldly.
He grabbed my arm as I turned to leave. ""Please, just five minutes.""
I looked down at his hand on my arm, then back up at his face. With deliberate slowness, I raised my own hand and slapped him hard across the cheek. The sound echoed through the hospital room.
""Don't ever touch me again,"" I hissed, then walked out, head held high.
I was shaking by the time I reached the parking lot, adrenaline coursing through my veins. I fumbled with my keys, dropping them twice before managing to unlock my car. Once inside, I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white, fighting back tears that threatened to spill.
My phone rang. Victoria's face flashed on the screen. I took a deep breath and answered.
""Hey.""
""Where are you?"" Victoria demanded. ""I've been trying to reach you all day!""
""At the hospital,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. ""Or just leaving it.""
""Hospital? Are you okay?""
""I'm fine. I just paid Ivy a little visit.""
There was a beat of silence. ""Tell me you didn't murder her.""
Despite everything, I laughed. ""No, but I did set off firecrackers in her hospital room.""
""You WHAT?""
I filled Victoria in on everything as I drove to her family's restaurant, The Imperial Garden. By the time I pulled into the parking lot, she was both horrified and impressed.
""You're insane,"" she said when I finished. ""Completely insane. I love it.""
Victoria was waiting at our usual corner booth, two glasses of wine already poured. She stood when she saw me, pulling me into a fierce hug.
""You look terrible,"" she said bluntly, examining my face.
""Thanks. That's just what I needed to hear.""
""You know what I mean."" She pushed a glass toward me. ""Drink.""
I obeyed, taking a long sip of the rich red wine. ""Julian wants to talk,"" I said, setting the glass down.
""Of course he does."" Victoria rolled her eyes. ""What's there to talk about? He's marrying your sister in your wedding.""
""Stepsister,"" I corrected automatically.
""Whatever. Blood relations don't seem to matter much to him anyway."" Her eyes narrowed. ""What else aren't you telling me?""
I sighed, knowing I couldn't hide anything from her. ""They're getting married in three weeks. At my venue. In my dress design.""
Victoria's mouth fell open. ""You're kidding.""
""I wish I was."" I took another sip of wine. ""Ivy's been planning this for months. The cancer just gave her the perfect excuse.""
""That manipulative bitch."" Victoria's hand tightened around her glass. ""And Julian? He's just going along with it?""
""He's convinced himself it's the noble thing to do."" I laughed bitterly. ""Giving a dying woman her last wish.""
Victoria pulled out her phone.
""What are you doing?""
""Calling that spineless excuse for a man."" Before I could stop her, she had Julian on speaker.
""Victoria?"" Julian sounded wary.
""You pathetic bastard,"" she greeted him cheerfully. ""I just heard what you did to Hazel.""
""It's complicated—""
""No, it's really not. You're leaving a woman who gave you her blood for six years to marry her dying stepsister. That's not complicated; that's despicable.""
""You don't understand—""
""What don't I understand? That you're weak? That you couldn't stand up to a manipulative woman and her equally manipulative mother? That you threw away six years for what... guilt? Pity?""
There was silence on the other end.
""Nothing to say?"" Victoria continued. ""Good. Listen carefully. If I ever see you near Hazel again without her explicit permission, I will personally make sure every high-end restaurant in this city knows exactly what kind of man you are. You'll be eating fast food for the rest of your miserable life.""
She hung up before he could respond.
I stared at her, equal parts mortified and grateful. ""You didn't have to do that.""
""Yes, I did."" She refilled our glasses. ""Now, what's the plan?""
""Plan?""
""For revenge, obviously.""
I sighed, suddenly feeling tired. ""I don't know if I want revenge anymore. I just want to move on.""
""Bullshit,"" Victoria said flatly. ""I saw what you did with those firecrackers. You want revenge. You're just afraid to admit it.""
Before I could respond, my phone rang. Julian. I showed Victoria the screen.
""Speak of the devil,"" she muttered.
After a moment's hesitation, I answered, putting it on speaker. ""What do you want?""
""We need to talk about the company transfer,"" Julian said, his voice all business. ""And finalize our divorce.""
My heart twisted at the word ""divorce,"" even though we'd only been engaged, not married. But after six years together, it felt like a marriage in all but name.
""Fine,"" I said coldly. ""When?""
""Tomorrow morning. My office. Nine o'clock.""
""I'll be there."" I hung up without waiting for his response.
Victoria raised an eyebrow. ""What company transfer?""
""He's giving me MG Designs as compensation,"" I explained. ""It's a failing fashion house, but the brand still has some recognition. With work, I could turn it around.""
""And you're accepting this? Like some kind of payoff?""
I shrugged. ""It's better than nothing. And it gives me a head start on my own business.""
Victoria didn't look convinced, but she didn't argue further.
The next morning, I dressed carefully in a tailored black suit that I'd designed myself. Professional, elegant, and utterly impenetrable. Julian wouldn't see an ounce of vulnerability from me today.
His office was exactly as I remembered it—sleek, modern, and soulless. Julian was waiting with his lawyer, documents spread across the conference table.
""Hazel,"" he greeted me, rising to his feet. ""Thank you for coming.""
I nodded curtly, taking a seat across from him. ""Let's make this quick.""
For the next hour, we went through the paperwork for the transfer of MG Designs. Despite everything, Julian was fair with the terms, ensuring I had complete control of the company and its assets.
""Now for the divorce,"" I said when we finished, pushing the signed papers aside.
Julian glanced at his lawyer, who cleared his throat. ""Actually, since you're not legally married, it's simply a matter of terminating the engagement. However, given the circumstances, Mr. Grayson thought it prudent to formalize the separation.""
""Let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau now,"" I suggested, wanting this chapter of my life closed as quickly as possible.
Julian nodded, dismissing his lawyer. ""I'll drive.""
The ride to the bureau was silent and tense. I stared out the window, deliberately keeping my body turned away from him.
At the bureau, we took numbers and waited. When our turn came, we approached the desk together.
""We'd like to file for divorce,"" Julian explained to the clerk.
The woman looked up from her computer. ""Do you have an appointment?""
""No,"" I replied. ""We thought we could do it today.""
She shook her head. ""I'm sorry, but you need to schedule an appointment first. And there's a mandatory 30-day cooling-off period after filing.""
""Thirty days?"" I repeated, my stomach sinking.
""Yes, that's the law,"" she confirmed. ""The earliest appointment I have is next Wednesday. After that, you'll need to wait thirty days before the divorce can be finalized.""
I did the mental math quickly. That would mean we'd still be legally married when Julian and Ivy had their wedding.
""Is there any way to expedite the process?"" Julian asked.
The clerk looked sympathetic but firm. ""No, I'm afraid not.""
We scheduled the appointment and left, the silence between us even heavier than before.
""This is a problem,"" I finally said as we reached his car.
Julian hesitated, then looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite read.
""Maybe it's not,"" he said carefully.
""What do you mean?""
He took a deep breath. ""Maybe we don't need to get divorced at all.""
I stared at him, sure I had misheard. ""Excuse me?""
""Ivy's prognosis isn't good, Hazel. Six months, maybe less."" His voice was soft, almost tender. ""After she's gone... maybe you and I could try again.""
My mouth fell open as the full implication of his words hit me. He was suggesting we remain married while he married my stepsister, waiting for her to die so we could reunite. The sheer audacity of it left me speechless.
""Are you actually serious right now?"" I finally managed, my voice barely above a whisper.
Julian reached for my hand, his eyes earnest. ""I still love you, Hazel. What I'm doing for Ivy... it's just to give her some happiness in her final days. But you're the one I want to spend my life with.""
 5- An Unthinkable Request and a Bitter Accusation
""Are you actually serious right now?"" I stared at Julian, unable to believe what I was hearing. The audacity of this man to suggest we stay married while he married my stepsister, then reunite after her death.
His eyes were pleading, hand still reaching for mine. ""Hazel, please understand—""
I slapped his hand away. ""Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me.""
""I'm just trying to make this right!"" Julian's voice cracked with desperation.
""Make it right?"" I let out a bitter laugh. ""You want to marry my dying stepsister in my wedding, using my designs, while staying married to me, then come back when she's dead? And you think that makes anything right?""
His face flushed. ""When you put it that way—""
""There's no other way to put it!"" I was shouting now, not caring who heard. ""You're disgusting. Both of you.""
""Ivy is dying!"" Julian raised his voice to match mine. ""Don't you have any compassion?""
That was the final straw. I slapped him across the face, harder than I had at the hospital. The sound echoed in the parking lot.
""Don't you dare lecture me about compassion,"" I seethed. ""I gave you my blood for six years. I postponed my dreams for you. I nursed you through your illness. Where was your compassion when you canceled our wedding? Where was your compassion when you let Ivy steal everything I worked for?""
Julian rubbed his reddening cheek, eyes downcast. ""I didn't think—""
""That's right. You didn't think. You never do."" I turned away from him. ""This conversation is over. I'm filing for divorce next week, with or without you. And don't ever contact me again except through lawyers.""
I walked away, my heels clicking on the pavement. For once, Julian didn't follow.
Once in my car, I took a deep breath. I needed to call Grandma Helen and Aunt Rebecca to explain what happened. They had been so excited about the wedding.
""Hello, sweetheart!"" Grandma's cheerful voice answered after two rings. ""How are the final wedding preparations going?""
My throat tightened. ""Grandma... there's not going to be a wedding.""
Silence fell on the other end. ""What happened?"" Her voice was suddenly much sharper.
I told her everything—Julian's betrayal, Ivy's manipulation, even the firecrackers. By the end, I could hear Aunt Rebecca in the background, swearing colorfully.
""That absolute weasel!"" Aunt Rebecca was now on speakerphone. ""I'll fly back right now. Let me at him.""
Despite everything, I smiled. My mother's family had always been fiercely protective.
""No need,"" I assured her. ""I've handled it. The wedding's off, and I'm moving forward.""
""What about your design business?"" Grandma asked practically. ""Wasn't it tied up with his company?""
""He's signing over MG Designs to me. It's not doing well, but I can turn it around.""
""Of course you can,"" Grandma said firmly. ""You're Catherine's daughter.""
My eyes welled with tears at the mention of my mother. ""I miss her.""
""She would be so proud of you,"" Aunt Rebecca said softly. ""Standing up for yourself like this.""
After promising to keep them updated, I hung up and drove straight to my new office. Ashworth Bespoke—formerly MG Designs—was now mine. The paperwork had been rushed through, probably Julian's guilty conscience at work.
The staff seemed uncertain as I walked through the doors. News traveled fast, and they surely knew about the canceled wedding.
""Good morning, everyone,"" I announced, standing in the center of the main workspace. ""As you may have heard, I am now the sole owner of this company, which will now be called Ashworth Bespoke. I look forward to working with all of you.""
A few hours later, my assistant knocked on my office door. ""Ms. Ashworth? Mr. Grayson is here to collect his personal items.""
I nodded stiffly. ""Let him in. I'll step out.""
Julian entered as I gathered my things to leave. Our eyes met briefly, but I looked away first, refusing to engage. I walked past him without a word, chin high, back straight. He didn't try to speak either.",1,1750649313.0,novelsfree,4,1.0,False
1li6gjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1li6gjq/when_is_it_growth_vs_changing_who_you_are_for/,When is it growth vs. changing who you are for someone else? I’m exhausted trying to meet my boyfriend’s expectations.,"Hi everyone. I’m really struggling and could use some outside perspective.

My boyfriend (25M) and I (23F) have had a complicated relationship. We started as friends, shifted into a situationship, and officially became a couple at the end of November—after I’d tried to end things in October. I came back because I care about him deeply and truly wanted to try again.

But lately, I feel like I’m constantly falling short. I have severe anxiety, I’m autistic, and I work full-time as a teacher. My personal life is incredibly stressful—my dad is very sick, and my mom isn’t really present. I’ve been carrying a lot emotionally, and it’s starting to spill over into our relationship.

This past weekend was rough. My boyfriend invited my dog over to his apartment (we don’t live together), which seemed sweet, but quickly became overwhelming. My dog is reactive—she’s lunged and even tried to bite unfamiliar people before. I manage her on a strict routine for everyone’s safety. But he wanted me to treat her like a “normal dog.” During the walk, he even took her muzzle off. I was panicking inside, but I went along with it because I didn’t want to start an argument.

Later, he asked if I trusted him. I was honest—I said I don’t always feel like I can fully rely on him. There have been a lot of moments where I’ve felt dismissed or misunderstood.

One recurring issue is food. I have a lot of sensitivities, and while I’m always willing to try new things, sometimes I genuinely can’t finish something if the texture or taste overwhelms me. He says I need to grow up and stop being childish. That hurts, because I am trying—and being made to feel ashamed just makes it harder.

Today, we had another disagreement. He felt like I was giving more attention to my dog than to him. He told me that if I want things from him—like affection or support—I should be showing that more clearly. He also brought up things like forgetting to replace a trash bag or not cleaning up a few grains of rice under the coffee table, even though I thought I was improving. I had just cleaned up spilled dog food and wiped some spots on the rug.

Then he said something that really hit me:

“The reason I don’t say it back is because I haven’t felt like you actually care for me the way your words say you do. Words are just words. Actions mean everything.” He says I act childlike sometimes—that it was cute at first, but now it’s something I need to grow out of. He wants me to act more “adult,” especially in public, to meet a certain standard. He said it’s how he honors the memory of his mother, who passed away and has been on his mind a lot lately. I understand that grief can be overwhelming, but it feels like I’m being held to a standard I didn’t even know existed—and one I’m not sure I can meet.

He says he does a lot to take care of me, and that the little things I do—like giving him a facemask every now and then—don’t feel like a fair exchange. But he doesn’t really tell me what he wants. We go out to eat sometimes, but he’s a homebody. I’ve asked him directly what he needs from me, and he hasn’t been clear. When we don’t have anything planned, I read or scroll TikTok. We do watch movies together, and I know he enjoys gaming, but I’m not always sure how to connect with him in a way that feels meaningful to him.

I don’t want to be a burden. I want to be a good partner. I’m trying—truly. But I feel like no matter what I do, it’s never enough. And I’m exhausted from constantly wondering if I’m the problem.

TL;DR: Boyfriend says I’m not doing enough. I’m autistic, anxious, and trying my best. So I guess I’m asking: Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you know when it’s time to work harder on yourself vs. when you’re being asked to change in ways that feel unfair or unsustainable? What can I do better? Am I missing something?

I have been taking a gradual approach to this because I cut out caffeine/coffee over a month ago and its helped alot for other areas like less anxiety.
Not exercising. 

Anyways I have done a lot of fruit and haven't seen any major losses per se because I've been doing lean protein at night.  Im feeling great however and energy is doing good.

Recently I started enjoying the V8 juice because I wasn't doing well on straight sugar.  Cole is right, definitely need salts, snake juice!

Yesterday I did almost a full day liquid diet LOL. Drank V8, juice and 1 banana and last night I had a couple Cheladas for dinner and today i woke up to a 1lb loss!
Im taking it to task and doing the same again today.  Im already naturally in a calorie deficit by default but im not trying to cut calories.
V8 really does crush cravings and hunger!  I wanted chips and tacos and V8 crushed that craving!

So Im playing around and testing if having another Chelada for dinner will cause a break of stall.  I had 1 banana today,  sugar, juice, V8 and a Chelada.
I also took 1/8 tspn of Potassium Chloride in V8.. so I've got plenty of salts now.

Im not going to look at the scale as the determination of loss because sodium and potassium will hold water.
But Im on my 2nd day.  Having fun drinking a big kid drink LOL 😆  because restrictions amd dieting with low carb was never fun!!  Its SUMMER AND I WANNA BEER! LOL

One thing for sure.. my stomach is flatter, I have energy and feel good!

She just recently got a divorce and sold her house. She makes questionable decisions, and is extremely scatter brained so in the process of selling her house she was supposed to have an apartment lined up but some things fell through and she ended up having no where to go. She called her parents first and they gave her tough love, I get it but I couldn’t let her be homeless. My husband and I talked it over and set some rules and said that she could move in for a little bit while she looked for apartments. I gave her up to three months because I told her that’s when we’re going to start trying for a baby. She moved in about a month ago and I’m growing to really resent her. She’s home all day on the weekends, I feel smothered. I have no free time with my husband alone because she’s always around and our house is not huge so we feel like we can’t be loud in the bedroom. She rarely cleans up after herself and it’s little things like shoes in the floor, bowls left on the side tables. She makes coffee every morning using our coffee, washes her clothes with our laundry detergent and ever single time I cook she expects food too. Food ain’t cheap. And I’m only making her pay a small amount of rent so that she could have extra money to get herself an apartment. She’s so innocently oblivious sometimes and I’m having a hard time navigating this and I don’t want this to ruin our friendship. she also has her own room which I told her I don’t want her confined to but she never leaves the living room. I can’t spend time with my husband alone in our home. And she even naps in the living room. I just feel like a regular person would read the room a little and go nap in your room. It’s hella annoying. We also let her bring her dog and that thing never stops barking when she leaves. If she’s here he’s fine but the problem is that she leaves at 7 am and her dog barks and wakes us up. AITAH for feeling resentful when I made the decision to let her live here?

What happened? Well, I have viral rhinopharyngitis, and I was supposed to take meds for that, but I dont have money until next week so I decided to just...wing it. Power through the sickness. And thats when I decided to take a random pill I found on my vanity.

Why did I trip? Maybe because I was already having floaty feelings on my body or maybe because I tried to use the things I sell in the store to cure my symptoms (spoiler: that made it worse) or maybe because I was desperate to sleep so I took a huge dose of melatonin to sleep (510 mg to be exact, yes, they sell that high) and it all just combine.

How do I feel? Horrible. I have been spitting/puking white foamy saliva, have horrible stomach issues (gassy, acidic reflux, less hunger). I have no sense of smell or taste, my tongue feels both burnt and waxy, while my water tasted like burnt coffee.

Why I didnt go to a doctor sooner? I dont have insurance yet, I technically have it, but I havent been able to get a clinic so I couldnt go sooner. My diagnosis was made by a doctor on a pharmacy, and that is the best I could get.

I still went to work, I completed my shift, so Im hoping that I will get my payment in full. Sorry for the rambling on the last post, and I hope this one is more readable than the last lol

1. Takes in a base document (something like a sheet in pdf format) that you would fill out for outlining the specifications of a building
2. AI is going to analyze the pdf and ask some questions about it
3. Takes in a recording from a meeting and AI is going to read the transcript of it and analyze
4. Populates an updated version of the document with all the chnages that are fetched from the meeting recording.

The prototype I built only does a part of the features that I described above but the workflow above is what I think that could help you guys a lot and I would like honest opinions about it. (Please be brutal and straight up, I am ready for it!!)

I've posted some thoughts on the experience below, but first - my son Daniel decided to produce a full show inspired by Jet Lag from the experience, and the **first episode just dropped**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjx\_iC73xY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjx_iC73xY)

Something to watch while you wait for the next (real) episode on Wednesday! 

Now, as for our experience...   
Some notes on the rules and prep for the game:

* We played on the subway and tram lines - no buses or trains. We created a bounding box of an area about 50 sq mi in size, but had  > 100 stations including all tram stops.
* We made a printed map using Google Maps with transit layer, put it in Photoshop and added a scale then resized to fit a Legal size paper. You can see a copy here: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/edvr6pzKMGWPqoBUA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/edvr6pzKMGWPqoBUA)  \- feel free to use it if you play in Toronto. The scale made it easy to measure with a compass and you'll see us carrying the paper map on a clipboard in the video
* We made some minor rule modifications based on the play area and some tabletop games we did before departing:
   * **Played using the ""small"" rules EXCEPT** with a 45 minute hiding time, AND all of the Medium seeker questions allowed (photos, tentacles, etc) to help speed things along
   * **3 hr hard limit on each hider** \- we wanted to ensure that all 3 of us could hide in the single day we had to play. Our plan was to use ""seekers final distance from hider"" as the tiebreak if multiple people went 3 hrs (did not end up being needed)
   * **We eliminated measuring options where everywhere in the play area would be closest to a single location** (Airport, Border, Mountain, Amusement park). The reason is that with a single possible measuring spot, these all turn into thermometers that can easily be used to split the play area in half, which we didn't think was their intent. *Thermometers are very powerful!* 
   * The hangman curse words have to exist on the [official wordle word list](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-list/wordle-word-list) (we didn't want any insanely obscure words). We never got this curse.

Overall the day went very well and we had a fantastic time. I'm not going to give a play-by-play because you can watch the videos if you're interested. I will provide some thoughts/suggestions/ideas for anyone looking to play themselves.

* **Get in shape!** Our game day ended up about 11 hours in total with over 35K steps. It was both physically and mentally exhausting! 
* **Prepare ahead of time** \- having the printed map, a compass and ruler for both sides, clear location-specific rules, and some practice tabletop games made thing run pretty smoothly overall. We used Discord for comms and Google Maps location sharing for position. 
* **Matching and measuring questions can be very tricky with Google Maps** as we discovered in our table top games, and we didn't use them much during the actual game (other than Matching Transit Line which is very helpful to verify the hider's stop is on our line). The reason for this is that there are often either only one of the things (see why we eliminated Airport/Border/etc above) which makes the question too powerful, or a lot of the things, and **Google Maps doesn't always show both sides the same search results** (depending on your zoom level and its general mood). For example, in our tabletop game, we narrowed the hider to an area we though had only 2 parks, but if you zoomed in closely enough and searched for park, there was a ""parkette"" (which is marked as a Park in Google Maps) that the hider could see and the seekers weren't aware of. Similar problem with Hospital, where at a city-level zoom it looks like there are only a couple but if you zoom into neighborhoods more show up. This means that you aren't always using the same data points as each other. With enough time to prep, we might consider picking a fixed list of points for each category and marking them on a custom google map to avoid confusion.
* **Radar questions aren't very accurate in small/med games** \- They are tied to the hider's location at the time they reply - which can be gamed by moving during the reply period (within their zone). Of course this is explained in the show as a feature that can be exploited, *but you may underestimate the impact* \- with a 0.5 mi diameter hiding zone for small/med games, you have to add+subtract 0.5mi off the radius of the radar to get the ""guaranteed""  zone. **So the 1/4mi and 1/2mi radar are essentially worthless**, and the 1 mi radar is really only a 0.5 mi radar (if it's a miss). This came up in a big way in our game (not in the first episode), and we decided if we play again, we will *tie all radars to the HIDER STATION rather than HIDER LOCATION* to make them actually useful. 
* **The max question answer times (10 min for pictures, 5 min for others) can be annoying** if you are trying to run an ""efficient"" game - obviously the best hider strategy is to wait until your last second to reply, but it means that a lot of the time the seekers are just sitting around waiting for the reply to plan their next move (and the hider is waiting for the time limit to send the reply). Sometimes this can be optimized (like sending a picture request while you are riding transit) but honestly it just dragged the game out - especially in the endgame when you tend to ask multiple picture questions. In the future, I think we would consider something like a time credit system (i.e. if you reply in <10 minutes, you get bonus time on your run for the time difference) and/or reducing max response times in the endgame (1 min should be sufficient since you never have to move to reply) in order to keep the game moving. 
* **The endgame feels harder IRL than in the show** \- particularly in a dense urban area if you are trying to keep play time reasonable. There just aren't many useful questions to ask. The radars and thermometers are too large, matching/measuring is difficult (see above) so you are left with photos and tentacles. The photos have a long turn-around time (if you need 4 photos, that's 40 minutes, see above for recommendation on reducing that) and can be somewhat useless depending on where they are hiding.  Tentacles are OK but not a complete solution, and could use more categories (Park or Coffee shop would be a good ones). Adding smaller radars or an endgame only thermometer might help. I would also reduce the picture taking time for the endgame since you don't have to move to take the picture. Possibly adding some new picture types such as ""picture in both directions"" (selfie and forward in the same position) or ""picture of a random person"" (which would force them to get more background in the shot). A smaller hiding radius may work for some folks. 

That's pretty much it but happy to answer any questions. Overall Toronto was a GREAT city to play in, both large enough and safe enough to turn some teenage boys loose in for some crazy Hide and Seek fun.

1li5ytu,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1li5ytu/keg_profitability/,Keg Profitability,"I did some profitability math for the Keg and found some results that surprised me.

* Making coffee is by far the most profitable thing you can do with a Keg, IF you're willing to make 9 coffees / day / keg. ($37,785 / keg / season)
* Green Tea is the second most profitable, with the same logic, if you're willing to make 6 green teas / day / keg. ($16,800 / keg / season)
* After that the most profitable thing you can do with a Keg is actually just make Mead. (4 Honey Boxes / Keg, 1 Mead / Day, $300 / Day, 28 Mead / Season, $8400 / Season). This discounts the cost of making the Honey Box, but you only need to do that once, not once per season or even per year.

In terms of profit / keg / season, this is the next few after that:

|Crop|Product|Profit / Keg / Season|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Starfruit|Starfruit Wine|7400|
|Ancient Fruit|Ancient Fruit Wine|6600|
|Wheat|Beer|5320|
|Pumpkin|Pumpkin Juice|4340|
|Hops|Pale Ale|4140|
|Pineapple|Pineapple Wine|3600|
|Red Cabbage|Red Cabbage Juice|3395|
|Melon|Melon Wine|2680|
|Artichoke|Artichoke Juice|2310|
|Rhubarb|Rhubarb Wine|2240|
|Cauliflower|Cauliflower Juice|2191|

I guess this surprises me because I always assumed Ancient Fruit was more profitable than Starfruit, but I guess it's just more convenient that you don't have to replant your Ancient Fruit after every harvest. But on the flip side, you can get Starfruit from Calico Desert without needing to find an Ancient Seed first. Also, wheat, pumpkin, and hops aren't that far behind these exotic fruits.

The Iridium Star versions of these don't change the math, you can just double everything provided you have enough casks, except the juice. And the coffee and green tea is more profitable than even iridium star starfruit wine, but having to make 9 coffees per day per keg is a huge caveat to that.

Another crazy thing is that even if you only make 1 coffee / day / keg, it's still the same profitability as making Pale Ale, depending on how you count the cost of the coffee plant (if you pay $2500 for the coffee bean, obviously it's worse, but if you got it for free, then it's slightly better). Green Tea would fall somewhere between Melon Wine and Artichoke Juice if you only make 1 / day / keg.

In terms of profit / crop / season, Banana Trees are the best, but you need to build 7 Kegs for every Banana Tree to get it. Also that's kind of cheating since it's a tree, so it takes up more space.",5,1750647704.0,StardewValley,7,0.86,False
1li5ysv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1li5ysv,NightRider V2; the Review I Promised,"NightRider V2 by Koka Labz; the Review I promised

I was so excited to try this one, and I had it for a total of 10 hours before cracking it open.
The meaty morsels of this formula: 
•200mg DMHA
•200mg Phenibut
•200mg B-PEA
•fast acting and extended release caffeine 100mg/100mg
•Bitter Orange 50mg
•Omberacetam 25mg
•alpha yo 1mg

*Serving size is 3 capsules.*

I took it with 2 scoops of Crack Reloaded V2 which I’ve been using as my semi-daily.

I ate the caps at about 4:30am, Reloaded went down around 4:45am-ish. I try to take caps before the preworkout if I’m stacking this way.

 Long story short, I found myself in the gym, unable to leave! It took 6 police officers with pepper spray and tasers, beating me and spraying me for 5.5 minutes. One of them sicked their dogs on me (dog is dead now) and I finished up my set of chest exercises after about an hour and 30 minutes working chest and triceps.

While training, I felt lighter but also heavier at the same time. The phenibut at 200mg really shines through in this magical formula. I thought I wouldn’t feel the phenibut with it being that low but it certainly came through at 200mg . Phenibut is one of those weird things where less is more and even that depends from source to source. This is a real nice source of phenibut.

 The synergy of the DMHA and B-PEA, with the phenibut is almost too much euphoria. Crack Reloaded already has a heavy dose of Eria jarensis and BPEA, and the phenibut with the DMHA just makes this very intense, locked in focus where it was just the moment, myself, and the weights in the gym. I’m also pretty sure that the omberacetam contributed to that really strong focus.

 I’m very happy with this blend! This is one of those nice and strong, compliment capsules that is on the same level as Therma Spark; but in my opinion is better than TS! I don’t care if that’s blasphemy to some of you folks. This is one of those compliment capsules that really bring out the best in your main pre workout and also your performance in the gym. This is something you might take with a pre workout on the weekend and try to get two sessions in on that day. 
My first gym session was at 5am and that lasted 1.5 hours, my 2nd session occurred at 3pm and all I took at that time was a small cup of black coffee and the formula felt like it was rejuvenated! 

 This weekend was a trial and I’m definitely going to use this on the weekends to try and get some extra training time with. I think next weekend I’m going to run this with kill switch. I’m going to avoid other DMHA products with this because the DMHA is really nice, a perfect amount for this blend at 200mg. No more is needed.

I also feel like this formula would be something to do some other type of training with, it seems very versatile. I would even take this for some type of long day doing administrative office type work… but that’s not why I got it.

 I received this package direct from Koka Labs after a trade with my buddy in Australia, 187ummKilla. He got smash AMF from me and I got this. It was a phenomenal trade, both packages landed at their respective destinations on the same days.

I do techy kind of work and just keep to myself. Over the course of the day, most of the conversations I hear (because usually I don't talk) have two meanings. I don't really know how to explain it. It could be something as simple as, ""why isn't the coffee machine working?"", and to me, I imagine it is code language for something that I need to do later that day. My current dilemma is an ethical one. I think that I did something wrong towards a psychic (that's her business, she works in a building with a sign that describes her practice as psychic type work). I violated a boundary. It is complicated because she is the second psychic involved and both the psychics are close to each other. She sent me on a quest after that. The quest involves getting a certain item from a woman who was my love interest until she told me she is separated from her husband (I hadn't known she was still married) at which point I asked her if she could fix that relationship, because she has a big family with him. Ask me anything, I don't know where to start. My second world of delusions gets convoluted to the point of being like the movie Inception (delusion inside delusion, inside...).

Well, coffee lovers unite because the latest Reddit chatter is all about this Organic SuperGreens Powder that’s supposedly changing the game. I mean, could something so simple be worth the hype? 

When I stumbled upon it, I’ll admit I was skeptical. We’ve all been there, right? You see these trendy health products that promise the world and deliver... what? A weird aftertaste? But after diving into the discussions and some personal trials, here's what I gathered:

- **Packed with Nutrients**: The consensus seems to be that these powders are loaded with everything from vitamins to antioxidants. 
- **Convenience Alert!**: Just mix it with water or toss it in your morning smoothie. Say goodbye to chopping and washing all those veggies! 
- **Energy Boosts**: People are raving about feeling more energized throughout the day. I mean, who doesn't need a little boost in the afternoon slump? 
- **Gut Health**: Some folks talked about improved digestion—goodbye, bloating! It's like *poof*, all gone. 

But here’s the kicker: **Is it as good as fresh greens?** 🤔 There’s been a lot of debate about how much of those nutrients actually translate when they’re processed into powder form. 

Also, have you ever tried something only to feel a little... iffy afterward? Definitely something to keep in mind—every body is different. 

For me, trying things like this goes hand in hand with feeling *RetirementReady*. It’s about feeling our best to enjoy the years ahead. You might think, ""Ugh, why not just eat a salad?"" But, let’s be real—some days you’re rushing out the door with a granola bar in hand!

1li5f12,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1li5f12/joys_jubilee/,Joy's Jubilee,"“C’mon, Jeremy! Hurry up!” I could hear Marcus whine from the other side of the bathroom door. I simply rolled my eyes, and continued to comb my hair to perfection, and apply my cologne. I opened the door and peered down at my seven year old brother, as an expression of annoyance dominated his face. “We’re gonna be late ‘cuz of you!” He grumbled.

Dad walked by, making final preparations in the house, and ruffled his hair. “Relax, kiddo. Joy’s Jubilee isn’t going anywhere.”

I nodded, agreeing. I don’t know why Marcus is so worked up, the dumb amusement park is open until 10 tonight, and we’ll still probably make it right when it opens. I could tell there was no logic in Marcus' fidgeting and frustration. The fact of the matter to him was simple: we were supposed to be at a theme park today, and at that moment, we weren't.

When I walked down the hall to get my shoes on, Marcus nearly knocked me over rushing to the front door. “Joy’s Jubilee: Where a kid like me, can be totally free!” He sang, like he’s heard in the jingle countless times.

“Ah, that reminds me, honey- we have headache medicine in the car, yeah?” My mom asked as she turned to dad. He simply nodded, pouring the pot of coffee into two separate containers.

“Here, you’ll need this too.” He laughed, handing her the container. With one last check around the house, we piled into the van, and hit the road, ready for a two hour journey. We spent most of the time listening to Marcus excitedly planning what he wants to do first, and listening to him loudly watch video’s starring Joy the Juniper Tree. I found myself staring out the window as the countryside rolled by. While I found Joy’s Jubilee fun, I’d always get a small pit in my stomach whenever we went. Dad assured me that we picked a good time of the year, and that there was nothing to worry about, but as I watched the clouds roll by, I couldn’t shake my tiny feeling of unease. I tried to think about all the people that’d be there that day, in hopes that it’d help. Before I knew it, however, we passed by a sign with a cartoon tree on it, with the words “Howdy, folks! This way to Joy’s Jubilee!” plastered in colorful writing.

“It’s Joy!” Marcus squealed, as if it’s the first time he’d seen it. We managed to slowly drift in a sea of parked cars, before we found a spot. The four of us wobbled out of the car, stretching our legs, before we were hit with a spray of white mist.

“Dad! Warn me next time, geez! I almost had my mouth open.” I coughed and sputtered. The smell of bananas and coconut overpowered my nose, as dad shook the spray-can of sunscreen, before hitting us with another dose, like an exterminator to a persistent roach.

“Can’t be too careful, boys! Close your eyes!” He said over the hiss of the can, before he turned to my mother. She eyed him coldly.

She only uttered, “No.” Before snatching the can away from him, and spraying herself down.

With the whole family properly coated, we began the trek to the front gates of Joy’s Jubilee. The large coasters, and other various attractions crested over the treeline as we were faced with the large, colorful sign of Joy and her seedlings, at the entrance of Joy’s Jubilee. Marcus could barely stop moving, jumping in place excitedly as Dad paid for the tickets. Dad had us all sign the waiver, before handing it back to the ticket person. The person handing my dad the tickets smiled, with their awkward, wooden smile. “It’s a Joy to have you here!” They chirped with a rehearsed cadence.

With a swing of the turnstile, we were past the front gates, into the main part of the park, Joy’s Junction, filled with food stalls of all kinds, and plenty of overpriced merchandise, all to the theme of a fairy grove. “Park Map? Buttons? Balloons?” The seedlings were every few feet or so, each with a chipper grin, and the same, clear cadence. The older I got, the more unnerving I found the seedlings to be. They were so lifelike, from a distance. The closer you got, however, the more their skin looked like bark, and their eyes seemed too glossy. “How about a shirt, commemorating our newest seedling, Glenda?” One held up a shirt, a cartoonish seedling girl’s face in the middle of the shirt, with the words “Glenda” in a cutesy font underneath, and the Joy’s Jubilee logo next to it.

Marcus had no time for the seedlings, however, as he rushed past them to the center of Joy’s Junction, where there she stood herself- Joy the Juniper. A gigantic, towering tree,a crown of branches with berries, she stood in the middle of the plaza, fenced off on all sides. Her eyes were currently closed. A small wave of calm ran through my shoulders.

“HIIIIIII JOOOOOY!” Marcus called out to the tree, and waved. Dad came up to him, and placed his hand on Marcus’ shoulder. “Marcus, don’t tell me you asked to come here for your birthday, just to say hi to a tree, hmm? I bet the line to Forest Flyers is pretty low, if we hurry.” Marcus spun around excitedly, giggling, and started running in the direction he knew the coaster was in. “Hurry, hurry!” He called to us over his shoulder.

From Forest Flyers, we hit Spinning Sunflowers next, followed by The Boar, one of the newer, high speed roller coasters. Dad insisted we hit the Atrium of Legendary Botanists next, despite the fact that he always slept through the show. By now, we were getting pretty hungry, and so we sat down for a bite to eat over at Oakey-Dokey. Even as the seedlings catered to us, bringing the food over in a quick and expert manner, I was enjoying myself thoroughly. I did notice my berry smoothie tasting a bit off, which was weird, as it was usually my favorite thing to get. Beyond that, the worries of the day seemed so far away in that moment. It was when I heard Joy’s voice over the speakers, that my gut did a flip.

“Howdy ya’ll! This is your good friend Joy speaking! In just 30 minutes, we’re going to have a special seedling ceremony! Now ain’t ya’ll just lucky?” It was clearly a recording, but it didn’t make me feel any better. “Not sure where to go? Don’t worry, my pals, the seedlings, should be able to git you back on over to Joy’s Junction lickety quick! Remember folks, attendance is mandatory- Not like you’d want to miss it anyway! Later, ya’ll!”

The crowd of people around us at the Oakey-Dokey started murmuring to themselves, some getting up right away to secure good seats to the ceremony. I looked over to my Mom and Dad, who snuck a concerned look to each other, before putting a smile on for me and my brother. “Wow, what are the chances?” My mother started, beaming at us.

Marcus hopped up. “Oh boy! A seedling ceremony?! I haven’t seen one in like, forever!” He cheered. It’s true, we hadn’t seen a seedling ceremony over the last four or five times we’ve been, though it doesn’t make the process any easier. We quickly finished our meal, as the seedlings corralled us all back to the plaza near the front of the park, where rows of seats were lined up. We were ushered into a row towards the middle, as more and more guests were packed in. The crowd bustled with an excited, nervous energy.

When no more people seemed to be seated, a rustling, creaking noise had murmured the whole crowd. All eyes looked forward, as the Juniper tree groaned, and shook. Two large, oaken eyelids split open, revealing the dark, amber eyes underneath. More crackling of bark shook the air around us, as the tree opened it’s woody, maw. “Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.” A booming, ancient voice echoed amongst the crowd. Overhead, the cutesy voice of Joy from the cartoons called out over the loudspeakers. “For years, I, Joy, the spirit of whimsy, have made Joy’s Jubilee a place for all manner o’ folk to come and take a load off. Joy’s Jubilee is a place where kids can be free to be how they want to be, without the cares of the outside world. Don’t worry, adults, that goes for the kids in all of us.” This line garnered some polite chuckles from the crowd. The loudspeaker voice continued.

“Today, we got something special for you folks- a seedling ceremony! We’ll start by saying goodbye to our oldest seedling, our dear Agatha.” The crowd applauded, as a creaky, slower seedling made their way down the rows, past the opened gate, and up to Joy. On stage, near the other seedlings, there was a clear difference in Agatha’s appearance, the wood of their skin chipped and discolored, their posture more hunched, compared to the rest of cheery seedlings on stage.

“Agatha has provided over 100 years of fantastic service to our friends visiting us every day here at Joy’s Jubilee, and with that, we give a hearty, Joy filled ‘Thank you!’” The speaker voice exclaimed, as the crowd cheered and clapped at the seedling, who bowed with what little energy they had left.

“And now, join as all as we wave goodbye to Agatha, as she returns to where all seedlings start- back to my heart.” The speakers crackle out overhead, as the real Joy opens her mouth wide, the wood splintering to reveal a dark, pitch black chasm. With one last wave goodbye to the crowd, the withered seedling took measured steps, entering inside the shadowy maw, before Joy clamped down, with no trace of the seedling remaining. There was a moment of creaking, and silence, before the speakers started back up.

“Well now, folks, if there’s one thing ol’ Joy knows, is that nature is a cycle- to every end, there is a neeeeewwww beginning!” The crowd cheered with a nervous energy, some people fidgeting in their seats. My heart caught in my throat.

“Now ya’ll, listen carefully. Can you hear me? Can you understand me?” The cartoon voice overhead giggled, as the tree in front of us, opened it’s mouth again. “Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa. Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.” It repeated, with a deep rumbling and shuddering. With every repetition, I sighed in relief. I couldn’t understand what she was saying. What I heard next to me had my heart shatter.

“I’m right here, Joy!” Marcus laughed playfully. “I’m right here!” He attempted to get out of his seat, and I tried to stop him. “Marcus, no, stop. Don’t move.” I whispered, trying not to call attention to the seedlings who were walking up and down the rows. Marcus looked up at me and frowned, folding his arms. Our parents quickly realized what was happening, and looked on in horror.

“How come? Jeremy, Joy is looking for me!” He whined loudly, wiggling further out of his seat, despite my attempts to push him to sit back down. By now, a few seedlings started walking into our row, seeing the commotion. They take one look at Marcus, and they all nodded. By now, mom’s inconsolable, as dad stood to try to reason with the incoming seedlings. “Now listen here, maybe he’s just making it up-” He tried to rationalize, but the seedlings brushed past him easily, with a strength that betrayed their smaller, childlike shapes. One of the seedlings held Marcus by his hand.

I stood up, ready to swing at the seedling who had my brother, and I threw my fist, my nerves fried, my brain going in a million directions. The seedling didn’t react to the impact, and two more rushed over to me, and hold me down in the seat. “Marcus! No! Please!” I screamed, as Marcus waddled down the aisle, hand in hand with the seedling. The seedling took Marcus to the front of the tree. The crowd cheered as the little boy, my brother, stood before the stretching Juniper, with some of the crowd whispered to each other, some hugged their own children tightly in relief. Marcus waved to the crowd, before the loud, groaning voice of the tree rumbled again. “Korunnnn Goruvta…..”

I saw Marcus say something to the tree, which I can guess were the words “My name is Marcus.” The tree stood motionless for a moment, and as much as I struggled and screamed, I couldn't break free of the seedlings who held me, as Joy’s mouth creaked open once again, widely, enough to accommodate a person. Marcus hesitated, before he stepped inside. When Joy’s mouth closed, I felt my whole body go numb, and limp in shock. I could barely register the overhead speaker talking once more.

“Everyone, please join me in a Joyful welcome as we meet Marcus, our newest seedling!” The crowd erupted in cheers, as numerous amounts of berries grew in a rapid frenzy on Joy’s branches, before falling to the floor, for the seedlings to collect for various recipes around the park. Joy’s mouth creaked open, and out stepped a seedling, identical in size, clothing, and hair as the rest of the seedlings. It’s his face that caused me to shudder, sobbing silently, and have my mother’s wails carry through the crowd. It was Marcus’ face.

Marcus waved to the crowd, before joining the other seedlings in a joyous hug. Without even glancing our way, he ran off to who knows where with a group of them. A jingle played overhead, before Joy closed her eyes, signifying the end of the celebration. One final time, the chipper speaker voice comes to life, with accompanying cheesy music. “Thank you all for joining us in our special Seedling ceremony. I hope ya’ll will join us again real soon!” I turned to face my parents, speechless, as the crowds dispersed. I noticed a good chunk of the crowd heading to the closest shirt stall crowding to buy something. One member of the crowd turned to reveal their latest purchase. A shirt, with a caricature of my brother’s face in the middle of the shirt, with the words “Marcus” in a cutesy font underneath, and the Joy’s Jubilee logo next to it.",4,1750645954.0,scarystories,7,1.0,False

But without sounding out of touch, i don’t believe it’s total nonsense.

Going out for something to eat or drink now is incredibly expensive. And obviously that’s not the consumers fault, but all still choose to go and do it. 

Every time we go out for breakfast, which is rare now, there is always a massive wait. Every other building on our Main Street is a coffee / cafe place. And they’re all full. You’re easily looking at at least $30 per person .

At work, every day half the office wanders down to the local cafe for a coffee, and sometimes before too.

Not saying the property market for FTBs isnt completely screwed, but I think the whole ‘you could buy a house if you stopped eating avocado on toast’ meme has been done to death, and there it is 100% true that constantly spending money on treats is going to delay your deposit massively.
