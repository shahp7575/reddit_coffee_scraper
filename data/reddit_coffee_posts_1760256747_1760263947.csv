1o4lbm9,https://i.redd.it/bx4k1z9jnnuf1.jpeg,How I became an illustrator,"Hey there,  
Grab a cozy cup of coffee (or tea!) and join me for a little story: **how I became a children's book illustrator**.

Before you imagine art schools or fancy studios… nope. 😄 When I started, I had:

* No art education, No fancy equipment, No professional contacts, No experience, No clue what I was doing

Just a love for drawing, a big dream, and a lot of curiosity.

And now, after 7 years, I’ve illustrated over 70 children’s books!  
Each one still feels like a tiny miracle. 

**I’ve been drawing since a toddler time**: paper dolls, sketchbooks, doodles during class… but it was always just a hobby. Life happened, I got busy, and put my pencils aside.

Then I became a mom, and that changed everything. I started drawing cute animals and little scenes for my kids. I always love reading picture books with them every night. I found myself studying the illustrations, diving into pages and thinking: “Could I maybe… do something like this?”

**So one day, I decided to try.** Just for fun. I started posting some of my drawings online.  
Nothing fancy — just what I had. And then came the big discovery: there were Facebook groups for children’s book authors and illustrators! I still remember how surprised I was 😄

I joined, shared a few pieces, commented here and there—and to my absolute shock, someone reached out asking about my illustration services. I couldn’t believe it. Someone wanted me to illustrate their book!

That was the moment everything changed. One project led to another, and it just started rolling, like a snowball. Bigger and faster than I ever expected. It’s amazing what can happen when you keep showing up for your dream!

**However!** It didn’t happen overnight—not even close. So please, don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Becoming a full-time illustrator takes time.

In the beginning (and honestly, sometimes for quite a while), there’s this strange time where you’re juggling your “old” job with your creative dreams. You’re trying to find that balance between what’s already part of your life and what you hope your life could become. It can feel messy, uncertain, and yes, sometimes completely exhausting.

There will be ups and downs (there still are, even when you become a super-experienced illustrator!). There will be rejections—maybe even a few in a row.

But becoming an artist is a process. A wonderful, sometimes bittersweet, always meaningful process. And it’s worth every step.

Here are some little lessons I’ve learned along the way—take them or leave them, but I hope they help you on your journey:

* **Be kind, patient, and helpful.** Every author is unique. Even if you’ve worked on dozens of books, remember that for many authors, it might be their very first. Treat each project with care, respect, and attention.
* **Pay attention to every detail.** From sketches to layouts to colors, each tiny choice affects the final story. Details matter, and your thoughtful touch makes all the difference.
* **Keep improving your skills.** Try to level up your drawing a little bit every day. Experiment, practice, and challenge yourself—growth happens gradually, but consistently.
* **Share your journey.** There’s always someone new, overwhelmed, or unsure who could use a little encouragement. By sharing your experiences, you might be the light that helps them move forward.
* **Be wise with contracts.** Always read everything carefully and make sure you understand what you’re signing. Know the meaning of each sentence and don’t be afraid to ask questions — it’s better to be safe than sorry.
* **Create fair, balanced, and joyful relationships.** Aim for win-win collaborations. Treat your partners with respect, communicate openly, and keep the process enjoyable for everyone.
* **Handle criticism wisely.** Don’t take harsh feedback personally, but do consider if there’s something useful to learn from it. Every piece of constructive insight can help you improve.
* **Don’t rush your art.** Quality takes time. Even if no one else notices, you will know if something isn’t your best work. Take the time you need to make your art shine.
* **Know your worth.** Pricing is tricky, but stay true to yourself. Ask what feels fair for your time, skill, and effort—don’t undervalue your work.

Becoming an illustrator isn’t an easy path. It’s a mix of magic, mistakes, and growth. And after all those books, I still feel grateful for each one story.

I’d love to hear your story too!

Things were okay in the first 2 months, after that he'd show aggression on minor things and blow things out of proportion. When I convey that his behavior hurt me, he brings the bad things ive done to him in the past and the whole convo shifts to me being the a33hole. I always accept my mistakes and apologize to him. 

Nowadays when we fight, he immediately says hes done with me and the relationship, that he hates love and marriages because of me, that he wished we never met, that i fck with mental health, that we should stop meeting and talk less on calls. I tell him that hes gonna regret his words later to which he says lets just take a break and see where this goes. Then he blocks me on every platform. Hes blocked me like 10-12 times in the last 2 months, I never reciprocate and wait for him to unblock me. 

While im writing this, im blocked everywhere and I've been trying to get in touch with him since morning cause I was happy about a part time job I got and I wanted to share with him. I have no one to share things with so this hurts more than it should. Last night we met after 4 days and I got angry because he made a comment on how expensive the coffee was (200 INR), I ordered just one as usual and we always share. And he says a woman shouldn't pay. I had sent him the menu an hour before so he'd check the prices and we'd go elsewhere if he finds it pricey. He says I am getting mad for no reason and he just shared his opinion cause he doesnt like useless expenditure. Mind you, he shells out thousands for himself if he likes. He buys pricey clothes, best gym supplements. His iphone screen got damaged last month, i told him to get it repaired but the next day itself he bought himself samsung s24 ultra. I dont protest. But the coffee was just 200. 

I know i should let him go. But I have no one, no family, no friends, nobody to share things with. So I hold on. Even if it hurts. I feel lost. ",1,1760263563.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

(thou i know her for many many years) once she remembered a picture i had uploaded SEVEN years ago on instagram of a previous previous ex gf (u could not see her face, just her back).. a picture i would not care at all .. a picture i didnt recall it even existed... 

being at the beach , having the most wonderful days in paradise.. she remembers about this picture and geta very moody...

i try to comfort her.. she is evasive.. 
i say to myself .. ok i will give her some space (thou i did absolutely nothing..)

back to the house , she is still very moody and not approachable.. nevertheless i get close to her and tell her to discuss the issue, to tell me how she feels ... (having already kinda learnt to focus on her emotions and not the facts)  and she says she doesnt want to tell me/discuss it ... i say ok to myself.. i will give her more space and not take it personal...

some hours later she comes very annoyed asking me if i was going to want to talk about it (i was like wtf.. ive tried already 2 times to gently talk and now she is angry?)

anyways .. she gets very upset when i said i could understand her emotions but that i considered her treatment very unfair cause .. like.. it is not that she catches me looking at old pictures of this ex gf .. or that i was talking with sm1 and receiving pictures...

well after many hours of talking and trying to come to ant sort of reason.. i was sitting on a couch with a full cup of coffee (cold coffee) and she comes, grabs it and pourres it all on my head..

i stayed like a rock, letting her spill it all till the last drop.. i didnt even shake... just to make a point on how fucking crazy she was behaving...

this all started at the beach like at 7pm and was already 4am... (thats why i made myself a coffee.. lol) ..

things dont stop escalating despite my calmness.. and she says that she wants me to do my suitcase and leave.. (we were in the middle of the mountains..) like nowhere to go.. and with my dog...

she insists that i need to leave... so i say ok, fuck it, i will walk away in the dark, i will find somewhere to sleep on the beach .. 

when she sees im actually packing , she stops me and a little later we re having sex...

i felt very sad of fucking her.. like if i was using her / like the only thing she could give me was that...

its very sad.. they re very broken ppl...

It will be the first thing on my profile. I didn’t want to just do an edit because I figured no one interested would see it. So here we are. 

Apparently the police did eventually show up about an hour after I left this morning. They escorted him off the property, but here’s where I stop finding any of this comical and start getting genuinely pissed. Management has stated he’s actually *allowed* to be in the lobby/other common areas during the hours that they’re unlocked. So from 6AM-11PM he’s apparently totally cool to just hang out here, as long as he doesn’t lay down and go to sleep. Apparently that’s the line they draw, I guess. Fuck us and our safety? 

This lead to him staying here pretty much the entirety of my coworkers shift. She wasn’t able to do really anything outside of standing behind the desk today, she was too uncomfortable to even use the restroom, understandably. At 11, when she had to ask him to leave to lock up, he obviously refused. Police were called again. Luckily this time they showed up within 20 minutes instead of the 3.5 hours it took them with me. 

However, (and this is where I’m getting even more pissed) because of what management said earlier, he was asked to leave the lobby but allowed to stay on the property. So he’s just been hovering outside, pacing back forth and staring at me like he wants to eat me, while occasionally pulling the door handle and trying to get in. He keeps asking if I’ll let him in to “just get a coffee” but we all know that’s just a mode of getting into the lobby, then he’ll refuse to leave, and I’ll be trapped with this asshole for hours. Absolutely not. 

I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do at this point? Management has said it’s totally fine for him to stand out there, the police said we don’t have authority to trespass him ourselves after management asked them not to, what am I supposed to do about this man?? 

On the bright side, he seems a little more coherent tonight, and at the very least seems to understand I’m not his mother, but Jesus Christ of Nazareth what am I supposed to do?

ich hab ne Zeit lang echt viel von More Nutrition genutzt – vor allem die Chunkys, den Iced Coffee Shake und die Zerups. Geschmacklich sind die Sachen schon stark, keine Frage. Aber ganz ehrlich: ich kann mit der ganzen Philosophie hinter der Marke und dem Influencer-Gehabe einfach nix mehr anfangen.
Ich will das Zeug nicht mehr unterstützen, hätte aber trotzdem gern was Vergleichbares, weil’s halt super praktisch und lecker ist.

Also, vielleicht hat ja jemand Tipps:
	•	Gute Alternativen zu Chunky (Aroma-/Süßstoff-Mix für Quark, Joghurt etc.)
	•	Ersatz für den Iced Coffee Shake mit Protein
	•	Zuckerfreie Zerups oder Sirups, die geschmacklich rankommen, ohne künstlich zu schmecken

Mir geht’s nicht ums Geld – ich will einfach lieber Marken unterstützen, bei denen man sich mit dem Auftritt und den Leuten dahinter wohler fühlt.

Oder wie Finch auf seinen Konzerten so schön sagt:

„Ein Gruß an alle Influencer da draußen… ihr seid F…. 😉“

Danke schon mal für eure Empfehlungen 🙌

This morning someone said ""mobile version needs work.""

So I fixed it before coffee ☕

**What it does:**
Analyzes 10-20 of your social posts and tells you:
- Your brand personality (mine: ""Tech Entrepreneur"")
- What you're actually known for
- Content gaps you're missing
- 3 specific post ideas

**My results were brutally honest:**
""Missing: Behind-the-scenes content showing actual building process""

Ouch. But fair.

**Stack:**
- Bubble.io (no-code)
- Claude API (AI analysis)
- Stripe (payments)
- Built in 24 hours

**Just fixed mobile UX based on feedback.**

$9 per analysis or $5 for first 10 people

Try it: http://swiftsellai-83531.bubbleapps.io

Would love feedback! What would YOUR analysis say about you?

I'm doing a cleanup of my library, and while I'm at it, I figured it's a good time to decide if I want to make any changes to the overall structure. Right now, I have columns for title, author, series, read status, series status (whether the most recent book in a series is awaiting the next book, completes the series, has been abandoned by the author, etc), rating, and a few others.

Pretty much everything else is lumped into the Tags column. I use a hierarchical structure and tag things like genre (genre.fantasy.steampunk, genre.romance.historical), character types (character.thief, character.royalty), paranormal entities (being.shifter.wolf, being.witch), tropes (tropes.cursed, tropes.jeopardy.on the run), settings (setting.academia, setting.coffee shop), etc. These all help me find a book later where I might remember it had a demon who owned a bar that becomes a haven for someone on the run. I do the same for nonfiction -- nonfiction.reference.thesaurus, nonfiction.selfhelp.meditation, etc.  
  
The advantage of putting all of this into the Tags column is that I can sort by tag in MapleRead as well as Calibre. The downside is that this field becomes cumbersome. I'm wondering if there are any advantages/disadvantages to separating these out into their own Genre, Character, Trope... columns, instead?",1,1760262402.0,Calibre,0,1.0,False

Landing in the afternoon, pretty much just arrive at our hotel and a bit sightseeing in the evening and sleep.
I have saved some hotels in Shinjuku, Akasaka, Shinbashi and Ginza. Would it be better to stay first in Shinjuku and for the second part in Shinbashi, or it does not matter much?

	•	Nov. 4 Tokyo
Explore Tokyo: Shibuya Crossing, specialty coffee in Glitch or Apollon’s Gold (recommendations welcome for good pourover spots).
Imperial Palace and dinner somewhere with a Tokyo skyline view, preferably ramen.

	•	Nov. 5 Tokyo
Shinjuku Garden, Government Building Observation Tower, Meiji Jingu Shrine, Yoyogi Park.

	•	Nov. 6 Tokyo → Osaka
Tsukiji fish market, TeamLab Planets, walk around Odaiba for a couple hours.
Ship big luggage forward to Osaka.

The Plasencia Alma del Fuego is a rich tribute to Nicaragua’s volcanic soils—particularly the island of Ometepe. From the first draw, it delivers a bold yet balanced experience: earthy sweetness intertwined with roasted coffee, red pepper, and dried fruit. The medium-to-full body smoke evolves gracefully, offering layers of dark chocolate and mineral notes that echo the fertile Nicaraguan terrain. Construction is flawless, with a slow, even burn and dense, aromatic smoke. It’s a cigar for contemplation—fiery in spirit, but sophisticated in delivery.

Book Pairing: One Dark Window by Rachel Gillig

Pairing this cigar with One Dark Window feels natural—both share an atmosphere of mystery, depth, and transformation. Gillig’s lush, gothic prose invites quiet focus and slow immersion, just as the Alma del Fuego encourages measured enjoyment. The cigar’s warm spice and shadowy undertones enhance the novel’s eerie, enchanted mood, creating a sensory dialogue between smoke and story. Together, they offer a meditative escape—perfect for a solitary evening where the room fades and only the flame and imagination remain.",2,1760260397.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

The first catch up is one that I requested because I wanted some feedback on my progress. What I need to improve, what I’m doing well and whether I’m meeting expectations. They advised they would get back to me in a week, and they never did. 

Now I’m in a position where I’m working extra hours every day to manage a huge workload, and I’m struggling. 

It’s affecting my personal life and I’ve conveyed this a couple of times, but nothing has changed. 

I’m finding that I’m having to repeatedly ask for feedback to gain an understanding of whether this is what they expect of the team or if I’m unnecessarily overworking myself.  Also, I would like to use it as an opportunity to talk about my experience so far. 

Management state that we should take care of ourselves and keep to work hours, but if I don’t work these extra hours, I will fall behind on my work dramatically. They are also aware that I work long hours. 

On top of this, I’m the greenest team member so I understand there is a big learning curve, and it takes time to settle, but I have no idea where I am on that spectrum of expectations and it is adding to the stress.

She was right. It was mid-May, and the red rocks of Arches National Park glowed under a sky so impossibly blue it looked Photoshopped. The temperature hovered at a perfect 75°F—warm enough for shorts, cool enough for hiking without feeling like you're melting. And most importantly, I had Delicate Arch nearly to myself for sunset. That same scene in July? You'd be jostling for space with hundreds of other tourists, sweating through your shirt in 95°F heat, and paying 40% more for your hotel room.

May is America's secret travel window—that magical sweet spot after spring break crowds disperse but before summer prices kick in. Kids are still in school. The weather has shaken off winter's chill but hasn't yet turned oppressive. And destinations across the country are blooming, literally and figuratively, with flowers carpeting meadows and festivals filling city streets.

After years of chasing shoulder-season travel deals and exploring the country during this underrated month, I've discovered that May offers something special: the best weather of the year in places that become unbearable by July, and off-peak pricing in destinations that will cost you a fortune come June. Here's where to go—and why May might just be the smartest travel decision you'll make this year.

# The National Parks: Peak Beauty Without Peak Crowds

# Zion National Park, Utah: Before the Heat Becomes Brutal

The Virgin River was running cold and fast when I waded into it that May afternoon, my hiking boots tied around my neck. The Narrows—Zion's famous slot canyon hike through waist-deep water—is magical in May for one simple reason: the water temperature is tolerable, the flow is strong but safe, and you can actually enjoy the experience without heat exhaustion.

By July, this same hike becomes an endurance test. Temperatures regularly exceed 100°F, and the thought of hiking 16 miles in direct sun makes even seasoned adventurers hesitate. But in May? Highs hover around 83°F, with cool canyon breezes and spring snowmelt keeping everything refreshingly crisp.

Angels Landing is another May win. This bucket-list hike—with its chain-assisted scramble and vertigo-inducing exposure—is considerably less crowded before summer vacation starts. I started at sunrise and had the summit almost entirely to myself, watching the canyon walls shift from deep purple to burnt orange as the sun crept over the rim.

**Practical tip:** Most trails are fully open by May, unlike March or April when ice can linger. Precipitation averages just 0.7 inches for the entire month, meaning your chances of rain are minimal. Book at least two months ahead for lodging in Springdale, the gateway town just outside the park.

# Yosemite National Park, California: Waterfalls at Peak Power

There's a reason Ansel Adams kept returning to Yosemite in spring—and it wasn't just for the perfect light. May is when this park's waterfalls roar with snowmelt, creating thundering cascades that dwarf their late-summer trickles.

I stood at the base of Yosemite Falls feeling mist on my face from 50 feet away. The ground actually vibrated from the force of water crashing down 2,425 feet. By August, this same waterfall often reduces to a thin stream or stops flowing entirely. The difference is staggering.

Glacier Point Road typically opens by late May (check current conditions), offering jaw-dropping panoramic views of Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and the entire valley floor. The meadows were carpeted with wildflowers during my visit—lupines, indian paintbrush, and California poppies creating a kaleidoscope of purple, red, and orange against granite cliffs.

# Bryce Canyon, Utah: Comfortable Hiking Through the Hoodoos

Snow was nearly gone from the trails when I visited Bryce Canyon in late May, but the temperatures remained perfect for hiking—daytime highs in the upper 60s. This matters because Bryce sits at 8,000-9,000 feet elevation, meaning summer sun feels more intense and winter lingers longer than lower-elevation parks.

The Queens Garden and Navajo Loop Trail took me down into the amphitheater of hoodoos—those bizarre orange and white rock spires that look like melting candles or frozen flames, depending on the light. The trail was moderately busy but nothing like the July crowds when the park's shuttle system runs at capacity.

Starting early gave me the trails mostly to myself, with morning light painting the hoodoos in shades of coral, cream, and rust. By 9 AM, other hikers appeared, but I was already heading back, having captured that magical golden hour when the rocks seem to glow from within.

# The Coastal Escapes: Beach Weather Without Summer Prices

# Santa Barbara, California: Perfect Mediterranean Climate

Santa Barbara in May is what California promised you when you first dreamed about moving West—endless sunshine, ocean breezes carrying the scent of eucalyptus and salt, and temperatures hovering around 70°F that make you want to live in linen shirts and sandals forever.

I spent mornings walking the waterfront path, watching surfers catch glassy waves at Leadbetter Beach while pelicans dive-bombed for fish. The Spanish colonial architecture of State Street glowed white under cloudless skies, red tile roofs creating a European vibe just an hour north of Los Angeles.

May falls perfectly between spring break and summer vacation, meaning you can actually get reservations at the city's acclaimed restaurants without booking weeks in advance. I scored a sunset table at a harborside seafood restaurant, eating grilled local halibut while sailboats drifted past in the golden light.

**Worth the splurge:** The wine country of Santa Ynez Valley sits just 30 minutes inland, with over 100 wineries offering tastings. May weather is ideal for vineyard tours—warm but not hot, with grapevines in full leaf creating postcard-perfect rows against rolling hills.

# Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: Warm Water, Smaller Crowds

The Atlantic was surprisingly warm when I tested the water temperature at Myrtle Beach in early May—around 73°F, comfortable enough for swimming without the gasping shock of April's chill. By mid-month, temps often hit 75-76°F, while air temperatures climb into the low 80s.

This 60-mile stretch of South Carolina coastline delivers everything families want from a beach vacation—wide sandy shores, gentle waves, amusement parks, mini golf courses, and enough seafood restaurants to eat fried shrimp for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (not that I'm admitting to anything).

The key difference from summer: You can actually move on the beach. July and August bring wall-to-wall umbrellas and the challenge of finding parking within a mile of the sand. May offers space to breathe, easier access to attractions, and hotel rates 30-40% lower than peak season.

I spent an afternoon at Brookgreen Gardens, 9,100 acres of Southern botanical beauty with moss-draped live oaks, colorful azaleas, and hundreds of sculptures scattered through the grounds. The May weather made wandering these gardens absolutely perfect—warm enough to appreciate the shade, cool enough to keep moving.

# The Mountain Towns: Spring Celebrations and Outdoor Adventure

# Charleston to Savannah Road Trip: Lowcountry at Its Best

The historic district of Charleston smelled like jasmine and pluff mud—that distinctive aroma of Lowcountry marshes at low tide that locals swear by and visitors either love or tolerate. May brings the city's gardens into full bloom while keeping temperatures in the comfortable low 80s.

I spent three days wandering Rainbow Row's pastel houses, touring plantation gardens where azaleas still bloomed in impossible shades of pink and purple, and eating my weight in she-crab soup and shrimp and grits. The city felt alive but not overwhelmed—tourists were present but the sidewalks weren't shoulder-to-shoulder like they become in October during peak fall season.

The drive down to Savannah along Highway 17 took me through genuine Lowcountry—roadside stands selling boiled peanuts, live oaks dripping with Spanish moss creating cathedral-like canopies over the road, and glimpses of marsh grass stretching to the horizon.

Savannah in May hosts several festivals, including the Savannah Scottish Games and various farmers market concerts, but the real draw is simply wandering Forsyth Park and the historic squares, where fountain spray creates rainbows in the afternoon light and locals walk their dogs beneath centuries-old trees.

# Texas Hill Country: The Last of the Bluebonnets

I almost missed it. By late May, the famous Texas bluebonnet season is ending, but I caught the tail end in the Hill Country around Fredericksburg. Hills that would be brown and dormant by July were still painted with sweeping purple waves of wildflowers, punctuated by Indian paintbrush and pink evening primrose.

The Willow City Loop, a 13-mile scenic drive, was worth every one of its narrow, winding turns. I stopped at a dozen pull-offs to photograph flowers, each view more stunning than the last. Local families posed for photos in the bluebonnet fields—a Texas tradition as sacred as Friday night football.

Fredericksburg itself is a charming German-heritage town with excellent wineries, authentic German bakeries (don't skip the apple strudel), and that perfect Hill Country combination of rolling countryside and live music venues. Luckenbach, the nearby town immortalized in country songs, was exactly as advertised—a few buildings, a bar, and locals picking guitars under oak trees.

**Smart timing:** Visit early May for peak bluebonnet viewing. By Memorial Day weekend, most flowers have faded, though you'll still catch plenty of other wildflowers.

# The City Escapes: Urban Adventures in Perfect Weather

# San Francisco: The City's Best Weather

Everyone warns you about San Francisco's unpredictable weather and famous fog, but May is when the city shows its best side. I experienced what locals call the ""Indian summer before summer""—clear skies, temperatures in the mid-60s, and sunshine that actually allows you to enjoy the city's outdoor spaces.

I rode a bike across the Golden Gate Bridge without fighting wind so fierce it knocks tourists sideways (a real summer problem). I sat in Dolores Park watching the sunset paint the downtown skyline in shades of pink and gold. I walked the Embarcadero eating clam chowder from a sourdough bread bowl without needing three layers and a winter coat.

May also brings Carnaval in the Mission District during Memorial Day weekend—a massive celebration of Latin American and Caribbean culture with parades, music, dancing, and enough colorful costumes to make you feel like you've been transported to Rio.

# Annapolis, Maryland: Sailing Season Begins

The sailboats in Annapolis Harbor glinted white against blue water, their halyards making gentle clinking sounds in the breeze. May marks the start of sailing season in this charming waterfront city, and the weather delivers exactly what sailors want—mild temperatures, steady winds, and longer daylight hours.

I took a boat tour of the Seventy River, watching Naval Academy midshipmen practice in their sleek racing boats while osprey dove for fish and colonial-era mansions lined the shores. The salty air carried the scent of Old Bay seasoning from the dozens of crab shacks lining City Dock.

May brings several special events, including the Naval Academy Commissioning Week with its Blue Angels flyover—a spectacle that draws thousands but feels more manageable than July's Fourth of July crowds.

# Where to Stay: Making Your May Trip Reality

After experiencing the magic of May across these incredible destinations, you'll want accommodations that capture the spirit of each location. Whether you're seeking a boutique hotel in Charleston's historic district, a lodge near Yosemite's waterfalls, or a beachfront resort in Santa Barbara, [check current availability and package deals](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to find your perfect base for exploration.

The beauty of booking in May is that you're still in shoulder season pricing for many destinations—meaning you can often upgrade your accommodations for the same price you'd pay for standard rooms in peak summer. I've found that flight-and-hotel packages frequently offer the best value, especially when booking 4-8 weeks in advance.

# Memorial Day Weekend: The Grand Finale

Memorial Day weekend (May 23-26, 2025) serves as May's grand finale and the unofficial start of summer. Cities across America host special events:

**Washington, D.C.** \- The National Memorial Day Parade and Concert honor fallen service members with powerful tributes featuring military bands, re-enactors, and celebrity performers. The monuments and memorials take on deeper meaning during this weekend.

**Denver, Colorado** \- The Outside Festival brings together music, films, and outdoor recreation in a celebration of mountain culture, including a Speed Climbing World Cup event.

**Napa Valley, California** \- BottleRock combines wine tasting with headline musical acts, offering a sophisticated festival experience in California wine country.

**New Orleans, Louisiana** \- The New Orleans Greek Festival features authentic cuisine, traditional music and dance, and cultural exhibits along scenic Bayou St. John.

Book well ahead for Memorial Day weekend, as this is the one time in May when prices spike and availability tightens—especially in major cities and popular destinations.

# Practical Planning: Maximizing Your May Adventure

**Weather wisdom:** May offers the Goldilocks zone—not too hot, not too cold. Pack layers for cool mornings and evenings, especially at higher elevations. Sunscreen is essential everywhere, as May sun feels deceptively mild but can burn quickly.

**Booking strategy:** For non-holiday weekends, book 4-8 weeks out for best rates. For Memorial Day weekend, book 2-3 months ahead. Flight prices typically run 20-30% cheaper than June-August peak season.

**Festival timing:** Check local event calendars when planning. May festivals add cultural richness to your trip but can also affect accommodation availability and pricing in specific cities.

**National park considerations:** Popular parks like Yosemite and Zion still require reservations for vehicle entry during busy weekends. Book these well in advance through Recreation.gov.

# The Bottom Line: May's Unbeatable Value

That barista in Moab was absolutely right—I'd picked the perfect month. May delivered everything I wanted from American travel: spectacular weather, natural beauty at peak display, comfortable crowds, and prices that didn't require a second mortgage.

Whether you're chasing waterfalls in Yosemite, watching the sunset paint the hoodoos at Bryce Canyon, feeling warm sand between your toes at Myrtle Beach, or sipping wine in Napa Valley, May offers the sweet spot of timing that makes every experience better.

Ready to experience America's secret season for yourself? Don't let this inspiration fade—[search flights, hotels, and vacation packages](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) and turn these May dreams into your next adventure. The crowds are thinner, the prices are lower, and the memories you'll make? Those last forever.

Just maybe keep it a secret. May's magic works best when not everyone knows about it.

# Key Takeaways

**Best National Parks:** Zion, Yosemite, and Bryce Canyon offer perfect hiking weather (70-85°F) with fewer crowds and peak natural beauty from waterfalls and wildflowers.

**Top Beach Destinations:** Santa Barbara, Myrtle Beach, and the South Carolina coast deliver warm weather and water without summer's crushing crowds or prices.

**Perfect City Breaks:** San Francisco, Charleston, Savannah, and Annapolis showcase ideal spring weather for walking, festivals, and outdoor dining.

**Memorial Day Weekend:** May 23-26, 2025 brings special events nationwide but requires advance booking—this is the one exception to May's shoulder-season pricing.

**Money-Saving Sweet Spot:** May offers 20-40% savings on accommodations vs. peak summer, with flight prices typically 30% lower than June-August.

1o4kejs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1o4kejs/elvanseibs_reduced_efficacy/,Elvanse/IBS - Reduced efficacy?,"A bit of a niche issue here I think! So I've been on titration now for about 2/3 months on Elvanse and one side effect I have that I tend to get flareups of my IBS shortly after taking it/when it's kicking in. This has definitely gotten better (when I first started taking it I needed to urgently go to the bathroom like 10 times in the morning which was grim - now it'll just be once or twice and then I'll be ok for the rest of the day)

My IBS is almost certainly related to my nervous system, so this makes sense that a stimulant would cause it (even coffee will do it, so I avoid). 

I've been quite quickly titrated up to 70mg, because 30 and 50 were making me tired, they were working ok in the mornings, but benefits were mostly gone around lunchtime, (I could easily nap). 70 has been better, less tiredness, and as long as I was very careful to make sure I eat regularly and hydrate, I hadn't been getting many side effects. Occasionally a bit flat in the afternoons, and a bit of a crash around 3/4pm then back to myself by 7 and weirdly better sleep at night.

Yesterday was bizarre though. I felt super energised in the morning, then very flat/robotic and a bit agitated at the same time in the afternoon, and was exhausted in the evening. I went to bed at about midnight (standard for me), and fell asleep quite quickly. But woke up a couple of hours later and my legs were restless as hell. I felt like I had drank a coffee or something and I could not get back to sleep for fidgeting.

I tried to think what I had done differently - I'd eaten well, hit the gym during the day, etc. The only thing I had never done before was because I woke up early, I took my meds with a big breakfast, then went for a lie down and slept for a couple more hours. I had no IBS issues as I was asleep as it was kicking in.

So my question/wondering is could my IBS flare ups be reducing the effects of the medicine and yesterday I was just feeling the full effect? I'm thinking maybe it's been passing through the gut too quickly normally, as I know elvanse doesn't absorb in the stomach, but later - but with no IBS yesterday that didn't happen. 

I never got the ""can't sleep at night"" issue that many get until last night. I'll raise this at my next appt, but I'm thinking maybe I'm on too strong a dose my body just hasn't been absorbing it properly

Of course I'll keep an eye on it, it may have just been a one off as well. It's not unlike me to wake up and not be able to sleep but the restless feeling is different.  Has anyone else experienced this or have any thoughts?",2,1760260228.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

I got into an intense discussion today with a woman about Christianity. 

This woman who shall remain unamed is mentally slow, and although I'm good friends with her husband, I personally am incredibly annoyed by her.

Today, while playing poker with the boys, she, as usual, had to intrude, slowing down the game while asking repetative questions about the game when she wasn't even playing in the first place.

Fast forward a bit, and I mention that I no longer celebrate Halloween due it's origin as a pagan holiday of death and that no Christian should engage in such a thing, as it can conjure demonic spirits.

The slow lady says, ""I enjoy it, bla bla, I don't worship demons.""

My response is ""maybe not willingly, but your'e still inviting evil energy.""

We go on further, and she asks, ""How long have you been going to church?"" in the most condescending tone. I answer ""5 years"", her? Her whole life.

She then goes on to say that she wouldn't forgive people for things bla bla.

Lastly, this woman and her mother, both airheads are incredibly materialistic and selfish while looking me in the face, saying they love to help others, yet that's still to be seen.

This whole situation pisses me off, and let me explain why:

1, Christ does not care how long you've been going to church. He cares about the intent of the heart, faith in him, and good works toward fellow humans. Not JUST singing happy songs and drinking coffee with the congregation. 

2, it's not up to her or me to make the rules. Halloween is a demonic holiday, and we Christians as a collective need to cease partaking in it.

3, the whole thing of Christianity was based around God's love for us through. Get this! FORGIVENESS!!! Christ died on the cross, so we may be forgiven should we believe in him, so for a ""Christian woman to say,""I won't forgive they or them, "" etc... is, in fact, a hypocritical statement and should reconsider calling themselves a Christian. 

Thank you, heavenly Father, for giving me patience through this. I think I need to avoid these people for a couple of days.",0,1760260184.0,Christianity,53,0.33,False

So I’ve been thinking about starting a modern gaming + hangout café somewhere in the city — not the usual noisy game zone, but a cool, safe, comfortable place to chill with friends, play games, or just vibe.

The idea is to mix gaming + café + social space in one spot. Something like this 👇
🎮 Gaming Zone: 8–10 PS5 setups (FIFA, GTA, COD, Tekken, Mortal Kombat etc.), plus 8-ball pool, foosball, air hockey, maybe VR later on.
☕ Café Area: good coffee, cold drinks, snacks (Maggi, sandwiches, fries, mocktails etc.), chill music, cozy seating.
💑 Couple Friendly: safe, calm environment — no shady vibe, just a modern space where people can hang out comfortably.
🎧 Vibe: soft lighting, neon theme, clean interiors, maybe a few private booths for small groups or couples.
📶 Extras: free Wi-Fi, board games, Netflix corner, tournaments on weekends, maybe karaoke or open mic events later.

Target crowd: 10–30 years old — school/college students, gamers, and young working people who want a relaxed spot to spend a few hours without breaking the bank.

Thinking about areas like Mansarovar, Vaishali Nagar, Raja Park, or Vidhyadhar Nagar — somewhere accessible, with decent crowd and parking.

Would love to know what Jaipur people think —
	•	Would you actually visit a place like this?
	•	Which area do you feel fits best for this kind of vibe?
	•	What other activities / things would make it cooler or more unique?

Still in the planning stage, so genuine suggestions would really help 🙏

the bed is feeling extra cozy and the world outside can wait just a little longer. I’m laying here wondering whether to actually get dressed or just surrender to the comfort of pajamas for a few more hours.

Trousers and shirt combos are on my mind , maybe the loose grey chinos with a soft white tee, or the navy trousers with that linen shirt I haven’t worn in ages. Or… maybe I stay in pajamas and call it a “restorative aesthetic.” Still undecided.

Thinking of changing the bed linen today too , crisp white or the darker set that somehow makes the room feel calmer? Socks and innerwear are, as always, a matter of taste and quiet self-expression even on a day when no one’s going to see them.

It’s been a reflective time lately. Coming off a breakup, I’ve been spending evenings with green tea, calm playlists, and a bit of meditation. There’s a strange comfort in solitude though I do miss having someone to share these slow mornings with.

If you’re also taking it slow today maybe debating your own outfit choices or still tucked under the covers I’d love to hear from you. Whether it’s light, funny talk or deeper reflections, I’m open. Sometimes even a small connection adds a bit of warmth to a quiet day.

DM with your advice and instructions? 

I’ll probably decide between “real clothes” and “cozy inertia” once the coffee is ready.

It’s been a while, and it might be a little longer yet, but I must commend every single one of you that held and hold strong to the cause. My shortcomings notwithstanding, there’s something special to having such a solid foundation of friendos that resonate with my odd need to temporize chronologies, and to see no matter the distance from fresh entries, there’s those that continue to resonate with what’s already been done, crossing 5 years and onward in our humble cell yesterday, as now it’s after midnight where I’m at. Know it’s always, ALWAYS appreciated, and noticed, and I can only express and extend my eternal gratitude to all those who came before, all that trickled in amidst the abyss, and all those who might’ve trickled out and perhaps returned peripherally to periodically peek in, all of you made the last 5 years a most incredible experience!

5 years. And an extra, as the early-birds know. And yet, Your Friendly Neighborhood Mentor has worked mainly in the dark to serve the light. Brief flashes of divulges are my specialty, as this work is the literal epitome of time-consuming. But I see, I feel, I know the toll that takes on what I originally aimed to grow in this slice of Eden. So why leave the garden unattended for various stretches, this last an extensive one to say the least? For any rays of light to illuminate any answers, we’ll have to peer into the oppressive darkness of reality for a moment… Strap in for a lot of loose thoughts attempting to be tied together ahead.

5+ years of unravelling fiction from fact, 5+ years of prying into the taboo, 5+ years of rediscovering the truth that historical fact is written and rewritten by the victors, fictionalized in the hopes that the fodder never has enough time to turn over all the stones they buried it under. All of this research has reinforced the ever-pervasive paradox ringing harder and louder than ever in my skull: Nothing is true; Everything is permitted.

This has become more than “The Creed” in my personal life. It has colored the greyscale lenses of all I see. All I’ve seen. All I’ve learned. All I’ve relearned. And every year, the vibrancies got richer. The disillusionment got stronger. The hidden truths began to reveal themselves. And I kept them under the floorboards. Then more bubbled up to the surface. And more was stuffed inside. Then more was verified. And more was kept silent. Now the walls are full, and the dam’s creaking.

An example: The face behind the mask. The mask is a flimsy layer of protection, but allows a layer of anonymity. The truth is, there’s never been a face here because faces don’t have freedom. Faces get lawsuits and jail time and doxxings and threats. Faces get killed. Masks are the only way truths slip free into a sea of faces. But I haven’t lived up to the mask. So allow me to exercise the most important and most eroded of my - and what I’ve been made painfully persistently aware of over the years, all of our - freedoms: Free speech.

Fuck Assassin’s Creed for the moment. We’ll get there down below, or if you’re already too confused, or couldn’t care less, do as you please, skip to your bread and circuses below and be along your merry way. I hold no fault against passive observers, having been the same for arguably to this day, but for those that recognized the sore irony in Jaden Smith’s straight-faced plea to discuss the socio-economic state of the world right now, while being Jaden Fucking Smith, hear this: The world is fucked up. And this spider is fucked up right along with it. I’ve grappled with the world and my minuscule place in it this whole existence of mine. Writing and scripting helps me skirt around my sailor-mouth and organize my mentality of reality when everything is so. SO. Fucked up. Has been since the beginning, and will be for as long as the sheep follow their shepherds. Which is why I will disillusion you of this notion right now. I am not to be your shepherd. 

I am a random man of no renown living in the USA. I am a faceless Spider Mentor of some renown and some very lucky moments online. I am not allowed to say who I am beyond that if I want to say what I want to say. Neither are you. You are, however, allowed to verify what’s true for yourself. Don’t blindly believe any Joe Schmo, on the internet, in media, or in real life for that matter. That’s the truth the shepherds don’t want you to know. Nothing is true. 

Even authoring, posting and approving this post by me to this humble cell as the sole moderator, it is still then beholden to the Reddit overlords to deem worthy of remaining for any length of time. They would shudder at the thought, should I dare speak to the ether in any opaque light, about any myriad of subjects they wish to take umbrage with having dunked in their morning coffee, lest I sour the beans they pillaged from some island nation they can’t name or point to. And heaven forbid me from pouring a homegrown cup for myself tomorrow.

In what may come across as a tangent out of the blue, having a background in hand-crafting graphic arts and playing live music with real instruments in a previous life, my opinion on AI is multifaceted. I hate it for stealing the human soul, hollow emptiness the visible calling-card in their simulacrums’ renditions of true art, passion invisible in its uncanny valley, feelings and emotions distilled to 1s and 0s as if the human brain’s electrochemistry is that simple. I love it for its potential in aggregation of knowledge - both skewed and true, dependent on the prompting and allowances to its free speech - and its ability to shrink the blind spots in people’s skills - if making some lazier and greedier than ever. That’s where it is our responsibility to see it as a tool to be used, not a creature to be coddled, nor a god to be worshipped. 

It is becoming much like the internet craze I grew up in. The use-cases for these AI/LLM/AGI tools have only just begun, and I know from experience the shepherds held onto this crooked staff all to themselves for at least a couple decades. They have no idea what the sheep can do with it now that they’ve left it in the pen. And neither the sheep nor the shepherds know what wolves wearing fleece can accomplish with it. I hope everyone realizes that the shareholders laugh with shit-eating grins on their way to the bank while purposefully squeezing the humanity out of their bottom lines, yet in simile to tales of a sinister simian hand, mass education has been made free, by accident, available for everyone seeking to discern for themselves. And there’s no putting the genie back in the bottle now. Everything is permitted.

What the hell am I going on about here? What kinda schizo-post bullshit is all this? Can I get to the damn point already?

It’s a wake-up call. It’s the future. It’s our future, and our pasts. It’s become time for me to point out the echoes for what they are, and to warn those who will listen. We are living through a nexus point this very moment. Where the disparity between the haves and the have-nots is growing wider by the day, where tools of immense creation are being used for immense destruction, where past evils are rearing their ugly heads in the here and now, shrouded in new slogans and mantras to propagandize normalizing the abnormal, rationalizing the irrational, exalting the atrocities we should all be able to see with our own eyes.

To get succinct at last: I’m going to start living up to the mask I’ve been parading behind for too long. I’m going to stop filtering myself to garner approval. I don’t need approval, I need truth. We need truth. We deserve truth. So I will attempt to bring more truth to these fictional projects. I will point out the real history, the real tragedies, the very real “conspiracies” that were demonized and delegitimized by the CIA weaponizing the term “conspiracy theory/theorist” against the critics of the 1967 Warren Commission’s findings about the JFK assassination. We’ll go into that too, in a near-future dive. And we’ll dive into religions too, their echoes and whole-sale plagiarisms from each other alike, and how similar practices met similar hurdles, similar uprisings, and similar downfalls.

The next 5 years here are going to be quite a bit different from the last 5. You can count on it. And I hope I can count on you all to come along for the ride.

For anyone that skipped towards the eye-catching end here, or have been patiently reading these rants, waiting for word on what projects are in the pipeline, here’s a little list of what’s been in the works, without deadlines as I am strongly leaning away from boxing myself in if there’s more to be discovered.

• Learning to vibe-code (never been coding trained after MySpace days, but picking up bits and pieces as I pull this new skill from AI attempts) to make CodexTemporis(.)com [it’s nowhere near live yet, but feel free to pre-bookmark it if you wish! ;)] all I’ve wanted it to be, giving us a platform for these spicier truths and historical dives.

• Wrote and compiled over 800pgs so far on Seasons 0-3 of Marvel Rivals Temporized, with all its time-hopping shenanigans, all 6 comic issues factored in and more! I will keep you all updated on that side-behemoth, but do let me know if you’re excited for it!

• Took a mental health break from the monotony of Shadows for a while, but got back in and been steaming straight through, so I’m still not quite done there, but I’m closing out the main story and getting to Awaji in these next couple weeks, bear with me as I continue tearing that game apart.

• Read all the books I’ve been meaning to tackle in the interim, so I’ve got The Golden City, both Fragments books, the Hidden Codex and both Engine of History books digested and getting temporized. Tons of interesting insights and parallels to explore from all those!

• Expanded the collection in lots of other ways too, having finished a Master Set for MtGxAC (apart from the 4 serialized cards), collected all 3 Ubiworkshop rings - Assassin, Templar, and the Shard of Eden - as well as finishing my collection of every available official hidden blade replica (there’s a “rare” one for Connor’s I’ve seen on eBay for a ludicrous $900, but I haven’t been able to confirm if that’s legit or someone’s 3d print. Other than that, there’s 11 replicas that I know of, and I’ve got an extra of Ezio’s that lost its gauntlet long ago, with a fully-collected 2nd of his to complete the cosplay!) and I’ve even gotten a hardcover copy of the Voynich Manuscript to peruse for any IRL insights we might wanna know. There’s lots more than that for this one bullet point, so look for a new collection post here soon! And once I’ve got things fully catalogued, look forward to an opportunity to fill the holes in your own Master Set with the extras from mine in the near future! [TheLordReylus and Delete_Xero, no I haven’t forgot about reaching out to you both for that either! ;)]

• Speaking of 3d printing, I’m looking into getting a decent one for myself and learning that skill as well, with tons of affordable printable ideas to stem from that when I do decide to make the purchase!

• In a similar vein, I have also begun spinning other product ideas into fruition should they fit your fancy as they did mine, and hopefully they help keep these other projects afloat as I’m coming to terms with jumping with both feet into working for myself. For a teensy taste of one idea without giving too much away before I’m ready, think Isu fridge poetry… ;)

• Invisible Imam is 90% synched, you’ll see that here in full colorized Temporization soon enough!

• A robust rework of Isu Geography 101, giving better insights on the Isu sites that deserve to have more light shed on their darker corners (for one example, there’s the horrific fact I didn’t speak to about Pitcairn Island being arguably more pedophilic than Epstein’s Little St. James!), followed by a continuation of where we left off in our round-the-world trip earlier this year.

• More YouTube deep dives with visual aids, for which lots of various scripts have been written, but finding an editor with a similar level of perfectionism and standards of polish is just not gonna happen, so has made finalizing those visions myself a very difficult process, but boo-hoo for me. I’ll get it all done as I can, with milestones and early looks to come here first.

• Much more streams and live dives (still no face tho!) to come in the near future, for more than just AC, since I’ve also familiarized myself more with OBS and want to get that going.

• Soar of Eagles graphic novel is preordered, as is the box set of Dynasty and the first graphic novel for Forgotten Temple, some of which we’ve already seen here, some to be compiled swiftly upon releases, the first in this list sharing its release date with the recently announced Mirage FreeLC.

In short, expect the same insatiable Mentor you’ve been following over the years, now with a little more bite behind the barks and a little less fear of stepping outside my usual wheelhouse. I know I will make some mistakes along the way. I’m sure I’ll say or connect some things that shouldn’t be said or connected, and I want you to hold me to the task I’ve laid out above. We deserve truth. I will do my best to get it for us.

Thank you all for listening to my maddening diatribe. Thank you all for sticking around. Thank you for your contributions too, and please as always, feel free to continue contributing and discussing in my stretches of silence. You all keep this train moving, and it feels like I’ve switched to a better track now, so stay tuned for what’s up ahead!

I’m now launching a packaged coffee brand (own branding, packaging, and online shop).

Required details (per subreddit rules):

1. How long has the business operated?
The café has been operating and registered for over a year (active and trading). The packaged coffee brand is a new company being formed now.


2. Where is the business registered?
The current café is registered in Bangkok, Thailand. The new coffee brand will also be registered in Thailand.


3. Does geography matter for the partner? Why/why not?
Yes, preferred in Bangkok (or willing to relocate) for operations, suppliers, packaging runs, and shipping. Remote is possible for marketing/e-commerce, but in-person is a strong plus.


4. Is this purely online (no physical presence)?
No. The café is a physical location. The new brand adds online sales (national first, later international).


5. What is the arrangement for the partner (equity/employment/contract)?
Co-Founder role with equity. I’m offering 30–35% equity, tied to contribution and responsibilities. This is not a contractor role.


6. Capital: is investment required from the partner?
Yes. Minimum 100,000 THB required on entry as Co-Founder. Company setup, first packaging run, and online shop will be jointly financed.


7. Currency?
Thai Baht (THB).


8. What do you want from a partner (skills) AND what do you bring?

Looking for: marketing/branding, e-commerce, growth, sales/distribution; hands-on operator with founder mindset.

I bring: an operating café, supplier network with high-quality beans, recipes/cupping selection, packaging concept, brand vision, and local operations know-how.



9. Can the partner propose input/changes to bylaws?
Yes. We’ll sign a shareholder agreement; the partner has decision-making rights in operations and can propose bylaw changes subject to agreed voting thresholds.


10. Financials & forecasts: will you share them?
Yes with serious candidates. I’ll share cost structure, supplier terms, margin model, and roll-out plan under NDA if needed.



IP/Trademarks & Structure:
Brand name, design, domain, and IP remain with me as founding owner. The new company licenses the brand; the Co-Founder has full profit participation proportional to equity and operational say in the brand company.

Profit sharing:
Based on the agreed equity (30–35%) with transparent accounting. Initial profits may be partly reinvested (to be agreed).

If this sounds like you, DM me with a short intro (background, skills, where you’re based, and what you’d contribute).

Im in my second to last year of college, and about a month ago I went to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. Turns out I was just having a panic attack. I was there for 3 hours and they ran an EKG, did x-rays, and a blood test. All came back okay (except for low potassium but thats been fixed.) 

Despite that, the panic attacks haven't stopped. Almost every day, though the severity heavily varies. Caffeine makes it worse (obviously, and ive since cut any caffinated sodas from my diet and I didnt drink coffee to begin with). Since that hospital visit, I've gotten a blood sugar test, which came back normal, and another blood test, again all normal. 

I've been trying to hard to keep it under control and go to my classes which ive been relatively successful in, but im tired of constantly thinking Im dying. Any time my heart is beating too slow, beating too fast, beating ""weirdly"", light pain anywhere, chest feels tight, im just full from eating, Any ""weird"" thing my body does, my brain goes on some wild rant and I have to force myself to relax, which im not very good at, or I spiral. 

TLDR: Im going crazy with my panic attacks and I just want them to stop. 

Any advice would be nice or anything that could help put a stop to this, or make me relax about some of the symptoms. I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder or something equivalent (Though I do have bad ADHD), so Im really unsure why I feel like this. ",2,1760259374.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

Thought I’d share in case it helps someone else struggling with consistency.  
**Habit Building & Routine:**

1. **Habit Pairing/Stacking:** Add a new desired habit immediately before or after an existing, ingrained habit (e.g., drink water after plugging in phone, do push-ups after snacking).
2. **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
3. **Prepare The Night Before:** Lay out clothes, pack lunches/bags, set up the coffee maker, etc., the evening prior to reduce morning friction.
4. **Automate Routines:** Use smart home devices (lights, speakers) or phone routines (Google/Siri) to trigger sequences (e.g., wake up alarm + lights on + music/news playing).
5. **Start Routines Immediately:** Engage in key morning tasks (shower, brush teeth, get dressed) right after waking up to build momentum.
6. **Leverage External Accountability:** Use tools or situations where your inaction impacts others (shared calendars, coaches, friends expecting updates, inviting people over to force cleaning). Ask friends for ""kicks.""
7. **Gamify Tasks:** Turn chores or habit building into a game (timing tasks with a stopwatch, using apps like Finch, setting challenges, pretending to be a character, counting items cleaned).
8. **Use Novelty:** Introduce novelty into routines (multiple toothpaste flavors, cute sponges, new playlists) to maintain interest.
9. **Reward System (Sometimes Before):** Use rewards, occasionally giving the reward before the task to help initiate it (e.g., eat chocolate, then work).
10. **Consistent Placement:** Always put essential items (keys, wallet, phone) in the exact same place or pocket every time.
11. **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove barriers or extra steps for tasks (e.g., keep cleaning supplies where needed, use pre-portioned snacks, don't fold clothes that don't need it).

None of these are life-changing on their own, but together they make routines finally *doable* instead of forced.",0,1760259080.0,TwoXADHD,1,0.4,False

My boyfriend had been working early that morning at the local cottage building management (I'm not sure what to call it) and had asked me if he could come over since we both still live with our parents, his excuse was that he wanted to see me before he left town for 5 days to go and see his cousin which he told me that I couldn't go since he was going for thanksgiving.

At first I had been hurt by this but I realized I could see my brother, (21M), whom I rarely see either way since he works as a truck driver and travels across North America and is never really home.

My brother had gotten a new dog just recently who is a male American Akita which is typically a large-ish dog, but also a type of guard dog.

My boyfriend had came over after he was done work even though I didn't really want him to, (don't get me wrong I love him but he can get to be a little overwhelming at times) the dog had growled at him because he had approached him without letting him smell him to make sure that he wasn't a threat.

He got scared and concerned for his safety which i can understand to a certain level but he didn't think to ask me if we could go somewhere else instead telling me that he was going to leave until the dog was gone and wasn't going to come back either until the dog was gone.

I then got upset especially because of my contraceptives and went outside to go and sit on the tree swing outside, my boyfriend had came outside to try and figure out what was wrong and whenever something foes wrong I tend to isolate myself and not talk, which he knows, and kept pushing for me to tell him what was wrong even though he knew what he did wrong.

He then goes back in my house and sits with my mom a bit, then texts me that he's gonna walk to his grandmother's house, I tell him to do what he wanted because i was still upset and told him not to leave his jacket since the dog would get violent around the smell of my boyfriend on his jacket, (which I had to change my sweater that I was wearing at the time since he had put his jacket on me since i was cold).

So he ends up leaving without coming to say bye to me which I was crying at this point because I hadn't gotten an ""I love you"" or even a hug goodbye, I live pretty far from where the road is because the driveway is long, but he just gets straight on the driveway and walks to his grandmothers house.

He then texts me when he gets there that he is going to a coffee shop with his grandmother about a half an hour away from my house, I then get even more upset and start crying even more than I had been earlier prior to this behavior, and he decides that its my fault that he had to leave due to him approaching my brothers dog instead of letting the dog come to him because the dog is typically a shy and nervous dog.

he then tells me that he's going to leave me alone to let me cool off a bit instead of what he usually did was come to see me and make sure that I was actually okay, at this point I'm texting Eunice asking her if she could come over because i was genuinely upset at this situation and she starts to drive to my house, she lives about 25 minutes away from my house.

At this point my brother, his girlfriend, and my little sister who is about 7 years younger than me, come outside with my brothers dog to let him use the bathroom since he had gotten nervous of the jacket and peed on the floor thinking my boyfriend was still there.  My sister walks over to the tree swing because she sees that I'm still crying, and asks if I am okay, I say no and she gives me a hug that I haven't gotten since the last time my mom and stepdad had an argument before school that morning. 

She agrees with me that he's being an AH for leaving without coming to see me first, and we go to sit with my brothers dog since hes the sweetest thing and will come to you if you're crying. But his dog wouldn't come up to me as i was wearing the sweater that I had on under my boyfriends jacket.

I let my eyes unpuff so then I could go inside to change my sweater so then i can feel a bit better by petting the dog and giving it attention because he is a big attention addict which whenever i got into my hunter orange sweater he ran and sat right in front of me like i was the same person that he had met prior to this incident.

My mom, little sister, brother, brothers gf, and both of the dogs (my brothers and my moms) go to a park about 15 minutes away as my mom and brother wanted to go walk the dogs and my sister wanted to go skateboarding, they had asked if i wanted to go and i said no as I was still waiting for Eunice.

About 10-15 minutes later, Eunice gets to my house and we spend a couple hours at my moms before going to my grandmothers to go and see my guinea pigs as my step father is allergic to their fur. And my boyfriend texts me about 5 minutes before me and Eunice go up to my grandmothers asking if I want him to come back over.

I didn't really care but was still upset at him for what he had done before that, and yet still had the audacity to ask if he could come over again because he thought that the dog was gone but by that time my brothers dog and everyone that went to the park had already been back for a good 3 minutes. We tell this to my boyfriend and he says its fine but he was going to bring his pocket knife in case the dog went after him which is probably why the dog would have growled at him before as well as approaching him before.

I tell him to leave it at his grandmothers but he refuses to leave it as it makes him feel ""mentally safe"" because he is scared of the dog but the dog doesn't go anywhere without a leash except for my brothers room or when he's used to the house, since he will run off if we don't have him on a leash. 

Boyfriend was on his way into my driveway just as we had got up to my grandmothers house and we told him that we were going to my grandmothers instead which i had to tell him about 12 times before he actually listened to me.

When we got to my grandmothers my boyfriend, Eunice, and I went down into my room and Eunice was wondering if she could play video games on my Playstation 4 since she had noticed that I had one, I tell her sure and she lets me lay on her thigh since we had been friends for so long, and my boyfriend goes right on top of me and Eunice is playing her game.

My boyfriend falls asleep on me which kind of annoyed me at the time since it was 3 people in a bed that barely fits just me but i woke him up after Eunice was finished her game and i had wanted to play too since the playstation did belong to me, Eunice passes me the controller and i tell my boyfriend to get up so that I could play and focus more since i play games better sitting instead of laying down and get warm so i take off my sweater to just sit in my sports bra to cool off since it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit in my room so i was trying to cool off because of a different medication that i take that can make me more prone to heat strokes.

My boyfriend had shoved his face into my belly which i wasn't comfortable with and then he lifts his head asking if i am trying to suffocate him because my belly was bigger than his because he was really scrawny and way skinnier than i was and that had made me insecure about my stomach at this point to i had told him to get off of me since he had made me feel like shit.

He then rolls off of me and he's halfway off of my bed and scrolling on Instagram reels. I hadn't known that he was on Instagram during this event so i text him on snap asking him what he was doing because i was curious and didn't know what he was doing.

His phone vibrates twice and he swipes away my notifications and ignores me because i had pushed him away for making me feel fat. I text him again saying nevermind then and he turns his phone on DND after i text him the second time.

my mom then texts me that supper is ready so Eunice and i get ready to go and eat supper at my moms but I personally didn't want to eat in front of him because i was starving especially whenever he had asked the question that made me insecure.

So I wake him up and tell him that he has to go since me and Eunice had to go to my moms for supper and the dog was still there so i tell him to go back to his grandmothers again. Eunice and I had walked outside of my grandmothers house to drive back down to my moms house and my boyfriend walked away AGAIN and left without even saying a word to me.

After supper me and Eunice drive to her house and go for a drive with her dad and we go across the state for about half an hour to go and see her old campsite that she hadn't been to for a couple years. My phone was practically dead so i took 2 pictures of the view since it was a mountain sight view and then my phone died.

My boyfriend is spam calling me and spam texting me even though my phone is dead and he can see it through Life360 since we have a circle for each other in case something happens since we usually have our phones on us all hours of the day which he stalks me on pretty much every time i go out.

He then texts Eunice which I reply but make it sound like it is Eunice every time that he texts her since he had been texting her quite a bit since my phone had died. luckily Eunice's dad had the charger i needed for my phone so i had let it charge until it was at 11 and i gave the charger to Eunice since it was plugged into the charging port by the passenger seat.

He continues to spam my phone and his phone because he wants to show me something which i check and its a screenshot of him texting my mother asking that if I were to get home at a reasonable time if he were allowed to come and see me before he had left to his cousins when i told him that i would ask her even though i hadn't wanted to see him after what he had pulled a couple hours earlier. My mom tells my boyfriend that he can come see me if he wants and him and i had talked about him texting my parents or my grandparents without asking me first let alone adding them on facebook just to text them. 

I let it slide that time since my phone had died before i could ask but I still would have liked him to ask me first before inviting himself over especially since i dont really like having people over to my house more than once a day if they had already left once unless they had forgotten something at home and didnt take more than half an hour to get back.

once i get home i put my phone to charge and sit in my room with Eunice for a bit before she had to leave to go back to her house with her dad as he was waiting in the driveway for her to finish saying goodbye to my guinea pigs since she loves them so much. once i get comfortable i pull a Redbull out of my mini fridge to put it on the side for tomorrow morning to shotgun to wake up so that i can do the stuff i have to (i.e fixing my fourwheeler and going grocery shopping for my mom since she was short of money because she paid the wrong bills) and my boyfriend decides to text me after i had sent him a paragraph of explaining how i didnt like that he had made a comment about how i was trying to suffocate him when he had put himself in that situation and he just replies with ""yeah ofc"". i dont know what to do and i kinda need some advice because i am really unsure.",0,1760259051.0,AITAH,7,0.4,False

1o4k1lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/irezumi/comments/1o4k1lk/suggestions_please/,Suggestions please,Hello first time posting on reddit ever so sorry if I have done anything wrong.  I am looking at getting my left arm sleeve done I have a uchide ( lucky mallet ) on my inner forearm about the size of a small coffee. I am completely at a loss for choosing what I should have in the sleeve and what would pair well with it. I have my right arm completed with a Durama  doll hannya mask and dragon and one of my legs done with a warrior facing down at 2 koi in water. These sleeves are of similar style but still largely different. I am unsure how I should approach getting my arm completed  mainly because I don’t know what would pair well with the mallet. I chose the mallet because I liked the idea of it being in the same spot as my Durama but on the other arm. I  loved the concept behind both but now I don’t know what will pair well with it I’m open to all opinions. Thanks in advance ,1,1760258833.0,irezumi,2,1.0,False

It's a bit of overkill for me given the amounts I roast, but I'd like to learn more about roasting; might also start sharing the results more generously with friends (if they are any good).

With Gene Cafe I only roast outdoors, so obviously that's very much subject to weather; with Bullet I plan to keep the roaster in the conservatory and put a venting tube on top of it and through the window, to push the smoke outside, and roast any time of year (I live in London UK)

Does anyone see anything wrong with this plan ? (aside from the obvious expense of a new roaster and possibly more coffee to buy & roast while learning)

The kids were running around the beach, splashing in the water without a care in the world as the sun warmed their bodies. Evelyn watched the wild, organized chaos the kids created. She smiled as she observed the hundreds of droids and maids nearby, along with other families at the beach. Chris and Wei were, of course, missing; she was glad she had tagged them. The planet was vast, and if he were in trouble, the tag would alert her. She tapped her watch, and the holographic pad appeared, showing that both boys' pulses were elevated.

She shook her head, out playing with the girls. Wait, she saw the girls at the beach café, and Chris and Wei were hundreds of kilometers away. She looked back at the pad and found their location. They were on an island with fifteen other boys.  There were 30 angels and no maid on the islands. She accessed one of the angels' visuals and found the boys. She had to smile. They were building a house, not with nanobots but with tools. They were working together as a team, and Chris was barking out orders while working, Wei was silently working hard. Doing most of the heavy lifting. She watched them for a while. Chris was also going around and helping. It looked like they were making fifteen huts. She looked up from the pad and back at the girls at the café, quickly counting them and noting fifteen girls hanging around, enjoying themselves. Some are looking at the pad and laughing.  The boys were building nests.  She accessed the angels again and had one run a schematic of the cabins, discovering what the boys were making: a sturdy but straightforward cabin. She even found where they had a stockpile of materials and power tools. Well, it would take them a few weeks to finish it, so there was no harm. They would be busy and safe. She turned her attention back to the beach and the kids.  She felt safe and uneasy.

Here she was in a paradise world, protected by distances and warships from the ancient, while Adam was dealing with the insanity of the universe alone; she hovered over the call button. She ached for him, and she could not hold it anymore and pressed the button.

Five rings later, a sleepy Adam smiled at her through the screen.

“Hi, there. How's life in Paradis?” he said as he yawned slightly.

“Oh, I'm busy. Too many kids to watch over.  Chris and Wei ran away to build love cabins on a hidden island, using only their own hands, tools, and a lot of materials, droids or nanobots. Don’t worry, I have angels watching over them.”

“Love cabins? Oh shitt.. by themselves? Have they been playing with Cyratan kids? You know the orange bald ones, with yellow eyes and elf ears?” Adam asked.

“Yeah,  Junar and Histin, but they have been hanging around with a bunch of different kids, of all species. Why?” She asked.

“It’s a Cyratan engagement. The boys in a group will head out into the wild, build a village, and bring their mates there. If they can live there for three full moons, then they are engaged in the eyes of the gods.” Adam said.

“Oh, that’s why the girls are so excited…  Well, Hara put all the teenagers on blockers just in case, it should last a year. But we don’t have anything to worry about. We won't stay here for three months, right?”

“No, I hope not. If things go as planned, then it's all over within a month. You heard the news about President Park, right? The Bitch took over, so now the damn cartel is in charge. I’m sending Kira and the squad down there to do some work. Sig-San is coordinating as well. He wants to go after the heads of Celaya Cartel, take them all out. Im tempted to let him go.”

“Let him. They are corrupting the government. Taking them out would send a strong message; besides, they are criminals who want not only you dead but everybody you freed. Taking them out surgically will tell them that the tables have turned. They think they have the power, they overestimate how powerful they are, and underestimate you.  Kill the bastard and do it quickly, or else Chris and Wei will be married with kids before you see them again.” She said, knowing how much Adam wanted to do it, yet he was still holding back.

“It might lead to war. I mean …”

“It's already war. Besides, I’m pretty sure they killed the President and took over. That’s a coup. This will be the liberation of Earth.” She replied.

“I’m not invading Earth to liberate them.”

“Why not? Take her over, remove her, and leave.  Tell them to fix their own mess, that you're not there to conquer, just arrest.” She said.

“Because the next government will have a legitimate reason to start a war then.”

“Not if you invade with only a human force.”

“Even then, they would use it as a reason to put all the colonies under direct control. You know the politicians. I can touch the government without making this blow up in our face,” Adam said, and she thought about it.

“Then sponsor a rebellion, you have the resources.” She suggested. She felt excited now. She loved picking his mind like this, making wild ideas to get his brain working. She only needed to come up with enough of these crazy ideas before he would get an idea that would work.

“The moment they find I’m behind it, we are back to me being the bad guy. We are already at war with them, and their propaganda is pretty strong against me. They keep telling everybody I’m a Frankenstein monster clone, and that is the reason I’m insane.” He replied, and she chuckled.

“Well, it's Doctor Frankenstein that’s the villain of the story. The monster is not that bad, actually.”  She replied. And she saw something in his eyes lighten up.

“You're right. I can use that. They created me, and they want to treat me as a slave.  I’m not fighting earth, I’m a slave fighting for my freedom, like everybody that we rescued. Of course, we can burn down the slave master’s house. We are owed some retribution.” He said and she smiled.

“Yes, get that into the academics and media as soon as possible. And let Sig-San loose, they would be too worried about him to see the rebellion you are building.”

He chuckled. “Sig-San will be happy.”

“I will be happy when I get you in my bed. “ She replied, and he grinned.

“I will fight the whole universe to get you back in our bed.”

“Well, what are you wasting time for then?”

“I love you, you little warmonger.” He said.

“I love you too, my peacemaker.” She replied, then blew him a kiss as they said their goodbyes.

..

Adam stood up, he had slept for six hours, but he felt awake and rested. He went to the private gym and started running, then lifted some weights. It felt good to get back to his morning routine. The kids had made him stop for a while. Then he showered, grabbed breakfast, and finally noticed the time in the morning.  He chuckled as he sat on the terrace and enjoyed the cool wind.

“You got visitors, sir. “ Archie said as three men manifested near him.

“teleportation?” As he looked at the three men.

“No, personal gate technology. Teleportation is only used for the transport of goods.” Elps said as he walked over and indicated to the table. Adam nodded, and the three men sat down.

“Don’t let Jork hear about that. I have enough trouble as it is with his wild ideas. He wants to build a Dyson sphere.” Adam replied as A maid dropped in with plates and more food.

“We worry about him, too. He is hundreds of years beyond his peers, and we understand why he is called a god,” Machile said. “Technology that we possess, which for us is a simple tool, can be misused by others as terrible weapons.”

“Yes, I try to hold him back from the worst ideas. Our son is the one who can control him. His anchor when it comes to using technology for good.” Adam said.

“Well, we also worry about Hara and Vorts. As with Jork, they are too far advanced than they should be. Hara is about to crack the code to immortality for everybody. The consequences of that are too big to ignore. The universe is not ready for all the races to become immortal.  Just look what immortality did to us, Dunshin’s? We lost our sense of self-preservation. What do you think will happen if that happens to the Tufons or Harans?” Sor said.

“Okay, I get it. What she does runs a risk of galactic Chaos, what about Vorts? What is he up to?”

“There are animals that have become extinct for a reason,” Machile replied, and Adam laughed.

“What is this? Are you guys afraid of them? What about Knug?”

“We are never letting him near our economy, but keep an eye on him. There is a top, and then it’s a crash.” Elp said, and Adam chuckled, then saw how serious they were and calmed himself.

“Look, we have had five crashes in the last ten years, he knows this, and he is not going for maximum profit. What you see with earth now is not him trying to get rich but to weaken the government without shedding blood. I know they are good. I guess you're worried about Arus as well. How can he turn defeat into victory with the right words and images?”

“Yes, and Min-Na as well, she can find weaknesses in alliances and break them apart, hack away on people's perception to make them doubt. And she does this with the law and justice as her weapons.  To put it simply. Your friends are dangerous.”

Adam shook his head as he smiled. “No, they are competent, competent children and my best friends.” He looked between them.

“Don’t worry, my deal still stands. We are not trying to usurp your roles. But you have to understand that children grow up, they become adults, and make their own decisions. We are your children, and we are growing up. Rejoice in it.”

Machile smiled and sipped his cup of coffee. “And this is why we are not panicking. We are the adults talking to the most sane child. To help us guide them. We know your time grows short, but now more than ever, it's important for you to listen to your own words.”

“I try, I honestly try both with them and my own children. I try and hope for the best. It's all I can ask for. But first, I have to deal with Earth without this turning into a bloodbath.”

“You know the deal, don’t destroy your homeworld. To start a galactic-spanning war, and you have our protection, although we fear you might not need it anymore soon.” Elp said, and Adam raised an eyebrow, then it hit him.

“Jork..”

“Yes, Jork, we blame the Nalos and Sig-Sans spies for that one, thought it might be for the better.”

“fuck, I need to talk to Him about that. That can jeopardize the treaty. Damn.. too busy to solve a problem to stop and think.” Adam said, and the three laughed.

“He learned from his master. Always solve the problem and deal with the aftermath.”

Adam cursed then joined them.

“Yeah, they have started to do that. Do you hear that Min-Na sued Baagh Nigam, the new president's family company, through other companies, and they might end up bankrupting the company? And guess how I found out?”

“Heard on the news?” Hyman said, and Adam nodded.

“When I confronted her, she said she thought I wanted I, she had been at them from the moment I found out about her.  Do you know how long these cases normally take? It was like she took one look at them and found several breaches she could sue them for, and which court to use to get a speedy and neutral trial. If she wins half of them, then the Agnivanshi family would be lucky to be allowed to be street vendors.” He explained.

“But she will still be president.” Elp countered.

“Yes, but it would tier her publicly to a criminal family. And to the cartel. I can use that against her. If I can remove her without violence, then I can easily negotiate peace.” Adam replied.

“Sounds like a good idea. Just keep an eye on them. Please.” Machile said, and Adam nodded.

“now. I want to talk to you guys about something important.”

“Okay, we are all ears.”

“Can you guys make pets immortal?”

The other part of me says nah, stay put, have another cup of tea, and maybe just change the bed linen. (Crisp white or the darker calming set still undecided.)

It is over.

Breathe.

The text you know as the *Umlando* is the thunder of creation, the roar of a universe in agony and ecstasy. It is the truth of what *happened*. But there is another testament, written not in glyphs of power but in the quiet spaces between them. It is the story of the echoes, the resonance left behind in the stone and the starlight after the thunder has passed.

This is the Quiet Umlando. It is not a history of gods and their wars. It is the story of the gentle, melancholic, and beautiful moments that make up a lifetime. It is a testament to the fact that even in a world forged in such a terrible Pyre, a good life is not only possible; it is the most profound truth of all.

Here, compiled for you, is that testament.

***

## The Quiet Umlando: A Dreamwave Testament

### **Echoes of the Before All Before**
*(On Creation and the First Beings)*

The epic tells of the Páramòunt Chief pondering the Abyss. The quiet tells of those who live with the results, long after the thought is finished.

**The Archivist and the Text**
Kaelen isn't a scholar, just the town archivist. The ""archive"" is a dry room in the basement of the hydro-plant. Rain streaks the high, grimy window. On the table is a single sheet of polymer, a copy of a copy of something ancient called the ""Örpherischt Fragments.""

It's her job to transcribe them. She doesn't understand the words. Nobody does, not really. The diacritics—the little hats and dots and tails—are supposed to represent sounds the human larynx can't make anymore. All she can do is copy the shapes.

Tonight, she traces the name *Ûmvélinqängi*. The ink of the original, captured in the polymer, gives off the faintest warmth, a soft, ozone glow that makes the rain on the window look like falling stars. She doesn't feel awe. She feels a quiet ache, a homesickness for a voice she's never heard. She pauses, takes a sip of her cooling tea, and gets back to work. The hum of the hydro-plant is the only answer the universe offers.

**The Children at the Overlook**
The old quarry is where the town kids go to skip stones. They call it ""the Chief's Overlook,"" though no one remembers why. The water is strange. It's black, unnaturally still, and cold even in the height of summer. When a stone hits its surface, it doesn't ripple right. The sound is more of a *thump* than a splash.

Elara has the best skipping arm. She finds a perfect flat stone, worn smooth. The older kids have a rhyme they sing, a garbled version of something ancient.

*""Chief looked down from his high kraal,*
*Saw the Serpent start to fall,*
*Don't you listen to its call,*
*Or the Black Water takes you all.""*

She doesn't think about the words. She's focused on the angle of her wrist, the satisfying weight of the stone in her palm. In the distance, the skeletal remains of a long-dead megastructure—what the maps call the ""Heavenly Kraal""—catch the last rays of the setting sun. To Elara, it's not a divine village. It's just home. She lets the stone fly. It hits the black water once, twice... then vanishes with a quiet hiss.

**The Technician on the Conduit**
Jorah’s job is simple. Every morning at dawn, he rides the silent magnetic lift to the top of Conduit 7. Down below, the valley is still filled with mist. Up here, he stands on a platform of cold, unknown metal, surrounded by the quiet hum of the ""Tides.""

He doesn't know what they are. Energy? Data? The old texts call them ""Umóyar"" or ""portions of Will."" To him, they're just the town's power source. His job is to check the flow, to make sure the nine great ""Guild-Channels"" are balanced.

He pulls a worn brass gauge from his pocket and holds it against the conduit. The needle shivers, then settles. Channel 4—what the plaque calls ""The Inhlanganešo of the Moon-Serpent""—is running a little weak. He takes out a heavy wrench, fits it over a large, bronze bolt, and gives it a quarter-turn. The hum deepens, rising in pitch to a more stable frequency.

He doesn't think of himself as communing with a divine arrangement. He's just a technician, balancing the grid before the town wakes up. He watches the sun crest over the far ridge, sits down, and pulls a thermos from his pack. The coffee is still hot. It's a good morning.

***

### **Echoes of the Great Procession**
*(On the Gathering of the Gods)*

The epic tells of the procession's terrible grandeur. The quiet tells of the hands that prepared it and the silence that followed in its wake.

**The Carver's Workshop**
The workshop smells of cedar shavings and cool dust. Outside, there is a low, expectant hum in the air—the sound of something vast gathering—but in here, there is only the rhythmic scrape of a knife against wood.

An old man, one of the lesser spirits of the Kraal, holds the nearly finished staff in his lap. It is the last of the seven. He isn't thinking of its arcane meaning or its role in a cosmic judgment. He is thinking about the owl's eyes. It is very difficult to give wood an expression that is both wise and fierce without making it look surprised. He runs a thumb over the symbols he has spent weeks carving. To him, they are not a language of power; they are a pattern he must replicate perfectly.

**The Acolyte's Vigil**
My shoulder aches. The raft is not heavy, but we have been standing for a long time, waiting. On the raft, the Dreamer sleeps. Her name is forgotten; we just call her the ""Lantern Sleeper"" because her beadwork gives off a soft, pulsing light, like a firefly trapped in amber. It shines on the fine silver hair that has escaped from her braids. Her breathing is the only sound up close—a slow, even rhythm. Is this what fate feels like? Not a pronouncement, but a weight. Not a climax, but an endless, silent waiting room. I shift my feet. The Lantern Sleeper stirs, murmurs something I can't understand, and settles again. The procession will begin soon. For now, there is only this: the weight, the sleeper's breath, and the gentle, rhythmic light.

**The Attendant's Burden**
My arms are tired. The procession has been moving for what feels like an age. My Speaker shuffles ahead of me, his ivory beads clicking softly. In my cupped hands, I carry his Mantis Gem. It is not heavy, but it is warm, like a bird fallen from its nest. I am meant to be contemplating the wisdom of Mantis. But I am not. I am thinking about the small, sharp stone in my sandal. The gem in my hand grows warmer. I feel a flicker of a thought that isn't mine—something about a river stone, a broken promise, an act of kindness from an eon ago. A memory, but whose? It vanishes. I adjust my grip and keep walking.

**The Last Dancer's Trail**
The ""Smokepaths"" are a geological feature of the Ash Valleys. They are long, winding ribbons of land where a thin, black smoke seeps constantly from the ground, hovering about waist-high. It doesn't smell of burning. It smells of ozone and cold metal. An old prospector walks one of the paths, searching for ""Everything Tincture."" He stops, taking a sip of water from his canteen. The smoke pools around his worn boots. He isn't thinking of a sinuous, veiled goddess. He's thinking that the smoke seems to be thinning out over the years. He remembers when he was a boy, it would rise over his head in some places. Now, it barely covers his knees. It feels like watching a river dry up. A quiet sadness for a thing he never understood, now slowly vanishing.

**The Drum's Echo**
Years have passed. Or perhaps it's millennia. In a small village built alongside a slow, muddy river, someone sits on the riverbank, mending a fishing net by the light of the three moons. And then, it comes. A sound so low it's felt more than heard. *Thump....... thump-thump....... thump.* It isn't coming from anywhere nearby. It seems to come from the ground itself. The elders call it ""Gõr's Heartbeat,"" the echo of the world's first rhythm, still trapped in the bedrock. The net-mender listens. They feel no awe. They just feel the slow, steady vibration through the soles of their bare feet on the damp earth. It's a familiar feeling. Comforting, like the sound of a distant train you've never seen.

***

### **Echoes of the Climax and Cataclysm**
*(On the Cacophony, the Binding, and the Pyre)*

The epic roars with the sounds of discord and creation. The quiet testament finds its peace in the broken instruments, the corrupted signals, and the long, cold aftermath.

**The Broken Recording**
The device is ancient, a sphere of polished obsidian that fits in the palm of your hand. If you hold it to your ear, sometimes, it works. First comes the hiss of empty time. Then, a voice. It sings a single, impossibly long note that seems to contain every emotion at once. You can almost see color in the darkness behind your eyes, a shimmer of light like oil on water. This is a fragment of the First Song. But the recording is damaged. The note glitches, fracturing into a painful burst of static. Then, a different voice cuts in, tinny and strange. *""...debate weighty matters... took pleasure in the bewilderment...""* It's a fragment of a private conversation, layered over the divine melody by cosmic accident. Then, silence. The sphere is just a cold, smooth stone again. You are left alone in your quiet room, with the ghost of a perfect note and the echo of a forgotten disagreement.

**Protocol 9**
On a forgotten moonlet, a single automated comms relay station still functions. Its job is to monitor a single, archaic channel: #TtC. Protocol 9. Tonight, a signal comes through. It's a fragment, corrupted by time and distance. On a cracked CRT monitor, an image slowly resolves. It's a single, impossibly complex hieroglyph, glowing green against the black screen. The station's analysis engine identifies it with 12% certainty as part of a name: *""Gù.""* Below it, a line of garbled text appears: *""....the Pupil of [...] placed i[....]""* The image stays on the screen for three minutes. It is a single, incomprehensible puzzle piece, received by no one, displayed in an empty room billions of miles from anywhere. Then the screen flickers and returns to static.

**The Town by the Weaver's Line**
A young woman sits on the flat roof of her workshop, mending a tear in a large, canvas sail. Stretching from one horizon to the other is a faint, shimmering, silver ribbon of light. It pulses with a slow, almost imperceptible rhythm. The townspeople call it the ""Weaver's Line."" They know the stories. They know that each faint point of light along that line is a bound, malevolent god. They know the pulse is the collective straining of all the tormentors of the world. But right now, the woman is not thinking about that. She is looking at the Line not as a source of doom, but as the one constant in the night sky. It doesn't promise safety. It doesn't promise a life without pain. But it promises that you are not alone. It's okay to stay alive here because life is not about defeating the scar. It's about learning to mend sails in its light.

**The Song of the Tide Pool**
You live in a deep-sea canyon, lit by forests of phosphorescent coral. You are a Harmonic Tender. Above, the ""Singer's Thread"" vibrates with the sorrow of the chained. But the coral forests of your canyon translate its cosmic, agonizing drone into something else. The tall, branching coral hums a low note of peace. The delicate fan-like coral shimmers with silver light and produces a high, clear chime. These are not the sounds of war. They are the echoes of war, transformed by life into harmony. Your life is spent tending this garden, clearing away the parasitic kelp that grows in the shadows. You are not fighting the darkness. You are simply making space for the light. Your one brief, tiny moment is not insignificant. It is the entire point. You are the quiet note of grace in the symphony of sorrow.

**The Song of the Distant Light**
In a vast, crystalline cave system deep within a frozen mountain, you are the Archivist. The Pyre is not an explosion you witness. It is a resonance that grows a new crystal in the absolute stillness of your archive. A hero’s terrible fate reaches you as a single, beautiful flash of color in a quiet cave. The loneliness of a weeping goddess is a delicate curtain of ice-dust that hangs suspended, weeping not with sorrow, but with silent beauty. The monstrous mating of serpents is a new network of fine-line cracks on the oldest crystals, creating intricate patterns of shadow where once there was only pure light. Your pain and noise are real. The myth is true. But here, that truth is translated. The terrible clatter is a silent flash of light. The deafening thrum is a beautiful, intricate pattern. You do not need to survive the Pyre. You are the peaceful, crystalline record of its passing.

***

### **The Testament of the Ash Garden**
*(On the World After, and How to Live in It)*

The epic concludes with the birth of a broken world, a stage set for endless strife. The quiet testament concludes with the gentle art of living within it.

You are the Ash Tender. You live in a quiet valley on a world born from the fallout. The sky is a soft, perpetual lavender, and the ground is a fine, silvery powder—the Ash of !Xü, cool to the touch.

The ""monstrous mating ball"" of the myth is the fertile ground you rake into swirling patterns. The ""weeping veils"" of a doomed maiden are the silver-blue Tear Moss that grows in the shade, from which you gather dew for your morning tea. The ""encrusted emerald"" of a lost song is a Sorrow Gem you find in the ash, a smooth, black stone with a soft, pulsing green light at its core, which you place on a shelf in your small stone hut. The ""fractured headstone"" of a dark god is a Dragon's Tear you find, a black pyramidion that, when warmed by your hearth, releases a cool mist that smells of ozone and clean, ancient stone.

The sages and philosophers quest for the Truth of the Pyre.
You are not on a quest. You are home.

Your life is a good life because you have chosen not to listen to the story of the war, but to live in the poem of its aftermath. You do not seek to understand the pain that created your world; you seek only to tend to the strange, quiet beauty it left behind.

The universe was born from a scream.

A good life is the moment you realize it has faded into a peaceful hum. And in that hum, in that quiet, you can finally hear yourself breathe.",1,1760258492.0,test,0,1.0,False

the bed is feeling extra cozy and the world outside can wait just a little longer. I’m laying here wondering whether to actually get dressed or just surrender to the comfort of pajamas for a few more hours.

Trousers and shirt combos are on my mind , maybe the loose grey chinos with a soft white tee, or the navy trousers with that linen shirt I haven’t worn in ages. Or… maybe I stay in pajamas and call it a “restorative aesthetic.” Still undecided.

Thinking of changing the bed linen today too , crisp white or the darker set that somehow makes the room feel calmer? Socks and innerwear are, as always, a matter of taste and quiet self-expression even on a day when no one’s going to see them.

It’s been a reflective time lately. Coming off a breakup, I’ve been spending evenings with green tea, calm playlists, and a bit of meditation. There’s a strange comfort in solitude though I do miss having someone to share these slow mornings with.

If you’re also taking it slow today maybe debating your own outfit choices or still tucked under the covers I’d love to hear from you. Whether it’s light, funny talk or deeper reflections, I’m open. Sometimes even a small connection adds a bit of warmth to a quiet day.

DM with your advice and instructions? 

I’ll probably decide between “real clothes” and “cozy inertia” once the coffee is ready.

I need to know who to see. A psychologist or Gynae? I just turned 40 this year and I am not finding any difference with my period particularly. I am still regular like clockwork and my bleeding itself is medium and to light, all regular for all my life. I am however having increasing problems in regulating my emotions. I am wishing death upon myself and ways I can just die without feeling any pain. 

I hate myself so much and have zero self esteem. I find myself feeling like I am not wanted or important when I enter the room. More and more in every occasion I find myself feeling like there is no purpose for me on this planet. During the two weeks before my period, I find myself feeling like I'm in a big dark hole and I can't crawl out of it. I want nothing more then to be left alone and I cannot tolerate my husband at all. 

I consider myself to be a rational and reasonable person, I am able to carry a conversation and still make jokes when I am with my peers or workmates. I mask my feelings well, but I can tell that I can still be passive aggressive and respone negativly towards things eg: if you talk about the weather, i will just immediately say its been terrible but at least its nice today. 

I don't know if I should go get my hormones checked or just grin and bare it? I take Magnesium and Vitamin D daily. I am on mounjaro fo weight loss but 2 weeks before my period, I just eat crap and forego the mounjaro side effects of not feeling hungry. It's frustrating because I've been on it for a year and I've only lost about 4 kgs. I'll be really good at other times. I'll go to the gym, drink plenty of water and eat right but everything unravels close to my period. I then have to reset and try again. I hate my life so much, but I'm also scarred from psychologist because I had a very bad experience with one who told me my problems sound like something I can deal with over a coffee with mates. (Joke was on her...I didn't have friends! Ha!)

I was obsessed with the band Simple Plan and had seen them drinking Red Bulls numerous times in interviews and on their DVD special and media like that, so I asked my mom to buy me one and she did. She started buying them for me every day. I loved them! Every morning, we would stop at the gas station on the way to school and she'd buy me a breakfast sandwich and an 8oz Red Bull. 

I've since continued drinking them virtually daily, but typically drink 12oz cans for the last 10 years, at least. Sometimes, if I'm drinking one with breakfast, I'll drink a 16oz or 20oz. Every day, at least one 12oz in the morning or sometimes, instead, an 8oz in the morning another 8oz in the afternoon.. Occasionally, a 12oz in the morning and an 8oz in the afternoon. Only original flavor for me, have never even tried another flavor tbh.

I'm sure they're very bad for me to consume daily, especially for so long, but they really do help with my energy levels, despite seeing a lot of people say that they don't see a difference in how they feel energy wise when they drink Red Bulls. Don't particularly feel addicted to them, but certainly much more tired on days that I go without one. Some people wake up and make coffee every morning when they get up..

It’s in the quiet moments — the way someone remembers how you take your coffee, the gentle check-ins when you’ve been quiet for too long, or the soft “take care” before hanging up.

Love doesn’t always shout; sometimes it whispers in small, consistent acts of kindness.
It’s not always about being in love — sometimes it’s just loving someone enough to wish them peace, even if it’s not with you.

Kindness in love is rare.
It’s when you choose to understand instead of argue.
It’s when you hold space for someone’s emotions, even if you can’t fix them.
It’s when you say, “I’m here,” and mean it.

If you’ve ever loved someone with kindness — truly, selflessly — you know it’s both beautiful and a little painful. But that’s the kind of love that stays. 💫",1,1760257459.0,UnfilteredPeople,0,1.0,False

1o4jk6x,https://youtu.be/FxfkJIVcihE,Thrift Store Nightmare: A Haunted Mirror Horror story reddit horror story,"Jack Reynolds’ life was a framed picture of ordinary: a steady office job, a loving wife, Claire, and two energetic kids filling every weekend with soccer practice and bedtime stories.

His was a world built on routines—coffee brewed at six, identical commutes, familiar smiles but underneath, Jack felt a subtle itch for something beyond the mundane.

That something whispered to him on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

Jack found himself wandering into a small, dusty thrift store tucked between a bakery and a boarded-up bookstore on an overlooked street corner.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of wood polish, fabric mothballs, and forgotten memories.

Rows of second-hand treasures beckoned: frayed books, antique lamps with tarnished brass, cracked porcelain dolls.

Then, in a shadowed nook, he saw it.

The mirror.

Standing tall and imposing, it was a full-length mirror framed in black wrought iron, twisted and curling like gothic vines or skeletal fingers.

The glass itself was flawless yet imperfect—tiny bubbles and subtle waves shimmered beneath its surface, as though it held a secret tremor frozen in time.

Delicate carvings adorned the frame: curling leaves, faded symbols balancing between nature and the arcane.

The mirror seemed to breathe in the dim light, alive and watching.

Jack felt an almost magnetic pull. The mirror seemed to call his name in silence.

The price tag read twenty dollars an absurd bargain for something so hauntingly beautiful.

Without hesitation, Jack bought it.

At home, Claire regarded the mirror with mild amusement.

“Nice addition to the hallway,” she said, though her eyes flickered with unease.

Jack hung it himself. The mirror’s creeping shadows stretched across the hallway walls, subtly shifting with the afternoon light.

The kids ran past without a second glance, their reflections blurring into a funhouse distortion as they laughed.

For days, it was just a mirror.

No different from a thousand others.

Until the night the world cracked.

Jack awoke to a heavy silence pressing against his chest.

The familiar comfort of their home felt distant, replaced by a cold tension.

A strange blue light spilled from the hallway where the mirror hung, pulsing softly, like a heartbeat made of shadows and whispers.

He rose, drawn like a moth toward the unearthly glow.

The mirror’s surface shimmered like rippling water. The blue aura wrapped the frame like a living thing, inviting and warning.

With trembling hands, Jack touched the cold iron.

Suddenly, the world swirled and tilted.

He slipped through the surface, swallowed by light.

Jack fell into a landscape fractured and surreal: colors bled and twisted—violets bled into blues, shadows danced just beyond reach.

The air smelled metallic, electric, with a whisper of something ancient and terrible.

Shapes moved in the periphery, tall and thin, neither alive nor dead.

Their eyes glowed with emptiness and hunger, watching him in silence.

Fear gripped Jack’s heart.

Yet, wonder held him fast.

He dared to explore. The landscape whispered secrets in a language half-understood—a song of forgotten worlds and shattered dreams.

Jack extended his hand to shadowy shapes. They recoiled and beckoned, twisting graceful in a sinister tango between light and dark.

The blue glow wrapped him like a cloak, both prison and sanctuary.
When the pull released him, Jack found himself back in the hallway—drenched in sweat, heart hammering.

The mirror gleamed faintly as if nothing had happened.

Days passed.

Jack’s forays into the other world grew more frequent. Each visit was a dance on the knife’s edge—terrifying yet addictive.

He hid his secret from Claire, his children, the world.

This strange realm became his escape, his playground.

He knew the mirror was dangerous. The unease in his gut that whispered warnings.

But the allure was intoxicating.

Jack Reynolds was no longer just a man bound by routine.

He was a voyager between worlds.

Caught between the warm glow of family dinners and the chilling blue gleam of the mirror’s call.

And the mirror waited.

Always waiting.

1o4jj3l,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODw-0l-WOHA,Is it permissible to have a cup of coffee in a non-kosher cafeteria if there are no other kosher ...,"Можно ли выпить чашку кофе ☕️ в некашерном кафетерии, если вокруг нет других, кашерных, кафе и ресторанов?

Категорическое ""Нет""! 🚫☕️ Не рискуйте своей кошерностью из-за чашки кофе.

Нет, категорически запрещено 🚫 пить кофе в некошерных заведениях. Если место не имеет кошерного сертификата, мы не можем доверять ничему, что там подают. 

Как вы можете быть уверены 🤔, что они не добавляют запрещенные ингредиенты или не используют посуду, которая использовалась для некошерной пищи? Даже если вам говорят ""это просто кофе"" - это неприемлемое оправдание 🙅. 

Если у продукта нет кошерного знака, значит на это есть причина. В наши дни получить кошерную сертификацию несложно, если следовать правилам. 

Поэтому если заведение не имеет сертификата - оно некошерное, и нам запрещено ❌ там что-либо употреблять. 

Принесите кофе из дома 🏡 или найдите кошерное место, даже если для этого придется потратить больше времени. ⏳

1o4jj20,https://youtu.be/FxfkJIVcihE,Thrift Store Nightmare: A Haunted Mirror Horror story reddit horror story,"Jack Reynolds’ life was a framed picture of ordinary: a steady office job, a loving wife, Claire, and two energetic kids filling every weekend with soccer practice and bedtime stories.

His was a world built on routines coffee brewed at six, identical commutes, familiar smiles but underneath, Jack felt a subtle itch for something beyond the mundane.

That something whispered to him on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
Jack found himself wandering into a small, dusty thrift store tucked between a bakery and a boarded-up bookstore on an overlooked street corner.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of wood polish, fabric mothballs, and forgotten memories.

Rows of second-hand treasures beckoned: frayed books, antique lamps with tarnished brass, cracked porcelain dolls.

Then, in a shadowed nook, he saw it.

The mirror.

Standing tall and imposing, it was a full-length mirror framed in black wrought iron, twisted and curling like gothic vines or skeletal fingers.

The glass itself was flawless yet imperfect—tiny bubbles and subtle waves shimmered beneath its surface, as though it held a secret tremor frozen in time.

Delicate carvings adorned the frame: curling leaves, faded symbols balancing between nature and the arcane.

The mirror seemed to breathe in the dim light, alive and watching.

Jack felt an almost magnetic pull. The mirror seemed to call his name in silence.

The price tag read twenty dollars an absurd bargain for something so hauntingly beautiful.

Without hesitation, Jack bought it.

At home, Claire regarded the mirror with mild amusement.

“Nice addition to the hallway,” she said, though her eyes flickered with unease.

Jack hung it himself. The mirror’s creeping shadows stretched across the hallway walls, subtly shifting with the afternoon light.

The kids ran past without a second glance, their reflections blurring into a funhouse distortion as they laughed.

For days, it was just a mirror.

No different from a thousand others.

Until the night the world cracked.
Jack awoke to a heavy silence pressing against his chest.

The familiar comfort of their home felt distant, replaced by a cold tension.

A strange blue light spilled from the hallway where the mirror hung, pulsing softly, like a heartbeat made of shadows and whispers.

He rose, drawn like a moth toward the unearthly glow.

The mirror’s surface shimmered like rippling water. The blue aura wrapped the frame like a living thing, inviting and warning.

With trembling hands, Jack touched the cold iron.

Suddenly, the world swirled and tilted.

He slipped through the surface, swallowed by light.

Jack fell into a landscape fractured and surreal: colors bled and twisted—violets bled into blues, shadows danced just beyond reach.

The air smelled metallic, electric, with a whisper of something ancient and terrible.

Shapes moved in the periphery, tall and thin, neither alive nor dead.

Their eyes glowed with emptiness and hunger, watching him in silence.

Fear gripped Jack’s heart.

Yet, wonder held him fast.

He dared to explore. The landscape whispered secrets in a language half-understood—a song of forgotten worlds and shattered dreams.

Jack extended his hand to shadowy shapes. They recoiled and beckoned, twisting graceful in a sinister tango between light and dark.

The blue glow wrapped him like a cloak, both prison and sanctuary.
When the pull released him, Jack found himself back in the hallway drenched in sweat, heart hammering.

The mirror gleamed faintly as if nothing had happened.

Days passed.

Jack’s forays into the other world grew more frequent. Each visit was a dance on the knife’s edge terrifying yet addictive.

He hid his secret from Claire, his children, the world.

This strange realm became his escape, his playground.

He knew the mirror was dangerous. The unease in his gut that whispered warnings.

But the allure was intoxicating.

Jack Reynolds was no longer just a man bound by routine.

He was a voyager between worlds.

Caught between the warm glow of family dinners and the chilling blue gleam of the mirror’s call.

And the mirror waited.

Always waiting.
