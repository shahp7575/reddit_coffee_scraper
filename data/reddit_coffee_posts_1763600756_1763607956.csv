1p1s5n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1p1s5n7/112023/,11-20-23 💛,"I stumbled upon an old playlist today, and it brought me back to us. I called it G, your initial. Just one letter, but it carried so much more than its shape. It was my way of keeping you close, of holding on to something of ours even when words failed me. Do you remember how we used to share jam links on Spotify, just so we could listen together? It became our quiet little ritual, kahit magkalayo tayo, it felt like we were side by side. I’d be cleaning in our house or fixing my things, while you were often tucked away in your coffee shop. I made that playlist especially for you, and the very first song was Butterflies by Abe Parker. Every time it plays, I’m reminded of that night I finally admitted to myself that I liked you.

You were standing outside your shop, and I had just finished my matcha. I asked my friend, “Ay, umuulan?” but it was you who answered. My smile gave me away, and all I could do was turn around, because I wasn’t wearing a mask that night. You used to say I was a snob for not talking to you, but the truth is, our eyes always carried the words we never spoke. That was the moment the lyrics hit me.

How do I tell you I need you
When you steal the breath in my lungs?
My body shakes 'til the blood in my face
Makes me awkward, smile, and turn around

There are memories etched so deeply in me that they still breathe, even now. Like that one quiet afternoon at your coffee shop. It was just the two of us, the kind of silence that isn’t empty but full of everything unspoken. You sat across from me, and my heart wouldn’t stop racing. I finished my drink too quickly, wishing I could stay longer, wishing time would bend for us. But then the shop filled with people, and duty pulled you away. As I left, Cowboy in LA played softly in my earbuds, as if the universe itself was teasing me with the words I never had the courage to say.

Let's skip the club, let's skip the crowd
Wanna take you on a date
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold the door
'Cause that's how I was raised…

Sweet memories, don’t you think? Especially that first night we met, November 18, 2023. I never believed in love at first sight, not really, but there was something undeniable about that spark between us. I was half-hidden behind my mask, and yet somehow, you still saw me. Later, we confessed we had both stolen glances at each other, like two magnets pretending not to notice the pull. For a fleeting moment, the world slowed, and it felt like it belonged only to us.

And then, there was our first kiss. It was quick, simple, and yet it made my heart race in a way I’d never felt before. I remember walking home afterward, smiling like an idiot, feeling so giddy that I kept replaying that moment in my head. It wasn’t just a kiss. It was the start of something that made me believe in connection, in timing, in the quiet magic between two people who just found each other.

But time changes everything. I know I once said meeting you was one of the biggest mistakes of my life, but that wasn’t true. I only said it out of anger, out of hurt. You already know why I had to act that way, even if I can’t say it here. It wasn’t because I stopped caring, or because what we had meant nothing. It was because I didn’t know how else to handle the pain. The truth is, meeting you was one of the most beautiful things that ever happened to me. And though it might be too late for apologies, please believe me when I say this now. I’m sorry. Truly, deeply sorry.

I’m sorry, too, for the lies I said, the ones I never intended to say or do. I know they hurt you, and I regret them more than I can ever express. If, in your heart, you ever find yourself regretting meeting me, please know that I understand. But still, I want you to know this. My feelings for you were always real. My love for you was, and will always be, sincere.

If I could ask for one impossible wish, it would be to return to the night we met. To relive it. To hold on tighter. To love you the way you deserved, without fear, without hesitation. But I can’t. And so I’m left with this aching truth. I love you still. I love you so much, it hurts.

I hope life is gentle with you. I hope the world offers you softness where I could not. And if fate is ever kind, may it let our paths cross once more, even if only for a moment, even if only to remind me that once, we had this. Once, I had you.",1,1763607658.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

The question I have starts here: Do you really need a ceremonial grade matcha for the best tasting drink?   
From my understanding as well as personal experience so far, standard culinary/ latte grade matcha honestly tastes fine. As long as you're not skipping prices so hard that you get the vomit colored powders, I haven't felt like the flavour or texture of your run of the mill matcha is that bad. BUT! with that in consideration, the matcha my coworker brought from japan tasted SUBSTANTIALLY better in both a latte as well as a cortado I made for myself. 

Lastly taking all that info, how far do you really need to go when purchasing a ceremonial grade matcha? Where's the start and where's the finish on quality and pricing.

I bought coffee and frozen dumplings. She scanned the coffee and said,
“Don’t rush your mornings. They’re the only part of the day that hasn’t disappointed you yet.”

Ma’am… HELLO??

Another time I bought cleaning supplies and she said,
“When life feels messy, start with what you can see.”

Why is my cashier dropping ancient wisdom like she’s a wandering monk?

1p1s14j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1s14j,What are these bumps I get inside my cheeks?,"Please do not mind the tiny flashlight in my mouth, I couldn’t pick it up otherwise.

Verifying info: I do not smoke or vape (I used to in HS but it’s been about 10 years since) I drink occasionally, did not today. I used to have braces but it’s been since middle school. I drink coffee occasionally and I did drink some today. I am a stressed individual normally but currently do have some active stressors in life. I grit my teeth in my sleep and have TMJ with a lot of pain behind my ears and where the upper and lower jaw connect.

I know this is not tooth related but I have been told by dentists to come in so they can check out my mouth about these bumps but they go away very quickly (maybe few hours or an hour, even minutes, unsure) and I never have time to come in when I notice them, they are random but appear closer to where my back teeth rub. They do not seem like canker sores because those last longer, I used to get them a lot when I was younger and I tend to get them when I’m super stressed. These feel similar with my tongue, like a hard bump and my teeth rub on them and they are painful. They normally appear in roughly the same area. I feel like it’s near where the saliva gland is unless it is on it, I’m unsure. They do not appear like crazy, it’s random and I don’t know why or what causes it, I haven’t been tracking patterns though. I do not bite my cheeks, only my lips. It’s been a little while since I’ve gotten one. I could not find anything on this online besides canker sores unless that’s what it is and dentists have no idea what I’m talking about since they can’t look at it (funny I went to the dentist today and then got one the same day). 

This one appeared as I was eating 10 minutes ago and now is gone by the time I’m done writing and taking pictures. It may look like multiple bumps in one of the pictures but I only felt one with my tongue, unless one is the saliva gland.

No one knew what I had suffered.

I stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path.

I suddenly kneeled onto the floor.

There were still bloody holes in my knees.

I tried to be a good girl, but he looked even angrier.

""What the hel are you doing?!""

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.",1,1763607309.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

I suddenly kneeled onto the floor.

There were still bloody holes in my knees.

""What the hel are you doing?!""

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.",2,1763607025.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1p1rxdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1p1rxdi/which_air_fryer_toaster_oven_fits_best_in_a_small/,Which air fryer toaster oven fits best in a small kitchen?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been living in a tiny apartment for the past two years, and counter space is basically nonexistent. I wanted an air fryer toaster oven but kept thinking there's no way I could fit one without making my kitchen feel even more cramped.

Turns out I was wrong. You just need to know what to look for.

**Size Actually Matters Here**

The biggest mistake people make is assuming all air fryer toaster ovens are these massive machines. Some are, but plenty of compact models exist that can handle everyday cooking without eating up your entire counter.

I learned to check the dimensions before anything else. Look for something under 16 inches wide if you're really tight on space. Also, measure your counter and the area under your cabinets because height can be a sneaky problem.

**What Features You Actually Need**

Don't get caught up in fancy features you'll never use. For a small kitchen, you want something that can replace multiple appliances. That's the whole point, right?

I looked for models that could air fry, toast, bake, and broil. This way I could ditch my old toaster and maybe even use my regular oven less. Convection cooking is clutch too because it cooks faster and more evenly.

**My Research Process**

I spent way too much time reading reviews and comparing specs. If you want to skip all that, I found this helpful collection of compact convection ovens that actually fit in small spaces: [https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven)

They're all on Amazon, so you can check the exact measurements and read real customer reviews about how they fit in tight spaces.

**Capacity vs Size**

Here's something weird I noticed. Some smaller air fryer toaster ovens actually have better interior space than you'd think. It's all about the design. Look for ones that can fit at least 4 slices of toast or a 12-inch pizza. That's usually enough for two people, maybe three if you're not super hungry.

**The Corner Strategy**

One trick that worked for me was putting it in the corner of my counter. Sounds obvious, but I wasn't using that space well anyway. Just make sure there's a few inches of clearance on the sides for ventilation. These things get hot.

**Power and Cooking Performance**

Wattage matters for cooking speed. Most decent models run between 1200-1800 watts. Higher wattage means faster cooking, which is great when you're hungry and your kitchen is already warm.

I also learned that stainless steel models hold up better than plastic ones, especially in cramped kitchens where you might accidentally bump into stuff.

**Final Thoughts**

A small kitchen doesn't mean you can't have nice things. You just need to be smarter about what you buy. An air fryer toaster oven that actually fits your space will get used way more than one that sits in your closet because it's too bulky.

If you're ready to start comparing options, check out [https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven) and filter by dimensions. That's honestly the easiest way to find something that'll work.

My kitchen still isn't huge, but at least now I can make decent food without ordering takeout every night. And I actually have a bit of counter space left over for my coffee maker, which is really all that matters.",1,1763607010.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

Here's what actually worked.","Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone going through something similar. It's been a hell of a ride. At one point I genuinely thought I was dying.

It started off with mild stomach pain after meals, acid reflux, and that constant feeling of fullness. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was temporary. But things escalated quickly. I couldn't eat properly anymore – everything seemed to hurt. I switched to light foods, but nothing helped.

I went to my GP, who prescribed Pantoprazole and told me to take it once daily for 2 weeks. It matched my symptoms, so I followed the plan. But it only got worse. I lost the ability to eat solid foods entirely. I began experiencing crippling stomach cramps – the kind that make you curl up in bed and cry. I couldn't walk. I could barely stand. I lived off water and vegetable broth. Every attempt at a real meal made me feel like I was about to die.

One day, the pain was so unbearable I called an ambulance. At the hospital, they gave me IV Pantoprazole, antacids, and lots of painkillers. The pain subsided a bit, but the bloating and discomfort remained. Something inside me told me I wasn't really getting better.

After a few tests, including an endoscopy, they diagnosed me with Type C Gastritis (chemical-induced gastritis). I was shocked. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, I eat fairly clean, and I don't even take NSAIDs. But they also found a gallstone. As expected, the first advice was immediate surgery – which I declined. I wanted answers first.

After a week in the hospital, I was discharged. But the pain persisted. Even high doses of Pantoprazole didn't help. The cramps started creeping back in, and I was losing my ability to function again. I had lost 20 kg in just 2 months.

Desperate, I sought a second opinion from a local gastroenterologist. He took my case seriously and dug deeper. He said my inflammation didn't even look that severe – so why was I suffering so much?

Together, we uncovered the likely causes:

* I drank black coffee every morning on an empty stomach.
* I was taking Accutane (Isotretinoin) for acne for over 2 years – often on an empty stomach or after only a small breakfast.
* I did OMAD and intermittent fasting, often bingeing on huge meals in the evening.
* I turned out to have a sensitivity to Pantoprazole, which affects 1 in 100 people (not rare in medical terms). It was likely the source of my extreme cramping.

**How I healed:**

**Step 1: Medication switch.** Pantoprazole was replaced with Esomeprazole, and the improvement was immediate. The cramps stopped. I could eat again. I felt like I was returning to life.

But that alone wasn't enough. I researched everything about healing the stomach lining. I built myself a strict set of rules:

* No red meat
* No processed food
* No sugar
* No gluten
* Only water and calming teas (like chamomile, fennel)
* No spicy or irritating foods
* Absolutely no alcohol for 6 months
* Only organic food

Within days, I felt better. But then I made the classic mistake. After a few weeks of feeling ""normal,"" I thought I was healed and stopped following the diet. I paid the price. My symptoms came back hard. It was a wake-up call.

So I went back on the plan. Strictly. For 4 months.

Honestly, the hardest part wasn't the restrictions – it was the boredom. Eating plain chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables every single day broke me mentally. I almost gave up several times because I felt like I was losing my mind. That's when I started looking for gastritis-friendly recipes that actually had some variety and taste to them. I found a newsletter that sends out safe meal ideas weekly and it legitimately saved my sanity during the healing process: [https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter](https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter)

**The result:**

I'm now functionally healed. I eat and drink whatever I want – within reason. My doctor warned me: once you've had this, you're always vulnerable. You have to stay mindful.

A night out with friends and a few drinks? Sure. Alcohol every weekend, careless eating, no rhythm? No way. That life is gone – and honestly, it probably should be for everyone.

**My advice if you're struggling:**

* Check your medications – even the ones you think are harmless.
* Don't underestimate coffee, Accutane, fasting, or stress.
* Stick to your healing diet for several months – not weeks.
* Be kind to yourself.

Healing isn't just about pills. It's about behavior, discipline, and self-awareness.

There were still bloody holes in my knees.

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.

This is not a story about a magical success, but about several attempts at the same dream.



It all began in a very ordinary way: a regular job, fairly stable, but the kind that starts to feel tight on the inside as the years go by.

Electric work, switchboards, cables – a normal profession, a normal life.

Only you catch yourself thinking more and more often: “Is this really what I want to be doing for another ten years in a row?”



To make things even more fun, at some point I somehow ended up surrounded by programmer friends. From random meet‑ups, walks, shared hobbies – you pick out people you want to keep talking to.

And these days a lot of smart, decent people are in intellectual fields.

What they saw in talking to me is still a mystery wrapped in darkness.



At some point my patience snapped, and instead of the usual “someday later” it turned into a firm “no, right now”.

The most obvious path at that moment was “web development”. You open the internet, type “how to get into IT”, and you instantly get whacked over the head by the holy trinity of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.



I did exactly what many people tell you not to do: I quit my job and sat down to study as if it were a full work shift. Not “an hour in the evening”, but a proper “this is my main activity now” mode.



I managed to slip for free into a course from one well‑known online school. What can I say? There was more water there than in my kettle.

Not completely useless, but still: their business is to keep you studying, preferably for years and preferably for a lot of money.

Whether you actually learn anything is your business. Anyway, you shouldn’t blindly listen to random people on the internet like me, by the way. I digress.



Mornings – coffee and tutorials, daytime – practice, evenings – debugging mistakes and yet another course.

Yes, another course. Turns out you have to pull information from different sources.

You can’t really be “taught” something; you can only “teach yourself” – I heard that somewhere, didn’t come up with it on my own.



Frontend slowly filled all the space around me.

First pet projects appeared, some landing pages, tiny little apps. The “portfolio” was slowly puffing up, same as my head, but my confidence – not so much.



Once it came to CVs and interviews, illusions started to fall one by one. On paper, “junior frontend developer” sounds nice, but in reality there are hundreds, thousands of such resumes.

You can’t just wave a pair of shorts at that many people who want to lie on a beach in Bali with a smoothie in hand.



A couple of interviews, polite rejections, long “we’ll definitely get back to you” pauses – and they don’t get back. Classic.

At some point it became clear: the world does not owe you a round of applause just because you suddenly decided to change your life.



Meanwhile, my wife had her own storyline running in parallel. She also chose to change her profession, went into design – and in her case it actually worked out.

New job, interesting projects, people who are genuinely happy with the results of her work. I was honestly happy for her.

But inside it highlighted a pretty sharp contrast: “here’s a person who tried and hit the target, and you tried and… well, not really.”



Savings are not infinite. At some point it became obvious: the experiment had to be stopped. I folded up my frontend saga and went back to my usual job.

From a survival standpoint – the right decision. From the inside – it felt like hitting the “revert changes” button.



But as it turned out later, once you dive deep enough into this rabbit hole, you don’t really go back to “the old you”.

It keeps pulling you further in.

Like a climber who has just conquered a small rock and, still out of breath, is already staring at a bigger one. Or something like that, I don’t know. You can come up with a prettier metaphor yourself.



This is the point where many stories end. Seriously, a lot of them.

Someone honestly tried, got burned, concluded “it’s not for me” and goes on living, joking about that old attempt. I also tried to do exactly that.



A one‑and‑a‑half‑year pause began. No courses, no “one more React video”.

I deliberately pushed the topic aside: work, home, some old hobbies, a TV show in the evening – life went back to being “normal”.



I almost managed to forget. Almost.



And that’s when our beloved IT world walked back into frame for the second time in the shape of a single book… and a very insistent “what if we try again, but differently this time?”. 



Now all this has resulted in an attempt to make my own game about mechs in Unity, but that’s another chapter.",0,1763606565.0,Unity3D,0,0.5,False

She came over to my house because she wanted to spend the night. I made coffee and poured us both a cup. I went to the bathroom before drinking mine. 

When I came out, she hadn't touched hers. I sipped mine then she did. 

I jokingly said that I didn't drug it, and she said that she just wanted to be sure. 

I was just joking, but I guess she was serious. I asked her why she came over if she doesn't trust me. She said that she trusts me, but just force of habit. 

I told her that I want her to leave, and that it made no sense for us to sleep together/be alone if there's no trust. She tried to reason with me for a few minutes, but I didn't back down. 

She texted later, and said that she's not interested in seeing me if I'm going to victim blame. I just responded that it's stupid to do what she did, if she didn't trust me. She's an adult.

I blocked her because I got nervous. Maybe I rushed to get her out of my house, but I don't think it made sense.

(Fun reason),"**TL;DR** I'm competing in a family cooking contest and need advice on making 3 traditional Vietnamese dishes. I have a rough plan and have started practicing, but I want to get these right. I love Vietnamese food and I want to win.

\--

**The Cooking Contest**

Every winter break, my in-laws host a cooking competition where 2 family members make an appetizer, main course, and dessert from scratch, all dishes from a specific country selected by a family member. That family member also selects the specific dishes to be served. Each course is presented blindly (A + B) and non-cooking family members rate each dish on **taste**, **presentation**, and **texture**.

This is my first year competing. I will be cooking against/alongside my brother-in-law in a shared rental kitchen - so planning equipment and timing is essential! I will not know his versions of the 3 dishes until the day of. I want to be prepared to win - and would appreciate any advice or corrections.

\---

**Our Required Menu + some of my plan/questions**

Please also help me get the spelling/grammar correct here.

Each of the 3 overall menu items are locked in (though the 3rd one is open to interpretation):

**1) Appetizer: Bánh Mì Thịt Nướng (Grilled pork bánh mì)**

* Gonna make my own baguettes too - advice? [recipe](https://vickypham.com/blog/vietnamese-banh-mi-baguettes/) (haven't tried it yet)
* Sauce [recipe](https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyphameats/video/7273464755812109570)
* **Looking for advice on** pork cut (shoulder vs something else), marinade recommendations, indoor grilling technique, ideal toppings and ratios

**2) Main Course: Cơm Gà Nướng + Nước Chấm (Lemongrass chicken + rice/sauce)**

* Open to any tips and advice
* I'm also considering adding **Gỏi Bắp Cải** (cabbage herb salad) for potential bonus points. Open to suggestions for what would round out the plate in a traditional and balanced way - garnish or edible.

**3) Dessert Pair: Đồ Uống Cà Phê Hỗn Hợp + Bánh ngọt** (idk how to write this)

* Apparently The requirement is to make a Vietnamese coffee cocktail and a French-influenced pastry. I haven't made a Vietnamese coffee before... Any classics or reliable approaches would help. I am leaning toward serving it warm because it'll be winter.
* For the pastry, I am considering [pandan madeleines](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/pandan-madeleine-recipe). I haven't worked with pandan before and I'm not sure if I should add a coating or glaze. Open to alternate pastry ideas that taste great with strong Vietnamese coffee.

**What I would love help with:**

* Ingredient and technique accuracy
* What is traditional vs where I can improvise
* Flavor balance
* Vietnamese spelling/word choice
* Timing tips for cooking all three in one day
* Any beginner pitfalls to watch out for

Thank you in advance. I appreciate any guidance this community is willing to share.

Yup, we're at that time of year!  Though this year, I'll be doing this in five parts like I did a couple years back when we had tons of Faceted Collection, though now it's the Everyday Luxuries collection that went wild with releases so I decided to make it Part 1 before I go into the Season releases throughout 2025.  

Yeah, the packaging for the 2025 releases did change and you can tell which ones were the old 2024 ones by the fact the text color switch going from black to white which made sense visually to me, though the fact its still in that Beveled bottle design however wasn't all that interesting to me, but the RAINBOW of colors is great!  Also lulz at Infinite Radiance being the only one with a different lid style

Anyways, shall we dive into the scents!!!!

* **Midnight Addiction** (Ripe Plum, Rich Almond Flower, Addictive Coffee Bean) - Kicking off with the first batch that came out for Spring 1, we kick off with Midnight Addiction which if I remember was supposed to be a dupe for Black Opium (AND FAIR WARNING, I don't own the originals for majority of these), if this was supposed to be it, count me in!!!  It smells dark and sexy to me and I get the fullness of the plum and the slight roundedness out of the almond flower just well, it's actually the coffee bean that I'm kind of feel like is somewhere in the background of the scent, but it's definitely not coffee-ish like Midnight Amber Glow was, it's got this nice, warm, and soft feel which made it one of my favorites this year!
* **Madame Mystique** (Bright Red Berries, Rose Petals, Sultry Woods) - Honestly, when I first smell this the first thing my brain thinks of is Dark Kiss.  For whatever reason I get this same kind of fizzy berry, but also dark and sexy tone as well here.  After a while the berries do take over on the drydown for me and it's got a nice sweetness to it that I enjoyed, but I still do prefer Dark Kiss.
* **You're Cheeky** (Pink Peppercorn, Warm Almond Flower, Vanilla Bean) - I think this scent kind of flew over my head because I couldn't remember how it smelled, but smelling it now, You're Cheeky is kind of giving me shampoo-vibe because I get the sweetness like it's a fruit or something but there isn't much in the scent notes to kind of lean me somewhere certain.  A little Robutussin-like to me...it isn't bad, but I don't think it's my kind of scent.
* **Seeing Rouge** (Blackcurrant Buds, Sweet Saffron, Amber Moss) - I think maybe the worst scent for me that came out this year might have to go to Seeing Rouge.  I know this is based off the mega popular Baccarat Rouge 540 scent, but I have never been a fan of this one.  Whenever someone gushes about it smelling sweet and beautiful...it's not coming to me because all I get is this antiseptic, animal hospital smell and it just does not work on my skin chemistry unfortunately.  Maybe I get a little warmth from the moss, but otherwise...not this was just not it, but it's just the scent of this and I assume the original (I have DUA's version of BR540 and that doesn't work on me either).
* **Loyal to You** (Sweet Lemon Blossom, Orange Flower, Vanilla Marshmallow) - With this being the Devotion dupe, Loyal to You is both a yay and a nay for me for some strange reason.  I felt like this did replace Iced Lemon Pound Cake for this year because it's supposed to be the lemon gourmand scent here.  To me, the scent doesn't quite smell gourmand to me in comparison to the aforementioned scent, but it also has this kind of weird syrupy groove that made me think of Belize Tropical Cabana (2021).  I don't know about this one anymore like...I guess in the first spray its good but the drydown isn't doing much for me.
* **Guilty as Fig** (Fig Nectar, Lush Jasmine, Creamy Musk) - I definitely forgotten the next two scents completely since there really wasn't much that came out to compare these to.  Guilty as Fig was pretty light for me and it smells nice on my skin that's for sure, but damn does it fade almost immediately for me.  I like the sweetness of the fig and the light floral coming off the jasmine which is funny that it says lush of all things.  I don't know, this was OK, but like I said, kind of forgettable in the long run for me.
* **Aqua Hour** (Watery Bergamot, Fresh Peony, Salty Driftwood) - Yeah, aquatic scents kind of was my weak point in the early year because we had a lot of aquatic scents last year as it was so Aqua Hour kind of just flew over me too.  Coming back to it for the end of the year review, it smells nice, the woodyness is what I get a lot alongside the bergamot in here.  It also has this sweet floral that makes the scent kind of give off this laundry detergent background (which is kind of funny considering the new B&BW product that came out this year).  It's fine though...way better than Mediterranean Mirage at least...
* **Viva Vanilla** (Rich Plum, Glowing Amber, Addictive Vanilla) - Yeah, they repackaged three of the 2024 Everyday Luxuries scents although one came as a mini and later on full packaging (we'll get there, I promise).  Viva Vanilla made sense since it was quite the fan favorite among them.  For me, yeah this is still great to me.  Like I still do think it smells similar to Wicked Vanilla Woods or even Ballet Nights because it's a cinnamon/vanilla-y scent that also feels gooey and candy-like.  I just love it that much, I guess!
* **Covered in Roses** (Ruby Berries, Sugared Rose Buds, Blush Amber) - Which is weird that I was surprised that this one came back.  Personally, I'm not a rose kind of guy as it as a distinct feel that I just don't vibe with (only a few seldom rose-related scents work for me).  Maybe it's the whole plant-y greenness of it that throws me off especially with the plain Rose scent and the screechy Rose Water & Ivy.  Covered in Roses does tone down those feelings, but then I'm left with a kind of planty, watery note that I don't know works for me.  Without comparing the previously mentioned scents, I couldn't tell the scent had the berries not, but I do have all three and yeah, this is sweeter by far, but this doesn't capture my interest much still.
* **All Eyes on Her** (Ripe Blackberry, Bold Jasmine, Velvety Sandalwood) - Now jumping to Spring 3, we quickly got 4 more than were released to us which were all new...maybe?  Anyways, All Eyes on Her was the one that I had not a lot of feelings towards because it's basically just Fall in Bloom, MAYBE a little sweeter with the blackberry note, but I swear they're kind of just the same otherwise to me.  Not that I disagreed with it because I kind of like this one a little more?  Yeah, maybe a bit of a double dupe like last year's If You Musk.
* **Strawberry Flirt** (Strawberry Jam, Vibrant Poppy, Cotton Candy Musk) - When I first reviewed it, I felt so confused because it smelled a LOT like All Eyes on Her which kind of disappointed me a lot.  Though with some time and working with it, it finally started to come together for me.  Like it's definitely got a stronger strawberry note to me and there's a sugary background that I don't really get out of the compared scent...I don't know how the scent changed for me, but this got better over time for me.
* **Pistachio Glaze** (Pistachio Creme, Toasted Vanilla, Sugared Patchouli) - Might personally be top 3 of my favorite scents of 2025 right here already!  Yeah, something about the pistachio scents this year (and Vacation Vibe and Sweetheart Cherry from last year) really stuck out to me and this was the crowning jewel!  It's got a strong cherry-like tone thanks to the pistachio and there's this warm nuttyness that just smelled heavenly to me.  Yeah, no...this is an awesome scent and yeah, it doesn't smell like what it's duping (Kayali's YUM! Pistachio).  
* **Imperfect Beauty** (Sweet Rhubarb, White Florals, Radiant Cashmere) - Just from some of these scent notes, I knew it kind of smelled familiar to me and it's with B&BW's 2022 scent, Poppy.  They both share kind of similar notes predominantly the rhubarb which I was surprised THAT was the key factor that me think of it.  For Imperfect Beauty, it's kind of a airy, sweet, floral scent that kind of runs a little watery/aquatic for me too.  It's fine for me though, cute scent, but a once in a while kind of scent for me.
* **Inner Angel** (Spiced Apple Cognac, Tonka Bean, Warm Praline) - Oh dang, I think Pistachio Glaze had competition to be honest.  Jumping to Fall 2, we got 4 more scents dropped starting with the one that excited me the most and Angel's Share getting a dupe is awesome since I REALLY love the apple cider scent that I get from this one.  Very apple-fronted with that spicy zip to it.  Though it does come at a cost of being a lighter scent however.  I love it though and is such a good Autumnal release!
* **Mediterranean Mirage** (Fresh Bergamot, Radiant Amber, Smooth Musks) - I think the one scent that really was a no thanks from me was Mediterranean Mirage.  While I see the scents coming close to Aqua Hour, this was anything but nice to my nose.  It's VERY sharp, the amber and musk are kind of in the way and the bergamot was more than like that citrus stab that made me wince hard at it.  Definitely comes off masculine as well to me, I don't know about it and on skin, yeah it gets slightly better after drydown, but after that point I'm just over it.  Just isn't a scent for me...
* **Free as a Flower** (Wild Orange Flower, Bright Lavender, Creamy Vetiver) - Then we have this one which is another scent I completely forgot about (especially since I reviewed this not that long ago).  I think of the 3 new ones, this fell in the middle because I loved Inner Angel and despised Mediterranean Mirage.  I also don't know how to feel about this one because it's a bright, lavender scent mostly.  I still am not quite sure what the vetiver smells like exactly, but it smells nice.  One of the few lavender scents that didn't feel like a copy and paste this year.
* **Pink Obsessed** (Blushing Jasmine, Cashmere Praline, Vanilla Bourbon) - Technically this came back in Spring 1, but as a mini-FFM in a gift set, but later fully returned in full-size with the Fall 2 releases.  Being the 3rd to return from last year, Pink Obsessed is a pretty nice, warm scent, but I couldn't tell you what I was smelling as it's both kind of floral and sweet and well-rounded enough that it could be a floral/gourmand to me.  Nice to see it return though...was one of the more memorable ones from 2024's set.
* **Infinite Radiance** (Sweet Mandarin, Opulent Muguet, Sensual Amberwood) - Then we get to the last one which was the LONE new one introduced in Winter 1!  With all of these other scents released through this, Infinite Radiance is the kind of middle-of-the-road one for me as well.  The citrus is nice, but I think I'm not too fond of the lily-of-the-valley or the woody notes really.  This was kind of just a bit dull to me especially with what we got throughout the year.  





  
======

  
Yeah, kicking off the annual posts finally and this was the year for Everyday Luxuries because overall, I think this was altogether a much better selection than the scents introduced last year.  Granted this is 16 new scents versus the 10 from last year.  Will they continue it in 2026 is curious since there isn't any hinted at for the rest of this year, but it could easily happen I would say.  ",8,1763606389.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

Used Replit + ChatGPT, 20 active users, $25/year pricing.","I talked to Kenny, a 13-year film pro who shipped a creator platform for filmmakers and content producers. Built over several months using Replit and ChatGPT while traveling in Thailand. Already has 20 active users testing and providing feedback.

His build matters for vibe coders because he's living proof that 13 years of domain expertise beats technical purity. That's why I wanted to share his story.

**His domain expertise:**

* 13 years as director of photography and video producer
* Produced content for major tech conferences and creators
* Built businesses serving clients from Vegas to Hawaii
* Experienced the industry shift as streaming changed everything
* Knew exactly what broke when platforms chased corporate accounts

For over a decade, V\*\*\*\* was the only real option for creative professionals hosting video. Then it got bloated. Features nobody asked for. Features everyone needed got ignored. Corporate accounts became the priority. Subscription renewal hit $130/year.

When I asked Kenny about the origin story, he told me he was having coffee with his wife in Chiang Mai on July 5th, dreading that renewal. He literally said: ""Why don't I try building an alternative?"" July 6th, he started building. Hasn't stopped since.

**His vibe coding approach:**

Kenny's not a traditional developer. He's built websites since age 18 using WYSIWYG builders, worked with Squarespace and Canva, but never wrote code. What struck me during our conversation was how intentional his workflow is:

* **Mockup-first workflow**: Creates all page mockups in Canva first. Then shares those mockups with ChatGPT, asking it to create a Replit prompt matching the design exactly. Only then implements in Replit. This strategy saves both time and money - something I learned from talking to him.
* **Assistant over Agent**: Most people waste money not realizing Assistant can perform the same functions as Agent, often better. Assistant has guardrails and asks for approval. Agent operates independently. Understanding this difference saved him hundreds of dollars.
* **Organized documentation**: Created a dedicated folder in ChatGPT as an evolving working document. The chat retains all questions across sessions. When things break at 11pm (and they will), he has the history to reference.

**On technical infrastructure:**

**Storage**: Currently using Replit's native Object storage with Row-Level Security, isolation buckets for users, and strong security features. Photos only for now. Plans to migrate to AWS or Supabase for video hosting in the future.

**Auth**: Already using Supabase for authentication, which will make the eventual storage migration smoother.

**Performance**: As users grow, he's focused on security, removing cache issues, and implementing lazy loading to speed up the platform.

The platform evolved beyond his initial vision. Started as a lightweight embeddable player for cloud links (Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, Instagram). Now it's a full creator profile platform with behind-the-scenes images, gear affiliate links, and customizable tabs for promoting events.

**What this shows about creative industry expertise:**

Kenny knew video hosting was broken. More importantly, he knew WHY it was broken and WHAT needed to exist instead because he lived it daily.

He understands what a filmmaker needs when hunting for that one video from three clients ago. He knows what matters when a musician wants to promote their next show while showcasing their work. He's experienced the friction of platforms built for everyone serving no one well.

When I asked him about validation, his answer was refreshingly direct: ""The build was structured based on my personal pain points."" No surveys. No market research. Deep knowledge from 13 years in the field.

This is the pattern we keep seeing with successful vibe-coded projects. The domain expertise becomes the moat. The technical implementation is learnable. But you can't fake a decade of understanding what your users actually need.

>

**Where things stand:**

* 20 active users currently
* Freemium model + $25/year paid tier
* No paying users yet (and he's okay with that)
* Still improving security, adding features, structuring next pricing tier
* Next tier will include AI chatbot for client inquiries
* Public roadmap and changelog through [featurebase.app](http://featurebase.app)
* Plans for geographic search directory to help clients find local talent

His strategy: Stay hands-on with active users. Connect with creatives. Offer free memberships in exchange for finding bugs and providing feedback. The boring reality of learn, iterate, repeat.

**On the human side:**

**Pushback**: Got it from dev friends who looked down on vibe coding. His response after 20 years as a business owner: ""People are scared of what they don't know and that's ok - it's your job to process and move on.""

**Reddit**: Very active on r/filmmakers and r/replit. His warning: ""Be prepared to have very thick skin lol.""

**First users**: Friends on Substack, Reddit, and Twitter. Stays active in Build in Public communities, offering advice and keeping up with user concerns.

**Support expectations**: ""If you're just starting out, be prepared to have zero or little support AND be ok with that - understand everyone is not as excited about your thing as you are.""

**Biggest win**: ""Learning how to build and launch my ideas within just a few months is absolutely a game changer. Learning vibe coding will create a very bright future for me alongside my existing film career.""

Reading Kenny's answers during our conversation kept me engaged for hours. This is exactly the builder spirit I keep seeing - people who turn their domain knowledge, expertise, and years of experience into products they own. With AI coding assistance, it's the perfect time to leverage yourself.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Domain depth beats technical purity**: 13 years of film experience gave Kenny insights that no amount of coding skill could replicate. He knows what creators need because he is one.
* **Workflow efficiency compounds**: His Canva → ChatGPT → Replit pipeline saves time and money. Finding efficient workflows early matters when you're building solo.
* **Assistant vs Agent distinction**: Understanding this saved hundreds of dollars. Most builders waste money on Agent when Assistant does the job better with guardrails.
* **Organized from day one**: Documentation through ChatGPT folders retains context across sessions. When things break (and they will), having that history is invaluable.
* **Build private, share public strategically**: As important as building in public is, building in private matters for sanity and prevents distraction from posting vs building.
* **Adapt or die mindset**: Kenny pivoted from photography to video to AI-assisted building. Each time the industry shifted, he learned the new thing instead of clinging to past achievements.

**Discussion:**

* For those building tools in your professional domain: how do you balance ""ship fast"" vs ""wait until you understand the problem deeply""? Kenny built on years of experience, not weeks.
* Anyone else here dealt with dev friends dismissing vibe coding? How do you handle that skepticism when you're solving real problems for real users?
* What's your take on pricing strategy for early products? Kenny's doing $25/year with no paying users yet. Too low? Just right for learning phase?

1p1rdro,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatulousTubes/comments/1p1rdro/why_not_get_surgery/,Why not get surgery?,"I have just been diagnosed with PET. I definitely don't want to upset or offend anyone, my question is sincere: From the research I've done and the posts I read here and elsewhere, all the ""DIY"" treatments - saline, PatulEnd, etc. - are temporary measures that last as little as hours for some people. At the same time, the recommendation that one avoid/eliminate coffee, alcohol, carbonation & spicy food (if reflux is a contributor), etc., will have a tremendously negative impact on quality of life, for less-than-guaranteed, incomplete, temporary ""relief."" Lastly, there is the fact that airplane travel is not at all advised, as it is almost certain to make symptoms worse, and may even make PET more ""permanent."" With all that said, surgical procedures have a very high rate of success - ET “shim”/catheter injection (hyaluronic acid, fat, Gelfoam, etc.) allow 70-85% of people to return to unrestricted flying. The results ""only"" last 6-24 months, but it is repeatable. Permanent reconstruction (fat graft + cartilage, myringotomy with plugging, cauterisation, etc.), allows 90%+ of people to fly without restrictions afterward, and is a ""one and done"" procedure for the vast majority. So my question is, why do so many people seem to be suffering and trying to make this a little bit better with convoluted, temporary measures, when there are procedures available that are very likely to provide a significant, if not complete and permanent, end to their symptoms?",0,1763605500.0,PatulousTubes,3,0.5,False
1p1rdj3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1rdj3,Pages Book Café,"I'm on a mission to find a quiet cafe where I can hide for a few hours. Not to hunch over a laptop but read a book, slow down my thoughts and hopefully restore my attention span. 

First on my bucket list, Pages Book Cafe in Ara Damansara. 

As soon as you walk in you'll see shelves of books facing the counter. They hold a good mix of fiction, non-fiction, crafting and cooking books.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

You have big dreams for the next 5–10 years… but *what’s the next move*? And how do you keep all those long-term goals straight when life is throwing distraction, debt, and dopamine traps at you from every direction?

That’s exactly why we built **ClarityGoals – The Long-Term Goal Tracker.**  
 Not another “habit app.” Not another bloated project tool. A simple overview that lets you:

* Map out your **10-year and 5-year goals**  
* Reverse-engineer them into **1-year, quarter, and month** milestones  
* Visually see your whole path on one clean board  
* Mark goals as *Achieved* and actually feel your progress stacking up  

Most people never write their goals down or track them consistently… and the data shows this kind of tracking can make you **about 9–10x more likely** to actually hit your goals vs the average person.

ClarityGoals is available **now as a web app** on all modern browsers. iOS and Android apps are coming early 2026.

And we priced it so money isn’t an issue:  
 ☕️ Roughly the price of *one* coffee drink per month  
 💵 **$1 for your first month**, then **$6/month**, no yearly lock-in, cancel anytime

If you’re tired of drifting and you’re ready to **design a life that actually feels like yours**, this is your tool.

👉 **Start your $1 first month at** [**https://www.claritygoals.com/**](https://www.claritygoals.com/)

I had a job. I paid my bills. I watched Netflix, scrolled TikTok, replied to messages, repeated. If you’d seen me, you’d probably think, “They’re doing okay.” But inside, I felt drained and strangely hollow, like I was drifting through my own life on autopilot.

What scared me wasn’t just the tiredness. It was the feeling that something vital in me had gone quiet. My intuition felt muted. Life felt flat. I wasn’t depressed enough to “break,” but I wasn’t truly alive either. I went to bed most nights staring at the ceiling, wondering why I felt so disconnected.

During one of those late-night searches about feeling “switched off,” I kept seeing the same phrase: [the pineal gland](https://healmindandbody.my.canva.site/dag4r-awuby), often called the “third eye.” At first, I dismissed it. It sounded too mystical, too New Age. I scrolled past the videos and articles and went back to my usual coping mechanism: distractions.

But the phrase kept showing up. Posts. Videos. Articles. People talking about sleep, dreams, intuition, and something inside them “waking up” again. It reached a point where I thought, *Okay, universe, I get it. I’ll at least read one article.*

That was the night I fell down the rabbit hole.

I learned that the pineal gland is a tiny pine-cone-shaped gland deep in the brain, linked to melatonin production, sleep-wake cycles, and what many spiritual traditions call our “inner eye.” Some call it the gateway to intuition and inner guidance; others stick to the biology and talk about circadian rhythm and night-time restoration. Both sides had something in common: when this little gland is stressed or “dull,” life often feels that way too.

Then came the punch in the gut: modern life is basically a pineal gland’s worst nightmare. Constant blue light from screens, late nights, stress, processed food, stimulants, and never really resting. It didn’t feel like I was reading an article — it felt like I was reading my daily routine.

As I read more, I started seeing stories from people who tried supporting their pineal gland with specific supplements and simple rituals. Some mentioned deeper sleep, vivid dreams, and a stronger sense of inner clarity. Others shared their personal pineal xt review and how a targeted formula helped them feel more “online” mentally and spiritually. I wasn’t interested in hype or miracles. I was interested in one honest question:

*What would happen if I actually supported this part of my brain for 30 days and paid attention?*

So I turned it into an experiment.

Every night, about 30 minutes before bed, I took a supplement designed to support pineal gland and brain health. No harsh stimulants, just a blend of botanicals and nutrients that lined up with what I’d been reading. I didn’t obsess over every ingredient; I just chose a formula that felt aligned and decided to be consistent.

I paired it with a tiny ritual. Lights dimmed. Phone in another room. I sat on my bed, placed a hand on my chest, and took ten slow breaths. With each exhale, I repeated in my mind: *“Tonight, I choose calm and clarity. I allow my mind to soften. I’m open to inner guidance.”* It took maybe three minutes. No chanting, no incense, no elaborate setup.

In the mornings, before touching my phone, I sat quietly for three to five minutes. I asked myself one simple question: *“What do I need today?”* Some days nothing clear came. Other days, a single word floated up: rest, focus, boundaries, honesty. I didn’t force it. I just listened.

The first week was subtle. I wasn’t getting any cosmic downloads. The main change was that I felt a little sleepier at night in a natural way. I fell asleep slightly faster and woke up a bit less wrecked. Old me would’ve said, “Meh, nothing’s happening,” and quit. This time, I reminded myself: this is a 30-day experiment, not a 3-day miracle.

During the second week, the small changes started stacking. My sleep felt deeper, and my dreams became more vivid and memorable. I woke up a little lighter instead of dragging myself out of bed. One morning, I woke up before my alarm, not in a panic, just calm and awake. It was such a small moment, but it felt foreign in the best way.

By the third week, I noticed a shift that had nothing to do with sleep. My mental noise had turned down a notch. Conversations felt less like something I had to “push through.” I wasn’t diving into my phone every spare second. I caught myself actually noticing sunlight on the wall, the taste of my coffee, the feel of my feet on the floor.

Then came the moment that really shook me.

I’d been stuck for months on a decision: a project that looked great on paper but felt “off” in my gut. Normally I would overthink it into oblivion — lists, pros and cons, asking everyone for advice. One morning, during my quiet check-in, a thought came through so clearly it almost startled me: *“You already know the answer. You just don’t want to disappoint anyone.”*

It was like my inner voice had finally cut through the static.

I realized my true answer was no. It didn’t matter how good it looked externally; my body tightened every time I considered saying yes. For the first time in a long time, I trusted that feeling. I turned the project down — and instead of spiraling into regret, I felt an unexpected calm. A quiet certainty. Like I’d just aligned with something truer inside me.

By the end of 30 days, nothing in my external life had dramatically changed. Same job. Same city. Same responsibilities. But my internal experience of that life was different. My nights were less of a fight. My sleep was deeper. I felt like a fog had lifted from my mind. My intuition wasn’t suddenly magical or dramatic; it was simply clearer, like a radio station finally tuned in.

Do I think a supplement alone changed my life? No. What changed my life was the combination: targeted support for my brain and pineal gland, a tiny commitment to ritual, and a willingness to listen inward again. The formula helped my body feel safe enough to relax. The rituals gave my mind space to breathe. Together, they made it easier for my inner voice to be heard.

Maybe that’s why so many people feel compelled to write their own stories and pineal xt review posts. When you’ve been living in mental fog for years, even a gentle shift feels revolutionary.

If you recognize parts of yourself in this — the exhaustion, the numbness, the sense that your inner “spark” has gone dim — consider running your own experiment. It doesn’t have to look exactly like mine. It can be your own version of nightly support, small rituals, and honest listening.

If you’re curious about the science and the specific formula that inspired my 30 days, you’ll find the same presentation I watched linked below. Watch it, feel into your own body’s response, and decide for yourself.

Thirty days from now, you could still be scrolling at 2 a.m., wondering why you feel so disconnected. Or you could look back, like I did, and quietly realize: *that* was the month everything inside you started to wake up.

To start - I never learned how to drive, I’m in my late 20’s, grew up in SF. Went to school on the east coast for college and moved to NYC, now I’m back in SF, so I’ve really never needed a car. 
I live off a major bus line that comes every 5 minutes, and getting to work door to door is 15 minutes. My grocery store is around the corner, and a major vein of nightlife, restaurants, coffee shop shops, etc is a block from my apartment.
Tons of bus lines, even the cable car, are right near me so getting to see my friends/family is easy. 
Recently, a friend who drives everywhere (has to) mentioned how peaceful it is that I’m beholden to a time frame not in my control. I was meeting them for an early morning paddle board across the bay and got there early due to the bus times, so I just read by the bay waiting (very nice). 
Overall, there have been about 7-8 times in my life where driving would have been helpful, but other than that my brain is just programmed to think alternatively because I’ve never drove. I certainly use cars to get around when necessary, but for the most part it’s tons of walking and public transport.

Context.  I met a guy at a party. His best friend got engaged to my best friend (Because he had lived 100 miles north I'd never met him before)
Anyways cue our eyes meeting, that zing of deep recognition a weird draw to him. I ignored this and left it. Well, eventually, he added me on fb. We started laughing at each others jokes and had great banter. He was quick and witty. 
We ran into each other again at a different party and this time the same thing. Our eyes met. There was that weird recognition again. I tried to shake it off. Id just left a 4.5 ltr like 4 months prior  and I wasn't looking really. Regardless of that i could not get him out of my head. 

Couple weeks pass and he messages me on fb and we just chat. He genuinely just wanted to know about me. As we chatted and the banter got more and more personal. Soon we're talking about more serious things but it was still cool. eventually he got the guts to ask me out. My initial reaction was hell no. Then i thought I yolo. What could one date hurt?
Well we had coffee and talked 7hrs. The next morning i took him out for brunch. Then we went to a museum. Before i knew it i was head over heels. We clicked like two pieces of a puzzle.
Enter the next amazing 2 months ever. I swear i was ready to marry him. We just instantly worked. No pretending no bs. We were straight with what we wanted and it was mutual. 

Then he passed away November 1st. His T1D got him 😢
I'm devastated. My heart has been ripped out of my chest.
Its been 19 days but may as well be yesterday. 

To the title.

I am the only person who knew him that was physically close to him. Our places were only 3mins apart. He had just moved to my city in April and didn't know anyone here. His Other friends are literally 100 miles away. Family much further. Across the country.

So if I hadn't met him there was a good chance he would've died anyways. His T1D had gotten brittle and he was to stubborn to take care of himself  properly. To go get checked out. I literally asked him all the time if I should take him or if  he should goto dr. I knew he wasn't feeling himself. If I had known it was that serious I would have dragged him to the hospital myself. 

Anyways If I wasnt around these last few months.  If we hadn't gotten so close. he would've died alone. He wouldn't have had someone to go looking for him. It haunts me to think how long he would've been there...
It haunts me that our time together was so short yet felt so orchestrated.
Sometimes I think that was my only purpose. To find him, love him and then to help his family and friends. 
So he wasn't alone. 

Im ok with that. But its also extremely grim. 

**just wanted to add that if this was just a small collision of destiny maybe his job was to teach me what real love looked like. I've been so fucked over in the love department. This man showed up. Asked me out. Paid for it all. Never expected anything from me! He was respectful, polite and listened. He went out of his way for me. He'd bring me home coffee after he worked 10hrs cause he knew it would brighten my day. He cooked and did dishes after a 10hr shift. He loved me so hard I found myself realizing I had been settling for dog shit my whole life. 
He did it making it look effortless. Easy. He wanted too. It blew my mind. 
My birthday he planned a night out and secretly invited my two best friends. He got me purple roses. My favorite color. 
He was an amazing human being who told I did too much but I honestly felt like he did to much. 
 I loved him so much. I couldn't do enough to feel like I was expressing it enough to him. 
 I was looking forward to loving him for a long time, and now he's just gone 😮‍💨😭

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, and Metroid: Samus Returns. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I think I just watched a whole business collapse in real time.","So… I don’t even know how to explain this without sounding insane.

I work at a small insurance agency. There are six of us. Payday was November 14th. Nobody got paid. We all reached out to the boss and he completely ghosted us for 3 straight days.

Then, out of nowhere, at 4:30 PM on Tuesday, he finally messages us saying he is “no longer in charge of running payroll.” That’s it. No explanation. No payroll. Nothing.

Here’s where it gets worse:

The guy who has been running the business isn’t even legally allowed to sell insurance because of his past felony charges. So he put everything under another employee’s name (let’s call him James ) so he could keep operating under the table.

Well… now it looks like he:
	•	secretly kept control of the company’s bank account
	•	cleaned out the account
	•	left James (the legal owner on paper) holding the bag
	•	disappeared again

Multiple coworkers are saying they think he’s going to “shut everything down” and ghost everyone. One said he literally cleaned out his desk because he’s convinced the boss is going to nuke the business.

Someone found what looks like an old charge for kidnapping from NY attached to the boss’s name, plus other stuff that makes this whole situation feel even more unstable.

One coworker pulled the Ring cam from the office because we honestly don’t know what’s going on, if he’s going to listen in or if this guy is going to randomly show up. People are saying they think he’s been coming back into the office when no one’s there because he’s been drinking the weird coffee he always buys.

Everyone internally is telling me to update my résumé ASAP because they think the boss set this whole thing up so he could bail with whatever money was left.

We still have no pay, no clarity, no communication, and the “owner” of the company (again, NOT the actual guy running it even though as far as we were concerned and James was concerned he WAS) is now contacting lawyers.

This has been the strangest, most chaotic, most unprofessional employment experience I have ever had. It feels like watching a slow-motion scam unravel. I am the OPERATIONS associate dude! If anyone knows what has been discussed it’s me and payroll was never discussed about being on James. We have documentation as of 11/10 never signed by the “boss” about how the payroll is structured between the two so him saying things haven’t been sent to him since September is just false.

Just needed to vent because… what even is this??? 😭

I have to keep things vague because this is ongoing and we are all collectively gathering proof, documentation, correspondence, and paperwork for all of it to help us with evidence.

Also when I called today I was told the new LLC has been established and receiving commissions since 2023 which is before when i was there or James so if my boss is putting it on THAT, James never had access to that bank account.",535,1763603668.0,antiwork,66,0.98,False

i'm not working right now and mornings are just so nice.  my brother has a bathroom where he lives that's pretty typical of most places in the world where it's sort of an open shower.  there's a drain in the middle of the floor, so you could shower on the toilet or really anywhere in there.  he's not that much older than i am but he works a lot of hours teaching kids english and is exhausted all the time.  he says showering sitting down is a necessity and i get it.  i've been exhausted before too and it's really really nice not to be so these cozy winter mornings i'm enjoying now are everything.

my brother also has a cat and he went away on vacation, asking his neighbour to look after it while he was gone.  he's been in vietnam for quite a few years now but says it's not an easy language to learn and most people don't know english.  he has a sort of clown act people respond to no matter what and i think he uses that a lot.  just being goofy and pleasant can help get your message across a lot of borders.  anyway, he was explaining to his neighbour about the litter box and how some of the bags for the waste weren't very good and would sometimes fall apart and that the other bags were better.  when he got back from his trip, he saw there were both types of bags and his neighbour told him she had tried to sort the waste accordingly.  she thought he wanted the good poops to go in the good bags and the bad poops to go in the bad bags.  so she'd been all this time trying to decide what poops would be considered good or bad.  my brother was like 'now she must think i'm psycho for sorting my cat's good and bad poops in the trash'.

We are traveling to France (from the US) for 2 weeks to visit a friend in Dijon. We'll be in Paris for about ten days, then take the train to Dijon to see our friend. We are a family of four, consisting of two adults and two 3-year-olds.

**About us:**

We travel frequently, although this is the biggest trip we've taken since having kids.

We love food, especially sweets. I love trying new foods and ethnic restaurants.

Our children are pretty easygoing for toddlers. They are pretty adaptable (within the limits of normal toddlers). I expect they will be bribable with pastries and park/playground visits.

Our itinerary includes lots of outside activity, because outdoor time is typically good for little kids. I'm doing my best to dress them very well for cold & rain. I have long underwear for them, plus a middle layer, plus a fleece layer and a weatherproof outer jacket. I got them chelsea boots, wool socks, warm hats, and waterproof mittens.

We'll also have travel strollers, which I know isn't ideal, but we have no way around this for 3-year-olds. Too big to carry, too small to walk far. We plan to use the bus over the metro when possible, since the bus is more accessible.

We are staying in an airbnb with a superhost (so hopefully reliable) in the 17th arr., 15 minute walk from Parc Monceau.

I tried to keep our itinerary light so that we'd have time to stroll around, eat at cafes, and see the sights. We hope to see some of the big attractions, but since we are traveling with little kids, we are happy to take in the magic of the city rather than try to hit all the most famous spots. This is my first time in Paris. My husband has been before.

**Wed December 24**

Land at CDG around 8:00am.

Take G7 either to lodging in the 17th if early check-in is possible, or to the 1st arr. If we can't go to lodging first, we'll use a luggage storage location to keep our bags.

Walk around La Magie de Noel Christmas Market in the afternoon +Tuileries Garden +the outside of the Louvre.

Hot chocolate at Angelina's

Pick up some groceries if possible, if anything is open.

**Thurs December 25**

Walk around, grab coffee, pastries, etc. if we can find anything open between the 17th & jardin d'Acclimation

Jardin d'Acclimatation at 10am

Maybe walk by Arc de Triomphe in the afternoon & pray that we find cafes open to feed us.

**Fri December 26**

Versailles- pre-booked 9am tickets.

Take the train from Paris, leave around 7am-7:30am. Spend the day there, eat lunch there, take an afternoon train back to Paris, find dinner in the 17th.

Hang out in the 8th arr. for the day.

Petit Palais in the morning.

Dior Museum- 3:30pm tickets pre-booked.

Galeries Lafayette Haussman- go to the rooftop for view of Eiffel Tower.

**Sun December 28**

Hang out in the 5th arr.

Jardin de Plantes in the morning

1p1qkou,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p1qkou/my_encounter_with_what_i_believe_was_the_hat_man/,My Encounter with What I Believe Was “The Hat Man”,"I was nine years old when this happened. My parents had recently divorced, and my sister and I were adjusting to a new living situation—weekdays with our mom in a small apartment, and Wednesdays and weekends with our dad. I mention this only because before the divorce, I had never experienced anything like what was about to happen.

At the time, I was terrified of the dark and had been diagnosed with night terrors. I refused to sleep alone. When I stayed at my dad’s, I always slept on the couch in the living room while he sat on the other couch, staying up until I fell asleep. He usually dozed off and went to bed around what I assume was 1 a.m., though we had no clocks or cable boxes that displayed the time.

The layout of the house was simple: a single story with a hallway leading to three bedrooms. If you stood in the hallway facing the living room, the kitchen and dining area were to the right, separated from the living room by a dividing wall. In the living room, one couch sat against the exterior wall, another against the dividing wall, with a coffee table between them and the television in the far left corner.

Almost every night, the same pattern unfolded. After the house had gone quiet and my dad had turned off the TV and gone to bed, I would wake up with a sudden, overwhelming feeling that someone was in the room—watching me.

And every time, I saw it.

In my peripheral vision, leaning against the dividing wall between the kitchen and living room, was a tall, solid black figure shaped like one of those plywood cowboy cutouts people put in their yards. He wore what looked like a fedora and always faced downward, motionless. He never changed positions. He never moved. He was simply… there.

For a nine-year-old already afraid of the dark, it was paralyzing.

Above the couch where I slept hung a stained-glass artwork—a red flower vase with curling vines, held together by twisted metal wires and suspended from a chain. For reasons I still don’t fully understand, that stained glass felt like protection. Every time I awoke and sensed the figure standing there, I stared up at the stained glass and refused to look away. I would keep my eyes fixed on it until morning light slipped through the blinds. Only then did I feel safe enough to let myself fall asleep again.

This went on for what felt like a year, though I was nine, so I’m sure it was shorter—maybe only a few months. But it always happened on Wednesdays, never on weekends.

Eventually, I became angry—not brave, just tired of being afraid. I convinced myself it had to be a shadow, maybe from a coat rack or something ordinary. One night, after waking up to find it in the same place yet again, I finally decided to confront it.

The moment I stood up and took a step toward it, the figure dissolved. It didn’t vanish suddenly—it dispersed, like smoke thinning into the air until nothing remained.

I screamed and switched on the lights, calling for my dad. I don’t remember anything else from that night. What I do remember is that after that evening, I never saw the figure again. And strangely, the stained-glass artwork was gone too. I never noticed its removal—it just wasn’t there anymore.

Fast-forward fifteen years.

I was in my dad’s attic, digging around for old snowboarding gear, when I found it—the stained glass. I had convinced myself over the years that maybe the whole experience had been imagined. But seeing that piece again hit me like ice water. I got goosebumps and couldn’t bring myself to touch it. I left the attic immediately.

Not long after, I mentioned the experience to my mom. She didn’t hesitate—she said, “Oh, you were terrified of that thing. We had to get rid of it.” She then told me something I had never known.

Apparently, when I was about four years old, the stained glass used to hang over a window in the dining room. One day, my mom walked in and found me standing in front of it, speaking to it. When she asked who I was talking to, I pointed at the stained glass and said, “The lady who made it, Mommy.”

What my mom never told me as a child was that the artist who created the piece—a close friend of hers—had passed away within a year of giving it to her.

Years later, I was randomly scrolling online when I came across a video discussing “The Hat Man,” a global phenomenon describing identical sightings: a dark human silhouette wearing a fedora, seen while dreaming, awake, or during sleep paralysis.

The description matched exactly what I had seen when I was nine.

And for the first time in years, I realized I had never truly forgotten him.",11,1763603261.0,nosleep,1,0.92,False
1p1qkcx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1qkcx,Coffee Haul from Japan & Vietnam Trip,"Finally got the new bean2cup super auto machine I had my eyes on for a while, decided to move on from manual brewing/semi-auto as I simply like the convenience of pushing a button and getting my (milk) coffee. Manual Brews are hell specially with guests.

Luckily I got VN return flight with stopover at Hanoi where I was able to grab some variety of coffee beans, I initially bought 1 pack from a shop, then found another shop with a different bag, then another shop with Luwak and so on. 

Got a pack of beans from Kyoto too which I forgot to take pic of but they were nothing special, and kind of overpriced.

  
Coffee Beans From left to right, Image 1:  
\-Luwak coffee blend  
350g - $35  
It is actually Luwak beans blend as 100% Luwak beans were $140/350g (12k inr).

\-Luwak Coffee Blend  
250g - $20  
Mr Viet seems to be a quiet popular ""brand"" of coffee beans there, highly being suggested. I liked the chocolaty-caramelly smell, unfortunately this brewed very light coffee so I had to pull double shots for a strong-bold shot I like.  
I think Luwak is to be had black or with creamer, not Milk-based.

\-100% Arabica Viet  
250g - $15  
Medium Roast (I think), currently using them and makes a really good latte/cappu. I feel this is the most ""Vietnamese coffee"" flavor I can remember from last year.

\-Arabica & Robusta Blend  
1Kg - $40  
This seems another popular Viet coffee brand, got it simply because I wanted one value for money 1KG bag to last me for a while.   
Its fragrance was kind of a better version of Araku Grand Reserve.

\-Last one I goofed up seeing BOGO for $15 and did not realize it was ground coffee and not beans, gifted them to sisters.

Cheap/fast/ long lasting meal and snack ideas?

I'm currently working construction, my diet and health in general has gotten significantly worse in the last year for multiple reasons. Not really sure how to effectively get myself out of the hole Ive dug. 
I don't sleep well, and so, rarely eat in the mornings, most often grab fast food for lunch (if its unavailable or I cant afford it, I just skip lunch) and again, fast food for dinner or nothing. Maybe a can of sardines once every couple days, a bagged salad here and there.  Not surprisingly, I've been having ice pick headaches for a few months, dizzy and light headed often, not thinking clearly (in such a way I know its related) and I know I have to fix my diet, badly, Ive just been so easily overwhelmed and self destructive lately, I dont know how to find solutions that I can stick to.
I have a toaster oven and a single burner hot plate, no stove. Not always able to warm things up at work. I know if I buy ingredients to make frozen breakfast burritos or meals for a week, things I used to do, I won't get to it. But I'm convinced if I can manage to get on the right track, a lot of the depression/insomnia/ brain fog/irritability will get better. I have money for food, spend it on fast food when I shouldn't, but I don't have a significant amount to be able to get groceries for a week or a ton of different ingredients, not yet anyway. I could really use some advice or suggestions to get somewhere with this, the only things I have gone back to for ease and price; 
canned sardines because protein and they last forever, I can keep them in my car all the time. 
Peanut butter and crackers (I honestly hate pb and dont really eat these unless Im starving so kinda pointless)
I used to keep a jar of nuts around but kinda on the expensive side for now....
So tired of drinking water (but I dont really) but again, dehydration has got to be contributing to everything, I recently (few months ago, went from drinking 7-14 shots/mixed drinks a day,  to not drinking more than 1-2 drinks every few weeks.. Never really cared for sugary drinks until I quit drinking alcohol and now thats all I've really had, (sonic slushes, tea and lemonade, monster, redbull, iced coffee) other than the occasional water I have to force. 
Sorry for the long, confusing request, idk if its the best place to ask, I'm just desperate for help really before I keep making it worse for myself",1,1763603178.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

When Jay takes off — “I’m in a place in my life now where I’m good. I very much value my alone time. Sometimes it’s good to just hang out at home by yourself. If you want to eat frozen pizza for 3 days in a row, you can do that!” Would never ever tell him to not travel. Would be more difficult for her if Bella were not there, it’s an added “thing” she has to do. Complains about taking care of her 🙄🙄🙄

One of the worst things in the entire world for her is that Disney is closing down her favorite rides. HUGE CRAZY RANT!

Multiple people asking for merch

She made a bunch of the 3D bats for the wall out of cardboard before they were popular and has never used them

Teases doing another tarot video, that’s never gonna happen

The only thing she misses about working in an office is decorating her desk. 😂 can you imagine how wild she went in her cubicle. “I got a lot of attention at work because of that” Recalls at a previous job, she was putting up tombstones on people’s desks and someone returned it to her and said “I don’t celebrate Halloween” and this apparently scarred Cris for life.

I’m new to this group, and I recently started my first LDR — just 4 days ago — with a guy I met during my trip to the Netherlands back in September.

September – How We Met
We matched on Tinder and connected really quickly. On our first date in Amsterdam, we grabbed coffee, walked along the canals, and ended up in a cozy bar for beers. We couldn’t stop laughing or talking,  I had butterflies the entire time!
The next day, we went to a concert, had great food, danced, sang… honestly, best date ever. It all felt so natural that I invited him to my Airbnb, and the connection just grew stronger.
On my last day, we talked and decided to stay in touch.

November – Trip #2
Fast forward to November , I planned a quick 4-day trip back to the NL (thank goodness for Delta miles lol). This visit was even better. He planned something fun every single day: festivals, seeing Sinterklaas, trying new food, visiting farms with horses and sheep (I love animals!), and… I even met his mom.
During this trip, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and we made it official.

Now – LDR Begins
I’m back in the US now, and I miss him like crazy. But I’m also starting to worry. He has kids, I don’t, and I’ve never done a long-distance relationship before. I’m wondering if we’re moving too quickly and what to expect or that we might not be able to deal with the time difference (6 hours) or distance. How can we make it work?

I can’t stay silent about what happened to my colleagues.","As a kid, I liked dissecting frogs a little too much, studying their insides, organs, and seeing how everything worked. 

That obsession carried me through college and med school and brought me here, standing over a patient, sweating and hating myself, regretting my life choices, and ultimately failing to remember everything I had been taught.

“Dr. Marks, we are waiting.”

Dr. Allison Marriott had blonde hair pinned back in a ponytail. 

She wiggled her monobrow, and I liked to imagine it came to life when she slept and crawled off her face. Mid-thirties, with deep frown lines around her lips and eyes. 

“Dr. Marks,” she barked, her tone sharp and commanding. “In front of you is a 16yo female patient complaining of abdominal pain. What do you suspect is wrong?”

The girl in question stared down at her hands. Blushing cheeks, raised heartbeat, unable to sit still. Her mother sat beside her bed, overbearing, by the look on the teen’s face. Helicopter parents were a nightmare. This wasn’t going to end well. 

Ryan, the R1 breathing down my neck, shot me a knowing look behind his clipboard. 

Dr. Marriott was temperamental.

Today, I just happened to be her target. 

“Well,” I cleared my throat, choosing my words carefully. The girl was a minor, so I glanced at her mother instead. 

A week earlier, a woman had mistook me saying “she’s grossly dilated” as being rude. 

Mothers were walking landmines. 

“First I’d get a full history and examine her. I would suspect appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or a possible ectopic pregnancy as urgent causes.” 

I eyed the mother again. 

“I’d also consider urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, or menstrual-related pain, depending on her symptoms. Check vital signs, do a full abdominal exam, and order a pregnancy test.”

“Pregnancy test?” The woman’s voice collapsed into a shriek, and I resisted rolling my eyes. 

Her eyes fell on me like I was the one who knocked up her teenage daughter.

Unsurprisingly, Allison just shrugged, so I had to explain myself. 

I settled the mother with a patient smile. 

Two cups of lukewarm coffee and three hours of sleep wasn't enough to foster empathy. 

“It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Matthews,” I said gently. “A pregnancy test helps us rule out abnormalities.”

The woman's face turned three shades of pale, and I excused myself before I could start acting human. 

Patients expect a robot; an empty, soulless and smiling robot that will tell them everything is sunshine and rainbows. I couldn't be that. 

Abdominal issues, especially in teenage girls, always warrant a routine pregnancy test to rule out anything serious. 

So yes, while I had been correct in my approach, I was “heartless”, according to the other R1’s. 

Allison took delight in reminding me, just three inches from my face, that my most important duties as a doctor was to avoid frightening the patient. 

As a first-year residential student, Allison was basically my mother. 

The day after her lecture, Allison’s expression was unusually perky for 8am, a bounce in her step, a smile on her face, and smelling of stale coffee. 

Allison always turned her nose up when I pulled out a cigarette and lectured me about healthy choices.

Usually while demolishing her third candy bar of the day. 

She knew everything, obviously. 

If I asked questions, I was uneducated. 

If I didn’t ask questions, I was ignorant and endangering patients. 

There was no winning.

“You’re being transferred,” Allison said, like she had personally fired me. 

She handed over a stack of crumpled papers. “Effective immediately, you’re being transferred to…” She didn’t bother elaborating. 

“The city,” Allison said instead of giving me the name. 

I would later find out it was Royal Blue Hospital, and I would be working on the maternity ward. 

There was no goodbye or good luck. 

I was expected to hand in my scrubs and my pager and leave the premises.

It felt a lot like getting fired. But the polite version. I considered protesting, but in this line of work, I had learned to keep my mouth shut and obey. It was better to keep my head down and grin and bear it. 

Finish my residency. 

Become another cog in the machine I already resented. Another hospital. 

Another set of bitchy nurses pretending I couldn’t hear them trash-talking patients. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say the worst person you know in high school will end up becoming a nurse.

The new place was impressive, modern and minimalist, towering over downtown with its checkerboard windows. 

The maternity ward had a built-in swimming pool. The automatic doors actually worked, unlike the ones that broke every five minutes at my old workplace. 

On my first day, I was told I would be lonely.

“Lonely?” I couldn't help questioning my colleagues, who only shot each other cryptic glances. They were nice enough. 

I received obligatory greetings that seemed too practised. 

Almost like each had been meticulously rehearsed. 

“It’s different this year,” one of the second-years told me as I dumped my stuff in my locker. 

His name was Dr. Harley, a surgeon several years older, with a thick four o’clock shadow and dark circles under his eyes. 

He clapped me on the shoulder with a grin, straightened his scrubs, and slipped on his lanyard, giving himself a quick once-over in the mirror. 

“Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. It just takes some time to get used to.” 

As he brushed past me, his breath fluttered my ear. “Believe it or not, this place is actually *haunted*.” 

When I walked into the residential lounge for my first meeting, I expected an empty room—or worse, to be outcast. 

But I was pleasantly surprised.

An empty box of sushi hit me squarely in the face upon opening the door, and I came to an unsure halt. 

It felt like walking into a game. 

A woman was halfway across the room, mid-yell and laughing, while the offender stood on a Craigslist couch, brandishing an empty soda can like a weapon. 

Another guy rolled his eyes behind a book, unimpressed. 

The thrower, a fuzzy redhead, crossed the room in a single stride.

“Time out!” he shouted, glaring at the woman. Then his eyes landed on me. 

“Yooo, we’ve got a newbie,” he announced, reaching for my hand. His fingers were refreshingly cool. “Sup! I’m Dr. Matthews, but call me Will.”

He pointed to the others. “That’s Dr. Carlisle and Dr. Faraway.”

The girl shot me a grin, dropping the sushi lid. “There’s no need for formalities,” she said, her smile bright. She reminded me of a human golden retriever, with long brown hair and wide eyes, no dark circles, not even a hint of exhaustion. 

“Just Olivia is fine,” she trilled, “Hey there!”

“Jake,” the other R1 muttered. A freckled blond with a ponytail and his feet propped on the table. 

He didn’t even glance up from his notes. I’d already pegged him as the smart-ass. “Welcome to Hell.”

A senior official stepped in, taking in the chaos of the room. 

His eyes locked on me despite the over two very clearly in battle mode. 

“Dr. Marks,” an older man with greying hair and crumbs in his beard, introduced himself as Dr. Lan, arms crossed. 

He didn’t bother looking at the others; he probably didn’t need to. “Let’s keep things professional.” 

He nodded at me to toss the sushi tray. “You’re in the workplace now,” he said. “Act like it.”

“You’re in the *workplace* now,” Will mimicked under his breath, exaggerating Dr. Lan’s Southern drawl. Jake smirked, and Olivia ducked her head, giggling behind her notes. These three were a riot.

Dr. Lan’s gaze suddenly shot to Will, his expression twisting, eyes narrowing. 

Maybe the sun was in his eyes. Will was standing directly in front of the window. 
“Is something *funny*, Dr. Matthews?”

Jake’s eyes widened, his gaze snapping to our superior. “What?” 

Dr. Lan wasn’t messing around. “Perhaps you want to share your hilarious joke with the rest of us?”

Will ducked his head, hugging his arms around himself. “I apologize, Dr. Lan. I acted unprofessionally.”

“Will—” Jake hissed, but Will jabbed him in the gut. Olivia shot him a death glare.

I detected some kind of rebellion against our superiors. 

Not something I’d expect in a workplace. 

These people were in their late twenties. This wasn’t high school. 

Dr. Lan’s gaze lingered on the two of them for a moment before he twisted and yanked open the door. He didn’t scold, but he didn’t need to. His expression said it all. 

“Dr. Marks, please follow me.” 

I found myself nodding and falling in step. 

“Don’t expect me to wait. Stay by my side and do not ask stupid questions, and I will tolerate you. You will be working on the paediatric ward with me today.”  

I followed him out of the residential lounge, the other R1s joining in step. 

My morning went just as I thought. I was expected to observe. 

The four of us stood around a child propped up on pillows in the paediatric ward. “Dr. Marks,” Dr. Lan called on me, of course.  “how would you manage mild dehydration in this two-year-old patient?”

Next to me, Will spoke up. He was surprisingly intelligent, considering his antics. “Uh, well, first I’d start with a 20 ml isotonic saline bolus, then reassess, and continue oral rehydration once stable.”

Lan ignored him. “Dr. Marks. I ask you a question, I expect you to answer it.”

I panicked and blurted Will’s response in a string of word vomit I immediately tried to swallow. “20 ml of isotonic bolus and reassess until stable.” 

Dr. Lan folded his arms. “Good. And if the patient’s condition deteriorates?” 

“Evaluate for underlying causes and conduct frequent assessment of urine output,” Olivia stated, lifting her head. 

I noticed Olivia had a little quirk: she tightened her ponytail whenever she answered a question. 

Will, on the other hand, fidgeted constantly, playing with his pen, or twirling a single strand of his hair.  

Jake was stiff. Robotic. Cool as a cucumber.

“If they’re deteriorating, I’d escalate care,” he added. 

His response was to-the-point, his gangly sandy blonde frame partially hidden behind Olivia. “I’d reassess immediately, repeat fluids if needed, and escalate to ICU support if they don’t improve.”

“Dr. Marks,” Lan barked. “What is required if the patient’s condition worsens?” 

Why was I the only one being lectured?

I flailed, catching Jake’s smirk. He was enjoying this. Being ignored. Something about it thrilled him. 

“Urine output,” I panicked, clearing my throat. “Monitor urine output, evaluate underlying causes, and repeat fluids.”

It was obvious I was just parroting my colleagues. 

But Dr. Lan didn’t even raise an eyebrow. “Correct.”

Will nudged me with a grin when we moved to the next patient.  “Someone’s popular!” 

“Dr. Lan,” one of our patients, a seven-year-old with cystic fibrosis, looked up from his DS. “Will is a good doctor,” he pulled a face. “Why do you keep ignoring him?”

Will strode over to the kid, ruffling his hair. “Ignore Dr. Lan,” he teased. “He’s got favorites.""

By the end of the day, the other three fully abandoned me to all duties. I had watched three deliveries and witnessed an infant’s death. 

A teenage girl was rushed in and gave birth to twins before bleeding out on the surgical bed. She was fifteen. I was the one who broke it to her father.

I was alone, exhausted, frustrated, every muscle aching, with no one to help. 

I paged Will over and over, but his pager didn’t go through. 

Olivia and Jake were nowhere to be found. 

Dr. Harley brought me coffee on our way down to surgery. 

“Have you seen Dr. Matthews?” I asked him, burning my tongue when I gulped it down. “I can't page him.”

“Matthews?” He frowned. His expression slackened. “Shouldn't you know that?”

“It's my first day,” I smiled through a grimace. “I barely know him.” 

Dr. Harley dumped his own coffee. “Upstairs,” he said. His tone hardened. “Focus, Dr. Marks.” 

By midnight, I was running on autopilot, the ward overflowing, with maybe five minutes to spare.

I crashed into the residential lounge hoping to finish the sandwich I left on the table. The light flickered on and I almost jumped out of my skin. 

Will was cross-legged on his laptop. 

Olivia was snoozing on the temporary bed they had set up, and Jake sat staring into oblivion. 

“Yooo, newbie.” Will looked up from his laptop, grinning. “How was your first day?”

“Where were you?” I demanded. “You’ve been MIA all night, leaving me to handle everything!” 

Will’s smile bled away. His gaze dropped. “Busy,” he said.

“Busy?” I shot back. I slumped into a chair, eyeing the sandwich. I gave it an experimental sniff and stuffed it in my mouth. “You’ve been slacking off.”

“Grace,” Jake muttered, shooting me a glare. “Shut up. You have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My blood boiled. I spat out the sandwich. “What?”

“We can’t go onto certain wards,” Olivia mumbled into her pillow, rolling over. “We’re not allowed.”

I laughed, even though I knew I shouldn’t. “You’re not serious.” My head spun as I stepped forward. 

I fought back a screech, but the words burst out anyway, bubbling on my tongue like soda pop. “You can’t just leave me to handle everything alone!”

Olivia was sitting up now, legs swinging off the bed. She swiped at her eyes. Was she actually crying?

I turned to Jake. He seemed like the only one with any backbone. 

“Were you in here this whole time?” I gestured toward Will, who slammed the laptop shut, looking suddenly sheepish. 

“I’ve been downstairs watching children bleed out in front of me, and you’ve been up here playing Minecraft?”

Jake stood up, hands in his pockets, and strode over, stopping just three inches from my face.

“Grace,” he said quietly, his voice dropping into a low growl. “You’ve crossed the line.”

“Is it connections?” I demanded, breathless. I knew I was crossing a line, going way too far, but I couldn’t stay calm and emotionless any longer. 

I was too fucking human to be a nurse. I couldn’t just smile, grin, and bear it. 

“You’re rich kids with powerful parents. You don’t have to play by the rules. Is that why I can’t even talk about you?”

I couldn’t resist a bitter laugh as I stepped closer. 

Jake’s breath brushed my cheek, but he didn’t back down. His eyes narrowed.

 “Like I said,” he grunted. “You have no idea what you’re talking about, Grace.”

“You three think you own this hospital,” I spat. “It’s all a power play. You’ve got connections that let you get away with murder, slack off, and play your little games, while I’m left holding the pieces! You snap your fingers, and the higher-ups roll over. Is that it? What are you, nepo babies?”

Jake folded his arms over his scrubs. “So what if we *are*?” He stepped closer, teasing his proximity. 

“What if we *are* abusing our positions and terrorizing our colleagues?” His lips curled into a smirk. “What exactly are you going to do about it?”

“Jake.” Will’s voice cut through me, cold, like splintered glass. 

His frenzied eyes found mine, a and a sliver of ice trickled down my spine. 

“We’re not nepo babies,” he looked away. “It’s… complicated.”

“Complicated.” I repeated. I turned to Olivia, who was silent, staring down at her lap. “Then explain! Tell me why you disappeared for nine hours—”

I didn’t realize I was shouting until the door opened and Dr. Lan stepped inside. 

He was holding a small bag, swinging it between his fingers. 

“Dr. Marks,” he said sharply, but his expression immediately softened. 

He sighed, and instead of scolding me, he motioned for me to follow. 

“Come with me.” 

“Dr Lan,” I managed to choke out. “The others—”

“Now.” 

The trio trailed behind as I was led on a walk of shame. 

Dr. Lan didn’t take me to his office. Instead, he stepped into an elevator and motioned for us to follow. Olivia hesitated, stepping back, but Jake tugged her inside. “I don’t understand,” I whispered as Dr. Lan led me down a long, winding corridor. 

It was too quiet. My steps felt heavy, my breath shallow, as we passed through a swinging door and into the sharp smell of antiseptic.

Soft, rhythmic beeps sliced through an otherwise silent ward. 

I looked at Dr. Lan for some kind of direction, but to my surprise, he wasn't there for work purposes. 

He produced a bouquet of flowers from the bag and strode towards the patient on the far side of the room. My gaze dropped to the patients.

One of them made my heart lurch. I felt myself unravel, coming apart, body, mind and soul at once until I couldn't breathe, until every breath felt forced, my lungs fighting for oxygen. I sensed my body falling, my knees hitting ice cold porcelain.

But I was still standing, legs wobbling, stomach twisting. 

Will.

He lay there, hooked up to monitors, surrounded by a mix of fresh and rotting flowers. His eyes were closed, his skin sickly pale. 

I felt myself backing away instinctively. There was no escape. 

The walls pressed in, too clinical, too white, too wrong. This couldn’t be real. My hands ripped at my ponytail. 

I spent the whole day with them. 

I talked to them. 

Olivia lay on his left, a halo of dark curls spilling across the pillows. 

Jake’s face was covered beneath a plastic mask.

Dr. Lan hovered over Will, checking his vitals and gently fluffing his hair.

“Our R1s were in a serious accident a few months ago,” he said quietly. 

“While transferring a patient to another hospital, there was a crash. We thought they might survive, but over the last few weeks, we had to induce a coma. They were declared brain dead yesterday.""

He moved slowly to Will’s bed, arranging flowers beside him, then to Jake’s, picking up get-well cards and reading each carefully. 

“William was the only doctor who questioned me,” he murmured, smiling at the empty space where Will stood beside me. 

“Olivia was a wonderful nurse. That girl would have gone far in medicine.” 

I pretended not to hear Olivia sniffling behind me.

“And Jacob,” Dr. Lan finished. Jake’s eyes flicked to me, mouth curving into a scowl. 

I was certain he hadn't forgotten the nepo baby comment. “An old soul trapped in a young body. Book smart and popular with female patients.”

Lan sighed. “We will be taking them off oxygen soon,” he said, his voice slipping back into professional calm. Then he met my eyes. “I believe they are at their end, holding on.”

“That’s a lie,” Jake snapped, the words slicing through the fragile calm. He slumped beside his own body, glaring at the doctor. “He can definitely see us.”

“He obviously can’t,” Olivia said, wiping at her red, swollen eyes. “Dr. Lan looks right through us.”

Will didn’t answer. He kept casting uneasy glances at his motionless body.

“Dr. Lan,” I whispered.

My voice broke on the last word, sharp and humiliating.

Too human. I barely registered that I was staring at empty air, speaking to empty air. 

I had been talking to my imagination all day. A sour burn crawled up my throat. “I need to go to the bathroom.”

Dr. Lan’s eyes lingered on Will’s body. “Go ahead.”

Will stepped in front of me. “Grace,” he said.

I shook my head. “I need to get out of here.”

“We were waiting for your shift to end,” he whispered. “We didn’t expect Dr. Lan to show up.”

I shoved past him. He felt physical, warm, real. His skin was clammy. 

His coat was real, brushing my fingertips. 

How had I missed the warning signs? 

How could I have been so stupid, so careless?

“Get away from me,” I choked out, then remembered he wasn’t actually there. “I’m okay. I just need air.”

“Dr. Marks.” Dr. Lan’s voice startled me. “Please keep this confidential for the time being. The only ones who know are the family and hospital staff.”

“What?” Will strode over, standing directly in front of him.  “What does that mean?”

*“It means our deaths weren't an accident,” Jake spoke up.

*“Can you not say that?” Olivia squeaked. “He said it was a crash!” 

I barely registered the trio’s conversation as it bounced around me, collapsing into white noise.

With permission, I staggered out of the ward, my head spinning. 

I barely reached the girls’ bathroom before collapsing to my knees, my forehead thudding against the ice-cold toilet seat as vomit-tasting sobs racked my chest. 

By the time my stomach was empty, I was shaking with exhaustion.

I was going crazy.

“And you thought we were *nepo babies*.”

The voice froze my blood. The flash of light blue scrubs was unmistakable. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a familiar figure sitting with his knees pulled to his chest, arms wrapped around them. 

Dr. Jake Faraway. 

Mr. Dead the whole time. 

I didn’t turn around. My hands clung to the toilet seat, my breath coming out in a shaky rush. 

Guilt was already tearing me apart from screaming at him earlier. 

His ghost showing up in the girls’ bathroom to hammer it in was just cruel.  

“I didn’t know,” I managed, my voice catching, choking on bile making its reappearance. “I’m sorry.”

“Don't flatter yourself. I didn’t follow you for an apology,” he muttered into his knees. 

“So, you've come to gloat,” the words spewed from my mouth before I could stop them.

He laughed. “About what? Being dead? You couldn’t have known. When I first woke up, I didn’t realize anything was wrong. Not until I tried to go home and bam—I was smack back in the hospital.” 

Jake shot me a rare smile. “I like to think the residential lounge is like our respawning point.” 

“You didn’t see your body?” I asked.

He exhaled. “Nope. But there was a lot happening on the ICU ward. I figured we had critical patients.”

“Who were…” I swallowed my words.

Jake sighed, nuzzling into his knees and turning his head to look at me. He offered a sickly smile. 

“Imagine my shock when I follow my colleagues to see what the hell is going on, and I see my own dumbass getting cardiopulmonary resuscitation.”

His expression twisted, and for a moment, I thought he might show real emotion, brows furrowing, lip curling, like he was about to cry but had trained himself not to. 

Jake was good at suppressing it. 

Unlike me, he could hide his humanity. 

The perfect doctor. 

“They brought me in first,” he said, closing his eyes. “Then Will and Olivia, who were in pretty bad shape. I found them in the resident lounge, and they thought I was messing around. I was like, no man, seriously, you are literally getting life-saving surgery downstairs.”

“They didn’t believe you,” I said.

He groaned, tilting his head back, eyes scanning the ceiling. “Would you?” 

His gaze flicked to me. “Imagine if we told you when you first came in. ‘Hi, Grace! Nice to meet you! By the way, we’re actually comatose upstairs, and you’re talking to our ghosts!’”

Nausea curled deep in my gut. 

I turned away, rested my head against the toilet seat, and squeezed my eyes shut. “Why *did* you follow me?”

“I lied.” I could hear the smirk in his voice. “I was fishing for an apology.”

“Asshole,” I muttered.

“In my defence, you did call us nepo babies,” he said. 

I swallowed my argument. “We’re in a hospital, so there has to be more like you.” I choked into ice-cold porcelain. “Are there others on… that side?”

Jake didn't reply for a moment. “Kids, mainly.”

“Kids?” 

“Yeah,” he mumbled into his knees. “The pediatric ward is full of them. Kids who have nowhere to go. Will keeps them company. That’s where he was.”

“But I didn’t see him—”

He cut me off. “You won’t see us all the time. You act like it’s our fault when we slip past your perception. We were in the pediatric ward all day. We saw the girl die, and we couldn’t help you.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, instead of calling myself out.

He groaned. “You apologize a lot. Seriously. Stop doing that.”

I held my breath. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Shoot.”

“Do you think you’ll stay?” I whispered. “When they switch off your oxygen.”

He didn’t respond. The stall suddenly felt cavernous. Lonely.

When I finally risked a glance around, Dr. Jake Faraway had disappeared.

***

I was half expecting the residents’ lounge to be empty when I crashed into it during a quiet period. 

“Hi,” I said to the empty room. “I'm sorry about earlier.” 

Ghosts were never quiet. They were just more annoying humans. 

Will was back at the table, greeting me with an over-the-top grin. This guy didn't know subtlety.

His messy red curls still threw me off, unless he’d looked like that when he died. 

His white coat was thrown over pale blue scrubs. 

I wondered why he was still wearing his work clothes. Olivia was sprawled across the couch, and Jake sat cross-legged on the floor like he was meditating.

I shut the door so I wouldn’t appear crazy.

I had a lot of questions.

After finding out my colleagues weren’t just dead but upstairs clinging to life, I’d freaked out at them like it was somehow their fault. 

If I wanted answers before I lost them for good, now was the time. 

I dropped into a seat at the table, pointedly ignoring Olivia, who was hanging upside down on the couch like a bored bat. 

“So, you guys are actually brain-dead upstairs, and you're stuck in the hospital you worked at,” I said.

“Basically!” Will shot me a grin. “I don’t believe in paranormal crap, and there’s no scientific explanation except one vague, hypothetical theory. Pure conjecture.” 

He propped his chin on his fist. 

“Sooooo, back in 2008, there was this case where a woman claimed she was in a coma but could walk around her ward and talk to other coma patients.” 

His eyes met mine, lips pricking. “So maybe when we died, our consciousness sort of jumped out of our bodies. Like a projection. And that's what we are.”

“Will.” Jake cracked one eye open, exasperated. “We’re not projections. You're an idiot.” 

Dr. Jake Faraway was the younger, long suffering, and apparently deader House.

His permanent frown lines and narrowed eyes made him a real joy to be around. 

Twenty-eight years old with the personality of a boomer. Will was sunshine and theories, Jake was cold logic. Olivia was the depressed glue holding them together.

“We’re ghosts,” Jake said flatly. The words curled on his tongue bubbled with finality. 

“There's no other explanation. We're dead. We’re not coming back. When they turn us off upstairs, we will die.”

Will rolled his eyes. “You don't know that. What if we wake up?”

Jake smacked him playfully over the head. “What part of *brain-dead* do you not understand?”

It sounded like a debate they had had a hundred times before.

Jake exhaled, eyes closing again, like Will wasn't a colleague but a child. 

He shifted onto his butt.  “Ignore him. His amnesia is making him optimistic.”

“Amnesia?” I asked, wandering to the fridge. Inside were beer, water, and expired pasta. 

I grabbed an orange instead and dropped back into my seat. My pager buzzed again. 

I ignored it, popping a slice into my mouth. “So you can’t remember how you died.” 

Jake abandoned his meditation and joined us, this time sitting on the table.

“None of us can,” Jake said. “Just what Dr. Lan told you. That we were transporting a patient.” 

He tilted his head. “Which is strange, because R1s usually don’t get that responsibility. It doesn’t make sense they would trust first-years with transportation.”

Olivia appeared in the chair opposite me, a blur of dark curls and smeared eyeliner. 

She gave me a faint smile, her eyes frantically following my hands as I peeled the orange. Did ghosts get hungry?

I offered her a piece, and she almost took it before shooting me a sheepish smile.

I slipped another piece of orange into my mouth.

“They didn’t even tell me about your accident. I had to find out for myself.” I glanced at Will, who avoided my gaze. 

“You guys had me talking to myself and didn’t mention anything until I saw your---” I refused to say bodies, “your real selves.”

Jake nodded, chin on fist. “That’s a good question. Why didn’t the hospital report it?”

Will rocked in his seat, head tilted back. “That's sus, right? Why didn't they tell anyone else?” 

He suddenly jerked upright with a hiss. “Fuck. This isn’t a Ghost situation, is it? Is that why we’re here?""

""Do we have to remember the accident to come to terms with our deaths, and then we step into a bright light and fade away to Whitney Houston?” 

Jake groaned, burying his face in his arms. “You're driving me insane.” 

“Maybe I don’t want to move on.” 

Will’s lip jutted into a pout. “If this is all easily explained, then when they switch off our oxygen, we’ll just disappear and just like, not exist,” he said, shuddering, “forever.”

“What if we weren’t transporting a patient?” Jake said abruptly, his head snapping up. 

He slammed his fist on the desk. Will almost flew out of his chair and Olivia shot him a glare. 

Will leaned across the table, pressing a finger gently between his eyes. “Explain, Jacob.”

Jake’s gaze flicked to him, clinical, sharp, and strangely alive with both excitement and fear. “What else do we transport that’s not patients?”

I knew the answer before Will could open his mouth. 

Something, like a spider’s leg, crawled down my spine. 

“Organs,” I said to an empty table. 

I had been staring at Olivia’s wide, searching eyes, her parted lips looking for an answer. 

Then, without a word, she flashed out of existence. 

I shook my head, blinking rapidly. I turned to the others, meeting dead air. 

The three of them were gone.

My pager buzzed: Code Blue. Floor 3. ICU. 

My stomach dropped, adrenaline spiking, muscles tensing for fight or flight. 

I could hear the soft patter of nurses rushing by, alarms shrieking from upstairs, but I couldn’t move. The door slammed open. Dr. Harley’s head appeared. “Dr. Marks, we need you in the ICU. Code Blue.”

I followed him, tripping over myself as we dashed up the stairs.

There was already a congregation of staff outside the closed door. “It’s our R1s,” Dr. Harley told me, pushing through the crowd. 

“They’ve flatlined.” His voice splintered. “We’re doing everything we can, but it’s serious.”

I stopped dead. Somehow, I reached out and grabbed him, yanking him back.

“They’re brain dead,” I whispered. “If you declared them brain dead, why are you trying to save them?”

“She’s right.” Jake appeared in front of him, arms folded, a faint, feathered glow outlining him. 

Jake stepped close, until the two were nose to nose. “We’re brain dead.” He stated. “Why *are* you trying to save us?” 

Dr. Harley turned to me, lips curling into a practiced smile. 

He yanked me away from the crowd, his fingernails digging into my skin. 

“Stop talking,” he hissed under his breath. 

“Do your job, and keep your mouth shut.” His eyes were hollow, like staring into twin stars. “Do you understand me?”

""Yes,"" I whispered, ignoring the ghost's rolled eyes.

“Stay here,” Dr. Harley snapped at me, shoving me back before forcing his way into the room.

Jake stayed with me, avoiding my gaze. 

He stared down at his feet for way too long, before it hit me. He was dead.

“Will and Olivia?” I spoke under my breath.

He exhaled. “Saying goodbye to their parents.

He slumped to the floor, his sigh breaking into another sob. 

Jake surprised me with a wet, shaky sob. “Do you know what my biggest first-world problem was before I died?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 

“I liked someone who didn’t like me back,"" Jake hummed, smiling. ""And for a moment I actually wished I were fucking dead.” 

I didn't expect him to break.

It was real vulnerability, real emotion. Pulling his knees to his chest, Jake hid his face. “My dad’s not coming, and my mom only agreed to take me off oxygen so she could fly back to Australia. Will and Olivia died with their families around them.” 

He gave a sharp, humorless laugh. “I died alone.”

I sank down beside him, fighting the urge to give an awkward pat to the air between us.

“Then why…” I started, trailing off. 

“Why are we still here?” He let his head flop onto my shoulder. Jake was comfortably warm. “Beats me.”

The two of us sat in peaceful silence, and I revelled in his ability to accept the inevitable. Dr. Harley stepped out of the room eventually, his eyes visibly red.

“Crocodile tears,” Jake muttered.

“Dr. Matthews, Faraway, and Carlisle have passed,” he said quietly. “They’ve called it.”

I stepped into the room, and Jake followed reluctantly, sticking close to my side. 

Will and Olivia stood by their empty beds, arms wrapped tightly around each other. 

After a moment, Jake moved toward them, slowly, like he was fighting against his own emotions, before he gave in, pulling the two into a hug and burying his head in Will’s chest.

My legs somehow worked, and I stepped outside.

I figured I would leave them alone. 

They were going to disappear soon, and I was not ready for that kind of goodbye. 

I barely knew them, yet somehow they felt closer than friends. 

Their presence had been better than that of any colleague I had at my old job. 

I went back to work, ignoring whispers among the patients of the R1's deaths. 

I glimpsed Will sitting with one of the cancer patients, a terminally ill five-year-old. 

The child was talking animatedly, and Will had a book open on his lap. He shot me a grin, and I managed one back.

“Have you seen Liv?” He called over, turning a page.

Instead of responding, I shook my head. 

My night shift flew by, and before I knew it, the sun was rising. 

Which was crazy because I felt like I'd lived a lifetime. 

Two surgeries and three kids almost flatlining. 

Will flashed in and out of my perception. 

Sometimes he was doing cartwheels to make the little kids laugh, and then he was nowhere to be seen, leaving his little fans restless. 

By the time I dived onto the temporary bed in the residents lounge, I was ready to sleep and never wake up.

“Hey.” 

Someone had other plans, a certain ghost hovering over me with boundary issues.

His breath prickled the back of my neck. 

I didn’t move, burying my head in warm pillows. “Go away.”

“Grace,” Jake prodded my cheek.

I hissed, pulling the blankets over myself. “Can you take your paranormal melodrama somewhere else and let me *sleep*?”

He withdrew his finger. “Someone’s cranky.”

“I’ve been up all night,” I mumbled. “Why are you still here?”

Jake sighed and, to my surprise, flopped down beside me. “No idea. Will seems pretty happy we’re not fading away. He’s spending time with the kids.”

“And you?” My eyes were already drooping, but  my heart was flipping over in my chest. Jake’s expression was surprisingly soft. And I wasn't used to soft.  

His half lidded eyes held mine and he shifted closer. So close, I could count each individual freckle on his nose. “What are you going to do?”

Jake froze when we were nose to nose, before rolling into his back. “Oh. Yeah, no. I'm not into that.” 

I retracted, a wave of heat spreading across my cheeks. “Into what?”

His lips curved into an uncharacteristic grin. “You seriously want to fuck a ghost?” He raised an eyebrow. “Is that even anatomically possible?” 

Jake’s gaze drifted to the ceiling. “If I were alive, yeah, I’d probably have shameless sex with someone I’ve known for barely a day. Sure.” His lips twisted into a smirk. 

“Hell, I’d probably cheat after a few days and fuck an older nurse anyway.”

“Can I ask you a question?” I asked. 

His smile was unexpectedly warm. “Sure.” 

“Before you died,” I said. “Did you often get punched in the face?” 

Jake didn't seem to find the funny side, and curled up. “I’m going to sleep. I don’t feel great.”

His words jolted me to a sitting position. “Meaning?”

“Meaning I don’t feel great,” he groaned. “What else?”

Then he sat up suddenly, eyes blinking open. “Where’s Olivia?” 

“Dr. Marks.”

I hadn’t realized the door was open. My head snapped towards the threshold. Dr. Harley stood looking bewildered. His eyes were still noticeably red from crying. “Who are you talking to?”

Jake shot me a sidelong glance. “Connor’s going to tell everyone you see dead people,” he muttered. 

“I remember when I started, he claimed I left a scalpel inside a patient. I had to prove I wasn’t incompetent. I almost lost my job.” His eyes narrowed. “He bullied Will for weeks just for calling him out during surgery. Don’t trust this asshole.” 

“Grace,” Dr. Harley said, his brows furrowed. He noticed me tossing glances at the empty space next to me. “Are you doing okay?”

While I fumbled for an excuse, the man sighed. “Go home. It’s been a long shift. Get some rest, all right?” 

His gaze lingered on the spot where Jake sat before he turned off the light and left the room.

“Olivia,” Jake said, diving off the bed. “Where is she?”

I followed him out the door—or through the door—in his case. “I haven’t seen her since you guys—”

Jake’s pace quickened, his doctor’s coat swishing behind him.

Dr. Jacob Faraway wasn’t dodging the House allegations.

“Since we flatlined,” he said, passing straight through a patient. “So, she’s moved on? Seen the light?”

I passed a nurse who gave me a tired smile. I nodded back and reminded myself to keep my voice low. “So, where exactly are we going?” I whispered.

Jake broke into a run. “She’s probably with her body.”

We took the stairs down to the morgue, slipping through the door. 

I had to steady myself before stepping inside. 

I was a nurse. 

I knew bodies, insides, the wiggly bits of human anatomy. 

What I didn’t know was how to grieve. How to come face to face with their bodies. 

I froze on the threshold as Jake staggered back, his eyes wide and wild. 

Jake dropped to his knees, heaving. 

“Don’t.” He wiped his mouth. “Don’t fucking go in there.” His voice broke around the words, and something cold, something slimy, slid down my spine. “Please.”

Ignoring him, I pushed my way in.

Blinding light slammed into my eyes. 

A surgical table. Metal instruments gleaming. Several masked doctors clustered around a body. 

I saw the limp hand, the restraints pinning down the limbs, the halo of dark brown curls spread across the clinical silver. 

It didn’t click. 

Not until a raw cry curled in my throat. 

Not until I saw the hollowed-out torso of a body splayed across sterile steel. 

Her lungs were visibly protruding through the thoracic cavity, while the stomach and kidneys had been carefully excised and placed in a sterile container.  

But her body was still moving, lungs still inflating, eyelids flickering. Olivia was still alive. 

“Dr. Marks.”

Lan, the lead surgeon, frowned at me behind his mask. “Please wear appropriate attire when observing a surgery.” 

His gaze flicked back to Olivia. “Is the patient’s heart ready for excision?”

“Where am *I*?” Jake broke down behind me. I didn't realize he'd followed me. 

His wild eyes found mine. “I remember what happened. We were transporting living patients for organ removal. When we realized, Will tried to—” he trailed off, his lips curling into a monstrous snarl.  

“That bastard attacked and knocked us out.”

He lunged forward, a whirlwind sending instruments  clattering across the floor. 

Bewildered doctors stumbled away from Olivia’s body.

Jake collapsed into sobs. “If I'm alive, where am I?” He wailed. “Where's Will?” 

Lan ignored the commotion. 

His gaze flicked to me. “Dr. Marks, this is standard procedure.” He gestured to Olivia’s body. 

“We’re keeping this confidential, but we are experiencing an organ shortage. Nobody is willing to donate, so do it ourselves. With ICU patients, we mimic a flatline and transport those viable for procurement.” 

His lips pinched into a smile behind his mask, when Jake let out a raw shriek, and sent scalpels flying. 

“Do not be concerned,” Lan said, his gloved hands coated in blood. “Dr. Carlisle remains fully conscious and responsive. Her awareness constitutes informed consent for complete organ procurement.” 

His gaze landed *on* Jake, a subtle, triumphant expression crossing his face. 

This was not standard protocol. 

This was shutting them up.

1p1qdv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1p1qdv5/blackout_zone_five/,Blackout Zone Five,"Honestly when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I’m not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in 95 they talk about the riots in LA.

They don’t remember the sirens screaming all night. They don’t remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities, almost the whole state. 

I was one of the few who stayed, some couldn’t leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors, in reality we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or uncle sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice of prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this or washed up veterans or ex cops. As for me, I had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves or in pairs if they feel like we’re important. I wish I was that lucky but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. Then again when we’re not doing Washington’s dirty work we’re holed up somewhere, licking our wounds out of the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies, as for me. I always believed in safety in numbers, plus they tend to attack groups of people. 

I tended to shack up in this big church, some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually it was just me, the pastor and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. It was a nice spot actually, the pastor always kept the fire going, and had some beds set out in the main worship area. 

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands, instant of course. But hey I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas with the absence of sugar. I took another sip as I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets with lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window to see the snow was starting to pick up, snowflakes began to gently tap the window.

I was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket for it and glanced down at the miniscule screen to see a radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and trasped over to my bag to my SINCGARS radio and set it up real quick, setting it to single channel and plain text, then punching in the freq. I took hold of the receiver and began to speak into it.

“Scepter to Nest, radio check over”

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

“Hearing you, got some work for you”.

“Hit me”.

“Got a hit from the marines saying there’s some unusual activity in the mall on grover street, they want a specialist to look into it.”

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh.
“Could they be more specific?” 

There was a short pause before nest finally responded.

“Some of the grunts said they heard coming from the old mall, not sure how its possible”.

“Yeah me neither, well I’ll start hoofing it there”

“Oh no need for that, there’s a convoy that you can hitch a ride with to the mall.”

I furrowed my brow 

“How did you manage that?”

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end.

“I have my ways, get geared, they're gonna pick you up soon”.

“I hear, scepter over and out”.

I said as I hung up the receiver and gathered up my gear. Of course it really wasn’t much, half of it was old surplus shit from vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that weren’t completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit and clipped on my gas mask bag to my hip. I grabbed my alice and my weapon case and walked outside as I could hear the sound of diesel engines rumbling closer outside. 

I walked outside to see a six vehicle convoy of weathered humvees and five ton trucks driving down the snow covered street with a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver side window to get a better look at me.

“You the collector?” He asked the gas mask, muffling his voice.
I nodded and he thumbed behind him. 

“Hop in man, we’ll drop you off on the way”.   

I didn’t waste any time and quickly threw my things in the back of the covered five ton. I chambered into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched over shapes of marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed as some shivered in their MOPP gear. Some opted to not wear their gas masks as lit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed alice packs filled the empty space from across the benches. I settled in my icey seat as a few of the marines offered grunts of acknowledgement. 

The truck let out a hiss before speeding off with delay. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines as the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hit my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half buried wreckages of cars and remains of what were once police checkpoints. 

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger marines turned to look at me. A question deep in his mind.

“I gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain’t most of you civies?”

I snapped out of my own trance as I pivoted to him. I offered a shrug

“Most of us are, but we all got our reasons. Just like all of you I’m sure”.

“But we’re kind of forced to be here. You can just leave…right?” He asked naively and I quietly scoffed at this.

“You must be new around here, we can’t leave even if we wanted to”.

This seemed to deflate his desire to ask more questions as his shoulders slumped but he remained silent. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole that had no doubt only gotten bigger from the year or so of non-existent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved hands never letting go even after death, some clutched icey weapons that could never save them. All too common sight nowadays, a constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multistory behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon that was once a mall. its numerous frosted over windows hide its spiraling depths from my vision. I could feel the five ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word I stood up from my seat and dropped my gear out of the truck before hopping out myself with a grunt. 

“Good luck collector” 

One of the marines bid me as I departed. I took a deep breath before reaching for my carrier bag on my hip for my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The marines only stared at me as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices. I reached for the receiver that hung on the straps of my bag and quickly keyed in.

“Nest I’m on site, not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.”

“Standard as in…?”  she responded with a pause for me to elaborate.

“Not seeing any shells, still some bodies around. Atleast not any fresh ones. Gonna load up over.”

“Well you know the deal, try to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can”.

“Got it”. I said as I hung up my handset on the strap of my bag. I kneeled down and began to key in my code for the case. With a soft click it slotted open. I grabbed my thirty eight and my twelve gauge. I began to load it up with double ought buckshot. I chambered a shell into the chamber and quietly walked over to the smashed front door. 

The interior was dimly lit from the half covered sky light. I could still see the outlines of abandoned storefronts hanging in the empty interior. Trash and various articles of debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half shattered as my boots crunched under shards of glass.

“Making entry” I quietly spoke into my handset as I stepped inside. 

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred doors spiraled ahead of me.

“Copy get me a live feed scepter.” 

Next responded with a less carefree tone. I reached for the shoulder mounted. I switched it on and set it to record.

“Live feed up”. I replied as I slung my shotgun up.

“Patching in, standby”. She stated as my camera made a few whirring noises. I reached for my belt and grabbed a flashlight, quickly switching it on to illuminate the long hallway, finally I could hear static from my radio as nest finally chimed in. 

“Alrighty, patched in! You know what to do. I’ll keep watching the feed”.
“On it” I responded softly as I carefully walked past some of the shadowy storefronts. I shined my light in as I made my way past.

The fronts that weren’t barred were completely barren from looting. I could feel the bitter air still clutch me tightly in its frigid embrace. My mask lenses fogged up slightly as I breathed out warm air.

Despite how bright my light was. The darkness of the hallway seemed to swallow the beam itself. I continued forward as I passed flickering neon signs that illuminated the floating dust particles kicked up by my boots. 

I passed the hallway into the main atrium. The main skylight acted like a beacon of brightness in rest of the lightless mall. A maze of escalators and stairs twisted around the multistory atrium. It was almost beautiful in a way.. How calm and quiet everything was now. The crowds that strangled every inch of this place either fled like roaches into the rehabitation camps or became one of the wandering shells. Not it was just us and those who don’t belong here.

I was snapped out of my thoughts as I heard the distinct sound of a phone ringing. I looked over to see several worn pay phones lined up against the nearby balcony. The ringing reverberated the empty halls as I hesitated to answer it.

‘Scepter? What's wrong?”

Nest asked with a twinge of concern in her voice.

“Got uh…a audio irregularity here nest”

I said attempting to regain my radio etiquette. Despite my hesitation to answer it, it was still ringing. It should have stopped ringing by now.

“The phone?” She asked with a hint of hesitation.

“Yeah its still ringing”. I stated slightly unnerved by the constant ringing

“Go ahead and answer it. Don’t say anything unless its necessary. I’ll listen in”.

I sighed into the mic before replying to her
“Copy”

I approached the still ringing phone. I shines my flashlight on the box itself. It had a deep layer of dust covering its exterior. I noticed alot of the wiring were completely exposed with the insulation of the wiring almost completely stripped from the cables. Parts of it looked to be snapped off completely from being chewed on by rats.

“Nest, I don’t think the wiring is even intact enough for it to even work. This place part of the blackout zone?”

“I can see from here it's not. As for power, it's in blackout zone five last I checked. Could be a backup generator that's still running. Look into it after you answer it.”

“Got it”

I said as I picked up the receiver and put it to where my ears would be under the chemical hood. I heard slight static from the other side as I quietly listened for any sound I could pick up.

I could hear someone else listening on the other end just like I was. I considered saying something as the silence only began to sink in further but decided against it. Instead I slowly tapped the receiver a few times with my clunky chemical gloves. 

I knew whatever was on the other side heard it when what I can only describe as a sharp inhale, from something that had greater lung capacity than a human. I heard a voice straining itself like it was trying to speak for the first time. The line went back to muted static again. I kept listening for a few more moments and I could now hear what sounded like the usual kind of music you hear when you get put on hold.

Something about it was wrong at your first listen; it might sound like a normal song. Something you might hear in a mall or an elevator. Maybe some old department store. Unassuming, unremarkable.

The notes that played I quickly took note that some of them were out of tune, some didn’t even sound like they were played correctly. Like it was a song based on someone else’s memory alone.

I looked down at the receiver, staring at the weather worn phone. Still emitting that strange music. I hesitated to hang up yet. Especially since nest was still listening.

“Hang up.” Said nest with a more harsh edge to her voice.

I quietly set the phone back in its place, finally silencing it. I grabbed my handset for my radio. I held down the button to say something but any words I could say refused to leave my mouth. I let the button go as I released my gloved finger.

I started walking again, this time with my free hand on my holster. I suppressed the sound of my heavy winter boots as I best I could while also avoiding stepping on any shards of glass or loose paper. I could tell nest was watching the feed closely.

“Got a floorplan for this place?”
I asked her quietly

“Standby” she said with added professionalism.

I sighed softly and silently wished I was somewhere else. I took out one of my disposable cameras and snapped a few quick photos of my surroundings. Including that strange pay phone. Eventually I heard nest back on the net.

“From what I can there’s a series of maintenance tunnels that lead to some kind of…utility room? Seems large enough to house a generator.”

I softly tapped my rubberized boot for a moment in thought.

“If it was running all this time it should have been out of juice by now”.

Nest was silent for a few moments but I couldn’t tell her finger was on the receiver from the slight static through my hand mic.

“Look into it please, you should be able to get into maints through one of the storefronts.” She replied after a slight pause.

“Got it”. I replied as I shined my light into one of the storefronts.

I got a closer look through the amber beam of my flashlight. Most of the arcade cabinets were still inside. The colorful fonts and vibrant artwork sprawled across the peeling plastic stared indifferently at my form as I gazed inside. The way in was half covered by metal bars. I kneeled down to get a better look inside. Honestly it was in better shape than most of the storefronts in comparison. It seemed like the looters didn’t see much point in ransacking this place, that might not be a good sign.

I crouched in careful not to strike the barred food with any of my gear or my alice pack. The air inside still carried a deathly frigidity to it. Despite being sheltered from much of the wind’s wrath. Even with all of the insulated MOPP gear on, the cold didn’t relent.

I stood up and looked around my weathered surroundings, my footsteps softened on the faded starlike carpet. The beam from my light source reflected off the arcade machine’s screens. Some of them were cracked or had a thin layer of frost covering them. I passed the once colorful prize corner, its cheaply made winnings were still stocked, hardly even touched. As splotchy and worn they were. Not even the looters wanted that shit. I peered around the arcade looking for my way into the tunnels. I finally sighted a set of double industrial doors just past the two racing game machines. The pho double racing seats jutted out from the ultra wide screen of the machine. I passed by the barely legible titles of Dayton USA and Sega Rally as I got closer to the door.

I glanced up at the lightless exit sign that hung above the doorway. My hand grasped the handle and turned it quietly only to find it locked. I took a step back and sent a swift kick into the door. The rusted hinges didn’t offer much resistance as the door flew open to a door hallway. I peeked my head around the corner as the light illuminated clinical white walls, various piping and exposed cables jutted out from the walls. The hallway was silent with even the sound of howling wind not reaching this place.

I trudged forward not exactly eager to continue on, but I resigned myself to do so. Then finally somewhere deep within the darkness beside my vision, I could hear something stirring in the lightless corridor, music, just music. This time it was different from how I heard it on the phone. Loud and clear, no longer strangled by the static of the payphone’s receiver. 

The tone was melodic, probably an older song, with lots of classical instruments. It was soothing almost unnaturally so. Like a lullaby from your childhood, it almost sounded familiar to me. Like something that lingered in the back of my mind, despite how many years had passed. Where have I heard this before?

I switched off the flashlight and stowed it on my webbing. I groped for my dimmer headlamp and turned it on. I unslung the shotgun from over my shoulder and half pumped it to check for the shell’s presence in the chamber.

“Please be careful” I heard nest say with a hint of nervousness in her voice.

I looked down at my handset as she made this remark. She was right. I did need to be careful. I was alone, no one was there to watch my back. No one was there to patch me up or carry me out if I couldn’t make my own way out. If I went down no one was here to carry me to safety. Something could easily leap from the darkness and slit my throat before I even had the chance to fire off a single shell. If I had to run in this heavy gear would I even make it? Even if I dropped my pack. I would drop my only lifeline to the outside world with it. I tightened my grip on my shotgun to keep my hands from shaking.

I took a deep breath as the music echoed in some distant corner of the tunnel. I started carefully moving down the hallway. I held my shotgun close to me, the music only grew louder as I walked deeper into the shadows for what seemed like an eternity.

“Switching to open mic.” I said softly into my radio as I set it to hot mic my every word, I needed my hands free for what came next.  Nest didn’t reply this time.

The hallway finally led to an open doorway. Which proceeded a middling room that seemed to some kind of storage or utility room. Something made me stop dead in my tracks. Two dead bodies lay on the cracked concrete floor in newly made winter clothes. I raised my shotgun as I creeped past the threshold of the doorway. I quickly scanned the room for any kind of threats. I checked my corners. Double checked the doorway behind me to ensure I wasn’t followed here. I did everything by the book. I couldn’t find anything inside minus the bodies.
The utility room seemed to originally house some shelving and circuit breakers but now it seemed to be converted into some kind of makeshift sleeping area of sorts. Two winter sleeping bags were laid out as well as some various other amenities. A kerosene stove, a cooler, and some burnt out flashlights. The floor was covered in torn open bright yellow packaging from handed out HDRs, patriotically colored foil wrappers, stamped on cardboard food packets with half torn American flags and a small bold text that read:

‘food gift from the people of the united states of america.’

‘Nest got two bodies here, look to be vagrants. Gonna look them over.”

“Heard”

I kneeled down beside the first corpse. They were dressed in soaked winter clothes, scarves and all. They were laying face down. I grabbed their shoulders and turned them over. The pale lifeless face of a man in his mid thirties with his eyes wide open stared back at me. The warmth had been completely sapped from his body by the cold air, must have been dead for at least ten hours but it could have been longer. 

I started to cut open the clothes with a pair of trauma shears from my belt to see if I could get a better look at any wounds that could have killed him. I noted quickly I didn’t see any kind of wounds or massive trauma that could have did him in, hell I didn’t even see a single drop of blood on him. If I hadn’t known any better I would have said the cold took him.

The other corpse was in the same state. Ice cold, pale, no wounds, no blood, nothing. The clothes they were wearing should have protected them plenty from hypothermia or frostbite. Even if their clothes got wet. It was almost like they just gave up on living all together. 

I snapped a few pictures of the bodies and the room itself. Nest was still quiet.

“Nest these bodies-” She interrupted me.

“I know just take some samples and-”

Something finally dawned on me, the music had gotten much louder now. Nest had noticed it too. I stood up to stare at where the music was coming from. I waited for it to draw closer beyond the closed doors but it never did.

I slowly approached the door with my shotgun at the ready. I swung the door open only to see utter darkness staring back at me. I shined my headlamp into the darkness, the shadows seemed to swallow the beam from my light. This wasn’t any natural darkness. The music itself seemed to be coming from the shadows themselves, despite the pitch blackness, I could see what seemed to be particles of dust and snow swaying in the air within the symphony. Waves of heat vibrated in the air in that supernatural darkness.
I never thought I would ever get close to one of these. I felt gusts of hot and cold air brush past me. It was mesmerizing honestly, I felt myself go into a small trance, it seemed like I found the source of the strange activity.

“Nest got a positive ID on a musician here”.

“I can see that…what's it doing?”

She inquired as the peaceful music continued to play and echo in the halls. I observed it for a moment before finally replying.

“Its humming”. I replied as I lowered my shotgun.

“Did it kill those two?”
Nest asked me softly.

I looked back over at the two unmoving bodies then back at the musician, gazing at it for a second.

“Unlikely, I don’t see any burns on them.”

As I said this I could hear something different. The fluorescent overhead light tubes began to softly buzz above me. I was sure the power was completely dead besides that phone. My doubts began to fester as they began to flicker on and off.

I felt a pit forming in my stomach as the lights continued to act up. Even the burnt out flashlights nearby began to flicker to life. Nothing about this was right, nothing about this made any sense. I needed to leave and fast.

“N-nest permission to-”

I stopped myself mid sentence. There was another sound. I waited, I listened. I heard it, somewhere close by but I couldn’t tell where. The sound of scrapping metal began to draw near. It almost sounded like it was coming from all around, every angle, every corner. I prepared myself for the task ahead, fighting for my survival. I kept turning and turning trying to point the barrel of my weapon at the source of this sound. 

“Scepter? What's wrong? What do you hear?” She asked with dread seeping into her usually calming voice. I debated telling her that I was cutting the job short and ditching it, but it was probably too late now. 

“Hold traffic”. I said as I curled my finger around the trigger, I waited for anything to move to make itself a target. But it only got quieter, even the musician’s ever present melody fell silent. The only sound I could hear now was the buzzing from the lights above me.
I continued to look around my surroundings. My heart started to beat faster like it was about to burst out of my chest at any moment. I felt sweat begin to build up under my stuffy MOPP suit.

I froze in place, there was only one place I hadn’t checked. Right above me. The musician suddenly blared out a series of notes much louder than before. The walls seemed to vibrate from the volume, it was much different from the song it was humming a few moments ago.

This song was fast paced, suspenseful like something you might hear in a good horror movie. I realized something at that moment, it was warning me. I didn’t have a chance to wonder why as I looked up

What I saw hanging from the ceiling was something I could hardly put into words. Where would I even start with describing what I saw?

My eyes burned when I looked at it, tears began to overtake my vision. The lenses on my gas mask began to fog up.

I could hear my radio crackling with some kind of interference. My trigger felt like it weighed fifty pounds. It was reaching out to me but I quickly noticed it didn’t have any hands. What I remember the most was its misshapen smile or maybe it was a sneer. I couldn’t tell. I finally squeezed the trigger.

I was quickly glad I chose buckshot this time otherwise I probably would have missed. I slam fired two shells into it. I know I hit it but it didn’t stop it. I was confident that it took off an arm if you could call it that. But it did give me just enough time to bolt for the door.

“Class five! Class five!” I yelled into the radio as my hand grasped the doorknob. I swung the door open and slammed it shut behind me

My heavy boots stomped loudly as I took off in a dead sprint down the never ending hallway. I could hardly see where I was going out of the foggy lenses.

“Get the fuck out of there locke!”

I could hear nest scream through the crackling interference of my radio.

That's when I heard those god awful sounds coming from behind me. The door behind bulged as it slammed into it with its endless body. The door began to bend and twist as its writhing appendages reached through the jagged gaps in the door. The sounds it made, like nothing I had ever heard in all my years of being a collector. A deep rumbling murmur shook my surroundings. The sound traveled through my body as this hum only increased in volume. The lights flicked rapidly as they were reanimated. My breathing only increased in rhythm as I reached the double doors back to the arcade. I could hear the sound of the door behind finally giving away as it flew off its hinges and slammed into the ground.
I shoulder checked the next door open, quickly shutting it behind me, thats when I noticed the arcade began to flicker alight. It wasn’t just the lights this time, it was the arcade machines too.

The dusty screens and debris-ridden speakers began to reanimate. Light filled the forgotten arcade, slow and sputtering at first, like something waking up that shouldn’t. Colored bulbs cracked to life one by one, blinking and stuttering like fireflies drowning in static. The machines, long-dead and dust-caked, flickered to their attract modes. Glitched gameplay previews stuttered across the screens, voices warbled through shredded speakers.
One cabinet, deep in the row behind me, let out a warped shriek.
“DAY… TONAAAAA—AA!”
It was blown out, distorted, far too loud for such a hollow space. The sound hit my chest like a shockwave—cheerful, enthusiastic, completely wrong. It echoed through the arcade like something remembering how to be alive, even if it didn’t understand why.
Even through the flashing lights and mechanical noise, I heard it: the door creaking open. The one I knew I had locked.
It slithered. It crawled. It walked—all at once, but never made a sound when it moved. I ducked low behind a row of jammed cabinets, trying not to breathe too loud. My gear felt like dead weight now.
I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible even with the adrenaline pumping into my veins. I was hardly able to stand up with how much my legs were shaking.

Even though it didn’t make a sound when it moved. I could still hear a very muffled creak from the floor itself from its mass. It whirred and warbled; it almost sounded like it was mechanical in nature instead of coming from a living thing.

The doorway was close but not close enough for me to make a mad dash for it without it catching up to me before I could crawl back under the barred door.

I slowly reached on my belt for something I had been saving for a rainy day just like this, an incendiary grenade. It felt like it took a lifetime for me to unhook it from my webbing without alerting it to my presence. 

I let my shotgun hang from the sling across my chest as I took off the various safety pins on the grenade. I slowly peeked through a gap between two machines. I could see its massive form almost covering the entire gap. I slowly pied the corner with my finger on the pin of the grenade, ready to pull at any time. I peeked my head around the corner. It wasn’t facing me this time. It was completely still, listening for the smallest sounds.

I twisted and pulled the pin with considerable force. I knew it heard it because it stopped making those god awful sounds. My arms felt heavy as lead. I fought my shaking hands to keep my thumb on the clip to keep it from going off in my hand.

It turned to look at me with that smile that was too wide, too misshapen. That's when I realized, it wasn’t smiling. It just didn’t have any lips for its spiraling maw. Its many eyes stared right into me.

Every single cell of my body screamed at me to run, to hide. I grit my teeth and finally tossed the grenade.
I didn’t know if the live feed was still active, I hoped it was but I know this must have been hard for her to watch but at least she had the common sense to stay quiet while this thing was after me. I felt tempted to turn off the live feed so she didn’t have to watch me get ripped apart by this thing. What little chances I had, lay in that cylinder of thermite. 

The grenade landed right next to it. It glanced over at it with its many independently blinking eyes. That's when it finally went off, first thing I saw was the smoke then the grenade hissing harshly as it released a cone of sparks. The mold covered carpet was the first thing to catch aflame.

I expected to hear it screeching, screaming. Anything but it was silent. Normally alot of these things scream when fire touches them. They hate it more than anything else.

I took my chance and dashed for the doorway as the smoke began to fill the room. I reached the barred door and practically threw my body through the gap. I slammed it shut and made sure it couldn’t be opened this time. My breathing was ragged as I laid on the floor covered in sweat. Smoke had finally claimed the majority of the room, obscuring my view of its interior.

I was about to push myself back up and continue running but something stopped me. An orange glow could be seen through the thick smoke. That's when I saw it, it was still alive. It emerged from the smoke. Its entire form engulfed in flames. That's when I realized how tall it really was. It stooped down to gaze at me. The flames didn’t seem to bother it as its flesh began to char.

I aimed my shotgun at it with my unsteady hands as it continued to stare at me from its side of the barred door. Its lipless maw began to move like it was trying to speak. I was glued to the spot as I could only stare at it with wide eyes as they stinged from looking at it.

Its appendages wrapped themselves around the bar, still staring down at me. I felt thoughts that weren’t my own enter my mind. A single word kept repeating itself over and over again from a voice I never heard in my life.

“Reanimator” It continued to echo in the confines of my skull.

Finally my radio screamed to life once again and I heard nest’s calming voice over the net. She only said one word.

“Run”

This seemed to snap me out of my trance. I pushed myself to my feet and took off down the hallway. The lights around me were flashing wildly as my legs burned from all the gear I was running with. I rounded the corner, entering the main atrium again.

I came to a screeching halt at what I saw next. Everything was back to normal, all the decay, all the disrepair. It was gone. The lights were back, the biting cold air had vanished entirely. The mall wasn’t just repaired, it was alive again. There were people. There were families and groups of teenagers meeting up at the food court after school. All walking by at a leisurely pace for a slow afternoon of shopping, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

The people looked normal enough at first. Nirvana shirts, jeans, the newest kicks. All wearing bright summer wear but I couldn’t see any of their faces. They weren’t missing them entirely, they were fuzzy like trying to take a picture of someone’s face when the camera was out of focus.

They didn’t even seem to notice I was there. Some of them even walked right through me like I was a hologram. I was lost, lost in more ways than I could possibly imagine. I reached for my radio in vain hope that I could still reach nest.

“Nest…can you hear me?”

I desperately wished to hear nest’s nonchalant voice over the net. I could only hear static from the other end, I was truly alone in this mall of ghosts.

The various shop fronts were stocked again. The windows were pristine and undamaged. I could see the out of focus people lazily walking back and forth between the aisles like it was just another day for them. Some of them occupied the colorful seating of the food court and gestured to each other like they were having casual conversations, but the only sounds I could hear from the were indistinct mumblings and murmurs of echoes of human voices. 

Sometimes I missed those days, I missed feeling safe. I missed coming back home to her smiling face. I missed the simple monotony of a nine to five. Hell I even missed those annoying ass jingles they played for ads on daytime TV. I missed it all. I began to wonder if this is where I would spend the rest of my days, wandering in this endless mall. Unseen, unnoticed. Bound to this mockery of normal life.

I trapsed forward not sure where to go at this point besides the exit I came from. I passed the now pristine pay phones. One of them began to ring suddenly. I immediately stopped where I was. 

I sighed softly and slowly walked towards the still ringing phone. That's when I felt a warm hand grasping my shoulder. I turned sharply, bringing my shotgun to bear. Staring back at me was a young woman in her mid twenties. Her face was different from the others, her face was in focus, she had delicate features. Jet black hair with long bangs. She had unnaturally pale eyes.

“You shouldn’t answer that”.

She said in a soft yet firm tone. I ripped free from her gip and backed away from her still aiming my shotgun at her.

“Why not?” I asked in a flat tone.

“You don’t want to know what it will tell you”.

I lowered my shotgun slightly

“It?” I asked not liking where this was going.

“The reanimator”

I was silent for a moment debating on what I should even do at this point.

“Who are you?” I asked warily

She crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly as she regarded me.

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you”

I opened my mouth to ask her another question but she cut me off.

“No more questions Locke, you need to leave this place.”

“How?” I asked with hesitation, unnerved she knew my name. I know she probably wouldn’t tell me how she knew.

“Same way you came in. you don’t have much time. It's coming. You want to see Lorraine again don’t you?”

My eyes widened as I was stunned into silence. I finally mustered up some words to respond to her. 

“Y..yes”

“Then go” She said with a wave of her hand.

The last thing I saw her do was wink at me before she turned and walked a few steps away from me and her form faded entirely from my vision. 

Then I heard that horrifying yet familiar humming, it was close. I knew I couldn’t hide from it. Fighting it was a losing battle. All I could do was run and pray for my survival. That's exactly what I did at that moment. I ran like I never ran before in my entire life.

The humming was getting closer even as I increased my speed. I finally saw my way out, the doors I took to get inside the mall, now a pristine set of sliding glass doors.
Outside I could see a familiar sight. Snow covered streets, the wreckages of cars, the frozen corpses. I slammed the doors open as I barreled myself outside using the last vestiges of my energy and will to live.

I panted as I continued sprinting into the knee deep snow not caring about the gear getting covered in snow. My radio began to squawk at me as I heard nest’s worried voice over comms.

“Scepter! Scepter come in!”

“I’m here!” I could hear nest sigh in relief from the other end.

“Thank fuck! Your feed cut and I couldn’t reach you.”


I took a deep breath in and out.

“I’m okay…I’m- sorry” I said in between breaths

“No shut up, just…get back safe”

I turned look back at the mall once again, it was in disrepair, ruined, worn down. The neon sign above the doorway that read ‘grover mall’ began to flicker. I cursed under my breath and raised my shotgun to my shoulder.

I saw its body coil itself by the doorway. Its infinite eyes stared back at me as I backed away from the mall. It observed me for a second before it suddenly recessed its measureless form back within the confines of the mall. I don’t know why it didn’t come after me. Nest made one last transmission for awhile

“Okay…the money will be in a dead drop. Pick up is ten minutes away. Nest out.”

I sighed and turned away from that awful place and walked down the treacherous road to await pick up. I always tried to avoid that place when taking contracts. I wish I could say I never did collector work again but I was in no place to quit. I went back to that church. Smoked a couple cigs, stared into the embers of the pastor’s fire and went out to do it all over again, the next day but I never went back to blackout zone five.

Telling her that the guy who got her pregnant is NOT “he’s just a friend”,"Context: My fiancée (43F) had sex with a “friend” 3 days before we started dating. We found out three months into our relationship that she was miscarring his kid. It put a strain on our relationship but we got through it. 

Another incident was a day before my birthday she had him over for coffee at 10pm at night. But it’s okay cause he’s “just a friend”. 

Now as we have worked on our relationship we have better boundaries and more respect for each other. Buuuuuuuut…. 

This man keeps coming around. Trying to take her out for coffee and just recently posted in her discord “I was just thinking of you” and the general message was asking how she was doing after having some medical treatments. 

I told her I don’t like the way he tests boundaries and I don’t like his language with her. But she just comes back with “he’s just a friend. There’s nothing there. I don’t even understand why you are insecure”. And she more so says it as a statement. Not a question. 

AITA for being insecure and telling her that I don’t like that she’s friends with this man??

1p1qab2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p1qab2/aliens_came_and_they_have_a_baseball_team/,"Aliens Came, and They Have a Baseball Team","This is the first eight chapters, which I still need to add to. Enjoy!


Aliens Came, and They Have a Baseball Team

Chapter One
The roar of the Fenway Park crowd was deafening. The Red Sox, trailing by a run in the bottom of the ninth, had loaded the bases with two outs. The tension was palpable, even through the television screen. In the broadcast booth, John Smoltz leaned forward, his eyes glued to the action.
""This is it, Joe,"" Smoltz said, his voice barely audible over the boisterous Boston crowd. ""3-1 count, fastball hitter, pitcher struggling with command of his breaking stuff but throwing over 100. This is what it's all about.""
""You're right, John,"" Joe Buck replied, his voice a mixture of excitement and apprehension. ""This is what baseball is all about.""
Suddenly, a strange hum filled the air, a low, resonant vibration that seemed to emanate from deep within the earth. The camera shook violently, the image distorting and blurring. The crowd, mid-cheer, fell silent, a collective gasp escaping their lips.
Then, in the center of the infield, a swirling vortex of energy erupted from the ground, engulfing home plate and the surrounding area. Players and umpires scattered, their faces contorted in terror.
""What in the…?"" Buck stammered, speechless.
The camera, miraculously, continued to roll. Buck, his voice trembling, tried to describe the scene. ""I… I don't know what to say, folks. This is… this is unbelievable!""
A voice boomed into his earpiece. ""Buck, describe what you're seeing! Don't just sit there!""
""I'm trying, I'm fucking trying!"" Buck yelled back. ""But I've never seen anything like this in my fucking life! It's like… like a giant vacuum cleaner is sucking up the infield!""
The vortex grew, consuming the pitcher's mound, the bases, and even a section of the stands. The roar of the crowd was replaced by a stunned silence, broken only by the frantic shrieks of terrified fans.
Then, amidst the chaos, a figure emerged. The players and fans that had been seemingly sucked into the vortex looked confused, but unharmed. They stared at the tall, slender being with skin that shimmered like polished obsidian. It stood with its arms crossed, observing the scene with an almost bored detachment.
Suddenly, for viewers at home and anyone looking at a screen anywhere in the world, the image shifted into focus. The obsidian figure’s voice boomed through every device across the globe.
""Greetings, inhabitants of Earth,"" the voice declared, its tone surprisingly calm. ""I am one of many beings from an alternate dimension called the Timekeepers. The fate of your universe, and another very similar one from an alternate timeline, is in peril. Put simply, only one timeline can continue. To determine which shall survive, a contest has been chosen. A test of skill, of strategy, of… sportsmanship.""
The Timekeeper paused, a hint of amusement in its voice. ""The contest? Baseball.""
Panic erupted across the globe. News channels spiraled into pandemonium. The Timekeeper continued, ""You have one month to prepare your team. We will allow you to select any player from their peak period of performance since your year 1990—the date your two timelines finished their split. We will return in thirty days with the players from the alternate dimension for games one and two here. Games three through five will be played in their dimension. Game six will return here. If necessary, game seven’s location will be decided by a coin toss.""
The transmission ended abruptly. In the booth, Joe Buck stared at the blank screen.
""Well,"" Smoltz finally said, his voice trembling. ""That was… something. Time to get to work.""

Chapter 2
The Oval Office now hosted, quite possibly, the most important conversation in human history. Maps littered the desk and the air crackled with nervous energy. The President paced before a bewildered group of advisors.
""Baseball?"" he thundered. ""Baseball? This is how they're deciding the fate of the universe?! Let's say we just nuke ‘em. What would be wrong with that?""
""Sir,"" Secretary of Defense Miller began, ""The Timekeepers possess technology far beyond our comprehension. Aggression could mean annihilation.""
""Advanced technology?"" The President scoffed. ""My administration has the best technology. The absolute best."" He gestured to the TV. ""And they choose... baseball.""
""It appears to be a method to assess our resilience,"" Miller offered.
""Resilience?"" The President scoffed. ""We invented this game! We have the greatest players! We will win this!"" He turned to his Chief of Staff. ""Get me Roger Goodell. Immediately.""
The Chief of Staff paused. ""Actually, sir, perhaps we should contact Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball.""
The President frowned. ""Manfred? Who's Manfred?""
""He's the head of baseball, sir. Roger Goodell runs the NFL.""
The President waved a hand dismissively. ""Whatever. Just get me someone who knows baseball. And tell them I need to discuss a matter of national security.""
As the gravity of the situation sank in, the President’s mood actually improved. He was delighted to be in charge with humanity's fate on the line.

Chapter 3
The War Room, a bunker beneath the White House, buzzed with anxiety. The President, however, was manic.
""Gentlemen,"" he declared, ""this is an opportunity! An opportunity to showcase American ingenuity, American grit, and most importantly, American… baseball!""
Secretary Miller cleared his throat. ""Sir, this is a global matter.""
""Nonsense, Miller,"" the President dismissed. ""This is a challenge. And America will rise to the occasion."" He turned to Rob Manfred. “Commissioner, we need a selection committee. We need winners. We need… legends.""
The Chief of Staff scribbled furiously. ""Yes, sir. Legends.""
""And,"" the President continued, a sly grin spreading across his face, ""make sure Bobby Bonilla is on that list.""
Manfred choked on his coffee. ""Sir, Bobby Bonilla? You really only hear about him on July 1st when the Mets pay his deferred salary.”
""Precisely,"" the President declared. ""If the Mets are still paying that man, he must possess some untapped potential. Some… enduring power.""
Manfred sighed inwardly. This was going to be a long month.

Chapter 4: 31 Days Later
The air in the clubhouse hung heavy with the stench of defeat. The Earth team, after a heart-wrenching extra-inning loss in Game 1, shuffled around dejectedly. A-Rod sat with his head down, replaying the final play.
""Tough luck out there, kid,"" Greg Maddux drawled, leaning against his locker with a mischievous grin. ""The pressure of the end of the world can really take a toll.""
A-Rod bristled. ""Shut up, Maddux.""
Maddux shrugged. ""Just stating the obvious."" He turned to Chipper Jones. ""See, Larry? Told you he couldn't handle it.""
Chipper didn't look up from his cards. ""Don't worry A-Rod, Doggy will make quick work of them tomorrow."" Prime Smoltz barked in A-Rod’s direction.
Maddux leaned forward. ""We'll go easy on you in Game 2. Maybe throw you a few batting practice fastballs.""
The media stormed in. Maddux walked up to Rodriguez, offering words of encouragement. As he spoke, Maddux casually reached up, wiped his nose, and with a nonchalant flick, transferred the contents of his finger onto A-Rod's pristine white T-shirt.
""You gotta be brave, A-Rod,"" Maddux said, maintaining eye contact. ""Embrace the pressure.""
""A-Rod! A-Rod!"" the reporters shouted.
A-Rod stood up, face flushed. ""Gentlemen, I'm disappointed, but we'll come back stronger. Maddux is on the mound and I feel like I've seen the differences in how pitching has evolved in the mirror reality.""
He glanced down. The booger was a dark stain against the white fabric. #Boogergate was already trending.
""A-Rod, that stain… is that…?""
A-Rod stammered, blaming the Cy Young winner. ""Maddux… he… he...""
The media turned to Maddux, who shrugged. ""Me? Oh no, wouldn't dream of it. I'm just focused on Game 2. Just throw good pitches and let my defense work.""

Chapter 5: Game Two
The cheapest seats at Fenway for Game 1 had gone for over $11 million. Game 2 seats were now pushing $20 million, and traffic control belonged to the National Guard.
The ceremonial first pitch had been cancelled after the President declared his Game 1 pitch ""the greatest ever thrown"" and replaced the ceremony with a video montage of his 44 mph lob.
As Greg Maddux toed the rubber, the world finally got a good look at the opposition.
The ""Timeline B"" team, officially designated by the broadcast as the ""Terrans,"" were terrifying to behold. While they shared human DNA, their timeline had clearly taken a different evolutionary path regarding athletics since 1990. They didn't just look fit; they looked industrial.
Every player in their lineup stood between 6'4"" and 6'8"". They wore uniforms of a matte, gunmetal grey that seemed to absorb the sunlight rather than reflect it, with no names on the back—only barcodes. Their biceps were the size of tree trunks, and their necks were thick cords of muscle that barely allowed them to turn their heads. They didn't chat in the dugout. They didn't chew gum. They stood in a perfect, equidistant line along the railing, staring at the field with the cold, predatory focus of sharks.
It was a team built for one thing: Velocity. In their world, finesse had been bred out of the game.
The Terran leadoff hitter, a biological construct of a man who played centerfield, stepped into the box. He wielded a bat that looked heavier than a telephone pole, yet he swung it one-handed during his warm-up. He dug his cleats in, shattering the batter's box chalk, and stared at the relatively diminutive Maddux.
Maddux adjusted his cap, looked at the hulking giant, and smirked.
His first pitch was a nasty two-seamer that started at the giant's hip and tailed back across the inside corner. The Terran hitter didn't even flinch. He was programmed for 105 mph fastballs; he hadn't registered the 88 mph movement until the umpire called strike one.
Two pitches later, the giant was walking back to the dugout, shaking his head in disgust after flailing at a changeup in the dirt.
The two and three spots—men who looked like they could bench press the team bus—made weak contact on first-pitch ground balls. A-Rod and Chipper made efficient throws to Pujols to end the inning.
Maddux winked at A-Rod as they returned to the dugout. ""Told you it would be okay, kid. They’re built like tanks, but tanks don't turn corners very well. Now go score me a run.""
It didn't happen until the bottom of the sixth. Mike Trout roped a line drive off the Green Monster for a triple, and Big Papi hit a deep fly to bring him home.
Maddux confused the Terran lineup all day. They were giants prepared for war, but they were losing a game of chess. Maddux threw a complete game shutout in only 83 pitches, giving up just two singles.
""Ahh,"" Maddux told the press later, ""It's kind of easy to throw to guys who've never seen anything under 98. We got the run we needed.”

Chapter 6
The team plane, which was actually just a repurposed Air Force One commandeered by the President for ""official team business,"" sat on the tarmac at Logan Airport. But there was no runway ahead, only the swirling, violet maw of a Timekeeper portal.
Inside the cabin, the atmosphere was a cocktail of adrenaline and confusion.
""So,"" Mike Trout said, buckling his seatbelt with a grip tight enough to crush a walnut. ""We just fly into that thing? That's the plan?""
""Technically,"" Ken Griffey Jr. said, adjusting his cap, ""we're flying through it. To a timeline where, apparently, they don't believe in off-speed pitches.""
At the front of the cabin, the President was on speakerphone, his voice booming through the overhead system. He had insisted on a pre-flight briefing.
""Greg,"" the President’s voice crackled. ""Tremendous game. Beautiful game. But honestly? Low energy. very low energy. 88 miles per hour? I have golf carts at Mar-a-Lago that go faster. We need power, Greg. We need to dominate. Like I do in the polls.""
Maddux, sitting next to a terrified A-Rod, rolled his eyes but kept his tone polite. ""I'll work on that, Mr. President. Maybe I'll grunt louder when I throw.""
""Good. I like grunts. Grunts are strong. Now, listen to me. You're going to their world. It’s going to be nasty. I’ve seen the intelligence reports. They don't have freedom there. They probably don't even have hot dogs. You go there, you win Game 3, and you bring back a win for America. And for me.""
The line clicked dead.
""Alright, boys,"" Manager Joe Torre stood up. He had been selected as the steady hand to guide this ship of egos. ""Buckle up. We’re wheels up for... wherever 'there' is.""
The plane taxied forward, the engines whining. As the nose cone breached the violet energy field, the windows flashed with blinding white light. Gravity seemed to invert for a split second—A-Rod screamed, clutching a bewildered Derek Jeter’s arm—and then, silence.
The light faded. The plane was descending.
Below them lay a city that looked like New York, but wrong. The architecture was jagged, aggressive, dominated by neon crimson lights. And sitting where Citi Field should have been was a monstrosity of chrome and black steel, easily twice the size of any stadium on Earth-1.
""Welcome to Earth-Beta,"" the pilot announced, his voice trembling slightly. ""Touchdown in ten minutes.""

Chapter 7
The locker room in the ""Chrome Colosseum"" was vast, sterile, and smelled faintly of ozone and protein powder.
As the Earth team unpacked, they noticed the amenities were... different. The vending machines didn't sell Gatorade; they sold canisters labeled ""HYPER-FUEL"" and ""ADRENAL-MAX.""
""Hey,"" Chipper Jones called out, looking at a monitor on the wall broadcasting the pre-game show from this dimension’s sports network. ""You guys gotta see this.""
The team gathered around. On the screen, two commentators who looked like bodybuilders in suits were screaming at each other.
""...AND THAT IS WHY THE EARTH-PRIME TEAM IS SOFT!"" one shouted, flexing a bicep that ripped his suit jacket seam. ""THEY RELY ON 'LOCATION' AND 'SPIN.' HERE ON EARTH-BETA, WE RELY ON TORQUE! WE RELY ON VELOCITY! TONIGHT, WE CRUSH THEM!""
The screen cut to footage of the Earth-Beta team taking batting practice.
""My god,"" whispered Pedro Martinez.
The opposing players were gargantuan. Their biceps were the size of human heads. When they connected with the ball, it didn't make a crack sound; it sounded like a cannon firing.
""They look like they were assembled in a lab,"" Trout muttered.
""They probably were,"" said a voice from the corner.
Everyone turned. Sitting on a folding chair, wearing a Mets uniform that was slightly too tight, was Bobby Bonilla. He was casually eating a sandwich.
""Bobby?"" Jeter asked. ""You're... you're on the roster?""
""President insisted,"" Bonilla said, chewing slowly. ""Said I was a 'financial genius' and needed to be the bench coach. Plus, it's July. I'm here to collect my check. You guys worry about the steroid monsters. I'm just here for the vibes.""
Suddenly, the locker room door slammed open. A man with wild hair and eyes that burned with intensity stomped in. He was six-foot-ten, lanky, and radiated pure intimidation.
Randy Johnson, the Big Unit, had arrived.
""Give me the ball,"" Johnson growled, snatching a baseball from a clubhouse attendant. He looked at the monitor, staring at the behemoths on the other team. ""They like velocity? They like power?""
He sneered, a terrifying expression that had made grown men weep in the 90s.
""Let's see how they like a slider that starts at their hip and ends in the dirt at 99 miles per hour.""

Chapter 8
The atmosphere inside the Chrome Colosseum was hostile. The gravity on Earth-Beta felt slightly heavier, making every movement a labor. The crowd didn't cheer; they chanted in a rhythmic, militaristic stomp that shook the dugout benches.
“CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY! WIN!”
""Friendly bunch,"" Smoltz noted from the dugout, watching Johnson warm up in the bullpen. The sound of Johnson's fastball hitting the catcher's mitt echoed like a gunshot, cutting through the crowd noise.
Joe Buck and John Smoltz (the broadcaster version) were set up in a floating glass pod hovering behind home plate.
""Welcome back to the Interdimensional World Series,"" Buck said, sweating profusely. ""We are tied 1-1. We are in a dimension where steroids were apparently made mandatory in kindergarten, and the designated hitter rule has been replaced by a rule that says 'hit it hard or go to jail.' John, what’s the key for the Big Unit tonight?""
""Intimidation, Joe,"" Smoltz replied. ""These Earth-Beta hitters are used to 102 mph straight fastballs. They haven't seen a guy who looks like an angry scarecrow throwing a wiffle ball from the sky. Randy’s release point is going to be a nightmare for them.""
The game began.
The first Earth-Beta batter, a man named ""Titan"" who looked like he ate cinderblocks for breakfast, stepped into the box. He dug in, creating a crater in the dirt.
Randy Johnson glared over his glove. He wound up, a tangle of arms and legs, and unleashed fury.
The ball hissed. Titan swung so hard the air displacement nearly knocked the umpire over.
Strike one.
Titan blinked. He hadn't even seen it.
Johnson threw again. A slider, breaking down and in. Titan buckled, his knees giving way as he bailed out of the box to avoid being hit. The ball snapped over the plate.
Strike two.
The crowd's chanting faltered.
For the third pitch, Johnson didn't get fancy. He reared back and threw a heater at the top of the zone. Titan swung, but his bat was nowhere near the ball.
STRIKE THREE.
Johnson stalked off the mound, shouting something unintelligible at the ground.
In the Earth dugout, A-Rod turned to Maddux. ""Okay, that was awesome.""
""It's all fun and games until they make contact,"" Maddux warned, though he was smiling. ""But hey, if we win this, maybe the President will let us nuke the moon or something. He seemed really keen on nuking something.""
""Focus, Greg,"" Jeter barked, grabbing a bat. ""We need runs. Their pitcher is warming up, and I think I saw smoke coming out of his shoulder socket.""
The Earth-Beta pitcher, a cyborg-looking behemoth named ""Vortex,"" stepped onto the mound. He didn't wind up. He just stepped and threw. The radar gun on the scoreboard flashed red: 108 MPH.
Jeter stepped out of the box, laughing nervously. ""Okay,"" he muttered to himself. ""Just... shorten the swing.""
Vortex threw again. 109 MPH.
""It's gonna be a long night,"" Bonilla said from the end of the bench, checking his watch. ""Is it direct deposit in this dimension, or paper check?”

In the gym or library everyone wants to just do his own thing, even when asking to take turns on the machines it feels like Im bothering them.

On the street when I see a guy i want to complement by its cool outfit and start to ask for where did he bought them It also feels like im going to bother them. Coffee shops? Bookstores? Supermarkets? Full public transport? All the same :/

1p1q9tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1p1q9tz/newly_diagnosed_started_meds_tuesday_question/,"Newly diagnosed, started meds Tuesday + question about caffeine tolerance","I (32F) finally got officially diagnosed a few weeks ago (yippee!!! only cost my arm, leg, and my little brother - if you get this joke you get a cookie)   
  
I started meds on Tuesday - 20mg Vyvanse with a 5mg dex booster for the arvo if I need it. My psych gave me a stepped plan to increase to 30/40/50mg every two weeks if needed, and I’ve got a follow-up in two months to check in.

This is also a mini celebration post because, as you all know, getting diagnosed and treated is expensive and so stressful. I’ve been hovering on the edge of burnout for a while, which is what pushed me to finally go through with it. Post-pandemic I had a huge ADHD (or autistic… still need to get assessed for AuDHD lol) meltdown and walked out of a toxic job. I also have Sjogren’s Disease and chronic urticaria/eczema, both of which are made worse by stress and histamine triggers - the usual comorbidities, of course.

It’s too early to know how the meds will really pan out, but I have noticed something: my overreactions are softer. I work as an executive assistant (yes, an EA with executive dysfunction, love that for me), and I get a lot of irritating requests. Normally I mask, smile, bottle it up, and people-please to death… but burnout recently has had me getting snappy and internally ragey. Since starting meds, I still feel the irritation for a sec and then its muted.

I’m still scatterbrained with racing thoughts, the whole adhd hubbub, still able to sleep fine at night, and I’ve been doing all the “good patient” stuff - tons of research, stocking up on electrolytes, adding more protein to my meals. I wasn’t expecting magic, but so far it feels like the only noticeable effect is “less rage hahaha.” I'll probably need to up the dose but I’ll definitely follow my psych’s plan and won’t increase the dose until each two-week mark until we hit that 'sweet spot' I keep reading about?

This all got me thinking because I have a really high tolerance for caffeine and alcohol despite being tiny. I normally drink 1-2 coffees a day but can easily go up to 3-5 without jitters or irritability. I can drink coffee at night and still sleep like a baby. On my first three days of meds I had 1.5 coffees, then 1 coffee, and today none. No headaches yet, so I’m waiting for caffeine withdrawals to ambush me… but also no noticeable difference in how the meds affect me.

So it made me wonder: does high caffeine tolerance translate to stimulant medication tolerance? Since caffeine is technically a stimulant, is there any connection?

My questions are:  
\- What’s your experience with caffeine while on ADHD meds?  
\- Does your caffeine tolerance (high or low) line up with how you tolerate stimulants?

And also:  
\- Do you have a career that seems counterintuitive for ADHD-havers?  
I feel like the only reason I’m considered “good” at my job is because I’ve built (ever-changing) coping systems and probably have a dash of the ’tism.

Her dog immediately growled and bared its teeth at my dog, who cowered. At the time, I remember finding it strange that the owner didn’t pull her dog away once it had been aggressive. I quickly moved myself and my dog on. 

About 10 minutes later, we were in the queue at Gail’s right by Farringdon tube station and I noticed the same woman and her dog were just ahead of us in the queue. Almost as soon as I noticed them, her dog attacked mine, seriously injuring his paw. Later at the vet, we learned a nail had been ripped off during the attack. My dog was whimpering and I asked a barista for a cloth to try to stop the bleeding. By the time I looked up, the owner had collected her coffee and her dog had left. The owner said nothing, no reaction or apology during or after the attack - she barely pulled her dog away. 

We have now spent £300 at the vet, for the appointment, anti biotics, cone and pain relief medication with a follow-up tomorrow to see if the nail has fully healed or if minor surgery will be needed. Fortunately, we have insurance. What worries me most is how unphased the owner was and that the dog wasn’t muzzled. 

I have reported it to the police, to try prevent this from happening to another dog. The barista and my friend are the only two people I know who saw what happened and we know the exact time: 3:15 pm on Monday, 17th November.

Then Lost It All in a Week.,"At 18, I was going to be the next big filmmaker. I started a video production company with all the passion and zero business sense. Unsurprisingly, it crashed and burned, leaving me with nothing but a bruised ego and a mountain of cheap camera gear. I tucked my tail between my legs, got a 'real job' in marketing, and spent years feeling like a cog in a machine, staring at the clock, the fluorescent lights humming over my cubicle. The dream was dead, or so I thought.

By 25, the itch came back. I couldn't do the 9-to-5 life anymore. Armed with a bit more knowledge, I launched a digital marketing agency. The first two years were a blur of 80-hour weeks fueled by cheap coffee and instant noodles. The office was my tiny apartment, and my 'staff meetings' were just me talking to my cat. But then, it happened. We landed one big client, then another. Suddenly, I wasn't just playing business owner; I *was* one. I hired a small, amazing team, we moved into a real office, and I even bought a car that didn't threaten to break down every time I hit the freeway. We were on top of the world.

And then came March 2020. In the span of about five days, I watched my entire world crumble. One by one, the emails rolled in: 'Due to the uncertainty...' 'We're pausing all contracts...' My biggest clients, the ones that paid for our salaries and our fancy coffee machine, vanished. The hardest day of my life was sitting my team down on a Zoom call and telling them I had to let them go. Seeing their faces, knowing I’d failed them, was a feeling I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I was back to square one, but this time with the crushing weight of failure on my shoulders.

The next few months were dark. I barely left my apartment, felt like a total fraud, and seriously considered just going back to a 'safe' job. But one morning, I started seeing a new pattern: businesses weren't just cutting marketing; they were desperately trying to figure out how to operate online. They needed help with remote collaboration, e-commerce, and digital presence more than ever. A tiny spark ignited. I started reaching out, not as a big-shot agency owner, but as a guy who knew how to solve this specific, urgent problem. The projects were small, the pay was a fraction of what I was used to, but it was work. It was a start.

Today, the business is growing again, but it looks completely different. It's leaner, smarter, and built on the ashes of that spectacular failure. I learned the hard way that entrepreneurship isn't a straight line up; it's a chaotic rollercoaster designed to test your limits. That week taught me more than two years of success ever could have.

So, Reddit, what's a moment you thought was the absolute end of your career or business, only for it to become an unexpected turning point?",1,1763601851.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1p1q1em,https://i.redd.it/8fzwi7up8b2g1.jpeg,Review #58: Michter's Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,"Michter's Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey

Distillery: Michter's

Age: NAS

Price: $47.99

Proof: 91.4

Nose: Noticeable rye spice for a bourbon, it's definitely not hiding behind the corn. It's bready and even has a slight must to it. Spiced oak. Clove. Some butterscotch and nougat are hiding behind the scenes, but the sweetness is mild. Kind of an interesting mix of notes here that I'm not sure necessarily work well together for me personally.

Palate: Not overly thin, but thinner than medium mouthfeel. A little sweeter than the nose. Still picking up that butterscotch and there's some caramel in there as well. Orange zest. Rye bread. It gets pretty earthy on the back end of the palate heading into the finish. A little leathery.

Finish: About medium length. Some of that earthiness carries over but it's met with a nice cherry note. It has almost like this black coffee with a dash of cherry syrup thing going on. Vanilla. More clove. More spice. Feeling how I felt about the nose here. There's some complexity, but just unsure if it really works.

Score: 4.4

Summary: I wanted to like this more and my hopes were that this bottle would push a 6/10. I like the rye's that come out of the Michter's and I'm actually a relatively big fan of the sour mash. It definitely has to do with my personal preferred flavor profile, but this just didn't do it for me. It an easy sipper, but in my opinion the rye and earthiness overpower the sweetness from the corn and the leatheriness in the palate was borderline astringent. I wouldn't mind most of these notes on their own, but I didn't feel like they worked together in harmony. In the high $40's there are just so so many other things I'd gravitate towards. Giving out an underwhelming 4.4.

2. Very Bad | Trying to choke it down but possible drain pour
3. Poor | Would drink if forced to but never under my own will

My current network consists of my ISP's router (A) with one of the ports in bridge mode connected to my own router (B). Both routers, A and B, have their own public IP addresses. Both routers also have their own Wi-Fi networks that have internet access. I can connect devices to either one just fine.

The issue stems from me hosting some websites behind router (I've enabled port forwarding for 443 and 80 to a webserver). These websites are all (to my knowledge) configured correctly; I am able to access them from public networks (e.g. coffee shop, public mall wifi, cellular internet). 

However, despite this, if any device connected to router A's LAN (Wi-Fi or ethernet) tries to connect to one of my sites, I get a ""Connection Reset by Peer"" error I can ping the public IP of router B from inside router A, and running nmap on other networks reports that the ports are indeed open on router B.

Over the years I have swapped hardware and ISPs, and yet the issue still persists. I cannot access any websites behind router B when connected to router A. All my sites are behind a reverse proxy (nginx proxy manager), which has been a constant, so I suspect something is up with it.

What tf Is Going On??","I just checked my bank statement and found **multiple unknown charges** from a place called **“Premier Express”**, all small amounts like £1.39, £1.69, £1.79, £3.88, £5.34, £7.28, etc.

Here’s the weird part:

Out of 7 Premier Express charges, 6 of them show the address:

475 Alfreton Road, Nottingham, NG7 5NH\*\*  
I Googled it, it’s literally a **convenience store** with a different name.  
I have **never** been to that road or that area or that store. strangely enough there is a dunkin near this store, which address is 457 Alfreton Road??

But then I noticed something that freaked me out:

Every single Premier Express charge lines up EXACTLY or around the dates I bought coffee at Dunkin (Exchange Arcade, City Square).

Here are my legit Dunkin transactions:

* **27 Oct 25 – Dunkin: £2.00**
* **28 Oct 25 – Dunkin: £2.00**
* **05 Nov 25 – Dunkin: £2.00**
* **07 Nov 25 – Dunkin: £2.00**
* **11 Nov 25 – Dunkin: £7.60**
* **17 Nov 25 – Dunkin: £3.80 (x2)**
* **19 Nov 25 – Dunkin: £3.80**
* **on some days, I paid cash**

And here are the “Premier Express” charges:

* **16 Oct 25 – Premier Express: £7.28**
* **27 Oct 25 – Premier Express: £5.34**
* **30 Oct 25 – Premier Express: £1.69**
* **04 Nov 25 – Premier Express: £1.79**
* **10 Nov 25 – Premier Express: £1.39 (two charges)**
* **19 Nov 25 – Premier Express: £3.88**

Now look at this pattern:

* On days I bought **£2.00** coffee at Dunkin → I get charged **£1.39–£1.79** at Premier Express
* When I bought **£7.60** at Dunkin → I get charged **£7.28** at Premier Express 
* When I bought **£3.80** at Dunkin → I get charged **£3.88 / £3+** at Premier Express 
* All charges happen **only** on days I visited Dunkin or the next day
* They always appear within the same date range 
* Even the number of transactions are identical 
* Premier Express is a completely different business in a different part of Nottingham

**I’m NOT accusing Dunkin staff**, they’re really lovely people, and that’s why I prefer to go there often. But I’m totally confused about how I’m being hit with these extra charges on the same days I visit that Dunkin.

The map in my bank app even shows the **Premier Express location**, but again, I have NEVER been there. I have attached a few screenshots below.

Has anyone seen this before? NFC skimming? Is this card cloning? A duplicate payment system? Something wrong with merchant terminals?

I’ve already noticed:

* The Dunkin charges show correctly as **“DUNKIN EXCHANGE AR”**
* The Premier Express charges are **separate** and come from a **different merchant ID, different address, different business**

This doesn’t look like a merchant descriptor issue because I’m being charged **twice** once by Dunkin, and once by Premier Express.

Is some sort of fraud going on here? Is someone skimming my contactless payments? Someone cloned my card? A nearby terminal is picking up my tap? Or for once I might assume that Premier Express is being used as some kind of processing account for Dunkin (but then why charge me twice for each purchase??

I've had health anxiety/OCD for a while, but never to this level or having to do with sensory cues. It came on so quickly, and I can't completely get rid of it. I sometimes feel like I'm living a different life now.

One night about 2 months ago, I couldn't sleep, so I took a small piece of an edible. It ended up being too much, and I woke up high and anxious. The next morning, I drank a large cup of coffee to stay awake and started feeling funny before class. I ended up having a panic attack in the stairwell. Ever since then, I am attentive to any bodily sensation that could be even remotely associated with panicking or being sick (dizziness, stomach upset, random aches and pains). I'm on high alert. There have even been times I've woken up in the middle of the night with intense full body anxiety shivers. It also seems like the sensations themselves have been happening more frequently than before.

I've gotten better at dealing with it, but it still makes me uneasy. I do have a therapist that specializes in anxiety and have tried to incorporate some breathing techniques. We might also start exposure therapy, but I'm not sure how that works with my particular triggers.

I'm looking to hear from anyone else that has experienced this and any advice or support to be offered.",2,1763600870.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

Era interesante… cuanto menos, lo más entretenido que había sucedido en días en este congelador del tamaño de una nación. Para el mundo era solo un punto más, una vida más, tan inservible como era posible, tan vana, tan insignificante. Me aterraba terminar muerta y que nadie se percatara siquiera de que algún día estuve viva, de que algún día mis pies pequeños se atrevieron a posarse sobre la fría nieve, descalzos, hasta sangrar y tinturar en profana hermosura aquella blancura pura de admirar.

Pero estaba divagando.

Desempleada, con 26 años, inmigrante colombiana en Rusia —Moscú, más específicamente—. Aquí, mujeres como yo no pasábamos desapercibidas, es verdad, pero no en los mejores aspectos. Bien nos veían como prostitutas, ladronas, niñeras de por vida, aseadoras… y así, la lista era casi tan infinita como humillante.

Sin querer, mis manos aferraron el vaso de cartón reforzado. Me parecía una enorme estupidez comprar un café con leche —o un “latte”— en Stars Coffee por ₽972,90 (rublos), más o menos 12 dólares, que si hacíamos el cambio a pesos colombianos serían cerca de $45.000. Me mordí el labio inferior sin siquiera darme cuenta cuando choqué contra algo relativamente duro al ponerme en pie de golpe, y mi café —ya frío— terminó esparcido entre mi blusa beige, ahora con una obscena mancha oscura.

Aunque para mi mala suerte (la cual no era poca), mi blusa no fue la única arruinada. Una tela oscura, contra la cual aquel líquido goteante contrastaba grotescamente.

Dios… llévame de una puta vez.

Elevé la mirada un poco, otro poco, y otro poco más, hasta ver aquello frente a mí: un hombre. Una piel ligeramente bronceada, ojos verdes que atravesaban hasta mi alma, tan preciosos, oscuros, brillantes… bien podría confundirlos con esmeraldas extraídas de las minas de la mismísima Muzo, en Boyacá.

Esa mandíbula cincelada parecía cortada a hachazos bruscos, violentos… deliberadamente violentos. Una nariz fina, pómulos resaltantes, una cicatriz más oscura que asomaba bajo el cuello de su abrigo —ahora arruinado por mi culpa— hacia su pómulo derecho. Otra cicatriz sobre el costado derecho del labio superior, y unas cuantas más que no logré detallar dada la interrupción de su voz.

—маленький мусор.

Al diablo… ¿qué mierda había dicho?

Mi mente trató de descomponer las palabras y buscar en un diccionario mental mal organizado, producto de un ruso aprendido en Duolingo. A ver… “маленький” era “pequeña” y “мусор” era “basura”. Basura.

Mi mente hizo de esa palabra un eco. La frustración de la invisibilidad forzada durante 26 años pareció estallar de golpe, y mi lengua imprudente no logró frenarse.

—Вы идёте по жизни, оскорбляя каждого, кто совершает ошибку, даже не давая ему возможности извиниться?  
(¿Vas por la vida insultando a cualquiera que comete un error sin siquiera permitir que se disculpe?)

Vi cómo su mandíbula se tensó y mis oídos lograron percibir el rechinar de sus muelas. Si esto fuese un anime, a lo mejor hasta chispas saldrían de ellas. Pero no: en vivo y en directo, los tendones de su robusto cuello se tensaron como alambres de metal hechos para no romperse jamás.

—иностранец.  
(Extranjera.)

No fue un halago ni una afirmación; en su voz sonaba a insulto.

—иностранец… me encantaría saber qué clase de país ha engendrado en sus putrefactas entrañas más oscuras a una criatura tan diminuta… y estúpida, sin lugar a dudas.

Mis labios se separaron en un gesto de sorpresa e indignación. ¿Quién diablos se creía este maldito hombre, con lo que bien podrían ser unos 1.90 de estatura y esos hombros tan anchos? Esos bíceps tensándose contra un saco que parecía hacer un esfuerzo sobrehumano para contener sus músculos cuando flexionaba el brazo para llevarse un cigarrillo encendido a la boca.

Concéntrate, cachonda desquiciada.

Y tenía razón. Debía centrarme.

—Сомневаюсь, что тебя это волнует, но если необходимо, и чтобы мы могли оскорблять друг друга более корректно…  
(Dudo que te importe, pero si es necesario, y para que podamos insultarnos con mayor propiedad…) —dije cruzándome de brazos con un gesto de superioridad estúpido en una mujer tan baja ante él—.  
—я колумбиец.  
(Soy colombiana.)

Me miró durante lo que fueron uno, dos, tal vez tres latidos largos, antes de que sus labios formaran un amago de sonrisa.

—Una puta colombiana.

Lo dijo en un español perfecto gramaticalmente, horrible con su acento ruso espeso. Su voz parecía pasar sobre grava. Me pareció eterna la espera de su respuesta; seguramente para él fue apenas un borrón cuando mi mano se estampó contra su mejilla derecha.

El sonido fue tan claro que ni siquiera percibí las exclamaciones de sorpresa a mi espalda.

Mierda.

Me congelé. Dos segundos. Lo que tardó mi cerebro en procesar la cagada más grande que había cometido en mi vida.

—Lo sien…

—No te atrevas.

Su voz me cortó. Más gruesa, más afilada. Sus ojos esmeralda me miraron lo que pareció un siglo entero, tortuoso, inaguantable.

Y entonces… reía.

El muy enfermo se estaba riendo. ¿De mí? ¿Del golpe? ¿De qué carajos?

—Дерьмо… en más de quince años nadie se había atrevido a… tu nombre.

No fue petición. No fue pregunta. Fue una orden disfrazada de curiosidad.

—I…

—¿I?

Repitió él, haciéndome sonreír por mi estupidez momentánea.

—Isabelle —dije al fin, bajo, casi aliviada de que no me hubiese devuelto el golpe.

—Isabelle… bien, ratoncita. Ahora no podrás correr.

Quise protestar; mis labios se separaron apenas. Pero él inclinó la parte superior de su cuerpo hacia mí, acortando la distancia. Lo suficiente para percibir el olor del cigarrillo y el calor atrapado entre sus labios. Labios gruesos, rojizos, suaves.

Y entonces lo escuché. Un sonido entre gruñido y risa.

—Arrugas la nariz cuando algo te inquieta, ratona.

Fruncí la frente, dispuesta a mandarlo al carajo, pero su móvil sonó y eso lo distrajo —a él y a mí—. Miró la pantalla y, antes de contestar, calló. Cuando habló, fue un ladrido.

—В пути.  
(En camino.)

Me miró. Sacó una tarjeta de su chaqueta con dedos gruesos, largos. La dejó en mi mano y, tal como había aparecido, se marchó. Aunque algo llamó mi atención.

Su culo, por supuesto.

¿El tamaño? ¿Los ojos? ¿Los músculos? ¿Esos dientes ligeramente afilados que parecían colmillos? Ja. Y se suponía que debía dejar de ser una calentona. Mi mente no ayudaba.

Pero no. No fue eso. Fue ver que detrás de él salían dos hombres que claramente lo escoltaban.

¿Cuándo?  
No los había notado en ningún momento.

Esa tarde, al llegar a mi apartamento, los pies me dolían de tanto caminar buscando empleo. Mis referencias de Colombia servían de poco aquí. El té me ayudó, pero incluso sentada en el sofá en pijama con la taza en la mano, sostenía aquella tarjeta. Un rectángulo negro como alquitrán con letras en un cirílico perfecto: «Лужим» (Luzhim). ¿Su apellido? ¿Su nombre? Bajo eso, un número dorado, elegante, discreto. Misterio. Peligro.

¿Mujer, empiezan a sonar las alarmas?

Genial. Ahora hablaba sola.

—Cierto, aunque no tan a menudo.

Perfecto. Me estaba volviendo loca.

Cuando cayó la noche, la curiosidad ya hacía eco en mi mente. Ese número. Ese nombre. Ese aroma a canela en su cigarrillo. Su perfume. Tan condenadamente reconocible que aún lo guardaba en mi memoria como un tesoro prohibido.

Vi una película. Dos. Ordené pizza. Una cerveza. Dos. Tres.

Y entonces todo se fue al carajo cuando mis dedos escribieron en la pantalla del móvil.

Hora: 7:46 p.m.  
Isabelle: «Enviar un simple ‘Hola’ sería muy común, ¿no cree usted?»

Apenas presioné enviar, casi me atraganté. Dos segundos después, los dos chulos azules aparecieron. Confirmación de lectura.

Pero no fue un mensaje lo que recibí.

Fue una llamada.

Su icono brilló en la pantalla. No mostraba su rostro, solo de su cuello a las caderas. Un traje azul oscuro sin corbata, los primeros botones sueltos.

Mi pulgar resbaló por el icono verde. Inicio. O tal vez mi fin.

No fui la primera en hablar.

—Lo común es para aquellos que temen a las consecuencias.

Pausa.

Me mordí el labio.

—No pareces de esos.

—Te equivocas.

—Lo dudo, ratoncita. Y espero que mi llamada no te haya incomodado. La idea de enviar textos cual adolescente desocupado no me va… ni a mi edad, tampoco.

Solté una risa. Baja. Incrédula. Fascinada.

—¿Tan anciano estás?

Dios santo. ¿Quién me había poseído? ¿Desde cuándo decía semejantes cosas?

El sonido al otro lado me congeló.  
¿Cómo podía existir una risa así?

Oscura. Cruel. Masculina.

—Cuida esa lengua, Isabelle. Yo no tendría problema en mostrarte cuán “anciano” soy.

¿Burla o promesa? No sabía. Pero quería más.

—Lo dice con demasiada seguridad, ¿no cree?

—Me diste tu nombre, ratona.

Mi sonrisa se desvaneció.

—No tienes idea con quién tratas, ¿verdad?

Un suspiro se escuchó de su lado.

—Te daré el resto de la noche, ratoncita. Busca mi nombre. Googlea. Investiga lo que necesites. Porque mañana llamaré de nuevo… y esta vez no te daré tanto tiempo para pensar.

—Oye, espe…

—Calla, mujer. Haz tu tarea. Y descansa. Te quiero sin ojeras mañana.

Y la línea murió.

Me dejó con la palabra en la boca.

¿Quién diablos era ese hombre?

     

     

    Cap#3

La luz del televisor parpadeaba en mi sala, iluminando a medias los restos de pizza, la cerveza a medio terminar y mis pies descalzos colgando del sofá. Pero yo no veía nada. No escuchaba nada.

Solo tenía una cosa en mente.

Luzhim.

Apreté la tarjeta negra entre mis dedos. No había más información. Solo ese nombre que se sentía como un secreto, como un disparo reprimido.

Me levanté y fui al escritorio, encendiendo la laptop con manos temblorosas. No sabía si era el frío, el alcohol o él. Google tardó demasiado en cargar. O tal vez era yo quien estaba respirando lento, demasiado lento.

Tecleé:

“Лужим”  
Enter.

No esperé… algo normal. Pero Dios… no esperaba **esto**.

Lo primero que apareció fue un titular con letras enormes:

**“Сергей Лужим — el fantasma de Moscú.”**

Mi garganta se cerró.

La primera fotografía era él. Un poco más joven, cabello más corto, las mismas cicatrices. El gesto frío, el ceño ligeramente fruncido.

Abrí el artículo.

Leí.  
Y cada línea hacía que algo dentro de mí se encogiera.

“Líder no oficial de una de las tres familias más antiguas de la Bratva.”  
“Investigado por el asesinato de seis empresarios en 2020.”  
“Supuesto vínculo con operaciones ilegales en Europa del Este.”  
“Apodado ‘el Fantasma’ por su capacidad de desaparecer sin rastro.”

Tragué saliva.

El aire se volvió denso.

Yo… había regado mi café sobre este hombre. Lo había insultado. Le había enviado un mensaje. Y encima de eso, él tenía mi nombre.

Y probablemente… ya sabía dónde vivía.

Mis ojos bajaron por el artículo:

**“Se desconoce información sobre su vida personal. Se rumora que no mantiene parejas, pero algunas fuentes afirman que una vez marcado por él… nadie vuelve a desaparecer.”**

Sentí un escalofrío subir por mi columna.

Me aparté de la pantalla, respirando agitada, intentando procesar. Tenía que detenerme. Tenía que dejar esto. Tenía que…

El móvil vibró.

Un mensaje.  
¿Un número desconocido?.  
No. No desconocido. **Su** número.

Me quedé quieta, más congelada que la nieve de Moscú.

El mensaje entrante contenía tan solo una frase.

**“No estés asustada, ratoncita. no Aún.”**

Se me cayó el móvil al suelo.

—¿Qué…? ¿Cómo…?

El “aún” me taladró.

Me agaché para recogerlo y mis manos temblaban demasiado. Tenía el corazón golpeando costillas como si quisiera escapar.

Otro mensaje entró antes de que pudiera reaccionar.

**“Quiero escuchar qué descubriste.”**

No contesté.

No podía.

La pantalla se iluminó de nuevo.

**“Isabelle.”**

Mi nombre escrito así, solo, era una amenaza.

Y una caricia.

Maldita sea.

Me forcé a escribir.

Isabelle:  
*“Eres… peligroso.”*

Un segundo.  
Dos.  
Tres.

Alexandrovich:  
**“Para la mayoría.”**

Lo peor no fue el mensaje.  
Fue el punto al final, aquel que em hacia pensar y sentir que esa palabra estaba dirigida directamente a mí.

Isabelle:  
*“¿Qué quieres?”*

Esta vez tardó más.  
Diez segundos.  
Veinte.  
Treinta.

Pensé que no contestaría.

Hasta que lo hizo.

Alexandrovich:  
**“Verte.”**

Mi corazón se detuvo, un ultimo latido fuerte parecio enviar la sangre hecha lava por mi torrente sanguineo haciéndome casi soltar no se si un suspiro o un jadeo

*Te dije que nos iba a devorar*

Me recordó aquella fracción de mi mente a quien casi mire de mala gana como si la tuviese sentada a mi costado

\-no dijiste un carajo

Espete casi de malas hacia la nada antes de reaccionar y centrar la vista de nuevo en el móvil en mi mano y finalmente decidir responder de l manera mas coherente posible porque cualquiera haría lo mismo…¿no?.

Isabelle:  
*“No.”*

Alexandrovich:  
**“Te pregunté qué descubriste. No te pregunté si querías verme.”**

Tragué saliva.

Isabelle:  
*“No voy a salir.”*

Alexandrovich:  
**“No pedí que salieras.”**

Me quedé helada.

Y entonces alguien **tocó la puerta**.

Una vez.  
Fuerte.  
Contundente.

Me paralicé por completo en mi lugar sintiendo como las piernas dejaron de ser carne, musculo, tejido para volverse casi gelatina.

Otro mensaje vibro en mi móvil el cual me miraba desde mi mano casi burlándose de mi cobardia.

Alexandrovich:  
**“Abre, ratoncita.”**

No.  
No podía ser.  
No podía haber llegado tan rápido.  
No podía—

Una segunda serie de golpes.  
Más intensa.  
Más exigente.

Tomé el móvil, apenas respirando.

Isabelle:  
*“No estás ahí.”*

Los tres puntos de escritura aparecieron.

Desaparecieron.

Aparecieron.

Sergey:  
**“¿Quieres comprobarlo?”**

Otro golpe.  
Mi puerta ya estaba temblando.

Mi alma también.

Mi mente gritaba *corre*, *salta por la ventana*, *esconde la tarjeta*, *haz algo*.  
Pero mi cuerpo estaba clavado al suelo.  
Enraizado en miedo.  
O… algo peor.

Deseo.  
Curiosidad.  
Atracción de autopista antes del choque.

Me acerqué.  
Sin decisión.  
Sin lógica.

Solo… llevada por una fuerza distinta. Más profunda.

Mi mano tocó el pomo.

Y entonces, sin abrir, escuché su voz.  
No a través del móvil.

**Detrás de la puerta. A centímetros de mi cara.**

—Isabelle.

Mi nombre salió de sus labios como un filo.  
Como una orden.  
Como un reclamo.

Mis rodillas casi cedieron.

—Ábreme.

No gritó.  
No pidió.  
Ordenó, realmente no necesitaba hacerlo, parecía que su voz tenia efecto en mi.  
Con la peligrosa calma de alguien que nunca en su vida escuchó un “no”. Y aun si lo habría escuchado, estaba segura de que nadie vivía para corroborar aquello.

—No… puedo —susurré, apenas si contenía aire en mis pulmones.

Del otro lado, su respiración se escuchó.  
Lenta.  
Profunda.  
Hundiéndose en mis huesos.

—Ratona… —susurró con una suavidad mortal—. Me dejaste entrar desde que me diste tu nombre.

Mi corazón explotó en el pecho.

—Ahora abre.

Me quedé ahí.  
Suspendida.  
Aterrada.  
Hipnotizada.  
Atrapada entre la puerta y su voz.

Y lo hice.

Giré el pomo.

Abrí.

Y ahí estaba.

Alexandrovich Luzhim.

En mi puerta.  
Con su abrigo oscuro aún goteando por la nieve.  
El cigarrillo apagado entre los dedos.  
Los ojos verdes clavados en mí como si ya me poseyeran.

Y sonrió.

—Buenas noches, Isabelle.

La forma en que pronunció mi nombre…  
No.  
Nada en mi vida me preparó para eso.

No para él.

Y menos para lo que dijo después.

1p1ppkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1p1ppkz/update_so_i_treated_the_coworker_whos_been/,UPDATE: So I treated the coworker who's been leaving tampons in our restroom to coffee. He was actually so sweet about it.,"Thank you to everyone who commented and helped ease my concerns. I admit I was overreacting a bit. I think I was just surprised and taken off guard that morning when I saw him.

This week I actually went into the office early again just to speak to him in person without anyone else overhearing. I told him that I thought his gesture was sweet and wanted to know if he wanted to grab coffee after work as a way to thank him. He accepted. 

FIRST. He thanked me for not telling our coworkers (he doesn't mind if I tell people outside of work as long as I leave his name and personal info out). 

He told me that he didn't want to make a big deal about the gesture because he was used to being in similar situations working around women. He used to work as a lifeguard at an indoor park when he was in high school/ college, but at that job it was mostly other men. He told me that the number 1 task that the other guys hated was being assigned to clean the women's restroom when it was time to close. That's because the guy lifeguards could only clean it once it was fully cleared, so whoever was assigned to it would always be the last lifeguard to clock out. 

But he'd just volunteer to do it since there was no way to avoid it. He told me that he got to know a lot of the regular women there as well as the High School swim coaches and students on the ladies swim team, and they were completely comfortable around him. They'd let him in even when they were still using the bathroom as long as they weren't actively changing or butt naked.

He thanked me for listening and said he was glad I didn't find it creepy. He also opened up and said the main reason he started bringing tampons (aside form the office mainly being filled with women) is because he grew up the eldest son with 3 brothers and no sister, and he always wanted a baby sister to look after but never got one, so he's really hoping for a daughter one day.

I told him I thought that was so sweet (because most men only want a son as a preference, so I wasn't expecting any guy to say that). 

  
I offered to pay for the coffee like promised and we ended the evening after talking a bit more about home life, we're hoping to make it a weekly thing now after work.

  
Thanks all for your reassurance. Hopefully it's a little wholesome story that'll brighten your week as well (:",141,1763600857.0,AskFeminists,13,0.97,False
