1ho14t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ho14t4/should_i_f33_fight_for_my_relationship/,Should I [F33] Fight for my relationship?,"\[F33\] have been with my fiance \[M34\] for over 7 months. 

Our relationship moved quickly, and I moved in with him a month and a half into dating and we got engaged 5 months into dating. 

Throughout our relationship, I was in school and stopped working a month after moving in, so he has supported me for almost 6 months, and my only contribution has been cooking and cleaning. In this economy, it has not been easy for him, and he is under immense financial stress. I had (and still have) every intention of paying him at least 2 or 3 paychecks once I start working while paying half the bills. I graduated this month and will be licensed after passing my boards in January.

My fiance has been very kind, sweet, and supportive. He has a lot of qualities I would wish in a partner. He cares for me when I'm sick, buys me lunch, and showers me with words of appreciation every day. He tells me he thinks of me all day, every day. Most times, I feel like the luckiest girl.

However, I have come to realize that I cannot reconcile with him in how different we are. Initially, he told me he was working on becoming closer to our faith \[This was very important to me while we were dating\]. I have not seen evidence of this in our seven months together. If anything, I feel as if I am drifting from my faith in our time together.

He drinks more than four cans or bottles of beer most days or a whole wine bottle in a day. I have tried to have a discussion with him about reducing his alcohol intake and even challenged him to have a dry November. However, he counters me by saying drinking is his way of dealing with stress and ADHD. I suggested going to the gym, and he did it for two weeks, then stopped. I did not notice the level of how much he drinks until 2 months into moving in with him. It's strange I would not have caught it, as my dad was an alcoholic while I was growing up.

My fiance becomes sensitive when I bring it up and becomes defensive while recounting how he was able to stop drinking cold turkey previously.

Another thing I cannot reconcile with is that he does not pick up after himself. When I first moved in, he told me that he had experienced a period of depression and his place had just turned into a mess. I didn't mind, and we cleaned it together. He would vacuum every day and pick up after himself. If anything, he would be upset with me for not cleaning up properly. 

Now, he leaves his dirty plates on the couch and coffee table and empty bottles of alcohol on the floor. The living room is always a mess, and he gets upset with me for not wanting to spend time with him there. It became evident to me that not picking up after himself is a formed bad habit, not a phase of depression.

He leaves his clothes on the floor and it drives me crazy, I know he works a hard job but to pick up after yourself should not be so hard as an adult.

For whatever reason he doesnt like people pointing out his personal flaws or attempt to change his routine. He likes to feel in control of his life as likely a result of childhood trauma.

I have seen him BIG make changes in this aspect to accomodate me to become more comfortable and at home, so its not that he is beyond any change. He is just resistant to it.

Id prefer he recognize the need to change on his own and make the attempt to change.

I love my fiance very much. He is incredibly supportive, very giving, and soft-hearted. I know there are not many men like him out there, and I should be grateful for him and the support he has given me.

He grew up in a harsh environment with irresponsible parents but works hard and is responsible in his career. I am very proud of how he overcame his situation, and I respect him.

However, I have reached a point where I am tired of asking him to improve on some bad habits and meet resistance or getting a few weeks of attempts before reverting back.

I have also noticed that his communication style is different from mine. If we are arguing about something, instead of reflecting on what I am saying, he will point out a wrong I did in the past that is unrelated to the current conversation.

If I point out that he did or does something, he becomes sensitive and will deny that he did it when we were both there to witness him do it. He responds impulsively to win the argument, then apologizes later after he stops to think it through.

We do eventually meet a resolution but the initial communication is rocky.

If I say or do something that offends him he immediately responds without thinking it through or pointing out that my actions or words were hurtful. This is a new experience for me as in my family we always point out when someone wrongs us rather than respond in anger because words spoken can not be taken back. He has never said anything too crazy, but his words still do upset me.

I don't like arguments, I avoid them as much as I can or attempt to resolve an issue before it gets there. He has no issues arguing, he almost impulsively ends up in one with me but since I am conscious not to get into one; I almost always navigate my way from it, then talk it out with him when I have calmed my thoughts.

Overall, we moved too fast. Now that I am not spending all my time in school worrying about passing, I have time to realize that our relationship is maybe unhealthy. Should I walk away, or should I keep trying with him?

In my religion marriage is forever, divorce is not recognized unless infidelity or DV. You also dont give up because things are hard. Every season of hardship passes.

He has accepted me as a whole and my imperfections, is it wrong that im not able to do the same?

He has also made strides in improvements in his lack of emotional regulation but it comes out once in awhile. Idk if I can enter a lifetime commitment when I recognize the issues before the marriage.

    **TL;DR;** 
    

After finishing school I am finding it difficult to accept my Fiance's drinking habits and his inability to clean up the house. I am realizing our communication styles are very different and although he treats me well, I wonder if its time to end the relationship or delay marriage until improvement.",1,1735372885.0,relationships,2,1.0,False
1ho12b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ho12b6/its_my_birthday_my_pregnant_wife_doesnt_respect/,"It's my birthday. My pregnant wife doesn't respect me and thinks I hate her, so she didn't get me anything for my birthday and it's my fault.","I don't know where to begin my story and throwaway account for reasons.

My wife (28F) and I (30M) have been married for 4 years and we don't have a very romantic marriage. I carried out relationship with restaurants and small weekend trips, then I was laid off at the beginning of COVID and my wife was living with her parents in her master's program. I ended up moving into her parents house due to financial problems and we had to sleep in separate rooms to appease their rules. After 4 months my wife graduated and got a low paying job in a town 50 miles away in a LCOL area while I was still job hunting, just so we could move out. We found an apartment and moved in together for the first time. It took a whole year after that for me to find any employment and I settled for a retail job. During that time we were barely making it at $1,500 over the qualifications for food stamps. We never did anything together other than maybe once a month go out to eat. Sex was happening maybe once a week. Then suddenly in 2022 both of us found excellent jobs at the same time and our incomes tripled in a month.

My wife had never lived on her own before. It's been a struggle to get her to do regular house work even when I do 75% of it. She pretty much only does the laundry and anything else like cooking, dishes, yard work, vacuuming, deep cleaning a bathroom, mopping, cleaning out the cars, and whatever else you can think of is all my responsibility. I've let the kitchen go a whole 9 days of stacking and ignoring before I had to say enough, this is disgusting and we won't live like this. I'm actually quite the cook, which is as much a benefit as it is a curse for us because I actually have standards for separating and organizing stuff in the kitchen. She doesn't live up to them despite all the explaining I do, which is somewhat my fault for being so precise about everything when it really isn't necessary most of the time, just more efficient for me. Unfortunately her cooking is worse than mine and I hyper critize my own creations so you can imagine what I think of hers. So when she asks if I like something she makes, usually I just tell her exactly what I think. Sometimes it's actually good, and sometimes her favorite comfort dish looks and tastes like slop. She wasn't having it anymore and preferred my cooking to her own. So I took the kitchen over along with grocery shopping and told her to do everything else in the house and that went over terribly. She didn't say no; she just doesn't do them, complains that grocery shopping is all the time she got to herself, and plays on her phone while she watches TV while I am home cooking.

Well fast forward to 2024, we have a toddler, lived through the deaths of three of our friends, were forced to move to a HCOL area by necessity, pay for daycare so we can both work, and are now have roughly the same discretionary income we had were when we were poor. We don't even go out to eat anymore because I can regularly make food at home that is as good as the restaurants serving $20 plates. The issue now is that with a toddler that needs to be watched, she can use that as an excuse to not do anything. She doesn't watch TV anymore (shee removed it from the living room so the toddler doesn't watch, her choice not mine) and instead just sits on the couch playing a phone game while our toddler runs around and plays by herself. We have sex about once every 3 months.

I decided that since all she wants to do is be a mother, that she should just be pregnant. We got her pregnant again. It only took 1 night at a hotel. Now she is doing something productive while being on the couch.

Unfortunately I got a promotion at work that has started requiring that I work 5 12 hour shifts. There's been a small pay bump but nothing significant enough to make up for all the lost time. I also have to commute over 1 hour each direction. I am no longer able to keep up with the chores and my wife is pregnant and also lazy, so the house is literally a mess 24/7 and I worry about my toddlers health. I found broken glass shards on the floor this morning where she plays. I stayed up until 11pm last night doing dishes to keep the place tidy.

We took PTO today and Monday-Tuesday so that I could work on several projects that have been stacking up in my absence. I told her the best thing she could do is get out of the house while I work on sorting our tens of moving boxes in the garage and put my tools up on the wall. My wife cried that I don't spend enough time with her. She asked me if I wanted to have sex and I told her no, I don't. She then asked me if I was still attracted to her and I said she is pregnant and hurt herself last time we had sex (true) and I need her to be able to watch the toddler while I work in the garage since that's what we took time off to do. She just kept crying and repeating herself and I just kept repeating myself. This isn't the first time I had taken time off to do this project. Six months ago we took time off but my wife got sick and I had to watch them both instead of working on our projects.

It feels like despite working very hard to go from nothing in a short period of time, we are still in the exact same position we were when we were near poverty. It's taken a toll on both of us. Our marriage is suffering. We aren't having sex because of the stress of being parents and having to work too much.

Today is my birthday and I got nothing but a a wife with a broken heart, spilled coffee I bought her all over my front seat (didn't even get myself one), and a ticket to sleeping on the couch in the living room. Good night Reddit.",5,1735372593.0,self,2,1.0,False
1ho11ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ho11ou/choosing_the_perfect_rug_size_for_every_room_in/,Choosing the Perfect Rug Size for Every Room in Your Home,"Rugs are more than just a decorative element—they’re essential for defining spaces, adding warmth, and tying a room’s design together. However, choosing the right rug size is crucial to achieving the perfect balance of style and functionality. Whether you're looking for [living room rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), a cozy **round rug**, or luxurious [carpets Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), this guide will help you find the ideal fit for every room in your home.

# 1. Living Room Rugs: Defining Your Space

The living room is often the heart of the home, and the right rug size can help anchor your furniture arrangement. Here are some tips:

* **Large Rugs for Spacious Rooms:** For a luxurious feel, opt for a large rug that fits all furniture legs on it. This creates a cohesive look and enhances the grandeur of the space.
* **Smaller Rugs for Cozy Spaces:** In compact living rooms, place the rug under the front legs of sofas and chairs to define the seating area.
* **Round Rugs for Statement Pieces:** A **round rug** can be a great focal point, especially in modern or eclectic spaces. Position it under a circular coffee table for a harmonious design.

For a touch of elegance, explore [luxury rugs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) that combine intricate patterns with premium materials, elevating your living room’s aesthetic.

# 2. Rugs for the Dining Room

In the dining area, the rug should complement your table and chairs while being functional.

* **Size Matters:** Choose a rug that extends at least 24-30 inches beyond the dining table on all sides. This ensures chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out.
* **Shape Harmony:** Match the rug shape to the table. For round dining tables, a **round rug** works beautifully, while rectangular tables pair best with rectangular rugs.
* **Durable Materials:** Dining room rugs should be easy to clean and resistant to stains, making materials like wool or low-pile synthetic fibers ideal.

# 3. Bedroom Rugs: Adding Comfort Underfoot

Rugs in the bedroom should add warmth and comfort while enhancing the room’s design.

* **Large Rugs for Full Coverage:** Position a large rug under the bed, ensuring it extends at least 18-24 inches on all sides.
* **Layered Look:** For smaller rugs, place one on either side of the bed or at the foot of the bed for a layered and cozy look.
* **Round Rugs for Unique Spaces:** A **round rug** at the center of the room or by a reading nook can create a soft, inviting atmosphere.

To add a luxurious feel, consider plush **luxury rugs in Dubai** crafted from premium materials like silk blends or hand-knotted wool.

# 4. Hallways and Entryways: Creating First Impressions

In high-traffic areas like hallways and entryways, the right rug can make a bold statement while protecting your floors.

* **Runners for Narrow Spaces:** Use a runner rug that leaves 4-6 inches of exposed floor on all sides to create a balanced look.
* **Durable Options:** Choose rugs with low piles or flatweaves that can withstand frequent foot traffic.
* **Patterned Carpets in Dubai:** Dubai is known for its vibrant and stylish carpets. Opt for a runner with intricate patterns or bold colors to leave a lasting impression.

# 5. Rugs for Outdoor Spaces

Don’t overlook outdoor areas when planning your rug placements.

* **Size Proportion:** Choose a rug that accommodates your outdoor furniture arrangement, such as a seating or dining area.
* **Weather-Resistant Materials:** Look for outdoor rugs made from durable, weather-resistant materials like polypropylene.
* **Round Rugs for Smaller Spaces:** A **round rug** can soften the look of small patios or balconies, adding a stylish yet functional touch.

# 6. Why Choose Rugs and Carpets in Dubai?

Dubai is renowned for its high-quality rugs and carpets, offering a diverse range of styles to suit every space:

* **Luxury Rugs in Dubai:** For those seeking premium options, Dubai’s collections feature hand-knotted designs, intricate details, and plush textures.
* **Affordable Carpets in Dubai:** If you’re looking for budget-friendly options, there’s no shortage of stylish and durable carpets that don’t compromise on quality.
* **Custom Rugs:** Many Dubai retailers offer customization services, allowing you to create the perfect rug tailored to your room’s dimensions and style.

# 7. Final Tips for Choosing Rug Sizes

* **Measure Your Space:** Always measure your room and furniture layout to determine the ideal rug size.
* **Think About Placement:** Ensure your rug enhances the space without overwhelming it. Proper placement can make a room feel larger and more cohesive.
* **Consider Layers:** Layering rugs can add depth and texture, especially in living rooms and bedrooms.

So this girl got hired at my tattoo shop and we hit things off pretty quickly after we met.. Ended up dating/living with her for almost a year.. Getting a cat, starting a life, we were happy... we both already had a drinking problem but it definitely developed into something that you could call an addiction.. Over the year, stupid drunk fights, petty arguments, wasnt even common enough to care though. Basically ended things just because I got bored and wanted something new and exciting to accompany my lifestyle since she was getting better and I wasnt...

 Got into a relationship pretty quickly after, which lasted a little less than a year.. A shit show from the start (Obviously) I got sober within that relationship due to her help and realized I never loved the girl and needed to end things because the liquor was the only thing to make her tolerable human to be around at all (Whole nother story though/mostly my fault as well)...

 That relationship ended the past month the only thing thats been on my mind is the girl I started my life with and was happy with at one point..
(She's by no means the most attractive woman i was with or am strictly lusting over, have many other exes in relationships that I couldnt care less about) 

 Anyways we've messaged and talked on the phone and were both happy to tell eachother we are both sober now and got to have a conversation that it felt like we never got to have. It felt great... Contemplated meeting up for coffee but I said I dont think it'd be a great idea since Im still hung up on her and she currently has a boyfriend... We said our goodbyes then on Christmas day said she still wanted to get coffee... I just saw the message now since it was on the only other messaging we have eachother on and basically just ""crashed out"" 

Looking for literally any and all advice I dont what im feeling (Except sadness about the girl I didnt even break up with recently)

We have friends in common who introduced us. According to them, she was tired of being treated like some sex doll—every guy she met turned into a sleep-and-dump scenario she was sick of repeating. She said she wanted something serious with someone willing to put in the effort.



So I decided to date her. On my first attempt to invite her to dinner, she was at a pool party with a guy friend (just the two of them). Apparently, the guy was having a heartache. Fair enough—some women have that kind of friendship. Strange behavior if you’re trying to meet a serious guy, but whatever. I didn’t think that was for me, so I moved on.



A month later, she asked me why I hadn’t asked her out yet.



I gave it another shot. We tried to arrange a date. She was only free on Thursdays, so I asked her out. She said, “Not this Thursday—I can’t really go on a date.” No problem. Only that Thursday, she posted a picture on Instagram wearing a sexy red dress. Still looking for serious guys, I guess. Or hey, maybe it was someone’s birthday. Who knows?



The next Thursday comes.



“Do you want to have breakfast or dinner?”

“Breakfast!”

“Great! Want me to pick a place, or do you have one in mind?”

*Sends Google Maps location*

“Awesome! What time works for you? I’m free all morning.”

“10:00 AM.”



She was 40 minutes late. The moment she sat down, she said, “Sorry for being late, but I have to be someplace else in twenty.”



I get it. We all have stuff to do. I suggested she could go and take care of her business, and we could meet that night for dinner. She said it was okay, and we went ahead with breakfast.



She had one cup of coffee. Just one.



I did most of the talking. She barely engaged and even yawned. Then we said goodbye.



Later, our friends asked how the date went, and I put on my best smile to praise her. A true gentleman.



Then I heard her version.

She said I didn’t even try to have sex with her. That I made no effort to get to know her and wasn’t interested in her, which is why there was no spark. She claimed she was hoping I’d take her to my place that morning and screw her brains out. She also said I might have been too timid.



Of course, it was pure fiction. This year alone, I’ve had sex with multiple partners—including one Russian woman who barely spoke English.



At first, my friends didn’t believe my side of the story until I laid out all the details (her being late, etc.). Their jaws dropped. She hadn’t mentioned any of it—her attitude, her lateness, nothing. Sadly, though, some still believe her version.



What I don’t get is the lie. Why tell her friends she wanted something serious, then complain she didn’t get the Fifty Shades of Grey treatment? And why tarnish my reputation when I was nothing but kind and honest?",3,1735372398.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening Versus At-Home Methods
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a bright, radiant smile can significantly impact your confidence and how others perceive you. When it comes to teeth whitening, you can choose between professional treatments and at-home methods. Understanding the benefits of each can help you make an informed decision about which option is best for you.

### Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening treatments are typically performed by dentists. Here are some key advantages:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Immediate Results:** One of the most significant benefits is the quick transformation. Often, professional whitening procedures can lighten your teeth by several shades in just one visit. If you have an upcoming event, this can be a game-changer.
- **Customized Treatment:** Dentists provide tailored approaches based on your unique dental needs. They assess the condition of your teeth and gums before recommending the best whitening method.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Professionals use higher concentrations of whitening agents than those available in stores. This means that the results are more noticeable and long-lasting.
- **Safety Assurance:** When a dentist performs the procedure, you have an expert ensuring that your teeth and gums are protected. They can also monitor for any adverse reactions during the process.
- **Follow-Up Care:** After a professional treatment, generally, dentists will provide aftercare instructions and may offer touch-up treatments. This ongoing support can help maintain your new smile.

### At-Home Teeth Whitening Methods

At-home whitening options, like whitening strips, toothpaste, and trays, are widely available, and they offer some benefits as well:

- **Cost-Effective:** Generally, at-home products are cheaper than professional whitening. They can fit easily within your budget while still helping you achieve a brighter smile.
- **Convenience:** You can whiten your teeth on your schedule. Whether it’s in the morning, evening, or during your lunch break, you can do it whenever you choose.
- **Simple to Use:** Many at-home kits come with easy-to-follow instructions. You don’t need to visit a dentist, making the process less time-consuming.
- **Variety of Options:** There’s no shortage of products. From over-the-counter strips to custom trays, you can select a method that suits your preferences.

### Disadvantages of Each Method

While both professional and at-home whitening methods have their perks, they each come with disadvantages as well:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Professional Whitening Drawbacks

- **Higher Cost:** As mentioned, professional treatments can be expensive. If you’re working with a tight budget, this might not be a viable option.
- **Time Commitment:** Dental visits can take an hour or more, including waiting time. Some people may find this inconvenient.

#### At-Home Method Drawbacks

- **Delayed Results:** At-home products typically take more time to show results. It might take several applications before you see a significant whitening effect.
- **Varied Effectiveness:** Many over-the-counter products are not as powerful and may not provide the same consistent results as professional treatments. Users can often experience uneven whitening.
- **Potential for Sensitivity:** Some people may experience tooth sensitivity with at-home methods, especially if they overuse the products.

### Which Method is Right for You?

Professional teeth whitening is often the preferred choice for many due to its immediate results and safety. Dental professionals use stronger agents and techniques that can lighten your teeth by several shades in just a single session. This method not only ensures you get the best possible results but also minimizes potential risks associated with improper use of bleaching products.

On the other hand, at-home teeth whitening options offer flexibility and convenience. They allow you to whiten your teeth at your own pace, making it easy to fit into your daily routine. While at-home methods may take longer to show results, many people find them effective and cost-efficient in the long run.

*Boom.*

Dust rained from the ceiling onto the map table before us, and Chris swiped it away from the topographical lines with a weary hand. “So, we’re all in agreement?”

Around the conference room table, everyone else nodded, their faces drawn. The rest of the day had been nothing short of awful; Sandra and her researchers had worked overtime to keep Sean stabilized, his wounds somehow worse upon their expert inspection. The bullet that had entered above his hip splintered upon impact, and Sean lost a lot of blood in the three surgeries it took to remove it. His ribs were cracked in two places, and he had a concussion from being too close to his own grenades. Shrapnel peppered his torso, and it took hours to stitch him up. Eve and her healers threw everything they had into the fight, and between them, the Head Researcher and matriarch of Ark River had come as close to a miracle as anyone could. Our leader now slept under the influence of generous sedation in one of the hospital cots, but while his life had been saved, Sean’s position as commander had to be filled in the interim. Ethan refused the position, wishing to remain with his Workers, and Sandra couldn’t leave her patients, which meant the role fell one again to a Ranger.

Chris sighed, though I couldn’t quite tell if it was relief or dread from how his shoulders slumped. “Okay. As acting commander, I think our first priority should be to evacuate as many wounded from the city as possible, and work to offset our losses. What’s the status on the front?”

“Organ soldiers are massing all along the line.” Josh stared blankly at the map, his face ashen, though I could tell from the redness of his eyes that he’d been one of many people to shed angry tears. “They’ve been pounding our positions with artillery for the past hour now. I think we’re in for an all-out assault before sundown.”

News of Andrea’s death, along with Kaba’s, had spread through the ranks like wildfire, and the resistance were noticeably demoralized at losing yet another of their influential leaders. Our gate guards had already begun to report numerous attempted desertions from resistance cells, finding abandoned positions where the fighters simply picked up their guns and headed for the refugee camps to wait out the war. What survivors remained from the underground Castle had been evacuated through the long, grimy sewer tunnels beneath the city, but this only created further human logjam in the already crowded southern districts of Black Oak. Civilians from all over were trying to flee the fighting, but with the mutants outside the gates, and the snows becoming more and more frequent, there was nowhere for the masses to run. Food had run low, one of our researchers had discovered contamination in the local water supply which required a boil order, and there weren’t enough intact houses or tents for everyone. Frostbite cases were coming in, and a few old people had frozen to death in the brisk night air. It was a nightmare of human suffering that could only get worse, and Chris had inherited it all as his first day being commander.

Looking down at my arm, I picked at the yellow sash tied there to demarcate my own resulting promotion, since it would be a while before I had time to visit a seamstress. I wouldn’t have minded going from lieutenant to captain if it hadn’t come with the additional, temporary step-up in responsibility; assuming Chris’s old job.

*Will there ever be a time someone becomes Head Ranger without someone else being killed?*

“Yet my scouts report more withdrawal activity in the north.” In response to Josh’s musings, Adam frowned at the map, hand on his sword hilt, one thumb rubbing the pommel in idle contemplation. “At first we thought it might be supply units leaving to restock, but there are multiple ELSAR units pulling back to the northern border. Some of our observation posts even reported skirmishes between ELSAR proper and their Auxiliary hounds. Perhaps the attack on the negotiations wasn’t sanctioned by Koranti?”

“I think so too.” I couldn’t help but nod at Adam, his words almost perfectly in line with my thoughts.

Others turned to look at me, but I turned to Chris, as he was commander now, and I knew he’d understand. “Crow purposefully left Sheriff Wurnauw exposed so he had nowhere to run but their observation post, and then she had her gunners hit it with a heavy crossfire. Even if she couldn’t predict Sean chasing Wurnauw down, Crow knew the firefight between both sides would likely kill anyone inside that shop, which means this was premeditated. She meant to take out our leadership with the rocket attack, then remove her provisional government competition by killing the sheriff. I’d wager there are probably some others we don’t know about who were killed behind the scenes, local politicians, councilmen, maybe even the mayor. She’s trying to take over Barron County, and since Koranti doesn’t share power, I’d say she’s fighting him too.”

“Which means untold suffering for the innocents caught in the middle.” Eve folded her arms and shook her honey-colored head at the map in sadness. “After all, by your own account, these ‘Organs’ don’t hesitate at cruelty of the most extreme kinds. Our healers are reporting numerous young women who’ve tried to kill themselves in our care, because of the abuse they suffered at the Auxiliaries’ hands. We have to protect the people from further violence.”

Sandra perked up a little, the two sharing a mutual look of support due to their combined roles as medical personnel. “Some of our patients from the civilian sector are reporting that Organ troops are using detention facilities where they hold political dissidents as staging areas, since they know we won’t attack them. We have the chance to demonstrate to the people of Black Oak that we are the morally superior choice of government, if we can adequately shield them from the conflict. I think we should consider not only evacuating wounded, but also non-combatants to strategic refugee camps in the countryside.”

“That’ll mean drawing more fighters away from the front line.” Josh set his jaw with a hardened gaze, a cold gravity to his words that sapped further hope from the room. “And besides, we’re already seeing refugees coming *back* through our southern gate from the outside. There’s too many freaks beyond the wall, so unless you’ve got enough material to fortify these ‘camps’ we’re just sending them out to slaughter.”

In my head, I saw again the farmhouse from the southlands, the gore-spattered interior, the dead family ripped to pieces and stuffed behind piles of debris for ‘storage’. New Wilderness had been built on a hilltop before the Breach opened, and the palisade wall that once ringed it had taken the entire fort a long time to raise. Even if we could equip all the refugees with adequate weapons, tools, rations, and warm clothing, there was no way they’d all be able to find suitable hilltops with fresh water nearby, or get protective walls erected in time. Most would die, either from cold, starvation, disease, or worst of all, the mutants.

*Even if the regular freaks didn’t get them, Vecitorak certainly would. He’d have a field day, ambushing an entire column of helpless civilians. They wouldn’t stand a chance.*

Quiet up until this point, Ethan glanced at Chris, his bearded face shadowed with doubt. “My boys can’t work fast enough to set up both refugee centers and maintain logistics for our campaign. They’re dead tired as it is, they need a break. If it if true that the mercenaries are pulling out, then this might be our best chance to take the city.”

Adam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the rest of us, head cocked to one side to accentuate his point. “It still doesn’t answer the question as to why Koranti just gave up and left. Even if there are a thousand Organs in Black Oak, Koranti’s mercs are better trained than the Auxiliaries. He’s got unlimited logistics outside the county line, he has an army of well-equipped soldiers, and yet he’s retreating? Think about it, the radios are working again, they haven’t tried to intercept our comms since the exchange . . . this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It could be that Koranti wants us to kill each other, and then swoop in once it’s over to clean up the pieces.” Ethan stroked his scruffy face with one oil-stained hand. “He didn’t strike me as stupid. Arrogant, maybe, but not stupid. If the Organs really have mutinied, then he’s better off letting us use up all our ammo on each other, and not on his higher-quality troops.”

Chris ran a set of fingers through his disheveled brown hair, and stared at the map in front of him, littered with little tokens depicting unit placement. “It could be that he didn’t expect to lose the Auxiliaries so quickly and is pulling out his heavy weapons to avoid Crow taking them for herself. I figure he doesn’t want a three-way civil war on his hands, which means he’d rather lose all his local muscle than see them take up arms against him. Either way, we can’t pass this up, not when half of the enemy is leaving down, and taking all their big guns with them.”

I leaned forward on the table to point out a few places near the frontline. “A runner from Sergeant McPherson said he noticed less artillery fire than usual from the north. There’s lots of infantry moving in, but it seems their support is faltering. Josh is right, the Organs are getting ready for something big, but without Koranti’s regulars they might be vulnerable.”

Chris took some of the tokens in hand, and moved the pieces around on the map as he talked. “The enemy is massing most of its units in the center, some 800 by the look of it. I think they expect us to bunch up to meet them by the same number, and since they’ve got more men in the city than us, they want to grind us down. If we can pull most of our forces from the center to the flanks, we can encircle and destroy them unit by unit instead of facing them on equal terms. That way, we can make the most of our numbers while they are forced to defend every inch of the front.”

“If they push on the center while we’re attacking the flanks, the enemy could break through.” Ethan made an uncertain half-frown and wiped his hands on his overhauls to be sure they were free of grime before pointing out what he meant on the paper.

“So we move faster than they do.” Chris took Ethan’s comments in stride, his tone guiding and instructive, reminding me of just how well suited he was for such a role. “We hit them hard, use every shell, every mortar, every heavy weapon system we’ve got. Even the exterior scouts can harass their convoys in the north of the city walls. I want them to think we’re everywhere, all at once.”

At the mention of his infamous scouts, Adam straightened up with an air of pride. “I’ll lead the patrols to our west. Anything they do, we’ll see and report. *Amica mea,* can you take the east?”

Eve’s golden irises flashed with a similar glint as her husband’s and she made a demur nod his way, cheeks aglow. “We’ll ride circles around them, *amor vitae meae*.”

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Chris turned to Sandra. “In the meantime, you and Ethan can work on that casualty evacuation out of the center. At the very least, get our wounded to the southern district, in case the center doesn’t hold. Be ready for more though, I doubt the Organs are going to go quietly.”

“Understood.” Sandra made a subconscious tug at her ragged sleeves, as if to roll them up before yet another surgery.

At last, Chris’s gaze fell on me, and I sensed a mix of pride and grim reluctance at what he was asking me to do. “I’ll take the western flank. As acting Head Ranger, you’ll need to be at the front of the offensive to help gauge our success. Since your platoon is already there, can you lead the pincer for the east?”

My skin tingling at the surreal sound of being addressed in my new rank, I nodded. “Can do.”

“Then you’ll have some of the ASV’s and our armored trucks, as well as a battery of mortars.” Chris moved the pieces accordingly, and the little tokens swept across the paper battlefield in two wide arcs. “Your objective will be the same as before; the prison camp in the north. I’ll push hard for the airfield. Once we reach our objectives, we can either radio, assuming ELSAR leaves the comms alone long enough for that to work, or we’ll fire three flares to mark it. As soon as that happens, we begin to collapse the lines inward and squeeze the Organs until they break. Questions?”

No one said a word, and another mortar shell exploded somewhere down the street with a dull *thud.*

Swallowing with a deep sigh of foreboding, Chris stepped back from the table, and reached for his gear, which leaned against the wall behind his knees. “Alright, let’s get to it.”

As the room cleared, Chris caught my arm on the way out and motioned for me to follow him through a small door at the back of the room. Inside, I found a back office with no windows, a desk, and a rather familiar green metal safe in the corner. A kerosene lamp lit it from the desk and cast eerie shadows across the old carpet. It had obviously been Sean’s personal office before he got hit, many of his personal possessions still sitting in various places, his rucksack, a spare pair of boots, and a rifle. As he was currently in the care of our nurses, the place gave off a melancholy aura, a dimly lit shrine to a world that was slowly being chipped away by this awful war.

Once the door clicked shut behind us, Chris strode to the safe and knelt to unlock it. “Sean briefed me on what to do if he were to temporarily be taken out of command. Told me you and I were to keep it under wraps. I take it you already understand the implications of this?”

Out came the canvas sling bag, and upon seeing it, my gut churned. Both ears crawled with the memory of screams, the shrieking of sirens, the arcing of missiles as they swept down to burn countless people to ash. The town of Collingswood had been destroyed by lesser weapons, conventional warheads launched long before I’d arrived in Barron County, but even that had left untold scars upon the wastes. I’d seen it myself, experienced the strange leftovers of the slaughter in its whispers, its shadows, its phantoms that refused to die for the sorrow they’d endured in their final moments. Human suffering always left traces, and the weapon in my hands now could do far more than even ELSAR could imagine.

“I do.” Taking it in hand, I tried not to look at the device, shuddering despite myself at how something so deadly could be so light.

Chris locked the now empty safe and stood to throw the sling bag an unpleasant look. “It can’t stay here, not in case the center gets overrun. You have to carry it with you, which means you have to learn to sit back and let others pull the triggers. No more running headfirst into carnage like today, understand?”

With a heavy sigh, I bit my lip and forced myself to comply. “Yeah.”

“With any luck, this will all be over in a few days, and we won’t need it.” Chris snorted at his own words, as if he didn’t truly believe them, and pulled a computer chair out from the desk to offer it to me. “How’s Lucille?”

I sat in the well-worn swivel chair, while he slumped down onto Sean’s unoccupied cot across from me, the two of us glad for any chance at a reprieve. “She won’t leave Andrea’s body. Won’t speak, won’t eat or drink, just sits there and stares at her dead sister. I can’t take her back to the front like that, Chris, but I don’t want to leave her here by herself. She’s got no one left.”

“Maybe we should send her back with the body to Ark River.” He leaned forward with his forearms on his knees. “You know how gentle those people are, perhaps some time in the church, away from all the shelling, will bring her back to her senses. Like you said, she can’t stay here.”

Lucille’s wail of mourning resurfaced in my head, and I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment to block it out. Guilt cut through my heart in a cold, cruel knife, and I thought back to how she worked hard to help me, set up my tent, ran errands, carried messages. I’d relied on her, but when the time came for me to be there for her, I’d let Lucille down. Her sister had trusted me, they’d all trusted me, and in my moment of responsibility I had failed both Campbell girls.

*If she hates me for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be undeserved.*

Setting the sling pack on the floor by my feet, I rubbed at my face with both hands, and the fingers came away far grimier than I expected. “If I try to send her back, I don’t know what she’ll do. Lucille wanted to be on the front so bad, and if I pull her off it . . .”

“You’re her commanding officer, Hannah.” Chris’s mouth formed a hard, sad line. “Our job isn’t an easy one. I know you care about her, I get that, but sometimes you have to be a leader first and a friend second. Sending her to the rear might be the thing she needs to recover, and whether she likes it or not, an order from you isn’t something she can dispute.”

I picked at the seam of my trousers in a bid to distract myself. He was right, I knew that, but it still felt like a further betrayal of Lucille that I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to commit. “Do you think Sean will be okay?”

He looked down at his scuffed brown boots, and I saw doubt flit through Chris’s expression. “Physically, I think so. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same man again. He was always the calm, diplomatic, calculated one. When he ran off like that, straight into machine gun fire . . . I thought he’d gone insane.”

Wincing at how closely his thoughts matched my own, I looked down at the sling bag, the launch panel hidden under its coat of olive-drab canvas. “It seems like we keep losing people faster than we can capture living space. Jamie, Andrea, Sean, it never ends. Chris, what if we can’t win? What if Koranti has some greater plan, what if we lose Black Oak, and—”

“That’s not going to happen.” Chris reached across the space between us to catch my hand and gripped it hard. “This is going to work, alright? We’re going to finish this together, like we always do.”

I wanted to believe that, but part of me still spiraled with uncertainty. After all, I had always thought when the day of victory came, Jamie would be by my side, the two of us marching to the county border arm-in-arm together. Now she was banished, and I was leading our old faction, a role I felt I didn’t really merit. Could our belief be misguided? Could this war be unwinnable? Were we every bit as foolish as Koranti said?

*Come on Hannah, get it together. Chris needs you, and so does the coalition. If Jamie were here, she’d tell you to toughen up, and she would be right.*

On that mental note, I gave Chris’s calloused hand a return squeeze and shifted in the chair to shove the canvas bag into my knapsack. While my knapsack was rather deflated, given that I’d left most non-essential things back at Ark River, I had a hard time stuffing the square metal panel inside, and at last, in frustration, I dumped the whole thing out onto the office floor.

For his part, rose to Chris top his canteen off from a water dispenser against one wall, the two of us enjoying a peaceful, almost domestic moment. It was warm inside the tiny office, and I slid to sit cross-legged on the floor alongside my pile of things, accepting a small paper cup of water from Chris as I went.

At one point, I inverted my knapsack for a final shake, and from the bottom, a folded bit of plastic tarp I’d forgotten about since before the offensive tumbled out. I mainly kept it in case I had to improvise a crude shelter, or for covering ammo, a casualty, or creating a screen to hide behind while washing myself in the field. Thus far, I’d been either far too busy to need it, or had improvised without, but something brown stuck out from between the green plastic folds and caught my eye.

Curious, I picked it up and recognized the paper-wrapped gift from Professor Carheim. He’d sent it to me via the old resistance leader, Tex, the night I escaped from Black Oak. Due to the chaotic events that followed, notably Tex’s assassination at the hands of Crow, I’d completely forgotten about the parcel. Now that Professor Carheim lay dead, I peeled at the coffee-colored paper with a heavy heart, wishing I could thank him for whatever was underneath.

As the wrappings fell away, my mind spun in confused, bewildered sparks of fascination.

*What on earth . . .*

I’d thought it was a book, judging by its shape and weight, but instead I found a translucent plastic case, the kind a camper might use to keep things from getting wet. A notecard had been taped to the inside of the lid facing outward, and I held it up to the light of the nearby kerosene lamp.

*Hannah,*

*So much has happened in this past year that I do not, and perhaps never will, understand. Our old world has been turned upside down, and it seems our future is as dark as it is uncertain. All that being said, your survival thus far has been one of the few rays of light to pierce this shadowy veil that has been flung on us, and I hope it continues for many years to come. Never forget what we spoke of, amongst the books and writings of a bygone era in human history. You are a champion of Order, of a better future, one I believe in with all my heart. A future of light, peace, and freedom. May these records help you find the way forward, and preserve the work we, the last stewards of a dying civilization, have done in order to keep Barron County a place ruled by men, and not monsters. If there is a God, I hope beyond all measure that he has seen what I have seen of you, and takes it into account whenever you find the end to this long dark road we have all been forced to travel on.*

*Best of luck,*

*Professor Henry J. Carheim*

Tears welled in my eyes, but I blinked them back and popped the latch on the side of the case to empty its content into my lap. Inside, a tightly bound stack of folded papers was held together by scotch tape, and a little black notebook fell out as well.

My already wounded heart sank when I recognized the name in the front flap.

*Property of A.V. Kabanagarajan.*

“What’s all this?” Chris knelt beside me on the carpet and picked up the tape-wrapped stack of papers to examine them.

“Not sure.” I flipped through the notebook, brow furrowed, only to find row after row of names. Some had ranks, as if they were military or ELSAR fighters; others were simple civilian names, but they all had dates beside them. It struck me that these must be deaths, for all the dates were recent, within the past several months, and thus couldn’t be births or anything else. They were too numerous to be the ones Kaba had saved from ELSAR, and on the final page Kaba had inked a parting message on in his neat, studious penmanship.

*Lest they be forgotten.*

“Hannah,” Chris had cut the tape while I paged through the notebook, and held the unfolded papers in his palms, a growing look of alarm on his handsome face. “Look at this.”

They were printouts, page after page from various online forums, some obscure, a few recognizable. All were as recent as the names in the notebook, though there weren’t nearly as many. As I read, my pulse quickened, and I had to remind myself to breathe.

Stories.

Stories about us, about Barron County, about the Breach, all of it.

One was written by Ethan on his first day at New Wilderness. I unearthed another that Chris had created just after his crash landing, and he recalled how he’d used his phone to send it before the device died out. For his part, Chris discovered a post made by Andrea, and reading her words made my chest tighten in grief that hadn’t had much time to scar over. Professor Carheim had one of his own, though it was more philosophical, speculative, and short. However, as I got down to the bottom of the pile, where it seemed the earliest entries were, I came across one post made by none other than Deputy Sean Hammond.

*Just like the posts Matt and Carla first saw before we came here. They were trying to warn us, and we had no idea. Koranti must have had them removed to keep news from spreading.*

My fingers trembled as I traced the lettering and found a mention of an unnamed ‘auburn-haired girl’ who was brought in raving about monsters in the dark. “Oh my God.”

“What?” Chris looked up from a story that seemed to have been written by Adam Stirling, but I was already pawing through the stack to the final, and ultimately, earliest account, which dated back to February.

I held it to the flickering yellow glow of the old-fashioned lamp and read as fast as my augmented senses would let me, paper flying in my hands. I even skimmed over a few of the slower parts, but still, my heart could barely keep up with the whirl of questions going on in my brain. Deep inside, I relived it all, I glimpsed the girl in the storm, the road, the boy in the gray jacket calling to me as he ran. I saw my memories and I saw hers, all blended together in the howl of wind, rain, and thunder.

Like a lightning bolt, a revelation hit me out of nowhere as I turned the final page, and I looked up into Chris’s worried gaze with slack-jawed horror.

“Madison Cromwell.” I stammered, blood like ice in my veins. Her tormented face rose before my mind’s eye, both from the fever dreams of my infection, and from the memorial photo in the check in building. “She’s the one that went missing in February, at the start of all this. She killed the Oak Walker.”

“She’s also the only one of these accounts that actually went into the Breach itself.” He scanned the pages as fast as a normal human possibly could, and all at once Chris’s sky-blue eyes rose to meet mine as his brain locked onto the same conclusion. “Twice, by the look of it. If Vecitorak said he had someone who could resurrect the Oak Walker’s spirit, then it would have to be someone caught in the Breach with him, which means . . .”

I held my right arm up so the kerosene’s flame could illuminate the silver in my tattoos and let the pieces of truth fit together in my head with terrible perfection. “She’s alive, Chris. Madison Cromwell is still alive.”",1,1735371830.0,cant_sleep,0,1.0,False

# The Secret Sauce: AI Co-pilot Features

The AI co-pilot is like having a super-smart intern who actually reads everything you save. Here's what it can do:

1. **Web Search**: Ask questions, get instant answers with sources
2. **Library Search**: Query your saved content
3. **Global Search**: Access public knowledge from other users

And yes, you can choose between **GPT-4**, GPT-4 Mini, or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** as your AI sidekick. Fancy, right?

# Real-World Usage: My Experience

I threw everything I could at Iki AI - blog posts, tweets, and even attempted some YouTube videos (more on that drama later). The tool handled content like a champ, automatically tagging and summarizing everything.

The Chrome extension is smoother than butter on warm toast. One click, and boom - content saved! Though I wish it pulled images better for thumbnails (looking at you, Cal Newport article).

# The YouTube Saga

Here's the tea: YouTube transcription is currently on vacation. It's supposed to be a killer feature, but due to some policy changes, it's temporarily out of service. The team promises it's coming back, but for now, if you're buying this for video transcription, maybe hold onto your wallet.

# Save.day vs Iki AI: The Showdown

Both tools are like siblings who went to different colleges. Here's the quick comparison:

|Feature|Iki AI|[Save.day](http://Save.day)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Login System|Username/Password|OAuth only|
|Chrome Extension|Basic|Feature-rich|
|Interface|Clean, Modern|Also clean|
|Video Features|Limited (currently)|More robust|
|AI Integration|Multiple models|Basic|

# Tips for Maximum Iki-ness

1. **Start Private**: Despite the confusing UI, make your collections private by default
2. **Batch Save**: Use the Chrome extension for quick saves
3. **Organize Early**: Create collections before you start saving
4. **AI Power**: Don't be shy with the co-pilot - it's your friend

# The Verdict: 7.6/10

Is it perfect? Nope. Is it still pretty awesome? You bet! The current score of 7.6 feels like watching a great movie with temporary audio issues - the potential is clear, but some fixes are needed.

# Who Should Buy?

* **Content creators** needing a smart library
* **Researchers** wanting AI-powered analysis
* **Teams** looking for a shared knowledge base
* **Digital hoarders** (like me) seeking organization

# Who Should Wait?

* Users primarily needing video transcription
* Those requiring advanced Chrome extension features
* Budget users who'll exceed 200 monthly co-pilot queries

1ho0v9f,https://i.redd.it/5ppbja74nj9e1.jpeg,Beginner's Fragrance Review,"Hello everyone!

As a complete newbie to the world of fragrances, I thought I share my thoughts on the collection I've accumulated so far. I'm still learning, but I’ve gotten pretty hooked on the whole journey! I typically apply 4 sprays—two on my upper neck and two on my clothes. Here’s my take on each of them:

1. Lattafa Asad
This one gives off a vibe that reminds me of Elixir. People around me often describe it as “vanilla-y,” and I  agree. It has a lovely, spicy vanilla touch that feels warm. It’s definitely a crowd-pleaser… but don’t expect it to last forever.
Compliments: People definitely notice it, but usually within the first 3-4 hours.

2. RioRabbit King 2.0
This fragrance is meant to recreate a mix of Dunhill and Diptyque’s Tam Dao. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite hit the mark for me. It’s overly alcohol-heavy at the start and fades pretty quickly. After about 30 minutes, it starts to smell synthetic.Compliments: None so far. 

3. EM5 Aqua Profumo
This one’s inspired by Acqua di Giò Profumo (a classic). It’s a really pleasant, fresh scent with rosemary and sage, and I think most people would enjoy it. My only issue is the longevity—it's not great, so I’d recommend opting for a roll-on version if you're looking for something longer-lasting.
Compliments: When I asked people directly to smell it, they liked it, but it wasn’t something that grabbed attention on its own.

4. Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh
By far the best performer in my collection. It’s got a deep, woody, almost burnt smell that reminds me of a Durga Puja Pandal (I know, random but specific!). It lasts a long time and gets noticed even after 4-5 hours.
Compliments: Absolutely—this one has received the most compliments so far!

5. Wild Stone Edge
A solid budget fragrance! It’s a bit light on longevity (maybe 2 hours max), but the dry down is where it shines. It smells really fresh and clean, and while I don’t notice it much after a while, others sometimes do, especially in close quarters like the gym.
Compliments: Yes, occasionally at the gym.

6. EM5 Aqua
This is Davidoff Cool Water in a bottle. The scent is spot-on, with a nice sea-water vibe and notes of rosemary and neroli. It doesn’t last more than 4 hours on me, but during that time, it’s really refreshing.
Compliments: Yes, this one gets noticed too—it's the second most complimented, right after Ameer Al Oudh.

7. Bella Vita GOAT
This one smells like an aftershave you'd find at a men’s barber shop. It’s not terrible, but it’s very synthetic at the start and doesn’t feel luxurious (for lack of a better word). The dry down has this powdery, talcum scent that I’m not crazy about.
Compliments: None yet. In a sad turn of events, my girlfriend even asked if I was wearing powder.

8. EM5 Afgano
This is a unique winter scent, inspired by Black Afgano by Nasomatto. It has notes of cannabis and coffee, which gives it a warm, cozy vibe. It doesn’t last as long as I’d like, but I really enjoy it for its uniqueness.
Compliments: Yes, I’ve gotten a few compliments on this one.

9. EM5 Nomade
Inspired by Ombre Nomade by Louis Vuitton, this fragrance has a beautiful mix of rose and oud. It reminds me of incense sticks I’ve smelled before, giving it a mystical, deep vibe.
Compliments: Yes, this one gets attention too.

Final Thoughts:
As a beginner, I’m still figuring things out, but overall, I think the EM5 clones are a great starting point. They capture the essence of more expensive fragrances but unfortunately fall short in terms of longevity. They are perfect if you’re just trying to get a feel for different scent profiles before investing in the original. 

Aqua, Nomade, and Afgano are definitely worth considering.

Avoid: 

Bella Vita GOAT and RioRabbit King 2.0—neither really moved me or anyone else around. 
Highly Recommend: 

Lattafa—especially Ameer Al Oudh, which has been my favorite. I also have a decant of Fakhar Men, and it’s great too—especially in the dry down!

Hope this helps! Still early in my fragrance journey. Would love to hear your thoughts or recommendations for a newbie like me! Am planning on getting Dior Sauvage next month. ",7,1735371730.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,0.82,False

*Boom.*

Dust rained from the ceiling onto the map table before us, and Chris swiped it away from the topographical lines with a weary hand. “So, we’re all in agreement?”

Around the conference room table, everyone else nodded, their faces drawn. The rest of the day had been nothing short of awful; Sandra and her researchers had worked overtime to keep Sean stabilized, his wounds somehow worse upon their expert inspection. The bullet that had entered above his hip splintered upon impact, and Sean lost a lot of blood in the three surgeries it took to remove it. His ribs were cracked in two places, and he had a concussion from being too close to his own grenades. Shrapnel peppered his torso, and it took hours to stitch him up. Eve and her healers threw everything they had into the fight, and between them, the Head Researcher and matriarch of Ark River had come as close to a miracle as anyone could. Our leader now slept under the influence of generous sedation in one of the hospital cots, but while his life had been saved, Sean’s position as commander had to be filled in the interim. Ethan refused the position, wishing to remain with his Workers, and Sandra couldn’t leave her patients, which meant the role fell one again to a Ranger.

Chris sighed, though I couldn’t quite tell if it was relief or dread from how his shoulders slumped. “Okay. As acting commander, I think our first priority should be to evacuate as many wounded from the city as possible, and work to offset our losses. What’s the status on the front?”

“Organ soldiers are massing all along the line.” Josh stared blankly at the map, his face ashen, though I could tell from the redness of his eyes that he’d been one of many people to shed angry tears. “They’ve been pounding our positions with artillery for the past hour now. I think we’re in for an all-out assault before sundown.”

News of Andrea’s death, along with Kaba’s, had spread through the ranks like wildfire, and the resistance were noticeably demoralized at losing yet another of their influential leaders. Our gate guards had already begun to report numerous attempted desertions from resistance cells, finding abandoned positions where the fighters simply picked up their guns and headed for the refugee camps to wait out the war. What survivors remained from the underground Castle had been evacuated through the long, grimy sewer tunnels beneath the city, but this only created further human logjam in the already crowded southern districts of Black Oak. Civilians from all over were trying to flee the fighting, but with the mutants outside the gates, and the snows becoming more and more frequent, there was nowhere for the masses to run. Food had run low, one of our researchers had discovered contamination in the local water supply which required a boil order, and there weren’t enough intact houses or tents for everyone. Frostbite cases were coming in, and a few old people had frozen to death in the brisk night air. It was a nightmare of human suffering that could only get worse, and Chris had inherited it all as his first day being commander.

Looking down at my arm, I picked at the yellow sash tied there to demarcate my own resulting promotion, since it would be a while before I had time to visit a seamstress. I wouldn’t have minded going from lieutenant to captain if it hadn’t come with the additional, temporary step-up in responsibility; assuming Chris’s old job.

*Will there ever be a time someone becomes Head Ranger without someone else being killed?*

“Yet my scouts report more withdrawal activity in the north.” In response to Josh’s musings, Adam frowned at the map, hand on his sword hilt, one thumb rubbing the pommel in idle contemplation. “At first we thought it might be supply units leaving to restock, but there are multiple ELSAR units pulling back to the northern border. Some of our observation posts even reported skirmishes between ELSAR proper and their Auxiliary hounds. Perhaps the attack on the negotiations wasn’t sanctioned by Koranti?”

“I think so too.” I couldn’t help but nod at Adam, his words almost perfectly in line with my thoughts.

Others turned to look at me, but I turned to Chris, as he was commander now, and I knew he’d understand. “Crow purposefully left Sheriff Wurnauw exposed so he had nowhere to run but their observation post, and then she had her gunners hit it with a heavy crossfire. Even if she couldn’t predict Sean chasing Wurnauw down, Crow knew the firefight between both sides would likely kill anyone inside that shop, which means this was premeditated. She meant to take out our leadership with the rocket attack, then remove her provisional government competition by killing the sheriff. I’d wager there are probably some others we don’t know about who were killed behind the scenes, local politicians, councilmen, maybe even the mayor. She’s trying to take over Barron County, and since Koranti doesn’t share power, I’d say she’s fighting him too.”

“Which means untold suffering for the innocents caught in the middle.” Eve folded her arms and shook her honey-colored head at the map in sadness. “After all, by your own account, these ‘Organs’ don’t hesitate at cruelty of the most extreme kinds. Our healers are reporting numerous young women who’ve tried to kill themselves in our care, because of the abuse they suffered at the Auxiliaries’ hands. We have to protect the people from further violence.”

Sandra perked up a little, the two sharing a mutual look of support due to their combined roles as medical personnel. “Some of our patients from the civilian sector are reporting that Organ troops are using detention facilities where they hold political dissidents as staging areas, since they know we won’t attack them. We have the chance to demonstrate to the people of Black Oak that we are the morally superior choice of government, if we can adequately shield them from the conflict. I think we should consider not only evacuating wounded, but also non-combatants to strategic refugee camps in the countryside.”

“That’ll mean drawing more fighters away from the front line.” Josh set his jaw with a hardened gaze, a cold gravity to his words that sapped further hope from the room. “And besides, we’re already seeing refugees coming *back* through our southern gate from the outside. There’s too many freaks beyond the wall, so unless you’ve got enough material to fortify these ‘camps’ we’re just sending them out to slaughter.”

In my head, I saw again the farmhouse from the southlands, the gore-spattered interior, the dead family ripped to pieces and stuffed behind piles of debris for ‘storage’. New Wilderness had been built on a hilltop before the Breach opened, and the palisade wall that once ringed it had taken the entire fort a long time to raise. Even if we could equip all the refugees with adequate weapons, tools, rations, and warm clothing, there was no way they’d all be able to find suitable hilltops with fresh water nearby, or get protective walls erected in time. Most would die, either from cold, starvation, disease, or worst of all, the mutants.

*Even if the regular freaks didn’t get them, Vecitorak certainly would. He’d have a field day, ambushing an entire column of helpless civilians. They wouldn’t stand a chance.*

Quiet up until this point, Ethan glanced at Chris, his bearded face shadowed with doubt. “My boys can’t work fast enough to set up both refugee centers and maintain logistics for our campaign. They’re dead tired as it is, they need a break. If it if true that the mercenaries are pulling out, then this might be our best chance to take the city.”

Adam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the rest of us, head cocked to one side to accentuate his point. “It still doesn’t answer the question as to why Koranti just gave up and left. Even if there are a thousand Organs in Black Oak, Koranti’s mercs are better trained than the Auxiliaries. He’s got unlimited logistics outside the county line, he has an army of well-equipped soldiers, and yet he’s retreating? Think about it, the radios are working again, they haven’t tried to intercept our comms since the exchange . . . this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It could be that Koranti wants us to kill each other, and then swoop in once it’s over to clean up the pieces.” Ethan stroked his scruffy face with one oil-stained hand. “He didn’t strike me as stupid. Arrogant, maybe, but not stupid. If the Organs really have mutinied, then he’s better off letting us use up all our ammo on each other, and not on his higher-quality troops.”

Chris ran a set of fingers through his disheveled brown hair, and stared at the map in front of him, littered with little tokens depicting unit placement. “It could be that he didn’t expect to lose the Auxiliaries so quickly and is pulling out his heavy weapons to avoid Crow taking them for herself. I figure he doesn’t want a three-way civil war on his hands, which means he’d rather lose all his local muscle than see them take up arms against him. Either way, we can’t pass this up, not when half of the enemy is leaving down, and taking all their big guns with them.”

I leaned forward on the table to point out a few places near the frontline. “A runner from Sergeant McPherson said he noticed less artillery fire than usual from the north. There’s lots of infantry moving in, but it seems their support is faltering. Josh is right, the Organs are getting ready for something big, but without Koranti’s regulars they might be vulnerable.”

Chris took some of the tokens in hand, and moved the pieces around on the map as he talked. “The enemy is massing most of its units in the center, some 800 by the look of it. I think they expect us to bunch up to meet them by the same number, and since they’ve got more men in the city than us, they want to grind us down. If we can pull most of our forces from the center to the flanks, we can encircle and destroy them unit by unit instead of facing them on equal terms. That way, we can make the most of our numbers while they are forced to defend every inch of the front.”

“If they push on the center while we’re attacking the flanks, the enemy could break through.” Ethan made an uncertain half-frown and wiped his hands on his overhauls to be sure they were free of grime before pointing out what he meant on the paper.

“So we move faster than they do.” Chris took Ethan’s comments in stride, his tone guiding and instructive, reminding me of just how well suited he was for such a role. “We hit them hard, use every shell, every mortar, every heavy weapon system we’ve got. Even the exterior scouts can harass their convoys in the north of the city walls. I want them to think we’re everywhere, all at once.”

At the mention of his infamous scouts, Adam straightened up with an air of pride. “I’ll lead the patrols to our west. Anything they do, we’ll see and report. *Amica mea,* can you take the east?”

Eve’s golden irises flashed with a similar glint as her husband’s and she made a demur nod his way, cheeks aglow. “We’ll ride circles around them, *amor vitae meae*.”

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Chris turned to Sandra. “In the meantime, you and Ethan can work on that casualty evacuation out of the center. At the very least, get our wounded to the southern district, in case the center doesn’t hold. Be ready for more though, I doubt the Organs are going to go quietly.”

“Understood.” Sandra made a subconscious tug at her ragged sleeves, as if to roll them up before yet another surgery.

At last, Chris’s gaze fell on me, and I sensed a mix of pride and grim reluctance at what he was asking me to do. “I’ll take the western flank. As acting Head Ranger, you’ll need to be at the front of the offensive to help gauge our success. Since your platoon is already there, can you lead the pincer for the east?”

My skin tingling at the surreal sound of being addressed in my new rank, I nodded. “Can do.”

“Then you’ll have some of the ASV’s and our armored trucks, as well as a battery of mortars.” Chris moved the pieces accordingly, and the little tokens swept across the paper battlefield in two wide arcs. “Your objective will be the same as before; the prison camp in the north. I’ll push hard for the airfield. Once we reach our objectives, we can either radio, assuming ELSAR leaves the comms alone long enough for that to work, or we’ll fire three flares to mark it. As soon as that happens, we begin to collapse the lines inward and squeeze the Organs until they break. Questions?”

No one said a word, and another mortar shell exploded somewhere down the street with a dull *thud.*

Swallowing with a deep sigh of foreboding, Chris stepped back from the table, and reached for his gear, which leaned against the wall behind his knees. “Alright, let’s get to it.”

As the room cleared, Chris caught my arm on the way out and motioned for me to follow him through a small door at the back of the room. Inside, I found a back office with no windows, a desk, and a rather familiar green metal safe in the corner. A kerosene lamp lit it from the desk and cast eerie shadows across the old carpet. It had obviously been Sean’s personal office before he got hit, many of his personal possessions still sitting in various places, his rucksack, a spare pair of boots, and a rifle. As he was currently in the care of our nurses, the place gave off a melancholy aura, a dimly lit shrine to a world that was slowly being chipped away by this awful war.

Once the door clicked shut behind us, Chris strode to the safe and knelt to unlock it. “Sean briefed me on what to do if he were to temporarily be taken out of command. Told me you and I were to keep it under wraps. I take it you already understand the implications of this?”

Out came the canvas sling bag, and upon seeing it, my gut churned. Both ears crawled with the memory of screams, the shrieking of sirens, the arcing of missiles as they swept down to burn countless people to ash. The town of Collingswood had been destroyed by lesser weapons, conventional warheads launched long before I’d arrived in Barron County, but even that had left untold scars upon the wastes. I’d seen it myself, experienced the strange leftovers of the slaughter in its whispers, its shadows, its phantoms that refused to die for the sorrow they’d endured in their final moments. Human suffering always left traces, and the weapon in my hands now could do far more than even ELSAR could imagine.

“I do.” Taking it in hand, I tried not to look at the device, shuddering despite myself at how something so deadly could be so light.

Chris locked the now empty safe and stood to throw the sling bag an unpleasant look. “It can’t stay here, not in case the center gets overrun. You have to carry it with you, which means you have to learn to sit back and let others pull the triggers. No more running headfirst into carnage like today, understand?”

With a heavy sigh, I bit my lip and forced myself to comply. “Yeah.”

“With any luck, this will all be over in a few days, and we won’t need it.” Chris snorted at his own words, as if he didn’t truly believe them, and pulled a computer chair out from the desk to offer it to me. “How’s Lucille?”

I sat in the well-worn swivel chair, while he slumped down onto Sean’s unoccupied cot across from me, the two of us glad for any chance at a reprieve. “She won’t leave Andrea’s body. Won’t speak, won’t eat or drink, just sits there and stares at her dead sister. I can’t take her back to the front like that, Chris, but I don’t want to leave her here by herself. She’s got no one left.”

“Maybe we should send her back with the body to Ark River.” He leaned forward with his forearms on his knees. “You know how gentle those people are, perhaps some time in the church, away from all the shelling, will bring her back to her senses. Like you said, she can’t stay here.”

Lucille’s wail of mourning resurfaced in my head, and I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment to block it out. Guilt cut through my heart in a cold, cruel knife, and I thought back to how she worked hard to help me, set up my tent, ran errands, carried messages. I’d relied on her, but when the time came for me to be there for her, I’d let Lucille down. Her sister had trusted me, they’d all trusted me, and in my moment of responsibility I had failed both Campbell girls.

*If she hates me for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be undeserved.*

Setting the sling pack on the floor by my feet, I rubbed at my face with both hands, and the fingers came away far grimier than I expected. “If I try to send her back, I don’t know what she’ll do. Lucille wanted to be on the front so bad, and if I pull her off it . . .”

“You’re her commanding officer, Hannah.” Chris’s mouth formed a hard, sad line. “Our job isn’t an easy one. I know you care about her, I get that, but sometimes you have to be a leader first and a friend second. Sending her to the rear might be the thing she needs to recover, and whether she likes it or not, an order from you isn’t something she can dispute.”

I picked at the seam of my trousers in a bid to distract myself. He was right, I knew that, but it still felt like a further betrayal of Lucille that I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to commit. “Do you think Sean will be okay?”

He looked down at his scuffed brown boots, and I saw doubt flit through Chris’s expression. “Physically, I think so. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same man again. He was always the calm, diplomatic, calculated one. When he ran off like that, straight into machine gun fire . . . I thought he’d gone insane.”

Wincing at how closely his thoughts matched my own, I looked down at the sling bag, the launch panel hidden under its coat of olive-drab canvas. “It seems like we keep losing people faster than we can capture living space. Jamie, Andrea, Sean, it never ends. Chris, what if we can’t win? What if Koranti has some greater plan, what if we lose Black Oak, and—”

“That’s not going to happen.” Chris reached across the space between us to catch my hand and gripped it hard. “This is going to work, alright? We’re going to finish this together, like we always do.”

I wanted to believe that, but part of me still spiraled with uncertainty. After all, I had always thought when the day of victory came, Jamie would be by my side, the two of us marching to the county border arm-in-arm together. Now she was banished, and I was leading our old faction, a role I felt I didn’t really merit. Could our belief be misguided? Could this war be unwinnable? Were we every bit as foolish as Koranti said?

*Come on Hannah, get it together. Chris needs you, and so does the coalition. If Jamie were here, she’d tell you to toughen up, and she would be right.*

On that mental note, I gave Chris’s calloused hand a return squeeze and shifted in the chair to shove the canvas bag into my knapsack. While my knapsack was rather deflated, given that I’d left most non-essential things back at Ark River, I had a hard time stuffing the square metal panel inside, and at last, in frustration, I dumped the whole thing out onto the office floor.

For his part, rose to Chris top his canteen off from a water dispenser against one wall, the two of us enjoying a peaceful, almost domestic moment. It was warm inside the tiny office, and I slid to sit cross-legged on the floor alongside my pile of things, accepting a small paper cup of water from Chris as I went.

At one point, I inverted my knapsack for a final shake, and from the bottom, a folded bit of plastic tarp I’d forgotten about since before the offensive tumbled out. I mainly kept it in case I had to improvise a crude shelter, or for covering ammo, a casualty, or creating a screen to hide behind while washing myself in the field. Thus far, I’d been either far too busy to need it, or had improvised without, but something brown stuck out from between the green plastic folds and caught my eye.

Curious, I picked it up and recognized the paper-wrapped gift from Professor Carheim. He’d sent it to me via the old resistance leader, Tex, the night I escaped from Black Oak. Due to the chaotic events that followed, notably Tex’s assassination at the hands of Crow, I’d completely forgotten about the parcel. Now that Professor Carheim lay dead, I peeled at the coffee-colored paper with a heavy heart, wishing I could thank him for whatever was underneath.

As the wrappings fell away, my mind spun in confused, bewildered sparks of fascination.

*What on earth . . .*

I’d thought it was a book, judging by its shape and weight, but instead I found a translucent plastic case, the kind a camper might use to keep things from getting wet. A notecard had been taped to the inside of the lid facing outward, and I held it up to the light of the nearby kerosene lamp.

*Hannah,*

*So much has happened in this past year that I do not, and perhaps never will, understand. Our old world has been turned upside down, and it seems our future is as dark as it is uncertain. All that being said, your survival thus far has been one of the few rays of light to pierce this shadowy veil that has been flung on us, and I hope it continues for many years to come. Never forget what we spoke of, amongst the books and writings of a bygone era in human history. You are a champion of Order, of a better future, one I believe in with all my heart. A future of light, peace, and freedom. May these records help you find the way forward, and preserve the work we, the last stewards of a dying civilization, have done in order to keep Barron County a place ruled by men, and not monsters. If there is a God, I hope beyond all measure that he has seen what I have seen of you, and takes it into account whenever you find the end to this long dark road we have all been forced to travel on.*

*Best of luck,*

*Professor Henry J. Carheim*

Tears welled in my eyes, but I blinked them back and popped the latch on the side of the case to empty its content into my lap. Inside, a tightly bound stack of folded papers was held together by scotch tape, and a little black notebook fell out as well.

My already wounded heart sank when I recognized the name in the front flap.

*Property of A.V. Kabanagarajan.*

“What’s all this?” Chris knelt beside me on the carpet and picked up the tape-wrapped stack of papers to examine them.

“Not sure.” I flipped through the notebook, brow furrowed, only to find row after row of names. Some had ranks, as if they were military or ELSAR fighters; others were simple civilian names, but they all had dates beside them. It struck me that these must be deaths, for all the dates were recent, within the past several months, and thus couldn’t be births or anything else. They were too numerous to be the ones Kaba had saved from ELSAR, and on the final page Kaba had inked a parting message on in his neat, studious penmanship.

*Lest they be forgotten.*

“Hannah,” Chris had cut the tape while I paged through the notebook, and held the unfolded papers in his palms, a growing look of alarm on his handsome face. “Look at this.”

They were printouts, page after page from various online forums, some obscure, a few recognizable. All were as recent as the names in the notebook, though there weren’t nearly as many. As I read, my pulse quickened, and I had to remind myself to breathe.

Stories.

Stories about us, about Barron County, about the Breach, all of it.

One was written by Ethan on his first day at New Wilderness. I unearthed another that Chris had created just after his crash landing, and he recalled how he’d used his phone to send it before the device died out. For his part, Chris discovered a post made by Andrea, and reading her words made my chest tighten in grief that hadn’t had much time to scar over. Professor Carheim had one of his own, though it was more philosophical, speculative, and short. However, as I got down to the bottom of the pile, where it seemed the earliest entries were, I came across one post made by none other than Deputy Sean Hammond.

*Just like the posts Matt and Carla first saw before we came here. They were trying to warn us, and we had no idea. Koranti must have had them removed to keep news from spreading.*

My fingers trembled as I traced the lettering and found a mention of an unnamed ‘auburn-haired girl’ who was brought in raving about monsters in the dark. “Oh my God.”

“What?” Chris looked up from a story that seemed to have been written by Adam Stirling, but I was already pawing through the stack to the final, and ultimately, earliest account, which dated back to February.

I held it to the flickering yellow glow of the old-fashioned lamp and read as fast as my augmented senses would let me, paper flying in my hands. I even skimmed over a few of the slower parts, but still, my heart could barely keep up with the whirl of questions going on in my brain. Deep inside, I relived it all, I glimpsed the girl in the storm, the road, the boy in the gray jacket calling to me as he ran. I saw my memories and I saw hers, all blended together in the howl of wind, rain, and thunder.

Like a lightning bolt, a revelation hit me out of nowhere as I turned the final page, and I looked up into Chris’s worried gaze with slack-jawed horror.

“Madison Cromwell.” I stammered, blood like ice in my veins. Her tormented face rose before my mind’s eye, both from the fever dreams of my infection, and from the memorial photo in the check in building. “She’s the one that went missing in February, at the start of all this. She killed the Oak Walker.”

“She’s also the only one of these accounts that actually went into the Breach itself.” He scanned the pages as fast as a normal human possibly could, and all at once Chris’s sky-blue eyes rose to meet mine as his brain locked onto the same conclusion. “Twice, by the look of it. If Vecitorak said he had someone who could resurrect the Oak Walker’s spirit, then it would have to be someone caught in the Breach with him, which means . . .”

I held my right arm up so the kerosene’s flame could illuminate the silver in my tattoos and let the pieces of truth fit together in my head with terrible perfection. “She’s alive, Chris. Madison Cromwell is still alive.”",1,1735371679.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1ho0uio,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ho0uio/1_year_today/,1 Year Today!,"This time last year I decided to stop drinking. I didn’t like how it made me feel, it made my anxiety worse, affected my sleep (I need sleep!) and I didn’t like being sloppy around my husband who hasn’t drunk for about 15 years.

I’ve done sober birthdays, holidays, work trips and gatherings with friends and family. I have also isolated myself a lot this year and struggled to know what to do with all the free time (that’s my goal for 2025…find more things I love to do with all my lovely new free time and energy!). But I did it! 365 days with no alcohol!

Ironically one of the biggest tests was last night. Met my parents and brother for dinner and was really tempted to drink…”it’s Christmas, one or two glasses wouldn’t hurt.” 

I played the tape to the end though and focused on my mantra “I never regret not drinking” and stuck with diet coke, water and a peppermint tea (my new favourite way to end a meal!). It helps that my dad was already on his way before we got to dinner, he was fine and didn’t do anything stupid or anything but I could tell he’d had a few pints and I just thought “nope, that’s not for me.”

Have woken up today clear headed, had a coffee and journaled in bed and I’m ready to start my day! So very grateful that I made this decision.",5,1735371641.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

*Boom.*

Dust rained from the ceiling onto the map table before us, and Chris swiped it away from the topographical lines with a weary hand. “So, we’re all in agreement?”

Around the conference room table, everyone else nodded, their faces drawn. The rest of the day had been nothing short of awful; Sandra and her researchers had worked overtime to keep Sean stabilized, his wounds somehow worse upon their expert inspection. The bullet that had entered above his hip splintered upon impact, and Sean lost a lot of blood in the three surgeries it took to remove it. His ribs were cracked in two places, and he had a concussion from being too close to his own grenades. Shrapnel peppered his torso, and it took hours to stitch him up. Eve and her healers threw everything they had into the fight, and between them, the Head Researcher and matriarch of Ark River had come as close to a miracle as anyone could. Our leader now slept under the influence of generous sedation in one of the hospital cots, but while his life had been saved, Sean’s position as commander had to be filled in the interim. Ethan refused the position, wishing to remain with his Workers, and Sandra couldn’t leave her patients, which meant the role fell one again to a Ranger.

Chris sighed, though I couldn’t quite tell if it was relief or dread from how his shoulders slumped. “Okay. As acting commander, I think our first priority should be to evacuate as many wounded from the city as possible, and work to offset our losses. What’s the status on the front?”

“Organ soldiers are massing all along the line.” Josh stared blankly at the map, his face ashen, though I could tell from the redness of his eyes that he’d been one of many people to shed angry tears. “They’ve been pounding our positions with artillery for the past hour now. I think we’re in for an all-out assault before sundown.”

News of Andrea’s death, along with Kaba’s, had spread through the ranks like wildfire, and the resistance were noticeably demoralized at losing yet another of their influential leaders. Our gate guards had already begun to report numerous attempted desertions from resistance cells, finding abandoned positions where the fighters simply picked up their guns and headed for the refugee camps to wait out the war. What survivors remained from the underground Castle had been evacuated through the long, grimy sewer tunnels beneath the city, but this only created further human logjam in the already crowded southern districts of Black Oak. Civilians from all over were trying to flee the fighting, but with the mutants outside the gates, and the snows becoming more and more frequent, there was nowhere for the masses to run. Food had run low, one of our researchers had discovered contamination in the local water supply which required a boil order, and there weren’t enough intact houses or tents for everyone. Frostbite cases were coming in, and a few old people had frozen to death in the brisk night air. It was a nightmare of human suffering that could only get worse, and Chris had inherited it all as his first day being commander.

Looking down at my arm, I picked at the yellow sash tied there to demarcate my own resulting promotion, since it would be a while before I had time to visit a seamstress. I wouldn’t have minded going from lieutenant to captain if it hadn’t come with the additional, temporary step-up in responsibility; assuming Chris’s old job.

*Will there ever be a time someone becomes Head Ranger without someone else being killed?*

“Yet my scouts report more withdrawal activity in the north.” In response to Josh’s musings, Adam frowned at the map, hand on his sword hilt, one thumb rubbing the pommel in idle contemplation. “At first we thought it might be supply units leaving to restock, but there are multiple ELSAR units pulling back to the northern border. Some of our observation posts even reported skirmishes between ELSAR proper and their Auxiliary hounds. Perhaps the attack on the negotiations wasn’t sanctioned by Koranti?”

“I think so too.” I couldn’t help but nod at Adam, his words almost perfectly in line with my thoughts.

Others turned to look at me, but I turned to Chris, as he was commander now, and I knew he’d understand. “Crow purposefully left Sheriff Wurnauw exposed so he had nowhere to run but their observation post, and then she had her gunners hit it with a heavy crossfire. Even if she couldn’t predict Sean chasing Wurnauw down, Crow knew the firefight between both sides would likely kill anyone inside that shop, which means this was premeditated. She meant to take out our leadership with the rocket attack, then remove her provisional government competition by killing the sheriff. I’d wager there are probably some others we don’t know about who were killed behind the scenes, local politicians, councilmen, maybe even the mayor. She’s trying to take over Barron County, and since Koranti doesn’t share power, I’d say she’s fighting him too.”

“Which means untold suffering for the innocents caught in the middle.” Eve folded her arms and shook her honey-colored head at the map in sadness. “After all, by your own account, these ‘Organs’ don’t hesitate at cruelty of the most extreme kinds. Our healers are reporting numerous young women who’ve tried to kill themselves in our care, because of the abuse they suffered at the Auxiliaries’ hands. We have to protect the people from further violence.”

Sandra perked up a little, the two sharing a mutual look of support due to their combined roles as medical personnel. “Some of our patients from the civilian sector are reporting that Organ troops are using detention facilities where they hold political dissidents as staging areas, since they know we won’t attack them. We have the chance to demonstrate to the people of Black Oak that we are the morally superior choice of government, if we can adequately shield them from the conflict. I think we should consider not only evacuating wounded, but also non-combatants to strategic refugee camps in the countryside.”

“That’ll mean drawing more fighters away from the front line.” Josh set his jaw with a hardened gaze, a cold gravity to his words that sapped further hope from the room. “And besides, we’re already seeing refugees coming *back* through our southern gate from the outside. There’s too many freaks beyond the wall, so unless you’ve got enough material to fortify these ‘camps’ we’re just sending them out to slaughter.”

In my head, I saw again the farmhouse from the southlands, the gore-spattered interior, the dead family ripped to pieces and stuffed behind piles of debris for ‘storage’. New Wilderness had been built on a hilltop before the Breach opened, and the palisade wall that once ringed it had taken the entire fort a long time to raise. Even if we could equip all the refugees with adequate weapons, tools, rations, and warm clothing, there was no way they’d all be able to find suitable hilltops with fresh water nearby, or get protective walls erected in time. Most would die, either from cold, starvation, disease, or worst of all, the mutants.

*Even if the regular freaks didn’t get them, Vecitorak certainly would. He’d have a field day, ambushing an entire column of helpless civilians. They wouldn’t stand a chance.*

Quiet up until this point, Ethan glanced at Chris, his bearded face shadowed with doubt. “My boys can’t work fast enough to set up both refugee centers and maintain logistics for our campaign. They’re dead tired as it is, they need a break. If it if true that the mercenaries are pulling out, then this might be our best chance to take the city.”

Adam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the rest of us, head cocked to one side to accentuate his point. “It still doesn’t answer the question as to why Koranti just gave up and left. Even if there are a thousand Organs in Black Oak, Koranti’s mercs are better trained than the Auxiliaries. He’s got unlimited logistics outside the county line, he has an army of well-equipped soldiers, and yet he’s retreating? Think about it, the radios are working again, they haven’t tried to intercept our comms since the exchange . . . this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It could be that Koranti wants us to kill each other, and then swoop in once it’s over to clean up the pieces.” Ethan stroked his scruffy face with one oil-stained hand. “He didn’t strike me as stupid. Arrogant, maybe, but not stupid. If the Organs really have mutinied, then he’s better off letting us use up all our ammo on each other, and not on his higher-quality troops.”

Chris ran a set of fingers through his disheveled brown hair, and stared at the map in front of him, littered with little tokens depicting unit placement. “It could be that he didn’t expect to lose the Auxiliaries so quickly and is pulling out his heavy weapons to avoid Crow taking them for herself. I figure he doesn’t want a three-way civil war on his hands, which means he’d rather lose all his local muscle than see them take up arms against him. Either way, we can’t pass this up, not when half of the enemy is leaving down, and taking all their big guns with them.”

I leaned forward on the table to point out a few places near the frontline. “A runner from Sergeant McPherson said he noticed less artillery fire than usual from the north. There’s lots of infantry moving in, but it seems their support is faltering. Josh is right, the Organs are getting ready for something big, but without Koranti’s regulars they might be vulnerable.”

Chris took some of the tokens in hand, and moved the pieces around on the map as he talked. “The enemy is massing most of its units in the center, some 800 by the look of it. I think they expect us to bunch up to meet them by the same number, and since they’ve got more men in the city than us, they want to grind us down. If we can pull most of our forces from the center to the flanks, we can encircle and destroy them unit by unit instead of facing them on equal terms. That way, we can make the most of our numbers while they are forced to defend every inch of the front.”

“If they push on the center while we’re attacking the flanks, the enemy could break through.” Ethan made an uncertain half-frown and wiped his hands on his overhauls to be sure they were free of grime before pointing out what he meant on the paper.

“So we move faster than they do.” Chris took Ethan’s comments in stride, his tone guiding and instructive, reminding me of just how well suited he was for such a role. “We hit them hard, use every shell, every mortar, every heavy weapon system we’ve got. Even the exterior scouts can harass their convoys in the north of the city walls. I want them to think we’re everywhere, all at once.”

At the mention of his infamous scouts, Adam straightened up with an air of pride. “I’ll lead the patrols to our west. Anything they do, we’ll see and report. *Amica mea,* can you take the east?”

Eve’s golden irises flashed with a similar glint as her husband’s and she made a demur nod his way, cheeks aglow. “We’ll ride circles around them, *amor vitae meae*.”

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Chris turned to Sandra. “In the meantime, you and Ethan can work on that casualty evacuation out of the center. At the very least, get our wounded to the southern district, in case the center doesn’t hold. Be ready for more though, I doubt the Organs are going to go quietly.”

“Understood.” Sandra made a subconscious tug at her ragged sleeves, as if to roll them up before yet another surgery.

At last, Chris’s gaze fell on me, and I sensed a mix of pride and grim reluctance at what he was asking me to do. “I’ll take the western flank. As acting Head Ranger, you’ll need to be at the front of the offensive to help gauge our success. Since your platoon is already there, can you lead the pincer for the east?”

My skin tingling at the surreal sound of being addressed in my new rank, I nodded. “Can do.”

“Then you’ll have some of the ASV’s and our armored trucks, as well as a battery of mortars.” Chris moved the pieces accordingly, and the little tokens swept across the paper battlefield in two wide arcs. “Your objective will be the same as before; the prison camp in the north. I’ll push hard for the airfield. Once we reach our objectives, we can either radio, assuming ELSAR leaves the comms alone long enough for that to work, or we’ll fire three flares to mark it. As soon as that happens, we begin to collapse the lines inward and squeeze the Organs until they break. Questions?”

No one said a word, and another mortar shell exploded somewhere down the street with a dull *thud.*

Swallowing with a deep sigh of foreboding, Chris stepped back from the table, and reached for his gear, which leaned against the wall behind his knees. “Alright, let’s get to it.”

As the room cleared, Chris caught my arm on the way out and motioned for me to follow him through a small door at the back of the room. Inside, I found a back office with no windows, a desk, and a rather familiar green metal safe in the corner. A kerosene lamp lit it from the desk and cast eerie shadows across the old carpet. It had obviously been Sean’s personal office before he got hit, many of his personal possessions still sitting in various places, his rucksack, a spare pair of boots, and a rifle. As he was currently in the care of our nurses, the place gave off a melancholy aura, a dimly lit shrine to a world that was slowly being chipped away by this awful war.

Once the door clicked shut behind us, Chris strode to the safe and knelt to unlock it. “Sean briefed me on what to do if he were to temporarily be taken out of command. Told me you and I were to keep it under wraps. I take it you already understand the implications of this?”

Out came the canvas sling bag, and upon seeing it, my gut churned. Both ears crawled with the memory of screams, the shrieking of sirens, the arcing of missiles as they swept down to burn countless people to ash. The town of Collingswood had been destroyed by lesser weapons, conventional warheads launched long before I’d arrived in Barron County, but even that had left untold scars upon the wastes. I’d seen it myself, experienced the strange leftovers of the slaughter in its whispers, its shadows, its phantoms that refused to die for the sorrow they’d endured in their final moments. Human suffering always left traces, and the weapon in my hands now could do far more than even ELSAR could imagine.

“I do.” Taking it in hand, I tried not to look at the device, shuddering despite myself at how something so deadly could be so light.

Chris locked the now empty safe and stood to throw the sling bag an unpleasant look. “It can’t stay here, not in case the center gets overrun. You have to carry it with you, which means you have to learn to sit back and let others pull the triggers. No more running headfirst into carnage like today, understand?”

With a heavy sigh, I bit my lip and forced myself to comply. “Yeah.”

“With any luck, this will all be over in a few days, and we won’t need it.” Chris snorted at his own words, as if he didn’t truly believe them, and pulled a computer chair out from the desk to offer it to me. “How’s Lucille?”

I sat in the well-worn swivel chair, while he slumped down onto Sean’s unoccupied cot across from me, the two of us glad for any chance at a reprieve. “She won’t leave Andrea’s body. Won’t speak, won’t eat or drink, just sits there and stares at her dead sister. I can’t take her back to the front like that, Chris, but I don’t want to leave her here by herself. She’s got no one left.”

“Maybe we should send her back with the body to Ark River.” He leaned forward with his forearms on his knees. “You know how gentle those people are, perhaps some time in the church, away from all the shelling, will bring her back to her senses. Like you said, she can’t stay here.”

Lucille’s wail of mourning resurfaced in my head, and I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment to block it out. Guilt cut through my heart in a cold, cruel knife, and I thought back to how she worked hard to help me, set up my tent, ran errands, carried messages. I’d relied on her, but when the time came for me to be there for her, I’d let Lucille down. Her sister had trusted me, they’d all trusted me, and in my moment of responsibility I had failed both Campbell girls.

*If she hates me for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be undeserved.*

Setting the sling pack on the floor by my feet, I rubbed at my face with both hands, and the fingers came away far grimier than I expected. “If I try to send her back, I don’t know what she’ll do. Lucille wanted to be on the front so bad, and if I pull her off it . . .”

“You’re her commanding officer, Hannah.” Chris’s mouth formed a hard, sad line. “Our job isn’t an easy one. I know you care about her, I get that, but sometimes you have to be a leader first and a friend second. Sending her to the rear might be the thing she needs to recover, and whether she likes it or not, an order from you isn’t something she can dispute.”

I picked at the seam of my trousers in a bid to distract myself. He was right, I knew that, but it still felt like a further betrayal of Lucille that I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to commit. “Do you think Sean will be okay?”

He looked down at his scuffed brown boots, and I saw doubt flit through Chris’s expression. “Physically, I think so. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same man again. He was always the calm, diplomatic, calculated one. When he ran off like that, straight into machine gun fire . . . I thought he’d gone insane.”

Wincing at how closely his thoughts matched my own, I looked down at the sling bag, the launch panel hidden under its coat of olive-drab canvas. “It seems like we keep losing people faster than we can capture living space. Jamie, Andrea, Sean, it never ends. Chris, what if we can’t win? What if Koranti has some greater plan, what if we lose Black Oak, and—”

“That’s not going to happen.” Chris reached across the space between us to catch my hand and gripped it hard. “This is going to work, alright? We’re going to finish this together, like we always do.”

I wanted to believe that, but part of me still spiraled with uncertainty. After all, I had always thought when the day of victory came, Jamie would be by my side, the two of us marching to the county border arm-in-arm together. Now she was banished, and I was leading our old faction, a role I felt I didn’t really merit. Could our belief be misguided? Could this war be unwinnable? Were we every bit as foolish as Koranti said?

*Come on Hannah, get it together. Chris needs you, and so does the coalition. If Jamie were here, she’d tell you to toughen up, and she would be right.*

On that mental note, I gave Chris’s calloused hand a return squeeze and shifted in the chair to shove the canvas bag into my knapsack. While my knapsack was rather deflated, given that I’d left most non-essential things back at Ark River, I had a hard time stuffing the square metal panel inside, and at last, in frustration, I dumped the whole thing out onto the office floor.

For his part, rose to Chris top his canteen off from a water dispenser against one wall, the two of us enjoying a peaceful, almost domestic moment. It was warm inside the tiny office, and I slid to sit cross-legged on the floor alongside my pile of things, accepting a small paper cup of water from Chris as I went.

At one point, I inverted my knapsack for a final shake, and from the bottom, a folded bit of plastic tarp I’d forgotten about since before the offensive tumbled out. I mainly kept it in case I had to improvise a crude shelter, or for covering ammo, a casualty, or creating a screen to hide behind while washing myself in the field. Thus far, I’d been either far too busy to need it, or had improvised without, but something brown stuck out from between the green plastic folds and caught my eye.

Curious, I picked it up and recognized the paper-wrapped gift from Professor Carheim. He’d sent it to me via the old resistance leader, Tex, the night I escaped from Black Oak. Due to the chaotic events that followed, notably Tex’s assassination at the hands of Crow, I’d completely forgotten about the parcel. Now that Professor Carheim lay dead, I peeled at the coffee-colored paper with a heavy heart, wishing I could thank him for whatever was underneath.

As the wrappings fell away, my mind spun in confused, bewildered sparks of fascination.

*What on earth . . .*

I’d thought it was a book, judging by its shape and weight, but instead I found a translucent plastic case, the kind a camper might use to keep things from getting wet. A notecard had been taped to the inside of the lid facing outward, and I held it up to the light of the nearby kerosene lamp.

*Hannah,*

*So much has happened in this past year that I do not, and perhaps never will, understand. Our old world has been turned upside down, and it seems our future is as dark as it is uncertain. All that being said, your survival thus far has been one of the few rays of light to pierce this shadowy veil that has been flung on us, and I hope it continues for many years to come. Never forget what we spoke of, amongst the books and writings of a bygone era in human history. You are a champion of Order, of a better future, one I believe in with all my heart. A future of light, peace, and freedom. May these records help you find the way forward, and preserve the work we, the last stewards of a dying civilization, have done in order to keep Barron County a place ruled by men, and not monsters. If there is a God, I hope beyond all measure that he has seen what I have seen of you, and takes it into account whenever you find the end to this long dark road we have all been forced to travel on.*

*Best of luck,*

*Professor Henry J. Carheim*

Tears welled in my eyes, but I blinked them back and popped the latch on the side of the case to empty its content into my lap. Inside, a tightly bound stack of folded papers was held together by scotch tape, and a little black notebook fell out as well.

My already wounded heart sank when I recognized the name in the front flap.

*Property of A.V. Kabanagarajan.*

“What’s all this?” Chris knelt beside me on the carpet and picked up the tape-wrapped stack of papers to examine them.

“Not sure.” I flipped through the notebook, brow furrowed, only to find row after row of names. Some had ranks, as if they were military or ELSAR fighters; others were simple civilian names, but they all had dates beside them. It struck me that these must be deaths, for all the dates were recent, within the past several months, and thus couldn’t be births or anything else. They were too numerous to be the ones Kaba had saved from ELSAR, and on the final page Kaba had inked a parting message on in his neat, studious penmanship.

*Lest they be forgotten.*

“Hannah,” Chris had cut the tape while I paged through the notebook, and held the unfolded papers in his palms, a growing look of alarm on his handsome face. “Look at this.”

They were printouts, page after page from various online forums, some obscure, a few recognizable. All were as recent as the names in the notebook, though there weren’t nearly as many. As I read, my pulse quickened, and I had to remind myself to breathe.

Stories.

Stories about us, about Barron County, about the Breach, all of it.

One was written by Ethan on his first day at New Wilderness. I unearthed another that Chris had created just after his crash landing, and he recalled how he’d used his phone to send it before the device died out. For his part, Chris discovered a post made by Andrea, and reading her words made my chest tighten in grief that hadn’t had much time to scar over. Professor Carheim had one of his own, though it was more philosophical, speculative, and short. However, as I got down to the bottom of the pile, where it seemed the earliest entries were, I came across one post made by none other than Deputy Sean Hammond.

*Just like the posts Matt and Carla first saw before we came here. They were trying to warn us, and we had no idea. Koranti must have had them removed to keep news from spreading.*

My fingers trembled as I traced the lettering and found a mention of an unnamed ‘auburn-haired girl’ who was brought in raving about monsters in the dark. “Oh my God.”

“What?” Chris looked up from a story that seemed to have been written by Adam Stirling, but I was already pawing through the stack to the final, and ultimately, earliest account, which dated back to February.

I held it to the flickering yellow glow of the old-fashioned lamp and read as fast as my augmented senses would let me, paper flying in my hands.

“Madison Cromwell.” I stammered, blood like ice in my veins. Her tormented face rose before my mind’s eye, both from the fever dreams of my infection, and from the memorial photo in the check in building. “She’s the one that went missing in February, at the start of all this.

2. PID so i don't need to faff with temp surfing
3. Fast heat up or the ability to automatically turn it on for warm up

Making 4-6 (mostly) milk drinks in total a day, 2x back-to-back each time.

The dollar value is in AUD. Here are some things I've considered as potential options already:
1. Bambino Plus - More of a ""sidegrade"" but I'm sure there have been some improvements since my 5 year old BBE. Will look nicer on the bench and take up less space. Wife can use the auto milk feature, which will make better milk than she does manually (sorry wife!)

2. Gaggia Classic Pro/EVO (I'm a bit confused on the model variants, but want to avoid boilergate) with a Gagguino kit. Either second hand (I can find them occassion for about $500) or new ($700-$800). I've read that the Peak Coffee kits aren't too bad to put together. I've got limited time for full on hobbies so would definitely prefer a kit, but can invest about an hour per night.

Si friend nakalimutan niya yatang ilog out yung gmail account niya, napansin ko lang to mga 3 days after ng pagkikita namin kasi nga madalang ko rin talaga gamitin yung ipad, at nagtataka ako bakit ang daming notifications na kung ano ano at yun nga account niya pa pala nakalog in sa app. Nung ilalog out ko na sana ewan ko ba't nakita ko pa kasi ang word na ""history"" so napindot ko siya at nakita ko browsing history ni bestfriend, nakita ko na recently lang nanood siya ng porn at ang kinagulat ko pa ilan don ay gay porn. Nashock ako kasi hindi ko ineexpect sa kanya yung mga yon. Since nandon na rin naman ako and nacurious na rin talaga ko kung kelan pa niya yon ginagawa nilagay ko sa search button yung word na ""gay porn"" para mafilter ang history at lumabas sa result na ang dami talaga niya navisit since 2017 pa. Ngayon ang problem ko now is yung isa kong friend nililigawan niya. Di ko alam kung sino kakausapin ko sa kanilang dalawa kasi ayokong masaktan yung friend ko na baka ginagamit niya lang para ihide identity niya. Kung kayo ba, ano gagawin niyo sa ganitong sitwasyon?

Context: I'm 23F and my bestfriend is 23M. We've been best friends since grade 11 dahil madalas kaming magkasama sa mga school project noon, funny and witty rin kasi siya kaya masarap talagang kasama. Pogi siya tbh pero sabi niya wala pa raw siyang nagiging gf that time nung nasa senior highschol pa kami pero nung college days may nababalitaan rin ako na nakakalandian niya pero hindi rin yata natutuloy maybe dahil focused siya sa acads during school days dahil matalino talaga siya that's why.

Previous attempts: Never ko pang tinanong yung about sa sexuality niya kasi hindi ko talaga naisip na gay/bi or baka curious lang din siya kaya siya nanonood ng ganon? Possible ba yon? Huhuhu ano sa tingin niyo? Also, kasalanan rin ba kung tiningnan ko yung browsing history niya? Please give some advice po. Thanks

*Boom.*

Dust rained from the ceiling onto the map table before us, and Chris swiped it away from the topographical lines with a weary hand. “So, we’re all in agreement?”

Around the conference room table, everyone else nodded, their faces drawn. The rest of the day had been nothing short of awful; Sandra and her researchers had worked overtime to keep Sean stabilized, his wounds somehow worse upon their expert inspection. The bullet that had entered above his hip splintered upon impact, and Sean lost a lot of blood in the three surgeries it took to remove it. His ribs were cracked in two places, and he had a concussion from being too close to his own grenades. Shrapnel peppered his torso, and it took hours to stitch him up. Eve and her healers threw everything they had into the fight, and between them, the Head Researcher and matriarch of Ark River had come as close to a miracle as anyone could. Our leader now slept under the influence of generous sedation in one of the hospital cots, but while his life had been saved, Sean’s position as commander had to be filled in the interim. Ethan refused the position, wishing to remain with his Workers, and Sandra couldn’t leave her patients, which meant the role fell one again to a Ranger.

Chris sighed, though I couldn’t quite tell if it was relief or dread from how his shoulders slumped. “Okay. As acting commander, I think our first priority should be to evacuate as many wounded from the city as possible, and work to offset our losses. What’s the status on the front?”

“Organ soldiers are massing all along the line.” Josh stared blankly at the map, his face ashen, though I could tell from the redness of his eyes that he’d been one of many people to shed angry tears. “They’ve been pounding our positions with artillery for the past hour now. I think we’re in for an all-out assault before sundown.”

News of Andrea’s death, along with Kaba’s, had spread through the ranks like wildfire, and the resistance were noticeably demoralized at losing yet another of their influential leaders. Our gate guards had already begun to report numerous attempted desertions from resistance cells, finding abandoned positions where the fighters simply picked up their guns and headed for the refugee camps to wait out the war. What survivors remained from the underground Castle had been evacuated through the long, grimy sewer tunnels beneath the city, but this only created further human logjam in the already crowded southern districts of Black Oak. Civilians from all over were trying to flee the fighting, but with the mutants outside the gates, and the snows becoming more and more frequent, there was nowhere for the masses to run. Food had run low, one of our researchers had discovered contamination in the local water supply which required a boil order, and there weren’t enough intact houses or tents for everyone. Frostbite cases were coming in, and a few old people had frozen to death in the brisk night air. It was a nightmare of human suffering that could only get worse, and Chris had inherited it all as his first day being commander.

Looking down at my arm, I picked at the yellow sash tied there to demarcate my own resulting promotion, since it would be a while before I had time to visit a seamstress. I wouldn’t have minded going from lieutenant to captain if it hadn’t come with the additional, temporary step-up in responsibility; assuming Chris’s old job.

*Will there ever be a time someone becomes Head Ranger without someone else being killed?*

“Yet my scouts report more withdrawal activity in the north.” In response to Josh’s musings, Adam frowned at the map, hand on his sword hilt, one thumb rubbing the pommel in idle contemplation. “At first we thought it might be supply units leaving to restock, but there are multiple ELSAR units pulling back to the northern border. Some of our observation posts even reported skirmishes between ELSAR proper and their Auxiliary hounds. Perhaps the attack on the negotiations wasn’t sanctioned by Koranti?”

“I think so too.” I couldn’t help but nod at Adam, his words almost perfectly in line with my thoughts.

Others turned to look at me, but I turned to Chris, as he was commander now, and I knew he’d understand. “Crow purposefully left Sheriff Wurnauw exposed so he had nowhere to run but their observation post, and then she had her gunners hit it with a heavy crossfire. Even if she couldn’t predict Sean chasing Wurnauw down, Crow knew the firefight between both sides would likely kill anyone inside that shop, which means this was premeditated. She meant to take out our leadership with the rocket attack, then remove her provisional government competition by killing the sheriff. I’d wager there are probably some others we don’t know about who were killed behind the scenes, local politicians, councilmen, maybe even the mayor. She’s trying to take over Barron County, and since Koranti doesn’t share power, I’d say she’s fighting him too.”

“Which means untold suffering for the innocents caught in the middle.” Eve folded her arms and shook her honey-colored head at the map in sadness. “After all, by your own account, these ‘Organs’ don’t hesitate at cruelty of the most extreme kinds. Our healers are reporting numerous young women who’ve tried to kill themselves in our care, because of the abuse they suffered at the Auxiliaries’ hands. We have to protect the people from further violence.”

Sandra perked up a little, the two sharing a mutual look of support due to their combined roles as medical personnel. “Some of our patients from the civilian sector are reporting that Organ troops are using detention facilities where they hold political dissidents as staging areas, since they know we won’t attack them. We have the chance to demonstrate to the people of Black Oak that we are the morally superior choice of government, if we can adequately shield them from the conflict. I think we should consider not only evacuating wounded, but also non-combatants to strategic refugee camps in the countryside.”

“That’ll mean drawing more fighters away from the front line.” Josh set his jaw with a hardened gaze, a cold gravity to his words that sapped further hope from the room. “And besides, we’re already seeing refugees coming *back* through our southern gate from the outside. There’s too many freaks beyond the wall, so unless you’ve got enough material to fortify these ‘camps’ we’re just sending them out to slaughter.”

In my head, I saw again the farmhouse from the southlands, the gore-spattered interior, the dead family ripped to pieces and stuffed behind piles of debris for ‘storage’. New Wilderness had been built on a hilltop before the Breach opened, and the palisade wall that once ringed it had taken the entire fort a long time to raise. Even if we could equip all the refugees with adequate weapons, tools, rations, and warm clothing, there was no way they’d all be able to find suitable hilltops with fresh water nearby, or get protective walls erected in time. Most would die, either from cold, starvation, disease, or worst of all, the mutants.

*Even if the regular freaks didn’t get them, Vecitorak certainly would. He’d have a field day, ambushing an entire column of helpless civilians. They wouldn’t stand a chance.*

Quiet up until this point, Ethan glanced at Chris, his bearded face shadowed with doubt. “My boys can’t work fast enough to set up both refugee centers and maintain logistics for our campaign. They’re dead tired as it is, they need a break. If it if true that the mercenaries are pulling out, then this might be our best chance to take the city.”

Adam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the rest of us, head cocked to one side to accentuate his point. “It still doesn’t answer the question as to why Koranti just gave up and left. Even if there are a thousand Organs in Black Oak, Koranti’s mercs are better trained than the Auxiliaries. He’s got unlimited logistics outside the county line, he has an army of well-equipped soldiers, and yet he’s retreating? Think about it, the radios are working again, they haven’t tried to intercept our comms since the exchange . . . this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It could be that Koranti wants us to kill each other, and then swoop in once it’s over to clean up the pieces.” Ethan stroked his scruffy face with one oil-stained hand. “He didn’t strike me as stupid. Arrogant, maybe, but not stupid. If the Organs really have mutinied, then he’s better off letting us use up all our ammo on each other, and not on his higher-quality troops.”

Chris ran a set of fingers through his disheveled brown hair, and stared at the map in front of him, littered with little tokens depicting unit placement. “It could be that he didn’t expect to lose the Auxiliaries so quickly and is pulling out his heavy weapons to avoid Crow taking them for herself. I figure he doesn’t want a three-way civil war on his hands, which means he’d rather lose all his local muscle than see them take up arms against him. Either way, we can’t pass this up, not when half of the enemy is leaving down, and taking all their big guns with them.”

I leaned forward on the table to point out a few places near the frontline. “A runner from Sergeant McPherson said he noticed less artillery fire than usual from the north. There’s lots of infantry moving in, but it seems their support is faltering. Josh is right, the Organs are getting ready for something big, but without Koranti’s regulars they might be vulnerable.”

Chris took some of the tokens in hand, and moved the pieces around on the map as he talked. “The enemy is massing most of its units in the center, some 800 by the look of it. I think they expect us to bunch up to meet them by the same number, and since they’ve got more men in the city than us, they want to grind us down. If we can pull most of our forces from the center to the flanks, we can encircle and destroy them unit by unit instead of facing them on equal terms. That way, we can make the most of our numbers while they are forced to defend every inch of the front.”

“If they push on the center while we’re attacking the flanks, the enemy could break through.” Ethan made an uncertain half-frown and wiped his hands on his overhauls to be sure they were free of grime before pointing out what he meant on the paper.

“So we move faster than they do.” Chris took Ethan’s comments in stride, his tone guiding and instructive, reminding me of just how well suited he was for such a role. “We hit them hard, use every shell, every mortar, every heavy weapon system we’ve got. Even the exterior scouts can harass their convoys in the north of the city walls. I want them to think we’re everywhere, all at once.”

At the mention of his infamous scouts, Adam straightened up with an air of pride. “I’ll lead the patrols to our west. Anything they do, we’ll see and report. *Amica mea,* can you take the east?”

Eve’s golden irises flashed with a similar glint as her husband’s and she made a demur nod his way, cheeks aglow. “We’ll ride circles around them, *amor vitae meae*.”

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Chris turned to Sandra. “In the meantime, you and Ethan can work on that casualty evacuation out of the center. At the very least, get our wounded to the southern district, in case the center doesn’t hold. Be ready for more though, I doubt the Organs are going to go quietly.”

“Understood.” Sandra made a subconscious tug at her ragged sleeves, as if to roll them up before yet another surgery.

At last, Chris’s gaze fell on me, and I sensed a mix of pride and grim reluctance at what he was asking me to do. “I’ll take the western flank. As acting Head Ranger, you’ll need to be at the front of the offensive to help gauge our success. Since your platoon is already there, can you lead the pincer for the east?”

My skin tingling at the surreal sound of being addressed in my new rank, I nodded. “Can do.”

“Then you’ll have some of the ASV’s and our armored trucks, as well as a battery of mortars.” Chris moved the pieces accordingly, and the little tokens swept across the paper battlefield in two wide arcs. “Your objective will be the same as before; the prison camp in the north. I’ll push hard for the airfield. Once we reach our objectives, we can either radio, assuming ELSAR leaves the comms alone long enough for that to work, or we’ll fire three flares to mark it. As soon as that happens, we begin to collapse the lines inward and squeeze the Organs until they break. Questions?”

No one said a word, and another mortar shell exploded somewhere down the street with a dull *thud.*

Swallowing with a deep sigh of foreboding, Chris stepped back from the table, and reached for his gear, which leaned against the wall behind his knees. “Alright, let’s get to it.”

As the room cleared, Chris caught my arm on the way out and motioned for me to follow him through a small door at the back of the room. Inside, I found a back office with no windows, a desk, and a rather familiar green metal safe in the corner. A kerosene lamp lit it from the desk and cast eerie shadows across the old carpet. It had obviously been Sean’s personal office before he got hit, many of his personal possessions still sitting in various places, his rucksack, a spare pair of boots, and a rifle. As he was currently in the care of our nurses, the place gave off a melancholy aura, a dimly lit shrine to a world that was slowly being chipped away by this awful war.

Once the door clicked shut behind us, Chris strode to the safe and knelt to unlock it. “Sean briefed me on what to do if he were to temporarily be taken out of command. Told me you and I were to keep it under wraps. I take it you already understand the implications of this?”

Out came the canvas sling bag, and upon seeing it, my gut churned. Both ears crawled with the memory of screams, the shrieking of sirens, the arcing of missiles as they swept down to burn countless people to ash. The town of Collingswood had been destroyed by lesser weapons, conventional warheads launched long before I’d arrived in Barron County, but even that had left untold scars upon the wastes. I’d seen it myself, experienced the strange leftovers of the slaughter in its whispers, its shadows, its phantoms that refused to die for the sorrow they’d endured in their final moments. Human suffering always left traces, and the weapon in my hands now could do far more than even ELSAR could imagine.

“I do.” Taking it in hand, I tried not to look at the device, shuddering despite myself at how something so deadly could be so light.

Chris locked the now empty safe and stood to throw the sling bag an unpleasant look. “It can’t stay here, not in case the center gets overrun. You have to carry it with you, which means you have to learn to sit back and let others pull the triggers. No more running headfirst into carnage like today, understand?”

With a heavy sigh, I bit my lip and forced myself to comply. “Yeah.”

“With any luck, this will all be over in a few days, and we won’t need it.” Chris snorted at his own words, as if he didn’t truly believe them, and pulled a computer chair out from the desk to offer it to me. “How’s Lucille?”

I sat in the well-worn swivel chair, while he slumped down onto Sean’s unoccupied cot across from me, the two of us glad for any chance at a reprieve. “She won’t leave Andrea’s body. Won’t speak, won’t eat or drink, just sits there and stares at her dead sister. I can’t take her back to the front like that, Chris, but I don’t want to leave her here by herself. She’s got no one left.”

“Maybe we should send her back with the body to Ark River.” He leaned forward with his forearms on his knees. “You know how gentle those people are, perhaps some time in the church, away from all the shelling, will bring her back to her senses. Like you said, she can’t stay here.”

Lucille’s wail of mourning resurfaced in my head, and I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment to block it out. Guilt cut through my heart in a cold, cruel knife, and I thought back to how she worked hard to help me, set up my tent, ran errands, carried messages. I’d relied on her, but when the time came for me to be there for her, I’d let Lucille down. Her sister had trusted me, they’d all trusted me, and in my moment of responsibility I had failed both Campbell girls.

*If she hates me for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be undeserved.*

Setting the sling pack on the floor by my feet, I rubbed at my face with both hands, and the fingers came away far grimier than I expected. “If I try to send her back, I don’t know what she’ll do. Lucille wanted to be on the front so bad, and if I pull her off it . . .”

“You’re her commanding officer, Hannah.” Chris’s mouth formed a hard, sad line. “Our job isn’t an easy one. I know you care about her, I get that, but sometimes you have to be a leader first and a friend second. Sending her to the rear might be the thing she needs to recover, and whether she likes it or not, an order from you isn’t something she can dispute.”

I picked at the seam of my trousers in a bid to distract myself. He was right, I knew that, but it still felt like a further betrayal of Lucille that I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to commit. “Do you think Sean will be okay?”

He looked down at his scuffed brown boots, and I saw doubt flit through Chris’s expression. “Physically, I think so. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same man again. He was always the calm, diplomatic, calculated one. When he ran off like that, straight into machine gun fire . . . I thought he’d gone insane.”

Wincing at how closely his thoughts matched my own, I looked down at the sling bag, the launch panel hidden under its coat of olive-drab canvas. “It seems like we keep losing people faster than we can capture living space. Jamie, Andrea, Sean, it never ends. Chris, what if we can’t win? What if Koranti has some greater plan, what if we lose Black Oak, and—”

“That’s not going to happen.” Chris reached across the space between us to catch my hand and gripped it hard. “This is going to work, alright? We’re going to finish this together, like we always do.”

I wanted to believe that, but part of me still spiraled with uncertainty. After all, I had always thought when the day of victory came, Jamie would be by my side, the two of us marching to the county border arm-in-arm together. Now she was banished, and I was leading our old faction, a role I felt I didn’t really merit. Could our belief be misguided? Could this war be unwinnable? Were we every bit as foolish as Koranti said?

*Come on Hannah, get it together. Chris needs you, and so does the coalition. If Jamie were here, she’d tell you to toughen up, and she would be right.*

On that mental note, I gave Chris’s calloused hand a return squeeze and shifted in the chair to shove the canvas bag into my knapsack. While my knapsack was rather deflated, given that I’d left most non-essential things back at Ark River, I had a hard time stuffing the square metal panel inside, and at last, in frustration, I dumped the whole thing out onto the office floor.

For his part, rose to Chris top his canteen off from a water dispenser against one wall, the two of us enjoying a peaceful, almost domestic moment. It was warm inside the tiny office, and I slid to sit cross-legged on the floor alongside my pile of things, accepting a small paper cup of water from Chris as I went.

At one point, I inverted my knapsack for a final shake, and from the bottom, a folded bit of plastic tarp I’d forgotten about since before the offensive tumbled out. I mainly kept it in case I had to improvise a crude shelter, or for covering ammo, a casualty, or creating a screen to hide behind while washing myself in the field. Thus far, I’d been either far too busy to need it, or had improvised without, but something brown stuck out from between the green plastic folds and caught my eye.

Curious, I picked it up and recognized the paper-wrapped gift from Professor Carheim. He’d sent it to me via the old resistance leader, Tex, the night I escaped from Black Oak. Due to the chaotic events that followed, notably Tex’s assassination at the hands of Crow, I’d completely forgotten about the parcel. Now that Professor Carheim lay dead, I peeled at the coffee-colored paper with a heavy heart, wishing I could thank him for whatever was underneath.

As the wrappings fell away, my mind spun in confused, bewildered sparks of fascination.

*What on earth . . .*

I’d thought it was a book, judging by its shape and weight, but instead I found a translucent plastic case, the kind a camper might use to keep things from getting wet. A notecard had been taped to the inside of the lid facing outward, and I held it up to the light of the nearby kerosene lamp.

*Hannah,*

*So much has happened in this past year that I do not, and perhaps never will, understand. Our old world has been turned upside down, and it seems our future is as dark as it is uncertain. All that being said, your survival thus far has been one of the few rays of light to pierce this shadowy veil that has been flung on us, and I hope it continues for many years to come. Never forget what we spoke of, amongst the books and writings of a bygone era in human history. You are a champion of Order, of a better future, one I believe in with all my heart. A future of light, peace, and freedom. May these records help you find the way forward, and preserve the work we, the last stewards of a dying civilization, have done in order to keep Barron County a place ruled by men, and not monsters. If there is a God, I hope beyond all measure that he has seen what I have seen of you, and takes it into account whenever you find the end to this long dark road we have all been forced to travel on.*

*Best of luck,*

*Professor Henry J. Carheim*

Tears welled in my eyes, but I blinked them back and popped the latch on the side of the case to empty its content into my lap. Inside, a tightly bound stack of folded papers was held together by scotch tape, and a little black notebook fell out as well.

My already wounded heart sank when I recognized the name in the front flap.

*Property of A.V. Kabanagarajan.*

“What’s all this?” Chris knelt beside me on the carpet and picked up the tape-wrapped stack of papers to examine them.

“Not sure.” I flipped through the notebook, brow furrowed, only to find row after row of names. Some had ranks, as if they were military or ELSAR fighters; others were simple civilian names, but they all had dates beside them. It struck me that these must be deaths, for all the dates were recent, within the past several months, and thus couldn’t be births or anything else. They were too numerous to be the ones Kaba had saved from ELSAR, and on the final page Kaba had inked a parting message on in his neat, studious penmanship.

*Lest they be forgotten.*

“Hannah,” Chris had cut the tape while I paged through the notebook, and held the unfolded papers in his palms, a growing look of alarm on his handsome face. “Look at this.”

They were printouts, page after page from various online forums, some obscure, a few recognizable. All were as recent as the names in the notebook, though there weren’t nearly as many. As I read, my pulse quickened, and I had to remind myself to breathe.

Stories.

Stories about us, about Barron County, about the Breach, all of it.

One was written by Ethan on his first day at New Wilderness. I unearthed another that Chris had created just after his crash landing, and he recalled how he’d used his phone to send it before the device died out. For his part, Chris discovered a post made by Andrea, and reading her words made my chest tighten in grief that hadn’t had much time to scar over. Professor Carheim had one of his own, though it was more philosophical, speculative, and short. However, as I got down to the bottom of the pile, where it seemed the earliest entries were, I came across one post made by none other than Deputy Sean Hammond.

*Just like the posts Matt and Carla first saw before we came here. They were trying to warn us, and we had no idea. Koranti must have had them removed to keep news from spreading.*

My fingers trembled as I traced the lettering and found a mention of an unnamed ‘auburn-haired girl’ who was brought in raving about monsters in the dark. “Oh my God.”

“What?” Chris looked up from a story that seemed to have been written by Adam Stirling, but I was already pawing through the stack to the final, and ultimately, earliest account, which dated back to February.

I held it to the flickering yellow glow of the old-fashioned lamp and read as fast as my augmented senses would let me, paper flying in my hands. I even skimmed over a few of the slower parts, but still, my heart could barely keep up with the whirl of questions going on in my brain. Deep inside, I relived it all, I glimpsed the girl in the storm, the road, the boy in the gray jacket calling to me as he ran. I saw my memories and I saw hers, all blended together in the howl of wind, rain, and thunder.

Like a lightning bolt, a revelation hit me out of nowhere as I turned the final page, and I looked up into Chris’s worried gaze with slack-jawed horror.

“Madison Cromwell.” I stammered, blood like ice in my veins. Her tormented face rose before my mind’s eye, both from the fever dreams of my infection, and from the memorial photo in the check in building. “She’s the one that went missing in February, at the start of all this. She killed the Oak Walker.”

“She’s also the only one of these accounts that actually went into the Breach itself.” He scanned the pages as fast as a normal human possibly could, and all at once Chris’s sky-blue eyes rose to meet mine as his brain locked onto the same conclusion. “Twice, by the look of it. If Vecitorak said he had someone who could resurrect the Oak Walker’s spirit, then it would have to be someone caught in the Breach with him, which means . . .”

I held my right arm up so the kerosene’s flame could illuminate the silver in my tattoos and let the pieces of truth fit together in my head with terrible perfection. “She’s alive, Chris. Madison Cromwell is still alive.”",2,1735371084.0,u_RandomAppalachian468,0,1.0,False

So I’ve been hesitant to lose weight but made up my mind, and I’ve finally gotten into the mindset that I’m losing weight for my health and because I deserve to feel good about myself and my body. Yay!

But (and I hope I worded the question above correctly) I’m just like so embarrassed because that means I’ll actively be perceived by others making more health-conscious choices. 

And I know I shouldn’t care (it’s probably cause I’m young, I’m 22) but I do care! Like I’m just so embarrassed that others will think “Oh look, the chubby girl ordered a salad. She’s finally losing weight.” Or that my family will make comments. Or that if I go to get a coffee with a friend that I’ll have to order a black coffee, which I’m not very fond of lol but I’ll have to like it. I hope I’m making sense??

I’m okay with these changes. Like I said, I’ve realized now that it’s a matter of health and in the long term I’ll be so glad I started. But how do I handle being perceived as actively trying to lose weight? I also don’t want to confront people and make it a big deal (cause to me it already is but don’t want others to know lol) or maybe it isn’t as dramatic as I’m making it out to be?😭",2,1735371074.0,loseit,5,0.67,False

But it did nothing. Tossed and turned until 04:30 and smoked another. Then my stoner friend calls me out of the blue and asks if i wanna go on a drive and smoke.

1ho0kec,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ho0kec,Help needed,"Hello friends,
I’m in a corporate role that includes frequent trips to China. One of the many upsides to this travel is that I’ve been gifted lots of incredible-looking tea, which tends to go unused as we’re a household of coffee drinkers. 

What’s the best way to get this tea into the hands of people that will drink and enjoy it? (I’m in Australia.) 

Our travel is almost exclusively in Fujian province, so most of the sets are Wuji Rock Tea and Narcissus.

1ho0jy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ho0jy8/sober_friends/,Sober friends,"One of the biggest challenges finding my path to sobriety was changing a lot of my routines, friends, activities. For the most part it went well, I had to distance myself from some people, and some were more than accommodating to adjust our friendship to my new goals (like instead of meeting up for happy hour, we grab a coffee/tea/whatever or take a walk). 

I also made some new friends, one in particular I met a few months in that was newly getting sober and it has been really helpful to check in with each other (in person) to see how we are doing, talk about life, other changes, etc. We met up today and she told me she has decided to start drinking again. My heart is kind of broken. I don’t want to hold judgement, but I am feeling selfish and I really liked having my sober buddy that I have seen almost every week for the past year. Now, my worry, is that if I remain close with her, that I will want to drink to kind of keep our connection. But I know that isn’t what I want to do. But I also don’t want to lose a friend. 

I don’t know. I want to be here and be a friend to her, regardless of her decision to drink, but this is so so hard. I know my sobriety is my own, and not dependent on anyone else. But it just kind of stinks. And I wanted to share. 

Just for today, I am not drinking. ",4,1735370374.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

My sister and I could the same actions but are met with different reactions. My sister could dodge work cleverly but my mom would find it endearing and praise her for being smart, which is at her own expense because she has to do that part of work. I on the other hand be called a monster for it. I'm asked to do things for my sister but she goes silent when my sister is to do something for me. For long she and dad, dismissed my grievances by asking me to be more adjusting and giving because I'm an elder sibling. Overtime I mostly excused myself from work because I hated being taken advantage of. The cycle goes like this : mom rants about the pain she feels in her body and amount of work she has to do, I feel pity and do some work, she asks me to do that everyday as a responsible person living in the house, she sees me free so dumps more work on me all while my sister is relaxing in her room, I feel like a bakra and refuse to do that work that I would have previously promised to and my mom gets agitated. None of this for my sister. She could some tasks without being asked once in a while and is showered with praises. She is asked to chill if she has done one or two tasks for the day.

Now this is why I can't cook. If I start cooking, mom will start guilt tripping saying that I can find time to cook when I need it for myself. Will ask me to cook for the entire family. Cooking for 1 and cooking for 4 is entirely different. Thats lot more chopping, lot more time to cook. I'll be asked to make it according to other's tastes. Not at all sustainable if i want to do it everyday. And I don't want to cook for my sister. If I ask her to even make coffee for me, we end up having a fight.

I know solution is to move out but I can't for now. I'm working on my fitness and that's why I want to cook. Mom prepares food but it is not working for me given my emotional eating issues. That's whole another story",1,1735370321.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False
1ho0jh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ho0jh0/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt_1/,There's something out there underneath the ice [pt. 1],"""Bishop to g5,"" I said into the microphone. ""Bishop takes pawn. Check."" 

There was a faint electric crackle over the headset as Donovan considered his next move. We were miles apart, separated by a heavy snowstorm that left the outside world in a blur of white fuzz. In my mind, I could still see him squirming in his computer chair, could picture his lips gently moving as he whispered to himself his next move. 

""King to d7,"" Donovan replied. 

""Can't. Queen at a4. You'll put yourself in check."" 

A faint groan escaped my headphones. Donovan had been operating on maybe three hours of sleep. His head wasn't in the game. The nightmares were getting to him. Getting to us all in their own way, but I was used to little sleep. 

Before I started working at the United States remote research station: Outpost Delta, I lived with my older brother and his girlfriend. They had a 2 year old and a newborn. Sleep was a luxury that I hadn't experienced for almost four years running. 

""Fine,"" Donovan said. ""King to c8."" 

""Knight to e7. Check...again."" 

""You think I don't see what you're doing, you little shit?"" 

""Please, enlighten me."" I had to stifle the laughter from my voice. ""What am I doing?"" 

""Trying to force me into the corner,"" Donovan said. ""You're lucky I don't have my queen anymore. Your king is wide open."" 

""You should probably do something about that once you're not in check."" 

""Yeah, real funny. Keep laughing."" He didn't make a move for a while, and when he did, there was a growl in his voice. ""King to b8."" 

""You're getting awfully close to that corner, my friend."" 

""Why couldn't we have just played Guess Who like I wanted?"" 

""Because we've played Guess Who almost a hundred times by now, and I'm sick of it."" 

""But I hate Chess. I actually hate it."" 

""You just don't have the patience for it."" 

In the year we'd known each other, that was the first thing I came to find out about him. The second was that he was an immense cinephile. When he wasn't wasting his time playing board games with me, or working, he was on the couch watching a movie. 

""You know what I miss?"" he said. 

""Papa John's pizza and Netflix?"" 

""Come on! I mean, who doesn't?"" We laughed about that. ""I miss Runescape."" 

""Never got into it. My brother did for a while."" 

""Let me tell you, it's a lot more fun than Chess."" 

""You're only saying that because you're losing."" 

Before he could respond, another voice intercepted our conversation. ""Have either of you talked to Edvard lately?"" 

It was Mia from Cabin G. We were all part of a research team observing odd phenomenon in Antarctica. Recent tremors and unusual climate change effects. Harsh storms at least two or three occurrences a week followed by hot days. Not necessarily hot in the normal sense, but relatively, it was warmer in the artic than it should've been. 

""No, I don't think so."" I double-checked the daily log beside my computer rig. ""He hasn't been on the public channel since this morning."" 

""Don?"" Mia asked. 

""A quick call on a private channel around two or three,"" Donovan said. ""Nothing important. Just wanted to see if I needed anymore supplies before he sends the registry to the company. Why, what's up?"" 

""He got ahold of me about an hour ago--"" 

""Little early for a booty call, don't you think?"" 

The airwaves went silent aside from the static. I clamped my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. 

""Sorry, not funny,"" Donovan said, but his tone implied otherwise. ""Seriously, though, what's up?"" 

""Nothing,"" she said, ""I just can't get ahold of him."" 

""He's probably taking a nap. Hard to keep a normal sleep schedule out here."" 

Donovan wasn't wrong. The nights felt endless, and the daytime was fleeting at best. Perpetual darkness around the clock. The increase in storms weren't helping either. It was hard to get out from under the covers when you were constantly bombarded by the cold. 

Our cabins had heating systems, but it just wasn't the same. Wasn't as cozy or safe as being beneath the blankets the company provided us with. Some days, you know the type, I didn't get out of my pajamas. On those mornings, I wouldn't even bother with a cup of coffee. Instead, I'd just make some hot chocolate, curl up in my computer chair with a blanket draped across my shoulders, and try not to fall asleep. 

It was especially difficult during the off season. The rest of our colleagues were airlifted home for the holidays. The four of us 'volunteered' to stay behind as the skeleton crew. Keep up with the research and monitoring until the New Year passed. 

The others were scheduled to return January 6th. Then, we would get transported back home for about a week and a half to visit our relatives or do whatever we wanted. Not a bad trade-off considering the extra pay. Time and a half for the weekdays, double time for the weekends. 

""I don't know,"" Mia said softly. Her voice was a faint whisper against the wall of static from the storm. ""Something doesn't feel right."" 

""What'd he last say to you?"" I asked. 

""He thought someone was knocking on his door."" 

""Bullshit,"" Donovan cut in. 

""No, he did!"" 

""I'm not saying he didn't, but that's impossible. There's no one else out here but us. Guy just needs to get more sleep."" 

Again, Donovan wasn't wrong. But to get more sleep implied getting any sleep to begin with. 

""That's not all,"" Mia continued. ""He checked outside his front door and found footprints in the snow. Thought he saw someone out there too."" 

I swiveled in my chair, turning to access the navigational radar to the left of my computer
The display showed a circular grid with all the cabins pre-rendered into the system. When we had a full team, there would have been twenty-six colored dots on the screen. One at every cabin. 

Instead, there were only four dots showing. One at Cabin C (Donovan), another at Cabin J (that was me), and a third at Cabin Y (Mia). Edvard was supposed to be at Cabin R, but his transmitter was casting a signal about two miles north of Cabin M. 

""What the hell?"" I whispered, restarting the system in hopes that it might recalibrate. 

It had done this before. Almost two months ago. There was an interference of some kind that set all of our equipment on the fritz. GPS kept scattering our transmitters all over the place. Lights were going on and off. Communications were down for half the cabins. Everything was a mess. 

Oscar, from Cabin D, even had his power go out. Luckily, the back-up generator kicked on long enough until Rita, from Cabin L, got over there to perform some much-needed maintenance on his fusebox. Blown circuit, corroded wires. Whole thing had to be replaced. 

It was a bad time for Donovan. The company couldn't send replacement parts for almost a week, so he and Oscar had to share a living space for a little while. The cabins are about the size of a studio apartment, maybe slightly bigger. As you might imagine, cramped spaces aren't an ideal environment for multiple people. And you can't exactly complain about the other person without being overheard. 

After the fact, they were good sports about it. Oscar requested a care package during a supply order. Choclate-covered cherries, a variety pack of chips, and a whole assortment of other goodies that he sent Donovan's way. In retur, Donovan ordered some books, movies, and video games for Oscar's 3DS. 

When the radar came back online, the dots were all the same. Edvard's transmitter still put him out by Cabin M, located in the middle of nowhere. 

""Hey, Mia,"" I said, ""did Edvard say anything else to you?"" 

""No,"" she said. ""I told him they were probably his footsteps from last night or something. That there's no out here but us."" 

""I checked the radar, looks like he's out by Henry's place."" 

""What the hell is doing out there?"" Donovan remarked. 

""No clue,"" I said. ""You guys keep trying his handheld. I'll take the Snow Cat out to him and see whats going on. If you get a hold of him, radio me."" 

The cabins were each located about a mile apart from each other. The distance could vary depending on the terrain. A little far on foot, but a quick trip for the plow. 

Of course, that was assuming the weather would be forgiving. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 

Snow came down in curtains, pelting the windshield with bits of ice, sticking to its surface. I turned the wipers on, but there was only so much they could do in a storm like that. 

It took me about half an hour to get there. Even when I arrived, I couldn't be sure if Edvard was actually there. Everything was white, and the snow flurries were funneling in a conical pattern, spinning around me until up was down and left was right. 

I pulled the hood of my coat over my head and anchored myself to the Snow Cat with climbing rope. Thick and durable. A reel almost 100 yards in length. Enough to travel the span of a football field. It might sound dumb, but in an environment like that, it doesn't take much to get lost. And with the low temps, you can't be exposed to the cold for more than maybe ten to twenty minutes without facing serious repercussions. 

I checked the compass I kept in my coat pocket and wandered out into the storm heading northeast. Every analyst was equipped with proper gear for outdoor travel: boots, insulated coat and pants, gloves, goggles, and a face mask. Still, the cold was unbearable. Felt like my skin was on fire, and I'd only been out there for a few minutes. 

I tried to call Edvard's name, but there was nothing I could do against the howl of the wind. Every word was swallowed by it, suppressed into a muffled whisper. I got lucky though. Edvard had left his Snow Cat's headlights on, and through the mist, I followed the pair of yellow beams. 

The windows were frosted over, and the exterior was coated in snow. I pulled on the handle and threw the driver's side door open. It was empty, but the interior lights were still on. I could hear Donovan's and Mia's voices coming in over the radio. 

""Houston to Edvard, you there Edvard?"" Donovan said. ""Do you read me, space cadet?"" 

""Ed?"" came Mia. ""Can you hear me?"" 

I moved to answer their calls, but then, out the other window, I saw a silhouette against the white backdrop of the blizzard. 

I leapt from the Snow Cat and sprinted towards the shadow. The boots were heavy and awkward. The insulation padding for the coat and pants didn't allow much in the way of mobility. It was like trying to walk in one of those inflatable Halloween costumes. 

With enough determination, I reached him. He stood still as a corpse, staring down at the ground. He was dressed in gear similar to mine, his own colored a shade of orange. But after so long in the storm, it had all been frosted white. An anatomically correct snowman. 

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

""Come on!"" I yelled. ""You're going to freeze to death out here!"" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: ""I was here.""",4,1735370318.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

14. **When you realize your friend can’t hold their liquor:** “A toast to the epic journey to puppy videos because you might need some serious distraction soon!”

15. **When your favorite band has an unexpected reunion tour:** “Well, guess I need to stop spending money on adulting now!”

16. **When your pet ignores you for the TV:** “Thanks for the loyalty, Fluffy. I guess Netflix really is the new best friend.”

19. **When your friend insists they can eat spicy food:** “Sure. Let’s just hope you don’t need a fire extinguisher for your taste buds later.”

20. **At a dinner party when someone eats all the breadsticks:** “Ah, I see we clearly came to the 'full-carb' section of the menu!”

21. **At family gatherings when Aunt Judy starts discussing your love life:** “Oh, Aunt Judy, let’s just say I prefer my non-existent love life unscripted.”

22. **When the barista spells your name wrong:** “I mean, I guess spelling isn’t a requirement for coffee? Must be part of the ‘mystique’ package.”

23. **When someone farts in class:** “Thank you for that insightful contribution to today’s curriculum. Truly enriches our learning experience!”

24. **When you’re forced to play a game you hate:** “Great, so this is what hell looks like. Got it!”

27. **At the grocery store when you cut in line:** “Sorry, I just really tend to become an impatient time traveler in these situations!”

28. **If the coffee maker at work breaks:** “Guess we should chalk that up as ‘natural selection’ for the caffeine-dependent!”

29. **When dogs start barking during a meeting:** “Ah yes, a true representation of our thoughts on this agenda!”

30. **If someone wears socks with sandals:** “Fashion police please report to aisle five, we’ve got a clear violation here!”

37. **When someone insists “they don’t need directions”:** “Sure, getting lost is a form of personal growth. So brave of you!”

38. **In a crowded public place when someone coughs obnoxiously:** “No need for alarm, folks! We just might have a viral star in our midst!”

39. **When your friend asks for fashion advice:** “Well, let’s just say ‘T-shirt and jeans’ is looking like runway material in this light!”

40. **At a baby shower when someone mentions “the miracle of life”:** “Here’s a thought: I could easily live without the life struggles of a human being!”

41. **If someone forgets the Wi-Fi password again:** “So, we’re going for a round of ‘Guess the Password’ tagline, I see!”

42. **When someone uses slang incorrectly:** “Congrats! You’ve just invented a brand-new language. Escape route: nowhere.”

43. **During a debate about the best superheroes:** “Pretty sure ‘distracted by shiny things’ isn’t a superpower!”

44. **When someone talks about their “epic” vacation plans:** “Watch out travel influencers, we have a world-class dreamer on our hands!”

45. **If you run into an ex:** “Well, look who it is! Still collecting awkward encounters, I see.”

46. **When discussing how to exercise without actually doing it:** “The best workout is probably visualizing yourself doing all the push-ups, right?”

47. **If someone interrupts a good story:** “Excuse me, the plot thickens, and you’re taking a detour!”

I’m a 33-year-old based in the Seattle/Puget Sound area, looking for someone who’s not only kind and adventurous but also shares my passions. I’d love to start off slow and get to know someone whose interests align with mine—someone who’s down for impromptu getaways and finding joy in the simple moments.

Photography and motorcycling are huge parts of my life. I spend a lot of time exploring the world through a camera lens and from the seat of my bike. I dream of finding a partner who would enjoy a leisurely ride over mountain passes, soaking in the scenery, and stopping for photos of breathtaking landscapes. And if motorcycling isn’t your thing, no worries—road trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

If your idea of fun includes chasing golden-hour sunsets, savoring roadside pie, and creating unforgettable memories, let’s connect. I’m looking for someone who values shared experiences, whether it’s exploring new places or appreciating the beauty of the everyday.

Let’s take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you’ve always wanted to explore—I’d love to hear about it.

More than happy to start off slow chatting online or having low-key coffee meet-ups as we get to know each other better. 

Brown Hair, Blue Eyes. Happy to share SFW photo if we hit it off.

I am allocating $1k/paycheck to my savings and investing goals, with my IRA and HSA each getting $400 until fully funded for the year and the balance going to savings.

I do own a condo with very low payments ($1650 per month, including PITI, HOA fees and payments on a 0% credit line for a new furnace and hot water heater installed this past February), gross income is $116k/year, and total monthly expenses are about $4k/month (HCOL area).

I also have almost 4 months of expenses saved in an emergency fund, but I also want to build another savings fund for larger purchases such as new living room furniture (my couch and coffee table have seen better days) and a new car at some point.  After all, I want to make sure I don’t go into debt for these items and would rather pay in cash when possible.

My question is then, should I put the focus on getting my emergency fund to 6 months of expenses or split the remainder of my $1k per paycheck for saving and investing between the two accounts?

What would you do?

For the record, my plan for my HSA and IRA are as follows:

HSA: $400 for 9 pay periods (employer contributes $700, $3600 would be the balance to max it out).  This will be the last year without catch up contributions to an HSA, since I’ll be 55 in 2026.

IRA: $400 for 20 pay periods to get to $8k.

All remaining money each pay period would go to savings, which means that the last 6 checks of the year, I’d have the entire $1k going to savings.

2 months ago I met a guy through LinkedIn, he had a article written about him which he posted, and I reached out to introduce myself since we’re going to the same university, both Jewish, similar interests, etc. The only thing is, in my view, he came from a stable family, went to school, already has lifers, etc. I on the other hand did not attend school (yes, even in America it’s still a thing), my family is destroyed, and we were literally on food stamps, plus never could get friends since we moved so often. I kinda explained that we had similar interests and a bit about me in a very reserved way when we first chatted (I know my weakness).

We had a call, talked for almost an hour, we laughed and at least for me, I felt good. (Mind you, this is my first ‘friend’ interaction besides in a dream). I mentioned a few things about my childhood, which he seems fascinated by rather than turned off.

Here’s where it gets tricky: after our call, I found out that he is the son of a celebrity/millionaire. I honestly didn’t know till later, but now I’m a little bit nervous to spoil this relationship. We’ve lived opposite lives, yet there’s a mutual respect and appreciation for each other. I also have knowledge about celebrity life (mostly from watching KUWTK), so it’s not super out of this world. He also distanced himself from his dad which brought him down a level (still has Aesop in a frat house tho).

Well, in one of my emotional midnight moments, I sent a pretty long text to him basically laying on the line that he is my first ‘friend’, that I over share (which I explicitly did), and that, even though he might not realize, he’s helped me emotionally so much. I didn’t, and don’t plan on telling him I know about his family. I also asked him what his plans are after he graduates this spring (same as me), and he didn’t answer but did give me advice instead.

I want to cultivate this friendship more, not to rub elbows with billionaires, but because I truly crave having a stable relationship in my life (besides my gf, tho I can be more emotionally open with her). He sends me articles, and is willing to respond to my texts. I choose not to bother him very often, although I think of him many times a day. We follow each other on Instagram (but not at the liking stage). He’s also offered to get coffee in the past (didn’t since he was busy last minute).

Where should I keep this relationship level so that I’m not overwhelming to him, and ultimately, how could I get it to a close friend level? My goal would be to party/travel with him or roommate since we’ll both be moving to Los Angeles and me not knowing anyone or having a lot of money to spend, and him growing up there just makes sense. I don’t want to come off as creepy, irrelevant, or obnoxious. Any ideas or suggestions?",2,1735368879.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

I’m 29 years old and don’t have half as many friends as I wish so would love to meet more people and get out more.

I work adjacent to the movie industry and so between doing that and watching too many movies my life revolves a lot around cinema. I like to read and take film photography and ride my bike but it’s a KTM e-bike so doesn’t really count as exercise. 

I drink too much coffee and not enough water and would love to grab a coffee or beer or a bite to eat while I’m on holiday if anyone’s down. Or any other activity really.

I am a retired solder and truck driver and definitely don't consider myself the brightest light bulb in the pack which is why I ask some stupid questions at times 
I am sitting on what is probably by estimate in the millions of coins that I have acquired  in my buying of storage units. I honestly believe people throw their change jugs in storage units and forget about them
Anyway I have over 10 of those 5 gallon water jugs full of coins. 6 1/2 of them are strictly pennies.
A short time back I decided to start doing some sorting and make up some of those collector books for each of the grand kids.
I'm still working on pennies at this point and haven't even looked at the others and I am maybe 2/3 through the pennies.
Now for my questions:
Can I send in those collector books in to be graded as a complete set? I have 3 sets complete with the date ranges from 1959 to current (so far I have only set wheat pennies into another jug and haven't sorted dates yet). I have picked out what in my opinion are the cleanest and best of the coins for each date to be in the books and most look almost brand new so I thought getting them graded may be worthwhile.
Next, what special years should I set aside to keep that would be of value? So far from what I've read and what I'm already putting away are 1969, 1970, 1972, 1982 (not sure why these would be considered rare cause I have almost 5 coffee cans full of just 1982), 2009, and one site seemed to almost recommend all years in the 70's and 80's that carried an S mint mark. I just figured since I'm taking all this time sorting I may as well search out the valuable years.
I know this is ending up being a larger project than I figured it would be, But for the grandkids it is worth it.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give [Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic ](https://theworldhealth.org/sumatra-slim-belly-tonic-official)a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

1hnzuc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1hnzuc2/how_do_one_save_an_engagement/,How Do one save an  Engagement?,"I [F33] have been with my fiance [M34] for over 7 months. Our relationship moved quickly, and I moved in with him a month and a half into dating and we got engaged 5 months into dating. Throughout our relationship, I was in school and stopped working a month after moving in, so he has supported me for almost 6 months, and my only contribution has been cooking and cleaning. In this economy, it has not been easy for him, and he is under immense financial stress. I had (and still have) every intention of paying him at least 2 or 3 paychecks once I start working while paying half the bills. I graduated this month and will be licensed after passing my boards in January.

My fiance has been very kind, sweet, and supportive. He has a lot of qualities I would wish in a partner. He cares for me when I'm sick, buys me lunch, and showers me with words of appreciation every day. 

However, I have come to realize that I cannot reconcile with him in how different we are. Initially, he told me he was working on becoming closer to to our faith. I have not seen evidence of this in our seven months together. If anything, I feel as if I am drifting from my faith in our time together.

He drinks more than four cans or bottles of beer daily or a whole wine bottle in a day. I have tried to have a discussion with him about reducing his alcohol intake and even challenged him to have a dry November. However, he counters me by saying drinking is his way of dealing with stress and ADHD. I suggested going to the gym, and he did it for two weeks, then stopped. I did not notice the level of how much he drinks until 2 months into moving in with him. It's strange I would not have caught it, as my dad was an alcoholic while I was growing up.

My fiance becomes upset when I bring it up and becomes defensive while recounting how he was able to stop drinking cold turkey previously.

Another thing I cannot reconcile with is that he does not pick up after himself. When I first moved in, he told me that he had experienced a period of depression and his place had just turned into a mess. I didn't mind, and we cleaned it together. 
He would vacuum every day and pick up after himself. If anything, he would be upset with me for not cleaning up properly. Now, he leaves his dirty plates on the couch and coffee table and empty bottles of alcohol on the floor. The living room is always a mess, and he gets upset with me for not wanting to spend time with him there. It became evident to me that not picking up after himself is a formed bad habit, not a phase of depression.

For Christmas, he wanted to bring out little decorations into the living room, decorate the tree, and emphasize how important it was to him. I begged him not to bring more things into the living room because it was already so dirty, and he became upset at me for not supporting something that meant a lot to him. I feel terrible for being unsupportive, but I really did not want the living space to look like a hoarder's living space. I have not invited my family to visit our place because even if I clean the house, it becomes dirty by the end of the day.

I love my fiance very much. He is incredibly supportive, very giving, and soft-hearted. I know there are not many men like him out there, and I should be grateful for him and the support he has given me.

He grew up in a harsh environment with irresponsible parents but works hard and is responsible in his career. I am very proud of how he overcame his situation, and I respect him.

However, I have reached a point where I am tired of asking him to improve on some bad habits and only getting two weeks of attempts before reverting back.


I have also noticed that his communication style is different from mine. If we are arguing about something, instead of reflecting on what I am saying, he will change the conversation to something wrong I did in the past that is unrelated to the current conversation.

If I point out that he did or does something, he will deny that he did it when we were both there to witness him do it. He responds impulsively to win the argument, then apologizes later.

Overall, we moved too fast. I wonder if it is even possible to save this relationship or are we too far different for it to work?",1,1735367440.0,AskWomenOver30,7,0.67,False
1hnzsx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hnzsx8/i_got_a_bambino_for_xmas_i_usually_drink/,I got a Bambino for Xmas.  I usually drink Americanos because I know it hides a bad espresso shot.  I'm dialed in at home now and feel like I'm wasting my espresso on my usual drink.  What should I be making instead?,"Basically, since I've dialed in the espresso, I've been steaming semi-random volumes of milk trying to find something that I enjoy.  Everything tastes like a milkshake.  Online guides about milk drinks are as variable as the regions in which they're made.  I want to taste the coffee.   What should I be making at what ratios to actually enjoy a decent espresso for more than a few ounces?

For reference, I'm a long time Aeropress drinker.  I love a good light roast with tons of nuance.  I'm really enjoying the Americanos I've made with the Babbino, but let's face it, an Americano is basically a way to hide crappy shots.  Sipping a straight shot is pleasant, but I'm American and I like to enjoy my coffee for more than two minutes.  I need some volume.

Give me a target to shoot for!",2,1735367280.0,espresso,15,0.67,False
1hnzsfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hnzsfv,"today we went through you're things, I miss you Grandma","Today, I went to my grandparents’ last home to help sort through their belongings and pack things away. My dad, uncle, aunt, and great-aunt were all working alongside me. As we went through the house, I found a few things I wanted to keep, and in the coming weeks, I’ll also receive some of my grandma’s furniture. It was an emotional day, filled with both laughter and tears.

What struck me most was seeing my grandpa sitting in his old chair, now surrounded by boxes in what was once their familiar living room. He looked so lost. I sat down with him, and we talked for a while. Despite his Alzheimer’s, he still remembers me—for now. He told me how special I was to my grandma, and I told him how special he was to her. He held my hand tightly, and for a moment, we just sat together. I showed him some photos of her I had found, and we shared those memories.

My grandma was the heart of our family—a true matriarch. She loved fiercely, deeply, and unconditionally. Her soul was beautiful, and she brought light into all our lives. Losing her has left an ache, but I’m so grateful for the 28 years I had with her. She loved the simple joys of life—coffee, seashells, pennies, and her faith in Jesus.

She and my grandpa were married for 62 years. He’s 86 now, and she was 81 when she passed. Their love was the kind you read about—he adored her completely. She was his world, his soulmate. As I went through her things today, I found so many pieces of jewelry he had gifted her over the years, each one a testament to the love they shared.

At one point, I stepped outside and sat in her old porch chair, letting the weight of everything catch up to me. I cried as I looked at the photos I now have of her. She was rarely in front of the camera, always preferring to be the one taking pictures of those she loved. Her absence felt so heavy.

I sat with her sister, my great-aunt Karen, who was so close to her. We talked for a while, and she told me how special I was to my grandma. I told her how special she was too and promised I would call her and keep in touch.

As I went through my grandma’s things, I discovered she had kept the dolls I used to play with as a child, packed away with a little note for me. I hadn’t even realized she still had them. I also found some of her perfume, her beloved seashells, and a thick, warm blanket that still smelled like her.

The world feels so different now. I’m trying not to let the grief consume me, but it’s hard. Food doesn’t taste the same, and nothing feels right. It’s like my world stopped the moment she was no longer here.

She was my best friend, my closest confidant. I miss her more than words can say, and I know I’ll miss her for the rest of my life.

I miss you, Grandma.

The dasher accepted it and it showed the dasher was at the McDonalds. 

I waited 15 minutes (seemingly because the order wasn’t ready). It was breakfast order like McMuffins and hash browns and coffee. 

Then see the dasher move. It went to another street two blocks from me. It sat there for maybe 3 mins before moving and then to my house. 

Did the dasher wait for another order and double drop? Can you do this in DoorDash? Or was he also on Skip or Uber Eats ?",2,1735366999.0,doordash,5,1.0,False

I always stay late and come in when needed and now that I’m sick I feel I am guilted for not coming in and my “reputation” should concern me as well according to them. I am not paid enough to care this deeply but truly it does hurt to hear. but I bust my butt every time I’m in, I ALWAYS stay late because no one else is scheduled and I don’t want to leave my coworkers hanging. But I have gotten fed up and I can’t even sleep without having nightmares about work. It’s just no longer healthy for me I feel my mind and body have reached a burnout. My friend who helped get me the job only truly checks on me when I have a shift with them the next day, I feel like our friendship has become distant unless they need a friend to talk to on the phone but when I’m not good it’s a different story they only reach out I feel to gauge coverage instead of a friend seeing if you’re okay. My boss seems fine with it (me leaving for health concerns) but my friend keeps trying to bring up benefits as to why I should stay. I cry everyday I’ve been sick on and off nonstop because calling out too much is bad (even tho I mainly find coverage). A skeleton crew is not my fault my health is in decline and the job isn’t helping. I just wish my friend would be more understanding that it’s not me it’s the company purposefully not giving us people that are needed. I would never make her feel the way she has made me even if she means to help it comes across hurtful and like I’m an inconvenience. I’ve been at the doctor and have labs later this month, I just wish I felt my own friend wasn’t mad at me or judging me but instead just being a friend. I know they are probably stressed because we already don’t have enough people. She made it sound like i really need mental help when I’m just truly mentally fried from the job, it’s not a fit for me, some are on my side and say don’t let anyone guilt you your health comes first but my own best friend makes me feel judged instead of just asking me straight up how I’m doing. (Other context is I have family in the hospital) so of course I’m not doing the best but money is money skeleton crew or not… am I the asshole for putting in my resignation because my health is in decline but my friend seems upset.
