Originally I was thinking split 6 days in Maui + 6 in Oahu; Maui being first so we can really chill at the beach, then getting more adventurous as the trip goes on. We‚Äôre flying out of Denver, so both have direct flight options if needed.

It‚Äôs soooo difficult to narrow down the islands though. It‚Äôll be our first time there and it all looks incredible. I could also see us really enjoying the Big Island‚Äôs parks, volcanoes, and coffee plantations. Flying to/from Denver from here might be a little more difficult from a quick Google search. 

For those who have been to the islands, does 6 days/each split between 2 islands seem reasonable? I‚Äôve read many say that anything less than 4 nights on an island leaves something to be desired. 

Then looking in October, is a certain time of month better than others? If you had to choose 2 islands of the 3, what would you choose? 

I‚Äôll take any resort recs too! I love exploring the best of the best but could also see us splitting the trip with a really bougie place on the beach, and a slightly less bougie place somewhere gorgeous. ",1,1741833123.0,honeymoonplanning,1,1.0,False
1ja1s9n,https://i.redd.it/dfyd38hcbdoe1.jpeg,Oh Joann's where will we go now?,"Yarn from what I am pretty sure will be my last Joann's run. I have a lot of feelings on this. As someone who once worked for a company that was bought out by a private equity firm that liquidated all the land the stores were on forcing the stores to pay rent on buildings they'd been operating out of for 40+ years with paid mortgages. I feel for the workers. I have literally been in their shoes. I genuinely feel for each worker at Joann's, and while we are shopping remember  these folks have lost their jobs already and are doing their best. I know when it happened to me over 3/4 of our staff walked out and we were unsure if we would eventually get paid. 

For the last 4 years I've been living in a smaller town in the southwest. The next nearest ""craft store"" is an hour+ away. 

Crafting and specifically crafts involving yarn are a part of the culture in my town. At a local coffee shop there's a knitting/crochet circle that meets a few times a week mostly some older ladies. I once saw one woman's husband hauling in a plastic bin filled with yarn for her as she walked to that yarn circle with a walker. It was absolutely adorable. Farmers markets will have people working on projects or selling them. In the summer we have a bunch of festivals and people will have entire stalls dedicated to hand woven tapestries, tablecloths, knitted/crocheted projects. It may not be in big ways but crafting is undeniably built into the culture of the area I live in. 

While it's a small town plenty of people love crafting weather it's with yarn or not. But it's been very dominated by crocheting and knitting communities here. And those communities are predominantly women. *(Not to say men are not welcome just that it skews heavily towards women.)* 

As I stood in line with what I am pretty sure will be the last time I'll be in there, there was a line of 10+ women. The checkout line had all those reusable bags, some with ""empowered women empower women"" ""empower the women around you"" ""glass ceilings are meant to be broken"" ones for black history month, feminism etc... And I realized for the first time that Joann's was a ""safe space"" for me. I started knitting at around 9 years old and only just started crochet. Joann's has just always been there in the backdrop of my life.

I looked around and I just had a moment where I wondered where will we go? We don't have another craft or yarn store in town. While there are communities of people who get together to crochet and knit together and undoubtedly that will continue. I just felt such an extreme feeling of loss, that the place I run to when I have lost a round of yarn chicken will be gone, the place I go to look at yarns and put them together for a project so I can know how they feel and look together is gone. The place where you could talk to other people interested in the same things for advice is just gone. Countless times I have asked random women in the store what they thought of colors I was using for a knitting project or a crochet project and thwy too would ask my advice. I think this may be hitting me a bit harder because this is the ONLY craft store nearby.

RIP Joann's you will be sorely missed. ",5,1741832850.0,YarnAddicts,0,1.0,False

The only downside is that if I take too much, I end up getting nauseous for some reason. DPH seems to help, but that just means I have more of my unhealthy vice in the home. I used to take ungodly amounts of Benadryl for fun.

Anyway, i just wanted to post something for potential newbies. It's really much easier than I thought I'd be, and it's much more effective. Id usually down over 20 g. in capsules and still feel like i need more. Now I can cross the line of ""too much"" with a single tablespoon.

Sustained eye contact when we met each other. Each time I see her, she seems to put herself in positions to be around/talk to me. First time I was grabbing some water, she left the bathroom near, double taked me and came over to the fountain, so I chopped it up with her asking advice about our shared hobby since she's a local legend and super impressive. Since then, she'd be stopping to grab some water when I'm walking near, which lines things up so we run into each other. Stopping to check her cell phone in a place I have to walk by, so I say hey, and she starts a conversation. 

Third time I saw her, we hung around one another for a while, so I asked her if she wanted to kick it. Grab a coffee. Play an outdoor activity. She ignored the coffee comment, went off on how bad she is at the activity, but how she would be down. When I went to set a date she was ""busy all month"". So I gave her my number, told her if she finds time to hmu. We kindly small talked and parted. She never hmu. I took it as a rejection. 

This was 5 months ago, and Ive been on dates since then. I gave the situation some space, ran into her a couple weeks later. She came up to me immediately. Starts kindly talking to me. She is incredibly popular, and we run into each other in a place with a lot of men giving her attention, yet she continually comes up to me on the couple of times per month I see her. Conversations can get semi-deep, but she's busy with work and has to cut them after a few minutes. I tried moving on, not actively ignoring her, but not trying to seek her out - when I catch her out of the corner of my eye, she will come up to me pretty quickly to talk, without fail. Still putting herself in positions to talk to me. Im not projecting romantic interest anymofe. However, I can tell she will sometimes look out of the corner of her eyes at me. 

Most recently, I briefly said what's up, moved away. She came over where I was participating in the activity, but I guess was ""busy"" instructing someone. I tried sitting next to her and when I went to talk to her, her back was turned to me. She had an opportunity to sit next to me and her apprentice, opted to sit on the outside excluding me, wouldn't look me in the eye. Yet would cheerlead me when I was participating in the activity. I felt embarrassed, like damn, someone literally turned their back on me and wouldn't look me in the eye. Yet next time I'm there, she comes up to me and tries to catch my eye while I'm talking to others, sweetly says ""hey"" to me, and puts herself in position near me.

She is undoubtedly the most gorgeous person ive met, but it feels like I'm getting mixed signals and like she wants my attention on her terms: quantity, depth, and timing. She seems like someone I'd like to be friends with outside of the confusion, if I can move past romantic feelings. I also dont want to burn the bridge or make our shared space awkward for either of us by ignoring her. But I'm just overall confused. My journal is littered with pages on how I need to move on, it just feels hard with these signals of semi-interest. It is in stark contrast to the women at this activity who clearly project interest in me, though, who like will stick around as long as possible, hint at dating, ask deep questions about me. If she is just seeking my attention, I dont think it's malicious.",1,1741832198.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1ja1i9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1ja1i9r/where_theres_smoke/,Where There's Smoke,"When I was in college, I got involved with a paranormal researching group through a friend of mine, we'll call him M. M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.



We were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel. He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader.¬†



We rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.



We did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.



The Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault.¬†



The family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.



""Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.""



We pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low.¬†



M said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.



M always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.



The couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.



Some of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.



""We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.""¬†



The woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.



""Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.""



So, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.



I didn't sense much. Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.



After about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.



""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.



""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.

M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.



We were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel. He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader.¬†



We rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.



We did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.



The Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault.¬†



The family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.



""Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.""



We pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low.¬†



M said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.



M always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.



The couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.



Some of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.



""We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.""¬†



The woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.



""Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.""



So, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.



I didn't sense much. Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.



After about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.



""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.



""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.

He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader.¬†



We rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.



We did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.



The Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault.¬†



The family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.



""Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.""



We pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low.¬†



M said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.



M always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.



The couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.



Some of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.



""We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.""¬†



The woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.



""Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.""



So, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.



I didn't sense much. Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.



After about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.



""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.



""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.



Actions, after all, have consequences.¬†

When I was in college, I got involved with a paranormal researching group through a friend of mine, we'll call him M. M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.



We were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel.

Not afraid. Not flustered. Amused. They leaned in, head tilting like they were trying to get a better read on you.

The couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.



Some of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.



""We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.""¬†



The woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.



""Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.""



So, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.



I didn't sense much. Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.



After about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.



""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.



""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.

When I was in college, I got involved with a paranormal researching group through a friend of mine, we'll call him M. M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.



We were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel. He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader.¬†



We rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.



We did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.



The Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault.¬†



The family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.



""Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.""



We pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low.¬†



M said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.



M always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.

1ja1bpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ja1bpw/stupid_me/,Stupid Me,"Hey everyone,

So i'm 27, living with my partner for 5 years now, and simply
put before we were married i got caught messaging other girls; it was a upsetting situation but we've been married for 4 years and this time we've had a baby; i've been messaging other girls again.


now the honest situation is this; i messaged a lot of girls, i met none, i haven't seen a single soul other than my wife, i met them to seek validation, we've had a non existent sex life and the shoulder i used to have to lean on hasn't existed for nearly a year, yes i know the first year is the roughest and everything else but the justification isn't me denying blame, i take responsibility for my actions fully.

since being caught i've cut off said friendships that encourage said behaviours, started therapy, and joined gym, it's putting an end to all of my bad habits and replacing it with healthy options.

my partner has decided to simply put a split to both of us currently and has took of her wedding ring, she's living at her mothers and the property we were renting she has said we should give back (partly because i was partaking in bad habits to cover funds as business has been horrible recently, e.g; gambling) furthermore i'm now seeing my son every 7 days or so for 2/3 days.

i'm trying so regardlessly hard to fix this and fix me but today was our second meet, we had agreed to meet back at our rented property which is in leeds, her family live in middlesborough and mine sutton coldfield, but as we arrived in leeds, i cleaned up made sure the house was spotless for her arrival & my sons so we can have a fab day but she arrived all dolled up, looking insanely cute, but said she's going for coffee with the baby mums group, made an excuse to go see whomever and then some lies to go with it like oh they constantly visit leeds so we're going to the neighbouring city (york) to just get out of here, i didn't make much of it until she arrived at home.

so i was caught by her as she used my phone saw some photos on my gallery of girls; which all the boys had been sending around in group chats, and she asked to go through my phone, reluctantly i said no and tried to gaslight her (i realised after its horrible nonetheless) and she saw everything.

today i picked her phone casually to order a chippy from the locals for her, and saw a message from
her ex saying ""let me know when your home safe x"" i balled out for ages seeing this because yes i know im in the wrong but im honestly trying from the depths of my heart to fix us but it felt like i was being punched in the gut, that with her arriving home with no wedding ring on, making all these elaborate lies and then that being the situation.

i questioned her; she said we went for coffee; but she doesn't owe me an explanation, a 4.5 hr coffee is excessive, let alone you've made a conscious effort to look pretty for your ex, and then just now i've used her phone to change the music for my kids nightlight and just went onto her instagram, and she's deleted all of her past messages with this guy?

im so incredibly confused and distraught on what to feel, can anyone provide any words of wisdom üòÇ

1ja1b6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ja1b6d/aitah_or_is_my_friend_annoying/,AITAH or is my friend annoying?,"
I‚Äôm in the U.S. on a cultural exchange program, and I met a girl who became a friend of mine. When I first met her, I really liked her, but over time, I started finding some of her behaviors annoying to the point where I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with her anymore. She‚Äôs a nice person, and I know that we all can be annoying sometimes. I‚Äôve also learned to accept people and overlook small behaviors‚Äîunless they‚Äôre intentionally hurtful or mean‚Äîbecause I know I have flaws too, and others put up with them.

That said, I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm overreacting, if I‚Äôve simply moved past the ‚Äúfriendship honeymoon phase,‚Äù or if most people would also find these behaviors frustrating. Here are some things that have been bothering me:

1-One day, I was really busy‚ÄîI had to meal prep and do my laundry‚Äîso when she asked to hang out, I told her I couldn‚Äôt. She then asked if she could come over instead, which seemed like a good idea, but my roommate had relatives visiting. When I explained that, she started suggesting solutions: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start your laundry now so it‚Äôs ready when you get back?‚Äù I told her that the washer/dryer where I live doesn‚Äôt work well, and I need to run my clothes through multiple cycles, so I‚Äôd rather stay home. Then she suggested I bring my laundry to her house. When I reminded her I also had to cook, she suggested I cook at her place instead. At that point, I was already stressed and didn‚Äôt want the extra hassle of carrying everything back and forth. I told her again that I‚Äôd rather stay home, and she finally understood. The next day, I texted her, and we went for coffee.

2- Once, I was in the car with her when my boyfriend called. Since I was connected to the speaker, she could hear our conversation. I introduced her, mentioning that she was from (her country). He greeted her and then referenced a viral video from her country. After that, every time he called, she wanted to talk to him. At first, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, but over time, even he got annoyed. He started ignoring her or making brief comments to be polite.
For context, when I‚Äôm with friends and someone calls me, I keep the conversation short or text them to call later because I find it rude to be on the phone while hanging out with someone.
One time, my boyfriend called to ask what we were going to cook that night so he could pick up the ingredients. He mentioned that he really liked a specific dish I had made for him before. I was on speaker because I was cleaning my room, and she suddenly jumped in, saying she would teach me how to make the best version of that dish. My boyfriend politely replied that it wasn‚Äôt necessary because he already loved mine. She kept pushing, saying, ‚ÄúOh no, she probably doesn‚Äôt understand the greatness of (dish).‚Äù It was so awkward. I just said, ‚ÄúThank you, babe,‚Äù and wrapped up the conversation.

3-We were at a packed restaurant with some friends and needed to ask the waitress for something. There was only one waitress working, and she was rushing back and forth with plates for a large table. Since it wasn‚Äôt urgent, we decided to wait until she was done. The whole time, my friend kept pressuring us, saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just ask?! Just do it! Literally, just ask her!‚Äù She sounded frustrated, almost angry, like she was annoyed that we weren‚Äôt interrupting the waitress. I finally snapped and told her, ‚ÄúThen you go ask her.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt, of course.
	
4- She has a best friend back home who recently started dating someone. She told me about their first conversation, and it went like this:
	‚Ä¢	Her: ‚ÄúOkay, you sound nice. I‚Äôm glad to finally talk to you. You don‚Äôt sound like a psycho.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Her friend‚Äôs boyfriend: ‚ÄúNah, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not a psycho. I would say I‚Äôm kind of crazy, though. I always want to do crazy stuff, but (girlfriend) doesn‚Äôt like that.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Her: ‚ÄúOh, you want crazy stuff? I‚Äôm always doing something crazy! Do you want a video from a stranger? I can go ask a random person to say hi to you in a video.‚Äù
Then she kept talking about how she‚Äôs the ‚Äúcrazy one‚Äù while her friend is not. She constantly mentions how wild or spontaneous she is, almost like she wants people to be impressed by it.

5- Whenever someone mentions something like, ‚ÄúOh, I have to work this weekend,‚Äù she responds with, ‚ÄúYou work on weekends?! Omg, I‚Äôm soooooo glad I don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù That‚Äôs just one example, but she does this often in different situations, making comments that feel unnecessary or inconsiderate.

These are the most prominent examples. What do you guys think? Am I overreacting? I also think that maybe she doesn‚Äôt have bad intentions but she‚Äôs just idk‚Ä¶ dumb? lol or maybe that she lacks self awareness. Please comment, I‚Äôd love to read your opinions. ",3,1741831408.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.



After about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.



""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.



""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.



Actions, after all, have consequences.¬†

When I was in college, I got involved with a paranormal researching group through a friend of mine, we'll call him M. M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.



We were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel. He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader.¬†



We rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.



We did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.



The Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault.¬†



The family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.



""Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.""



We pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low.¬†



M said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.



M always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.



The couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.



Some of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.



""We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.""¬†



The woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.



""Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.""



So, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.

We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer.

""There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?""



The Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt.

""Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.""



Then he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.



""If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.""



They thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.



When we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.



Two days later, I got a call.



It wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.



They had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.



Apparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.



""We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?""



I explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.



""So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?""



""Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.""



He nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, ""Does this look familiar?""



It was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.



The charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.



""That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.""



They had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.



After that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.

You have seen him before, though you cannot recall where. Perhaps in the background of a crowded street, just beyond the edge of your vision. Perhaps seated in a diner, a cup of coffee growing cold before him. Perhaps in the reflection of a window, though when you turned, there was no one there.

He is not remarkable. His clothes are neat but forgettable‚Äîalways appropriate for the season, but never standing out. His posture is relaxed, his movements unhurried. He does not speak first, but if you address him, he will smile in a way that feels like he has been waiting for you to do so.

No one else seems to notice him. If you point him out, your friends will nod, unbothered, and change the subject. If you ask a shopkeeper if he was just in the store, they will hesitate before answering, as if the memory is slipping away even as they reach for it.

He is always just leaving.

You have passed him on the sidewalk, exiting Jim‚Äôs Ice Cream Parlor. You are sure of it. But when you stepped inside, Jim only greeted you as usual, the shop empty except for the two of you.

You once saw him standing in the doorway of the school. The door was ajar, just enough to see the dark beyond, but not enough to see inside. When you blinked, the door was closed.

No one remembers his name. If you ask him, he will tell you something different each time. Something close to familiar, but never quite right.

Sometimes, you think he is following you. Not closely. Not in any obvious way. But there are nights when you catch a glimpse of a figure beneath the glow of a streetlamp, too distant to be sure, and yet unmistakably him.

And sometimes, you think‚Äî

You are the one following him.

There is a man.

You have seen him before.

When you're facing overwhelming odds, or being called upon to take incredible risks and defy incredibly odds, or else to, as a unit, perform something that is going to be *incredibly* costly but which is (a) necessary, and (b) any lesser unit would fail utterly to achieve (such as the Charge of the Light Brigade, though that was a fuck-up because the commander misunderstood his orders, but they still performed heroically and accomplished something that any lesser unit would have utterly failed to do), there are always going to be certain cultural touchstones, battle-cries, drawing upon your culture and history, that inspires ordinary men and women to hearken to the deeds of their metaphorical (and possibly literal) ancestors.

For example, when you need to inspire Japanese to such feats, the correct way to do so is to draw your sword, point it in the vague direction of the enemy, shout ***""BANZAI!""*** at the top of your lungs, and lead the charge personally.

When you need to inspire the British, you give a cry of *""Tally ho,* lads!"" whilst waving your hat over hear head and gesturing in the vague direction of the enemy. You do not lead the charge from the tip of the spear, but you are *following* the man who does.

When you need to inspire United States Marines, you shout at your own men like you're angry at them, ""Come on, you sons of bitches! Do you wanna live forever!?"" Then fix your bayonet and recklessly advance in the direction of the enemy, laying down cover fire.

So, what would the Worker Drones use? Obviously their problem is they're all paralyzed with fear and ***unarmed*** (which is an undesirable trait for a military) in MD, but supposing they nutted up and started building themselves guns after all the shit went down, what would their battle cry be?

I have always been mindful to keep my discussions of my situation to a minimum, to avoid negativity. when i lost my job and had trouble with the current job market, people stopped asking me to hangout. when i had two failed surgeries this year, people stopped asking how i am. now that my health has declined even worse, i have no contacts in my life anymore. they‚Äôve all slowly faded away after pitying my situations and then treated me differently. this is very difficult as a 25 yo woman who desires the sanity of companionship and friends. this feels like a negative feedback loop that is nearly impossible to escape from. when i think about it ‚Äî if i somehow miraculously had a change of luck, i wouldn‚Äôt want to associate with me or people like me either, I‚Äôd want to get away from it. i add nothing to the table anymore, i have no network that would entice another person my age to stay in contact with me. my health and career struggles have just compounded onto each other, and now i‚Äôm basically a shut in. i was never this way to this degree in my entire life, and it hurts so badly. i‚Äôve also learned that some people i have known through my life aren‚Äôt real friends to discard me like this. what is one to do in my situation ‚Äî or do i just accept a loner life confined to the outskirts of society which will someday lead me to end my life?

1ja12q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1ja12q9/i_am_a_detective_investigating_a_murder_in_a/,"I am a Detective Investigating a Murder in a Rural Louisiana Town, The town has STRANGE RULES !","The girl was seventeen years old when they found her, laid out like a broken offering on the edge of the swamp. Her name was Abigail ""Abby"" Thorne, daughter of a single mother, last seen leaving her part-time job at Waylon‚Äôs Gas & Grocery two nights before.

The way she was found‚Äîstripped to the bone in some places, untouched in others, hands placed neatly over her chest like she had been posed‚Äîmade it clear this was something different. Not just a murder. A message.

I arrived in St. Mercier, Louisiana, on a gray October morning, driving down a two-lane road flanked by bald cypress trees, the kind that loom like twisted sentinels over the waterlogged earth. The town sat near the edge of the Atchafalaya Basin, where the land felt more like forgotten swamp than civilization. I passed abandoned sugar mills, their rusted skeletons still standing against the sky, and trailer homes with Virgin Mary statues out front, half-sunk into the ground from years of flooding.

St. Mercier wasn‚Äôt much. A gas station, a church, a handful of businesses clinging to the edges of Main Street, and beyond that‚Äîa sprawl of farmland and dense, unnavigable marshes. The kind of place where people didn‚Äôt talk to strangers and the law was more of a suggestion than a rule.

Sheriff Earl Duvall, a man in his sixties with the kind of face carved by cigarettes and bad sleep, met me at the town's only diner. He pushed a black-and-white crime scene photo across the table‚ÄîAbby Thorne, arms crossed over her bare chest, her eyes gone.

""The crows?"" I asked.

He shook his head. ""No crows touched her. No gators either. We found her like that."" He tapped the photo. ""The eyes weren‚Äôt taken by animals, Detective. They were scooped out. And whoever did it, they left her that way on purpose.""

I had seen plenty of dead bodies in my time, but something about this one felt different.

‚ÄúLocals say she broke the rules,‚Äù Duvall muttered, stirring his coffee absently.

I frowned. ‚ÄúRules?‚Äù

He exhaled heavily, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúEvery town‚Äôs got superstitions. This one just takes ‚Äòem a little more seriously.‚Äù

Before I could press him, the waitress‚Äîa gaunt woman with deep-set eyes who looked like she hadn't smiled in a decade‚Äîcame by to refill our coffee. She didn‚Äôt look at me as she poured, but her hand trembled slightly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre investigating the girl, ain‚Äôt you?‚Äù she muttered, voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded.

She hesitated, then leaned in slightly.

‚ÄúYou should go back to Baton Rouge, detective. This town don‚Äôt like it when outsiders start asking questions.‚Äù

I glanced at Duvall, but the sheriff was suddenly real interested in his plate of eggs.

Something was wrong here.

The girl was dead. The town had rules. And whatever they were, I had the sinking feeling that Abby Thorne had broken one.

The road leading to Abigail Thorne‚Äôs crime scene was barely a road at all‚Äîjust a stretch of packed dirt and gravel, winding through dense cypress trees, the branches so thick overhead they swallowed most of the daylight. Spanish moss hung like tattered curtains, swaying lazily in the humid breeze. The air smelled of wet earth and something else‚Äîsomething sour.



Sheriff Duvall drove in silence, his hands gripping the wheel like he was bracing for something. I watched the trees pass by, but I wasn‚Äôt just looking at them. I was feeling them.

Something about this place was off.

The deeper we drove, the heavier the air felt. The silence wasn‚Äôt just quiet‚Äîit was waiting.

We finally stopped near an overgrown clearing, just a few yards away from the edge of an abandoned sugarcane field. A single stretch of yellow crime scene tape fluttered uselessly in the breeze.

‚ÄúShe was found here?‚Äù I asked.

Duvall nodded but didn‚Äôt move to get out.

I stepped out of the car first. The heat was thick, suffocating, and the smell of stagnant water clung to my skin. The grass was flattened, the soil still dark where the girl‚Äôs body had been found.

No footprints. No drag marks.

Just like someone had placed her there.

Duvall climbed out, clearing his throat. ‚ÄúSomething I oughta tell you, Detective,‚Äù he muttered.

I looked up.

‚ÄúFolks in this town‚Ä¶ they got ways of thinking. Ways that ain‚Äôt always modern.‚Äù

I studied his face. ‚ÄúMeaning?‚Äù

He exhaled, then reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, folded piece of paper. It was old, stained in places, like it had been passed through too many hands.

I took it. Unfolded it.

Inside were rules :

**The Laws of St. Mercier (To Be Followed Without Question) :**

1. **If you find a door in the woods, do not open it. No one builds doors without walls.**
2. **Never bring back anything taken from the water. Some things are meant to stay drowned.**
3. **If you hear your name whispered from the cane fields, do not answer. It is not calling you‚Äîit is remembering you.**
4. **On the first Sunday of every month, every house must leave an offering on the porch before midnight. It does not matter if you believe. It matters that it believes.**
5. **There is a house at the end of Red Creek Road. No one lives there. No one ever has. If a candle burns in the window, do not look at it. If the door is open, do not go inside.**
6. **If you wake up to the sound of someone moving in your home, do not search for them. They have already seen you.**
7. **The missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.**

A cold sensation crept over my skin.

I looked up at Duvall, half-expecting a smirk. Some kind of joke. But he just stood there, staring at me like he was waiting for me to understand.

‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with Abby?‚Äù I asked.

He nodded toward the edge of the clearing.

Beyond the tall grass, past the trees, the sugarcane field stretched out like an ocean of green. I followed his gaze until I saw it‚Äîsomething small, half-hidden in the dirt.

I walked closer, crouched down.

It was a door.

Old. Wooden. Covered in faded carvings.

And half-buried in the ground.

A door without walls.

I turned back to Duvall. ‚ÄúDid she open it?‚Äù

His face was pale, his jaw tight. He didn‚Äôt answer.



But I already knew.

Abigail Thorne opened the door.

And something came through.

I took photos of the door, brushing away dirt to get a better look at the carvings. They weren‚Äôt just random scratches‚Äîthey were symbols. Strange, looping marks that almost looked like letters, but not in any language I knew. The wood was warped, swollen with time, and there was no handle.

It didn‚Äôt belong here.

I turned back to Sheriff Duvall, who stood stiffly near the car, watching me like he didn‚Äôt want to get any closer.

‚ÄúThis was here before Abby died?‚Äù I asked.

Duvall hesitated, then gave a slight nod. ‚ÄúFar as I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt think to mention it before?‚Äù

Another pause. Then, quietly‚Äî‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt push him. Not yet.

Instead, I took one last look at the door before we left.

The thought stayed with me as we drove back toward town, the road weaving through miles of flat, open land, past rotting barns and crumbling houses, places long abandoned but still standing like silent watchers.

I needed to know more about Abigail Thorne.

Waylon‚Äôs Gas & Grocery - Last Place She Was Seen Alive

Waylon‚Äôs sat at the edge of town, a small, dusty gas station with a general store attached, the kind of place where the shelves carried equal parts beer, motor oil, and hunting knives. The windows were clouded with age, the walls lined with old yellowing posters for church raffles and missing dogs.

Inside, a thin, red-eyed girl at the register barely looked up when I walked in. Name tag: Katie.

I set my badge on the counter. ‚ÄúYou were friends with Abby?‚Äù

She swallowed. ‚ÄúI worked with her.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúShe came through here the night she disappeared?‚Äù

Katie fidgeted, glancing toward the back of the store. Like she was checking to see if we were alone.

I leaned in. ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm not from here. I don‚Äôt care what stories people tell. I care about who killed your friend.‚Äù

She hesitated, then leaned forward, voice barely a whisper.

‚ÄúShe was scared.‚Äù

A chill ran through me.



‚ÄúScared of what?‚Äù



Katie‚Äôs fingers trembled as she traced an invisible shape on the counter.



‚ÄúA week before she died,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúAbby started saying she found something out near the cane fields. Said it wasn‚Äôt right. She kept asking people about it, but no one would answer her.‚Äù



I could already guess what it was.



‚ÄúThe door.‚Äù



Katie flinched at the word. ‚ÄúShe wanted to know what was behind it.‚Äù



I stared at her, waiting.



She swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThen she started talking about opening it.‚Äù



Something heavy settled in my gut.



‚ÄúWhat happened next?‚Äù



Katie‚Äôs gaze darted toward the door, like she was afraid someone would walk in. ‚ÄúThree nights before she went missing, she told me she‚Ä¶ she had a dream.‚Äù



I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat kind of dream?‚Äù



Katie licked her lips. Her voice dropped to barely a whisper.



‚ÄúShe saw something coming out of it.‚Äù



I felt a sharp prickle of unease at the back of my neck.



‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù



Katie‚Äôs breath was shaky. ‚ÄúShe said when she woke up‚Ä¶ there was dirt in her bed. Under her fingernails. In her mouth. Like she had already been there.‚Äù



She had opened it.



Whether she meant to or not.



I turned back toward the door. I needed to get out there again. Needed to see for myself.



Because whatever Abby had found‚Ä¶



It wasn‚Äôt done yet. 



The drive back to the crime scene felt different this time.



Before, I had looked at it like a detective‚Äîexamining evidence, measuring possibilities. Now, I was looking at it like Abby must have.



Like something was waiting there.



I parked at the edge of the clearing, stepping out into the heavy, humid air. The trees swayed lazily in the breeze, the smell of damp soil and stagnant water thick in my lungs. The cane fields loomed just beyond the clearing, their green stalks rustling like something breathing.



Duvall wasn‚Äôt with me this time.



I preferred it that way.



I walked to the spot where Abby‚Äôs body had been found. The ground was still disturbed from where forensics had worked, but something else caught my attention.



Footprints.



Not hers. Bare. Large. Deep.



Someone had been here after the crime scene was processed.



Or something.



I crouched, running my fingers through the indentations. They were spaced too far apart. Too long. Like whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîhad walked here wasn‚Äôt moving like a person.



A noise clicked in the trees behind me.



I stood up fast, heart hammering.



The forest was still.



But the air had changed.



Something was wrong.

I turned slowly, scanning the trees. The door was still there, half-buried in the ground, its carvings seeming darker now, deeper. A thin layer of dust had settled over it, except for one part‚Äîthe center.

Where it had been touched.

I stepped toward it cautiously, my boots crunching over dry leaves. The closer I got, the heavier the air became. It wasn‚Äôt just the humidity‚Äîit was pressure.

Like the whole damn forest was holding its breath.

I crouched beside the door, reaching out. My fingers brushed the carvings‚Äîdeep grooves, too precise for age to have worn them away. And then I saw something else.

Something small, wedged in the dirt near the edge of the door.

A fingernail.

I swallowed hard. It was chipped, torn at the edge, the tip stained dark. Dried blood.

Abby‚Äôs?

No.

The blood was fresh.

A crackle in the trees behind me.

I spun, hand reaching for my gun. The cane fields stretched out before me, silent and swaying. But something had moved.

The sugarcane stalks on the edge were bent outward.



Like something had walked through.



And then I heard it.



A sound I didn‚Äôt want to believe.



A slow exhale. Wet. Ragged.



Something was in the field. Watching.



My grip on my gun tightened. I took a slow step back toward my car, keeping my eyes locked on the broken stalks.



A shadow shifted.



Tall. Thin. Not quite right.



And then, just as I took another step‚Äî



The cane moved.



Something stepped back into the field.



I stood there, heart hammering in my chest, my body screaming at me to move. But I didn‚Äôt. I just listened as the rustling faded.



And then the forest was still again.



Like nothing had ever been there.



But I knew better.



Something had stepped through.



And it hadn‚Äôt gone back.



I didn‚Äôt go straight back to the station.



Instead, I drove through town, past the empty streets and shuttered businesses, past the sagging porches where old men sat in silence, staring at nothing. The kind of town where people lived close together but still felt alone.



Waylon‚Äôs Gas & Grocery was open, but I didn‚Äôt stop. Katie had told me everything she could.



I needed someone who wasn‚Äôt afraid to lie to me.



So I went to the church.



St. Mercier Parish, a crumbling brick building with peeling white paint and stained-glass windows that had darkened with age, sat just beyond the center of town. The cemetery beside it stretched toward the bayou, half-flooded, tombstones leaning as if sinking into the marsh.



Father Etienne Rousseau had been the town‚Äôs priest for nearly forty years. A man who had watched generations come and go, burying more people than he baptized.



When I found him, he was sitting on a wooden bench beneath the massive oak tree behind the church, rolling a cigarette with steady, wrinkled hands.



He didn‚Äôt look at me as I approached. ‚ÄúAfternoon, Detective.‚Äù



I sat beside him. ‚ÄúYou heard what happened to Abigail Thorne.‚Äù



A slow nod. ‚ÄúTragedy.‚Äù



I studied his face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem surprised.‚Äù



Another pause. Then, in a voice dry as dust‚Äî‚ÄúI am too old for surprises.‚Äù



I pulled the folded piece of paper from my pocket, the one with the town‚Äôs rules, and smoothed it out between us on the bench. His eyes flickered toward it, just once, before he looked away.



‚ÄúSomeone gave me this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAbby broke one, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù



Rousseau took a slow drag of his cigarette. ‚ÄúIt does not matter what she did,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúOnly what was done to her.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat does the door lead to?‚Äù I asked.



Rousseau sighed, tapping ash onto the ground. ‚ÄúIt does not lead anywhere,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúIt lets something out.‚Äù



I exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúWhat did she let out?‚Äù



The old priest turned to me then, and there was something deep and tired in his gaze.



‚ÄúShe did not let it out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe just reminded it that it was here.‚Äù



A heavy silence settled between us.



Finally, I folded the paper again, slipping it back into my pocket.



‚ÄúWho put the door there?‚Äù I asked.



Father Rousseau didn‚Äôt answer right away. Instead, he gestured toward the flooded graveyard beside the church.



‚ÄúYou see the water creeping up?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúEvery year, it rises a little more. Bury the dead deep as you want‚Äîeventually, the swamp pulls them back.‚Äù



I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with anything?‚Äù



His eyes darkened.



‚ÄúThe door was put there to cover something up. But the ground shifts, the years pass, and things that were buried don‚Äôt always stay that way.‚Äù



The hair on the back of my neck stood up.



I stood, adjusting my belt, ready to leave, but before I could step away, Rousseau grabbed my wrist.



His grip was thin, but strong.



‚ÄúDo not look for it at night,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIf you hear it moving, you didn‚Äôt hear anything. If you feel it watching you, you are wrong.‚Äù



His fingers tightened.



‚ÄúAnd if you wake up with dirt in your mouth‚Äîleave St. Mercier.‚Äù



I pulled away, heart pounding.



I left without another word.



The sun was starting to set, and as I got into my car, I realized something.



For the first time since I arrived in St. Mercier‚Ä¶



I did not want to be here after dark.



I didn‚Äôt go back to the station.

I didn‚Äôt go back to the crime scene.



I drove to the motel on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that smelled like mildew and bad decisions, where the neon ‚ÄúVACANCY‚Äù sign flickered weakly in the humid night.



Room 6A. It wasn‚Äôt much. A bed, a chipped wooden desk, and a bathroom with a mirror that had seen too many faces. I bolted the door behind me, tossed my keys on the table, and collapsed onto the mattress.



The day weighed on me like a second skin.



The crime scene. The footprints. The door in the woods.



Father Rousseau‚Äôs warning.



‚ÄúIf you wake up with dirt in your mouth‚Äîleave St. Mercier.‚Äù



I ran a hand over my face. I needed a drink. I needed to think.



Instead, I stared at the ceiling, listening to the motel hum with its own strange life. The buzzing of the overhead light. The distant chirp of cicadas outside. The hollow quiet of a town that didn‚Äôt want me here.



Somewhere around 2 AM, I must have dozed off.



I woke up with the taste of dirt on my tongue.



My eyes snapped open.



For a long second, I just lay there, heartbeat hammering in my ears. The motel room was dark, but something felt wrong.



My mouth was dry. Gritty.



I sat up slowly, swallowing hard. The taste was unmistakable.



Soil.



I reached up, touching my lips, then ran my fingers over my tongue. I spat onto my palm.



Dark flecks of earth.



The motel was locked. No windows open. No way I could have brought it in.



I swung my legs over the side of the bed, every muscle tense. The old wooden floor was cold under my feet. I scanned the room, pulse pounding.



Everything looked the same. The chair, the desk, the crumpled sheets.



Then I saw it.



Something was wrong with the door.



I stood slowly, moving toward it, hands clenched into fists. The doorknob was still bolted, but‚Ä¶



The wood was marked.



A black handprint, smeared across the center of the door.



Not a full hand. Just four long fingers.



Like someone had pressed against the wood from the outside.



But that wasn‚Äôt what made my breath catch in my throat.



The fingers were too long.



I took a slow step back, heart hammering. The air in the motel room felt thick, too still.



Something had been here.



Something had touched my door.



And as I stood there, staring at the mark, another realization crept over me, curling like a cold hand around my throat.



The dirt in my mouth.



The last thing Abby Thorne told her friend before she died.



‚ÄúI woke up with dirt in my bed. Under my fingernails. In my mouth.‚Äù



She had opened the door.



And now it knew me, too.



By the time the sun rose, I had already packed my bag.



I hadn‚Äôt slept.



I sat on the edge of the motel bed, watching the light creep through the thin curtains, painting the room in muted gold. The black handprint was still on the door. The dirt in my mouth still clung to my teeth.



I needed answers.



So I drove.



Sheriff Duvall‚Äôs office was a small, sun-bleached building at the center of town, just a few doors down from a barber shop that had long since given up on customers and a post office that only opened three days a week.



I pushed through the door.



Duvall looked up from his desk, his eyes tired, bloodshot.



‚ÄúYou look like hell, Detective.‚Äù



I tossed a photo of my motel door onto his desk‚Äîthe black handprint clear as day.



His face didn‚Äôt change.



‚ÄúI want to know who did this.‚Äù



He leaned back in his chair, rubbing his jaw. ‚ÄúWho says it was done by someone?‚Äù



I exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúYou trying to tell me it just appeared on its own?‚Äù



Duvall said nothing.



I sat down, voice low. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a murder, is it?‚Äù



He shifted, like he was fighting himself. Then, finally‚Äî‚ÄúYou think this is the first time something like this happened?‚Äù



My fingers curled into fists. ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù



Duvall‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúMore than I care to count.‚Äù



I leaned in. ‚ÄúAbby didn‚Äôt just break the rules, Sheriff. She uncovered something. Something you all know is real.‚Äù



His eyes darkened. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly do you think you‚Äôre gonna do with that information?‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt have an answer.



Because the truth was, I didn‚Äôt know what the hell I was chasing anymore.



I stood up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back to the door.‚Äù



Duvall‚Äôs face hardened. ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not.‚Äù



Something cold passed between us.



Then I heard it.



A car pulling up outside. Then another.



I turned. Through the window, I saw two trucks parked in front of the station. Three men climbed out‚Äîlocals.



They weren‚Äôt here for small talk.



I looked back at Duvall. He sighed, rubbing his temples.



‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt personal, Detective,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù



I knew that look.



I had seen it in other places, in other cases. The look of a man who wasn‚Äôt in charge of his own town anymore.



I glanced back at the men outside. They weren‚Äôt holding weapons, but they didn‚Äôt need to. This was a warning.



A final one.



I grabbed my badge off his desk and walked to the door.



As I passed Duvall, he spoke one last time.



‚ÄúGo home.‚Äù



I stepped outside.



The men didn‚Äôt move, but their eyes followed me. Unblinking. Unfriendly.



I got in my car, turned the key.



And I drove.



Not out of town.



Not to the motel.



Back to the woods.



Back to the door.



Because whatever they were trying to hide‚Ä¶



I needed to see it for myself.



The drive back to the woods felt unending.



The road was the same‚Äînarrow, cracked, framed by sagging trees heavy with moss‚Äîbut the air had changed, like it was pressing against the car, pushing me back.



I didn‚Äôt turn around.



The town had made their threat clear. They wanted me gone.

But I had to see.

I pulled off onto the dirt path, killing my headlights as I rolled to a stop. The forest stretched out before me, dark and endless. The cane fields rustled in the breeze, whispering against themselves.

The sun had almost set.

And I had made the mistake of coming alone.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped out, boots sinking into the soft, damp earth. Every step toward the clearing felt like pushing against a current, like the very ground was trying to drag me back.

I reached the tree line.

The door was still there.

Half-buried in the dirt, its carvings darker now in the fading light. The ground around it was disturbed.

Not just from me.

Something had been here again.

A thin trail of footprints, leading from the door back into the cane fields. Deep. Uneven. Like someone had crawled their way out.

The back of my neck prickled. I turned slowly, scanning the stalks. The light from my flashlight caught nothing but the endless rows of green.

But I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I could feel it.

I swallowed hard and crouched by the door, running my fingers over the carvings. The wood was warm. Like it had been touched recently.

Or opened.

A noise clicked behind me.

I stood up fast, turning toward the field.

The stalks shifted.

Not the wind. Not an animal. Something tall. Moving.

I lifted the flashlight. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù

The wind picked up. The cane groaned.

Then I saw it.

Not a person.

Not an animal.

Something wrong.



It stood just beyond the first row of cane, tall and thin, its arms too long, its head tilted slightly‚Äîlike it was listening.

I couldn‚Äôt see its face.

Or maybe it didn‚Äôt have one.

My breath hitched. My body screamed at me to run, to move‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt.

Because it was already moving toward me.

Like it knew I wouldn‚Äôt leave.

Like it had been waiting for me.

My legs unlocked. I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the door. The thing stopped.

Then it did something worse.

It lowered itself.

Not like a person crouching. More like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Its limbs bent wrong, folding in on themselves.

And then‚Äîit reached out.

Its fingers‚Äîtoo many fingers‚Äîdragged through the dirt toward the door.

A sharp crack sounded in the distance. A gunshot.

The thing jerked upright.

Another shot. This time closer.

I turned, heart hammering‚ÄîDuvall was standing at the tree line, shotgun raised.

‚ÄúMove, goddammit!‚Äù he shouted.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I ran.

The thing in the cane didn‚Äôt follow.

It just stood there, watching.

Watching like it knew something I didn‚Äôt.

And as I ran back toward my car, the last thing I saw was its hand still resting on the door.

Like it was waiting for someone else to open it.

I left St. Mercier the next morning.

Duvall never said a word about what he saw. Neither did I. We just sat in his truck as the sun rose, drinking bad coffee and listening to the swamp breathe.

It was understood‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt staying.

They let me leave.



I drove past the abandoned sugar mills, past the houses sinking into the mud, past the town that had decided long ago that some things were better left buried.

But that night, at a cheap motel an hour outside Baton Rouge, I woke up with dirt in my mouth.

I sat up fast, heart hammering, spitting into my hands. Dark flecks of soil. Under my fingernails. In my teeth.

The sheets were clean. The floor untouched. But I knew.

I knew it hadn‚Äôt let me go.

For a long time, I just sat there, breathing.

Then I checked the door.

Locked. Bolted.

But that wasn‚Äôt what made me stop.

On the wood, just below the handle‚Äî

A black handprint.

The same mark from my motel door in St. Mercier.

Only this time, there was something different.

A smudge near the fingertips. Like whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîhad left it had pressed harder.

Like it was getting closer.



I stood there, my body cold despite the thick Louisiana heat, staring at the mark.

And I realized something.

I never saw Abby‚Äôs body up close. I saw photos, reports, witness statements.

But not her.

Not what was left.

I thought about what Father Rousseau said.

‚ÄúThe missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.‚Äù

Abigail Thorne had been found in the clearing.

But had it really been her?

Or had something else crawled through that door wearing her name?



I swallowed hard.

Outside, the motel parking lot was quiet.

But I didn‚Äôt open the door.

Because I had the terrible, sinking feeling that if I did‚Ä¶

Something would be waiting for me.

Something that had been watching since I left.

Something that wasn‚Äôt finished yet.

And this time‚Äî

It might not let me go.",10,1741830708.0,Ruleshorror,4,0.92,False

Insanity doesn't seem that far away anymore. I am teetering on the edge, tied down to a concrete table under a dazzling, unforgiving light. 

Insanity‚Äîlunacy‚Äîlosing-your-fucking mind starts in the brain, synapses fizzling out one by one. I remember watching the late afternoon traffic as a child, my cheek lodged against cold windows. 

I remember being transfixed by those lights flying by. So many lights.

Now, I imagine them, deep inside the meat of my brain, each one flashing out. 

Insanity takes them, one by one, as my laughter‚Äì wait, I'm laughing? 

When did I start laughing? 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star, wherefore art thou? Where are the stars? Where is he?

Where are they? 

Questions flood my mind, but they dance and twirl and contort into not-questions. 

Shadows dance around me. 

Sometimes they have voices.

They speak English, mixed with something raw, beautiful, and wrong. 

Their words twist in my throat, foreign and yet so familiar. 

I laugh again, tipping my head back, high on the light that bathes me, tickles my skin, crawls across my face, and entwines around my heart. So tight. So suffocating. 

I feel her‚Äîoh, so invasive, oh, so beautiful! Oh, please! Fill my veins. 

Drown me in her. Never let me go. 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star‚Äîstars in his eyes, their eyes, your eyes‚Ä¶

I sense my body jerking violently, blood seeping from every orifice, my head tossing side to side. I can *feel* elongated teeth ripping into me, pulling, tugging, ragging my insides from me. 

They're *insides*, I think, hysterically. Through half lidded eyes, the twinkling stars grow into shadows. 

My insides are supposed to stay *inside* me, and yet there they are, like tangled, withered ropes, caught between unforgiving teeth gnawing deeper and deeper, enough to satisfy them, and yet not kill me. But I don't scream. I laugh. 

I am his, and he is mine, and I am theirs. 

I choke on my blood-tinged giggles as the stars come closer. 

Eyes. 

Eyes that reflect light so bright, so painful, I am momentarily brought to sobriety, my head jolting, my bound wrists writhing by my sides. 

In his eyes, they remain, drowning him and drowning me, pushing me closer and closer to the edge. 

I teeter on so many edges; the surface I lie on, my body meat to the slaughter, feeding The One who is always starving, always pulling me from the concrete floor, tracing his fingers down my naked spine, and pulling it from me. 

Inside my mind, the edge closes in on me, as he, she, they, *those* devour. 

The darkness shifts slightly, my eyes adjusting to dim candlelight, as his lips find my ear. 

He smells like he's always smelled. 

Like me; each of my rotting bodies and the fragmented static piecing me back together. 

His sharp exhale bleeding into a laugh is enough to send shivers through me, unwinding my thoughts, unwinding me. 

‚ÄúCan I tell you a story, Nin?‚Äù 

The King‚Äôs voice is soothing, moonlight dripping from every syllable, as another mouth finds my lips. 

She is softer, lighter, pressing kisses. 

I don't respond, unblinking, my lips stretching wider into a smile. 

He grins back, and in the orange blur of candlelight, his teeth are painted in me. 

Leaning closer, the King hangs upside down, his crown of emaciated bone falling in his eyes. 

‚ÄúI don't usually like starting with ‚Äòonce upon a time‚Äô. It's so‚Ä¶ urgh, outdated, you know? But I've always liked fairytales, and, funnily enough, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be the Prince.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce upon a time,‚Äù the words bleed from my mouth, each one cruelly pulled from my throat, globules of warm wetness running down my chin. 

They are my words, my *last* words, the last stars flickering out in my mind. 

‚ÄúThere was a Prince who didn't understand how to love.‚Äù

The King inclines his head, curious, and yet his eyes darken, that endless star perforating his pupils growing brighter, like the moon herself is laughing, writhing around his iris. 

I imagine his mind, like an infestation. 

His face is almost human, bearing the features of a human man. His voice is almost human. But what splinters in his skin, contorting his bones and shifting under his flesh, is my *King*. 

Every time I pull away from that thought, it slams into me, violent and unrelenting. 

When I squeeze my eyes shut to avoid those prickling starry lights, ice cold fingers prick my chin, forcing me to look at him. It's another face. 

Another crown, this time sitting on top of short blonde curls bleeding into starlight eyes. 

‚ÄúIt's not your turn to tell a story,‚Äù The voice is softer, like a cool breeze grazing my face. 

His smile is the worst thing about him. 

It lies. 

He speaks through glistening teeth, and yet he wastes no time reaching into my mouth, all the way down my throat, and ripping out my vocal cords. 

I don't scream. 

I laugh. 

‚ÄúI'll tell her.‚Äù

Her voice pricks between two males, a low, sultry murmur caught between a giggle. 

She smells like someone I used to know, tinges of perfume and scented candles and lemon candies. 

When she gets closer, however, the stink of rot and decay seeps into my nose and throat, soaking strands of her tangled hair suffocating me. 

‚ÄúOnce upon a time,‚Äù she hummed, ‚ÄúThere was a beautiful Goddess. Her name was Nythea, and in the dawn of human civilization, she walked among us.‚Äù

The King's lips find my neck, biting down. ‚ÄúNythea was curious about us.""

""She wanted to learn about us, so she walked among us. She worked with us. Lived with us. Slept and ate with us. She played with our children and gradually began to enjoy her life on the ground."" 

""Nythea had friends and family, people who loved her‚Äîand their children loved her!‚Äù

When a third mouth finds my skin‚Äîoh, so they're being gentle now?‚ÄîI shiver. 

I don't know or understand what I am feeling. 

Do I feel pain or pleasure? 

Am I falling or flying?

‚ÄúBut Nythea‚Ä¶‚Äù the third voice murmurs, ‚Äúmade one grand mistake.‚Äù

He chuckles, and the others echo him, as if they are one.

‚ÄúShe trusted humanity,‚Äù he sings. ‚ÄúShe trusted them with the bountiful knowledge that she was their Goddess‚Äîexpecting them to pray for her, lay themselves down for her, scream her name from the tops of their lungs‚Äîrejoice! For she had returned!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow na√Øve of her,‚Äù the soft voice‚Äîsoft lips‚Äîwhispers into mine. 

‚ÄúDo you want to guess what humans did to Nythea? Oh, Nina, it was terrible. ""*Goddess*?"" 

She lets out a dramatized laugh. ‚ÄúHow could you be a goddess? There is no Goddess! The sky is the sky, and the stars are the stars, and the moon is the moon!‚Äù

They dragged her to their founding tree, built upon a lie‚Äîon a belief of their own making‚Äîsacrificing her to the sky, where she was chased back home, back into the gnawing darkness far above the clouds.‚Äù

Footsteps.

This time, the three are dancing around me.

‚ÄúBut she whispered,‚Äù the King‚Äôs voice bleeds her words. 

‚ÄúShe whispered and waited for humans to prosper‚Äîfor them to start looking at the sky, and believing the sky, and believing in her.""

""In her light that grew stronger, whispering into lonely minds, thoughts that were curious about her lonely crescent sitting amongst the stars."" 

""She began to find them. Followers who looked at her in awe, transfixed by her beauty and her vanity. Who gave themselves to the sky to be able to touch her light.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis town believed in her,‚Äù their voices became one, entwining, entangling around my skull. ‚ÄúBut Nythea did not want followers. Believers. Oh, no.""

""She wanted soldiers who would follow her every order‚Äîwho would distance themselves from the light and fall in line with her. Strip away their shadows and consume themselves, allowing her to mold their bones, their flesh, their souls into her personal toys.‚Äù

They laugh. I laugh, too.

‚ÄúShe took their children, stole their outlines, the bare makings of their souls, creating royals who would serve her.""

""Who would fall to the ground in her name, worship her language, becoming her beacons‚Äîher very first human soldiers who surrendered themselves, allowing her to shape them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there was a problem.‚Äù

The words splutter from my lips, already entangled, knotted with theirs.

‚ÄúThere was!‚Äù they laugh, joining in. 

‚ÄúBecause what Nythea soon realized was that she could only control a certain part of them. The human body, the terrestrial body and mind‚Äîshe could not mold into hers.‚Äù

They continue, each of their voices growing louder, like she was screaming. 

Through them. 

‚ÄúNythea did not forget what the humans did to her. She did not forget her agony and their lack of empathy.""

""She did not forget their coldness, their narrow minds empty of curiosity. Their willingness to call her a *false* God. 

""Oh, she could rip apart and shred and destroy parts of them, the extra parts that clung to them like a second skin."" 

""But no matter how hard she tried, Nythea could only play with the dancing bodies that appeared behind light. Their useless mimics who always came back.‚Äù

The King appears, looming over me, and Nythea‚Äôs light is all I can see.

He is hers. Her human soldier who walks among humans.

Who speaks her language.

Who I gave to her.

‚ÄúOutlines,‚Äù he whispers, the stars in his eyes burning into me, scalding me. ‚ÄúPerfect snapshots of the human mind and the human soul and the human body. Indistinguishable from the original, and when detached, tethered to Nythea‚Äôs light.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

I sob his name, sober now, sober enough to see through her light perforating him.

‚ÄúBut what if‚Ä¶‚Äù The King‚Äôs triumphant smirk splits into a grin. I glimpse parts of him I shouldn't‚Äîa threadbare tee hanging in strips of mangled material clinging to him, hair that dangles into once-human eyes, a crown a reluctant King hadn't wanted.

‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs still reaching?‚Äù

The King‚Äôs declaration brings me to another edge once again. 

I‚Äôm standing on the edge of my childhood swimming pool. 

The memory is sweet. I can hear splashes and squeals, other children diving in, and the excited slapping of soaking footsteps running to cannon-ball. 

The other kids shout at me to join them, but my stomach twists and turns at the thought of falling into something so blue, so mesmerising and endless, and I stumble back. 

I watch the slow ripples of water, my bare toes so close to the edge. 

I hated swimming as a kid. Mom wanted me to take lessons, but after one accident in the sea, slipping into the deeper water, being dragged down by water with no ending, no bottom, an endless abyss swallowing me into the feast of the drowned, I stayed well away. 

‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù

There's a kid behind me impatiently tapping his feet, arms folded over his chest. I see his figure dancing in the reflection, his scowl splitting into two‚Äôs and three‚Äôs, carried by the water‚Äôs ripples. I clench my fists, my heart lodged in my throat. 

‚ÄúIt's too deep,‚Äù I whisper, taking one, and then two steps back. 

‚ÄúNo, it's really not.‚Äù I catch his eye-roll in the water, and then his sudden grin. 

It's too late to scream. I feel his hands shove into my back, and I'm falling forwards, plunging deep into the twinkling blue, slipping beneath the surface, my legs kicking, my arms flying out to try and bring myself back. 

But I'm falling deeper and deeper, screaming into nothing. Oblivion. 

Before a hand wraps around my wrist, and yanks me upwards. 

Up, up, up, I am flying. 

And I break the surface.

‚Ä¶

**SPLASH**. 

*‚ÄùThat was uncalled for.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùWhat? You told me to wake her up!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùI didn't mean to throw a bucket of ice over her head!‚Äù*

It took me maybe half a second to realize I was soaking wet, gasping for breath, and part of me‚Äì splintered parts of me, wondered why I wasn't in my childhood pool. 

Ice cold water dripped from my hair and down my neck. I blinked it from my eyes, my chest aching, contorted words still twisted in my mouth that was so dry. 

I couldn't remember the last time I spoke my own words, when her language didn't suffocate my tongue. 

The memory was vague, fleeting, dancing in the back of my mind: I was lying under her light, surrounded by the moon‚Äôs followers, basking in her words. 

Presently, however, I was‚Ä¶ wet. I recognized my surroundings, light pink walls and minimal decoration, a ratty couch and a coffee table overflowing with paper. 

Two figures loomed over me, illuminated in dim light cast from a sputtering bulb, silhouettes bleeding into people with features, when I was I was so used to‚Äì

My mind jerked when one of the shadows bounded forwards, and I felt the sudden sharp sting of a hand slapping my cheek. 

Reality slammed into me, and there he was, two inches from my face, wide eyes and contorted lips twisted into a snarl. 

He was thinner in the cheeks, dark blonde hair pinned into a ponytail, bruising circles under half lidded eyes. 

Samuel Fuller‚Äôs glare was raw and real, and painful to fully digest. I felt his fingernails slicing into my bare shoulders jerking me left to right. The moon turned him from a stranger into a friend. 

Now that I knew the truth, so did he. 

‚ÄúIt was *you*,‚Äù he spat in my face, his voice breaking. 

‚ÄúYou killed him, turned him into a fucking monster, and made me hate him‚Äì made me despise him‚Äìmade me hurt him!‚Äù 

He slapped me again, and I was grateful for the sting. I was no longer numb. 

‚ÄúI came to see them,‚Äù he whispered, breaking down, dropping onto his knees, his head in my lap. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I came to see them! That night, I came to talk to them, and you were there.‚Äù He lifted his head, his lips curling, eyes burning, scalding my soul. 

‚ÄúYou turned me away. Made me think they hated me‚Äì when you already had your claws into them.‚Äù Sam spluttered on a sob, and I didn't move. Couldn't move. ‚ÄúYou snaked your way inside my brain and forced me to think I fucking *knew* you.‚Äù

I let him come apart, unraveling between my knees. I felt his sorrow, his pain, deep inside my bones, threatening to unwind me. 

‚ÄúWhen it was *him*.‚Äù he gritted out. 

Sam was right. 

All those memories I had of him, ones I held onto, ones I never wanted to let go, were never mine. Instead, I embodied myself inside them like a parasite. July 4th weekend, Samuel Fuller sat under the stars on a picnic blanket, watching the fireworks. 

But not with me. 

In freshman year, he grew close, and suddenly apart from the person who decided to join a frat to get more friends. 

Sam hated the idea. Hated the idea of losing one of his best friends to a group of frat bros. So, they became strangers again, only awkwardly smiling at each other in passing. But that wasn't *me*. 

Memories were precious, and for just a while, they were mine. 

They painted a fantasy, a promise from the moon herself, that, in exchange for the vessels I offered her, I could be oblivious. 

That I could live happily with my eyes closed, wearing *his* memories like skin. 

‚Äúand then you turned him‚Äì all three of them‚Äì  into fucking *devils*.‚Äù Sam whispered, his voice bleeding into a whine. 

‚ÄúSam.‚Äù another familiar voice murmured. Poppy appeared, nursing a coffee, a blanket slung over her shoulder. Poppy's eyes were harder than I remembered. 

Her hair was longer, matted curls stuck to too-pale cheeks. 

‚ÄúGo easy on her.‚Äù

Sam pulled something from his belt, and I felt the ice cold steel sinking into the flesh of my forehead. ‚ÄúShe's a *devil*,‚Äù he spat. 

‚ÄúSo, why did you save her?‚Äù Poppy asked him, handing me the coffee. I took it, hesitantly, wrapping my fingers around the warmth. She ignored Sam‚Äôs gun, throwing the blanket over my shoulders. Now that I was regaining my self awareness, my eyes immediately found clumsily bordered up windows blocking out the moon‚Äôs light. 

Poppy and Sam‚Äôs living room was so painfully mundane and human, I could feel that numbness, that *nothing* rolling off of me, replaced by agony I chose to revel in. 

Sam didn't respond, but he did lower the gun, his lips twitching. 

‚ÄúYou dragged her away from the little game they like to play, and brought her here,‚Äù Poppy hummed. ‚ÄúIf you wanted her dead, you would have left her with them.‚Äù

Poppy's words struck me, pulling me from my reverie. 

‚ÄúGame?‚Äù I meant to jump up, but Poppy was quick to gently shove me back down. 

‚ÄúHey. Take it easy, all right?‚Äù she soothed, stepping back. ‚ÄúIt's been a while‚Äì and trust me, it's a lot to take in. So, just take a breath.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were playing hide and seek with you,‚Äù Sam said, his lips curling. Poppy nudged him to shut up, but he continued, baited by his own words. ‚ÄúEvery day, the King stands in the town square with his eyes shut, and his *stomach* has to hide.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúOf course, as his ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô‚Äù‚Äîhe quoted the air with two fingers‚Äî‚Äúwe have to watch him play. And of course, cheer him on to feed his ego even more.‚Äù

Sam folded his arms, averting his gaze. ‚ÄúYou were clearly completely out of it, and King Asshole was closing in on you.‚Äù

He stuck out his lip. ‚ÄúSeriously, that piece of shit literally rigged the game in his favor, because of *course* he did.‚Äù Sam didn't look at me, intentionally glaring down at his filthy sneakers. ‚ÄúI grabbed what was left of you, and I brought you back here.‚Äù 

He sighed, relaxing slightly. ‚ÄúWhich was a stupid idea, because this is the first place they'll check when they start hunting you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting out of here before they can,‚Äù Poppy spoke up, her expression hardening. ‚ÄúThere's a supposed slip-kid helping people escape town. If we take the back roads in my car and follow them all the way to the barrier, we‚Äôre home free.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarrier?‚Äù I questioned, my tongue feeling raw and wrong. 

Poppy slumped onto her sofa, crossing one leg over the other. ‚ÄúWhen Rowan Beck‚Äî‚Äù she caught herself, and I saw her jaw tighten. It was as if the moon were actively ripping his name from every mouth. I felt it too, a constant order at the back of my mind to address him as King. 

‚ÄúI mean, the King,‚Äù Poppy corrected herself. ‚ÄúWhen he accepted his crown, he also put up a barrier around the town, locking us out from the rest of the world.‚Äù Her gaze found the window, jaw clenching. 

‚ÄúWhere the sun never rises, and it's always night. Which is his perfect Kingdom.‚Äù she blinked, jerking her head, like she was shaking his influence seeping inside her mind. 

‚ÄúWhich is why we‚Äôre getting out of here.‚Äù Poppy jumped up. ‚ÄúFirst thing tomorrow, when we know the royals will be sleeping.‚Äù

I noticed Sam stiffen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not *leaving* them,‚Äù he gritted out. He was trembling. 

She was quick to pull him into a hug, one that he leaned into. 

Poppy waited before pulling away from him. ‚ÄúThey're gone, Sam,‚Äù she whispered, grasping his shoulders. The way he stared back at her, hopeless, half lidded eyes struggling to take her in, pierced my heart. 

‚ÄúWhatever has taken over them has an ironclad grip. And I don't know about you, but when your possessed ex-boyfriend started culling people in the middle of the street‚Äîstudents, Sam. Half of our class.‚Äù 

Poppy choked on her words. ‚ÄúI knew then that he wasn't coming back. And if, by some miracle, he did? It wouldn‚Äôt be Kaz.‚Äù

Sam threw up his arms in exasperation, and I caught his shadow dance across the wall. ‚ÄúBut what if we can, I don't know, pour it out of him? The moon is inside his head, right? So, we force her out of him!‚Äù

Poppy groaned, tipping her head back. Again, I watched her shadow follow her lead. ‚ÄúThat's not how it works! The moon isn't tangible! You can't just *pour* her out!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe haven't even tried!‚Äù Sam spat back. ‚ÄúSo, you just expect me to leave? You're just going to let her fucking torture them?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's *not* Kaz, Sam.‚Äù Poppy said, her tone hardening. ‚ÄúIt's got his face. But it's *not* him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's *his* body!‚Äù Sam shrieked. ‚ÄúShe's inside his head, and she's suffocating him!‚Äù

I was dazedly following their conversation, before it hit me. 

Instead of speaking, I stood up, my legs wobbling, my head spinning around. 

‚ÄúExcept we *can* pour the moon out of them,‚Äù I said, strangled by my own words.  

Admittedly, I had never seen the severing ritual, or knew if it even worked.

We had never succeeded in creating vessels from sacrifices, so there was never a reason to use it. 

I grabbed a moldy banana from the fruit bowl on the coffee table and a pair of scissors. Sam and Poppy both turned to me with questioning looks. 

‚ÄúI was never as good as my brother at learning the severing ritual,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut we had to learn it as part of our path of light.‚Äù

I shook my head when Sam rolled his eyes. Even Poppy scoffed. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter. The ritual is only performed if something is wrong‚Äîeither with the sacrifice or the person conducting the ceremony.‚Äù

I slashed the banana in three places: at the top, where it was mostly brown mulch, in the middle, and at the bottom.

‚ÄúWhen I performed the assimilation ritual on them, I had to carve three different words into three different parts of their body to bind the moon inside them. The binding is done in case the vessel is still conscious and can sever her themselves.‚Äù

I pointed to the top of the banana. ‚ÄúThe arm. *Luhar*, which is considered the entrance point.‚Äù

I stabbed the middle. ‚ÄúThe palm. *Velilua*.‚Äù

Finally, I stuck the blade into the bottom. ‚ÄúAnd the heart. *Thalix*.‚Äù

I held up the banana. ‚ÄúThe severing ritual is simple. In order to release the moon from the vessel, just slice open the binding words.‚Äù I did so, cutting through the markings on the banana skin, slicing the top, middle, and bottom, and holding it upside down in front of their wide eyes. 

‚ÄúAnd.. she should be released.‚Äù I caught myself. ‚ÄúThe severing *must* be performed by the same person who performed the binding ritual. If not, the moon will think we are mocking her. So, I will be severing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're serious.‚Äù Poppy spoke up through a  breath. 

‚ÄúHypothetically.‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúI've never actually seen it happen because, until your friends, we never had‚Ä¶ suitable vessels.‚Äù

The two of them just stared at me, wide eyed. Poppy looked oddly impressed, while Sam had gone red in the cheeks. Poppy released a breath after a bout of silence. 

‚ÄúSo, everything will, what, go back to normal?‚Äù she whispered, her eyes wide. 

I nodded. ‚ÄúIn theory. Severing the moon‚Äôs light also sends her back into the sky.‚Äù

When Poppy stared at me, incredulous, I remembered a class from the cult. ‚ÄúIt'll be like a reset. The moon‚Äôs influence will be drawn back, and the town will return to normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut everyone who died‚Äì‚Äù

I cut her off. ‚ÄúMom told me to think of the town governed by the moon, as no longer under human laws of physics. When she's gone, those laws will hopefully be restored.‚Äù 

I thought back to a different class. 

‚ÄúAgain, it‚Äôs all hypothetical. But the moon has been a presence in our town for years. She's been trying to do this for *years*.  But she's never been successful.‚Äù

Poppy nodded slowly. ‚ÄúOkay, so what makes your roommates special?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're out of towners.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe cult can only sacrifice people from out of town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Sam‚Äôs expression twisted. He slumped onto the chair arm. ‚ÄúSo, you've  known how to save them this *whole* fucking time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just got my memories back,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI never knew I was part of my mom‚Äôs cult‚Äîor that I had a brother, that I even performed the sacrifice in the first place‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I stopped. These two didn't need my sob story, and I didn't deserve to give it. 

But Sam seemed inclined to listen.

Poppy gave a gentle nod for me to continue, and I did, choking on my words. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Ä¶ did it,‚Äù I whispered. 

‚ÄúWhen I‚Ä¶ carved their hearts from them and made the offering‚ÄîI didn't want to remember it. I didn't want to remember what I'd done to them.‚Äù I hissed out a breath, tracking Sam‚Äôs reactions. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my place to say it, but I really did love them. I was alone, and all I had was my brother. I didn't have a choice. It was either I sacrificed three students, or my brother was next. But they felt safe. They were warm and real, like home, and for the first time in so long, I felt like I had a family.‚Äù I found myself smiling, somehow. 

Thinking of home cooked meals and spoiled board games, movie nights, and the smell of Kaz‚Äôs cooking when coming  home from class, my smile actually felt real. 

‚ÄúThey *were* my family,‚Äù I told Sam and Poppy. ‚ÄúAnd I never wanted to hurt them.‚Äù

I didn't want Sam to look at me, but he was, his eyes narrowed. I couldn't tell if he wanted to speak to me or shoot me.

I swiped at my eyes, getting to the point. ‚ÄúSo, the moon wiped my memories of my mother and brother and the cult. She‚Äîwell, she let me live my fantasy.‚Äù 

I nodded at Sam. ‚ÄúShe filled my head with memories that weren‚Äôt mine, so I could insert myself into their group and unknowingly let my mother, when the time was right‚Ä¶ come inside our house and take what was hers. What I *gave* her.‚Äù

Sam scoffed, breaking through the uneasy silence.

‚ÄúIs this the part where we‚Äôre supposed to break down crying and forgive you?‚Äù

His words dripped with resentment.

‚ÄúLet's get several things straight,‚Äù he said, stepping too close. ‚ÄúThey're not your family, dude. You ritualistically murdered them. I don't give a fuck if you were in a cult‚Äîthat you had ‚Äòno choice.‚Äô If you had an ounce of humanity, you would have let them go.‚Äù

He stepped even closer, his breath tickling my face.

‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Sam spat. ‚ÄúYou killed them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were already *dead*.‚Äù I whispered, and something in his expression cracked. ‚ÄúI offered them to the moon to save them!‚Äù 

Sam scoffed. ‚ÄúOh, because that's *better*?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's enough,‚Äù Poppy cut in. ‚ÄúOkay, look. None of that is important right now.‚Äù

I ignored her. I *did* let them go.‚Äù I laughed, and it felt *good.* 

‚ÄúRowan disarmed me, because of fucking course he did! He forced me to tell the truth. I told them about Jonas, and they tried to *help* me help my brother escape.‚Äù

The words were spilling from my mouth before I could stop them, sharp breaths that hurt my chest, that stung my eyes, taking me back to kneeling on dirt in front of the town lake, Rowan dying on my lap, his spluttering sobs, blood flowing from his lips, and the moon, already starving for him, reflecting in jagged lines tracing his pale skin. 

‚ÄúThey were murdered on our doorstep by two cult members. They shot Kaz and Imogen dead, and Rowan‚Äîfatally, in the heart. I carried him to the lake, and Rowan died in my arms.‚Äù

Sam didn't speak, his jaw clenching. 

‚ÄúIs that what you want me to say?‚Äù I demanded. I was spiraling again, and I couldn't stop it. ‚ÄúThat I willingly turned them into monsters because I didn‚Äôt want to fucking lose them? Then yes. I did.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Sam said bitterly. ‚ÄúI really needed *you* to decide their fate.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou weren't there.‚Äù I gritted out. ‚ÄúBut if you were, and you had the chance, you would too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not *important* right now,‚Äù Poppy snapped. ‚ÄúWhat's important is the severing ritual, or whatever it is.‚Äù she turned to me wearing a strained smile. ‚ÄúDo you really think it could work? Is it really that simple?‚Äù

No. 

No, it wasn't that simple. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI just need to get close enough to him, and open up the binding.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck with that,‚Äù Sam muttered. ‚ÄúThe only people they allow into the town hall are potential sacrifices, or‚Ä¶ ‚Äú he straightened up. 

‚ÄúKaz sometimes stands at the door. I don't know why.‚Äù He scratched his head. ‚ÄúIt's probably a power thing, or whatever, but I can try and talk to him.‚Äù 

His gaze found mine. ‚ÄúI'll talk to Kaz, and you get into the town hall and find Beck.‚Äù

Sam was already moving towards the hallway, grabbing his coat. 

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he gestured to me. ‚ÄúKaz never sleeps, so he'll be there.‚Äù

Sam yanked open the front door, turning back to Poppy. ‚ÄúStay here. Keep the door locked, and only open it when you know it's me.‚Äù

When we were alone, treading down pitch dark streets filled with overturned cars and corpses littering the concrete, I figured I‚Äôd ask Sam what had been bothering me for a while. 

‚ÄúWhy do you hate him?‚Äù I asked, stepping over the mutilated body of a woman. 

The town hall was only down the street, but we had to take it slow. 

Sam snorted, kicking a rock. ‚ÄúHe got himself kidnapped by a cult, and then turned into a devil. That boy isn't human.‚Äù

I held my breath, letting out in a sharp hiss. ‚ÄúI didn't let him see you the night you came to our door,‚Äù I spoke up, words lodged in my throat. ‚ÄúI tied him up, and he begged me to let him talk to you, but I didn't.‚Äù I tripped over my words. ‚ÄúI couldn't.‚Äù

Sam didn't speak for a while, kicking through puddles, before he turned to me.

‚ÄúHey, Nin?‚Äù

I didn't respond, keeping my gaze glued to the ground. 

‚ÄúIf, by some miracle, we do actually manage to pull this off,‚Äù he whispered, hopping over a road sign. Sam‚Äôs voice was a low murmur. I made the mistake of hoping he was maybe coming around. 

When he turned to look at me, his face eerily lit in her glow, my stomach twisted.

‚ÄúI hope you know that if you even *speak* to them‚Äì or go near them, I will fucking kill you.‚Äù He said casually. ‚ÄúDo you understand me? You're lucky I'm not stringing you up.‚Äù

I couldn't resist a spluttered laugh. 

‚ÄúOh, don't worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI'm *pretty* sure I'll be keeping my distance.‚Äù

I waited for his response, caught off guard when he dragged me back, pressing the two of us to a wall. The town hall was just ahead of us, and in front of us, two guards.

Neither of them were Kaz. 

Sam twisted to me, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he whispered, pressing one finger against his lips, and pointing the other at the guards. ‚ÄúDo not say a fucking word.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, aye, captain,‚Äù I muttered, biting back my words. 

I didn't realize I was subconsciously developing a Rowan Beck style attitude. 

I stayed down, as Sam dragged me towards the town hall. 

‚ÄúBow,‚Äù Sam hissed, shoving me with his elbow. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt bow, they‚Äôll kill you on sight. You need to prove your loyalty to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you stupid?‚Äù he spat, pulling me to my knees. ""*Bow*! Or they'll kill you!‚Äù

I recognized the guards standing post in front of the town hall doors. 

Noah and Dex. Cult members I grew up with, dressed in familiar white robes. 

With my memories intact, I knew exactly who they were. They stood on our doorstep, and murdered my roommates in cold blood. When I changed my mind, decided to save them, decided to *live* for my brother, they took away my choice. 

Maggots crept up my throat, a raw, visceral hold on my body sending me into fight or flight. 

I watched them put a bullet in Rowan‚Äôs heart, forcing me into a cruel choice; either give them up to a celestial light to save them, or lose them forever. Sam raised his head, nudging me to do the same. 

*Slowly*, his eyes told me, and I copied, lifting my head slightly. 

‚ÄúMy name is Samuel Fuller,‚Äù he spoke up. I'm an, um, a former friend of the King.‚Äù

He stood, keeping his hands behind his back. ‚ÄúI want to talk to Charlie Delacroix.‚Äù

‚ÄúConcerning what, exactly?‚Äù Noah‚Äôs head inclined, his gaze on me. ‚ÄúThe King is busy preparing for the assimilation of Nythea.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ tell him Sam is here to talk to him,‚Äù Sam said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an old‚Ä¶ friend.‚Äù

I expected to be killed on sight. Sam was a bad actor, and I was a runaway. But Noah and Dex nodded, turned, and disappeared inside clinical white light bathing the lobby. 

I could sense my body already trying to run. The doors were so close. 

I was *so close* to getting in there. 

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Sam whispered, releasing a breath. ‚ÄúWell, that was too easy.‚Äù

I risked a glance at him and he shoved me. Hard. 

‚ÄúDon't look at me. Look straight forward,‚Äù he said under his breath. ‚ÄúShe's watching.‚Äù

I did, training my eyes on the front window of the town hall. 

The window was blown through, what was left of a corpse lying limply on the ground. 

It wasn't my place to admit I had been desensitized to the horror around me, but the dead body didn't even graze my mind. 

It almost‚Ä¶ fit. 

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ be here.‚Äù he whispered, his voice shuddering. ‚ÄúI can't talk to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn't hate him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt wasn't his fault what happened to him. It was mine.‚Äù

I jumped when Sam‚Äôs head whipped around to stare at me. 

‚ÄúYes, it was,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd if I want to hate him, I will.‚Äù

I knew the resentment in his eyes, the hatred, the anger. I knew it well. But this time, unlike Rowan, I could save him. 

I expected him to yell at me, or more scathing insults. Instead, though, he just sighed, losing some of his bravado. 

‚ÄúYou really *do* think you‚Äôre the center of the universe, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Sam averted his gaze, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúEven in the made up fantasy which was our 'friendship', I never called you out on your selfish BS.""

I kept my gaze on the ground, conscious of the guards appearing at any moment. 

‚ÄúIt's the truth.‚Äù

He didn't move, his gaze glued to the doors leading into the town hall. 

‚ÄúBelieve it or not, Nin? You‚Äôre not the problem this time. I know it‚Äôs hard, since we all revolve around *you*. But this is between Kaz and me. I‚Äôll do the talking, and you get your ass in there and start the cutting-banana-binding‚Ä¶thingy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSevering ritual,‚Äù I corrected in a low murmur. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Sam ducked his head, letting out an exasperated breath.

I didn‚Äôt technically know Samuel Fuller, but those memories still felt like mine‚Äîthe two of us sitting on his bed, talking about everything from relationships to classes. 

Even kneeling in a post-apocalyptic town governed by my possessed roommates, I still felt like I could tell this boy anything.

And I think, despite his hatred and resentment for me, Sam felt it too.

He turned to me, and for the first time, he looked like Sam again‚Äîmy friend.

‚ÄúNot that it‚Äôs *any* of your business, but before you and your cult buddies sacrificed my boyfriend and turned him into a fucking devil, I think I‚Ä¶‚Äù He heaved out a breath, throwing his head back, his gaze finding the too-dark sky. ‚ÄúYeah, I really fucked up.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to reply, when the doors to the town hall flew open.

I don‚Äôt know what I expected. 

Maybe, like in shows and movies, my freshly brainwashed roommate‚Äîconverted into royalty‚Äîwould announce his presence with bravado, guards surrounding him, or a grand display. 

But Kaz was alone. 

No guards. No spectacle. Gone was the cloak made of human flesh. 

Instead, he wore a white tee and jeans, a college letterman jacket thrown over the top. If Charlie Delacroix wanted to look like a ruler, he was failing. While Rowan oozed the role of a leader‚Äîa king‚ÄîKaz looked more reluctant, more soldier than royal. 

He‚Äôd cut his hair. Boyish. More mature. 

His crown of adorned bone sat askew atop thick blonde hair that fell over his forehead, splattered red, slick like paint over his eyes. Each cutting prong was cruel, slicing into his flesh, marking him, dried beads of blood running down his face, as if maybe at some point, he fought back, trying to rip emaciated bone from where it was forced, lodged onto his head. 

The winding trails of crimson were a reminder. 

No matter how hard he struggled, she would always *win*. 

Kaz was a scarlet King. 

I wanted to believe some parts of him were clinging on. But the longer I stared, the less human he appeared. I glimpsed stitches pushing out from his scalp, the evidence of his harrowing brainwashing, where the moon had quite literally pierced through his skull and forced him to submit. 

When he started towards us in slow strides, hands in his pockets, I could almost mistake him for being human. 

I could see the contortions in his skin, undulating bones courtesy of a transformation that had twisted his body.

He didn't look like a werewolf (or ‚Äòmoon afflicted creature‚Äô), or a person. 

While he had the characteristics of a four legged beast, an original werewolf, his body was more human, save from his twisted spine protruding through his back. This was the most normal he‚Äôd looked in a long time. 

That was, of course, if I didn‚Äôt stare too long at the way his body dragged itself, like a third limb of this sentient thing drowning him. 

Kaz dropped onto his hands and knees like an an animal. His eyes, filled‚Äîtaken over‚Äîby blinding light, regarded us with amusement, before he jumped up, slipping on a pair of Ray-Bans. 

He resembled exactly what you‚Äôd expect a college stoner converted into a *trickster* would look like. 

Charlie Delacroix carried himself like one. His slow, almost teasing strides had weight. 

‚ÄúGo inside,‚Äù Sam muttered, nudging me.  ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

I jumped to my feet‚Äîor at least I tried‚Äîbefore I was forced back down, pinned to the ground by an otherworldly force, a sentient thing seeping into my bones and taking an unyielding hold. 

I could feel it taking control of me, body and then mind, pinning me to rough concrete. 

I tried to pull free, knowing I had a goal. 

I had to get through those doors, find the King, and perform the severing ritual.

But even that thought became obsolete in my head, my vision blurring. 

Next to me, Sam dropped to his knees, almost as if in prayer. 

Kaz‚Äôs footsteps grew playful, his shredded sneakers stopping in front of me.

He pulled off the glasses with a grin. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Kaz popped the P.

When I managed to lift my head, I could make out tiny slithers of moonlight spiderwebbing down his cheek and  splintering in his eyes, swimming in his pupils. He really was fucking beautiful. 

‚ÄúStay.‚Äù

His voice was more of a laugh. It was powerful, impossible, contorting my spine, sending me onto my stomach. 

I didn‚Äôt realize I was screaming, until my own cry echoed in my skull. 

And, like a bad fucking joke, my roommate mimicked my screech, mocking me. 

Dropping onto his knees next to me, the trickster mimicked my wails, choking on his laughter. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he mocked my voice, and I could almost believe it *was* me. 

‚ÄúNo, don't hurt Sammy!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't hurt the guy who fucking *tortured* us!‚Äù

""Kaz.""

Sam was still on his knees, speaking through his teeth. 

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù

Charlie Delacroix was more animal than human. When Sam snapped at him, he *did* stop, his jaw clenching. Slowly, Kaz crouched to Sam's level, his head inclined. 

‚ÄúThe *man* of the hour,‚Äù Kaz hummed. ‚ÄúDid you enjoy slicing me up, Sam?‚Äù

He reached out, first hesitantly, stroking his cheek, almost cradling it, his fingers tiptoeing across Sam‚Äôs skin. 

‚ÄúDid you enjoy‚Ä¶ripping your knife through my flesh?‚Äù

Kaz was gentle, every touch intimate-- every touch meaning something. 

Sam's expression crumpled, and I remembered what he'd done, indoctrinated by psycho townies. 

I remembered his cruelty. 

Unfortunately, so did Kaz. 

Deep, *deep* down, I think he was still hurting. 

I waited for Kaz to lunge, teeth out, snapping Sam‚Äôs head off. But again, he resembled a young cub, hesitant, backing away from Sam, rocking back and forth on his heels, and then leaning in closer. 

I had barely enough time to register him leaning close, pressing a kiss to Sam's lips, his hands wound in Sam's hair, taking a fistful, violently yanking his head towards him.

Kaz's smile was cruel, feral, enjoying Sam like a toy.

""Go on."" Kaz murmured, breaking the kiss. ""You wanted to tell me *something*.""",2,1741830529.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

I always have green tea in the afternoon regardless of whether I'm drinking coffee or tea in the morning. After a while I started drinking coffee again and it was fine at first but my asthma steadily got worse over a few months.

Christophe spent the night in Medical. I stayed with him.



After several hours of sedative-induced sleep, he snapped awake. When he saw me, he shot up and started to panic.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said, not because it was true but because there was nothing else to say.



He focused on me. Something was wrong with his eyes. There was no light in them. Only a flat, inhuman darkness.



But it was gone as quickly as it came.



He settled back, breathing rapidly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù



I reached for his hand. He reached back and held on desperately. Images of what his hands had done flashed in front of my eyes, eclipsing the room for fractions of a second: Kyle‚Äôs shoulder folding and crunching under the force of his blows. A man crumpling to the floor as his bones punched upward through his ruined chest. Isam screaming as Christophe smashed in his ribs. And how many other people had he torn apart? Did he even know anymore? Had he ever?¬†



As if reading my mind, Christophe let go with a shudder. I suppressed a shudder of my own.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said again. ‚ÄúSomething is wrong. I‚Äî‚Äù



A doctor rushed in, looking so tired I wanted to hug her right up until she said, ‚ÄúYou have to leave.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Christophe.



‚ÄúYou could have hurt her,‚Äù said the doctor.



‚ÄúTo be fair, this *is* the best place to get hurt,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no good place to get hurt, especially not by him.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Christophe started to breathe rapidly again. ‚ÄúI did not hurt her. I know I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù



It was obviously true, but suddenly I didn‚Äôt care because all I could see were his hands as they‚Äôd been just hours before, slick with blood and caked with gore. I wondered what he saw when he looked at me. If what he‚Äôd seen had made him panic.



‚ÄúGo,‚Äù the doctor told me.



I went.



The second I stepped out, I felt better.



But at that same second ‚Äî before I‚Äôd so much as taken a breath ‚Äî Christophe began to fight.



My little cheat code of an instinct kicked in, and I marched back in even though I didn‚Äôt want to.



His relief was palpable, but it didn‚Äôt last. When I approached, he tensed up, taut and flat-eyed. I noticed his hands were shaking. I looked away quickly, afraid I‚Äôd blink and see them bloodstained or worse, and took a seat.



I felt like I was caught in a live trap.



Christophe‚Äôs condition deteriorated every hour. He constantly checked that I was still there and asked countless times if I was hurt. He kept looking at me ‚Äî sometimes with relief, mostly with something that veered maddeningly close to revulsion.



But for all that, he broke apart whenever I tried to leave.



And he just got worse.



By the end, he was childlike but frightening, confused and utterly lost. He couldn‚Äôt sleep until the doctor doubled his sedative. As he was finally drifting off, he asked me, ‚ÄúDid I kill you? Is that why you smell like nothing?‚Äù



A memory hit me, cold and clear, of Gabriella explaining how it feels when Christophe thinks you smell like nothing.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dead,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive because of you.‚Äù



‚ÄúDid I try to kill you?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



That conversation repeated itself dozens of times over the next couple of days.¬†



Ironically, the person who kept me sane was Merry.



He first came by the day after his promotion. Maybe it was because of the exhaustion, but I felt a sickening surge of envy when I saw the sequined jacket he‚Äôd thrown on over his new commander uniform.



The jealousy changed to annoyance when he forced a cup of coffee into my hands.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a breve,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI made it, and you‚Äôre going to drink it right now.‚Äù



Other than that, he was solicitous as he told me how the Harlequin was making his life hell (‚ÄúI mean, I expected that. But I also expected it to be funny, which is where the disappointment comes in‚Äù), Birdy was scaring him (‚ÄúIn a good way, as much as you can describe what she‚Äôs doing to Asher as ‚Äògood.‚Äô‚Äù), and he didn‚Äôt like being a commander (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much work, and I didn‚Äôt even get a raise. Apparently, reinstating me with the paycheck counts as my raise, and because I went from zero dollars to ‚Äî well, I don‚Äôt want to rub it in so let‚Äôs just say I make more than you ‚Äî it‚Äôs like an exponential raise, and the Harlequin said that means I can never get a raise again. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù).



‚ÄúBut otherwise,‚Äù he finished, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right. Now.‚Äù He leaned forward. ‚ÄúHow about you?‚Äù



Before I could formulate an answer, something in his pocket beeped. He grimaced and pulled out a pager. It was striped black and white, had a red border around the screen, and was overall vaguely ridiculous. For some reason, it made me laugh.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your father‚Äôs idea,‚Äù he said darkly. ‚ÄúHe loves pagers. Which reminds me‚Äî‚Äù He pulled one out of his other pocket and slammed it on the side table. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs yours.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy does he need pagers?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs the Harlequin. Anyway ‚Äî‚Äù He bopped me on the head. ‚ÄúI have to go. Director Arlo wants me to decorate his office.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy is that your job?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo idea. When you get a chance, ask him.‚Äù



The silence that followed his departure was almost painful.



A few minutes later, Christophe opened his eyes.



They were blank at first. When he focused on me, they went dark. Perfectly, flatly dark. Then they went bright. Too bright, wrongly bright.



Then ‚Äî for the first time in days ‚Äî they looked normal.



‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said groggily.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs good?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here.‚Äù



Then he fell back asleep.



Merry visited every day after that. He was our only daily visitor, but by no means our only visitor.



Rafael came several times. Mikey visited twice. One morning, Richard and a few Ward 2 coworkers brought a giant handmade card. Carmen was with them and handed me a bouquet of flowers. When I tried to arrange them by Christophe‚Äôs bedside, she stopped me and said, ‚ÄúNo, those are for you.‚Äù



After they left I set the flowers up at his bedside anyway because I had nowhere else to put them.



All in all, I was simultaneously heartened and upset by the sheer amount of care and regard Christophe received.



I mean on one hand, I was thrilled for him. Besides, I completely understood ‚Äî on top of having genuine friends in Ward 2, he‚Äôd saved the lives of several staff during the breach.



On the other hand, I felt a specific kind of misery that accompanies the realization that people don‚Äôt really care what you‚Äôve done or who you‚Äôve hurt as long as they think you‚Äôre a cool dude.



And I was one of those people.



Luckily I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it (or the fact that I saw broken, bloody bodies every time I looked at Christophe‚Äôs hands), which made it easy to push behind my heart.



Merry made it even easier. Like I said, he was the only one who visited every day, and usually more than once.



He always brought a breve and snacks with him, and in between rants about the Harlequin and how badly other B-Class agents were treating him, he asked about my favorite food. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only asking because as a commander, I have full requisition and supply privileges, so I can get you whatever you want.‚Äù



I promised to think about it. I knew he wasn‚Äôt fooled, but I suspected he wouldn‚Äôt push.



I was right.



On one visit, he brought mesh sack of fruit along with Birdy. She was huge ‚Äî the size of an spaniel at least ‚Äî and quiet. Her size and silence worried me, but I was relieved to see her.



Merry was relieved, too ‚Äî not about Birdy, but because he‚Äôd finally achieved a measure of control over his subordinates. ‚ÄúSo they hate me, right? And they think my height is an insecurity so they kept calling me Commander Bantam and the Homunculus. So I got the Harlequin to sign off on a rule saying they have to call me Captain Manlet ‚Äî you know, instead of Captain Planet ‚Äî and now they don‚Äôt call me anything at all. Anyway‚Äî‚Äù He reached into his bag and pulled out food while Birdy watched longingly. He held an apple out to her, eyebrows raised. She leaned forward eagerly, only to shake her head miserably.



‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you eat?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúI have to stay big until I‚Äôm done,‚Äù she answered, ‚Äúin order to avoid certain temptations.‚Äù



‚ÄúOne apple won‚Äôt make you heart-sized,‚Äù said Merry.



‚ÄúOnce I start eating, I won‚Äôt want to stop. So it‚Äôs better to just not start.‚Äù



Merry tossed the apple to me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it so it hit me in the face and fell to the floor.



‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to eat that one, but you do have to eat something.‚Äù



‚ÄúI ate before you got here,‚Äù I lied.



‚ÄúGood. You have to eat again. Well, actually, you don‚Äôt. But if you don‚Äôt, I won‚Äôt leave. I‚Äôll sit right here next to you, and there will be nothing anyone can do to stop me, because I‚Äôm a commander. I‚Äôve got apples, bananas, oranges, pretzels, popcorn, potato chips‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúA banana,‚Äù I said irritably.



He passed one to me. ‚ÄúEat it, unless you really want me to stay here. And if you do, I will ‚Äî but only if you eat. Either way, you have to eat to get what you want.‚Äù



Once I‚Äôd swallowed the last bite, Merry cheered.



That woke Christophe up.



He looked at me first. Grogginess cleared to the dispiritingly familiar dead-eyed stare. But then it gave way to recognition and warmth. For a minute, I thought he was back to normal.



But he was actually just high as a kite.



He gave me a clumsy hug, and waved at Merry with no hint of annoyance. This put Merry in an extraordinarily good mood, and since Merry can‚Äôt be normal when he‚Äôs happy, he wound up singing the Chiquita Banana song. He danced and sang it incorrectly, which made Christophe laugh until he gagged.



Merry sang it four times in a row before Dr. Courtland stormed in and chased him off. Then he turned on me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs a commander. If he comes back, I‚Äôm sending him out and you with him.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt yell at her,‚Äù Christophe slurred indignantly.



‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt yelling.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know what yelling is, and that was yelling.‚Äù



Dr. Courtland left, but not before glaring daggers at me.



Christophe was sweet for a little while. He made me eat another banana, then unpeeled one for himself. But instead of eating it, he made it dance ‚Äúlike Merry,‚Äù which made him laugh until he cried.



At some point, I reached for him. He leaned in, but the instant we touched, he froze. His face shifted and the light drained out, leaving that flat darkness in its wake.



Then he started to cry.



Dr. Courtland swept into the room so quickly he had to have been listening at the door. He made me leave, which sent Christophe into a spiral. I tried to go back, but Courtland blocked the door. ‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs a safety issue.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat makes you think I‚Äôd hurt him?‚Äù



‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt talking about him. Go.‚Äù



And that was that.



Although furious, I didn‚Äôt go back because I didn‚Äôt want to piss off the medical staff.



So I decided to piss off my father instead.



I marched to his new office and pounded on the door until he answered. Before I even opened my mouth, he said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm going to ask!‚Äù



‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre going to ask me to tell you what‚Äôs wrong with your bad dog, or perhaps to force Medical to allow you to stay in his room. Either way, both ways, any ways ‚Äî the answer is *no*. Please leave. Some of us are working. I understand that‚Äôs a novel concept for you, but that‚Äôs no excuse.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù



He slammed the door.



Since I had nowhere else to go, I went to my own room and whiled the day away until I fell asleep.



All else aside, it was a relief to sleep in a bed instead of a chair.



But I didn‚Äôt sleep long.



I woke after nightfall to something cold and hard gently nibbling my fingers.



I shot up, screaming.



It was Birdy, bigger than ever and perched precariously on the edge of my mattress.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said mournfully. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help it. You taste like banana.‚Äù



I willed my heart to slow down. ‚ÄúI can just *give* you a banana.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt.‚Äù She watched me with her abyssal eyes. ‚ÄúDoes Asher know if dogs are carnivores?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes Asher know,‚Äù she repeated, ‚Äúif dogs are carnivores?‚Äù



‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you ask him?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



The finality in her voice gave me a chill.



‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶he probably knows.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his favorite candy?‚Äù



I answered automatically as the memory undredged itself: ‚ÄúRollos.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you know if he‚Äôd rather bleed out or be set on fire?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you know if he‚Äôd rather‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúBleed out, probably. I don‚Äôt know. Why are you asking?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a surprise,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut not for long. Thank you.‚Äù



She hopped off the bed and bobbed away.



Suddenly my new pager went off. The message on the screen made me choke:



*Your codependent animal is causing problems. Go fix it now ‚Äî so says your father, Arlecchino*



I put the pager in my pocket in case I needed the proof to reenter Medical, and went downstairs.



I could hear Christophe all the way at the opposite end of the unit. By the time I reached his room, my ears were ringing.



But the moment he saw me, he calmed down.



And for once, his eyes didn‚Äôt go dark.



‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù he asked.



I glanced at the workers arrayed around his bed. Dr. Courtland nodded impatiently.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm great,‚Äù I lied.



As he relaxed, I had a fleeting and very bitter thought: *How nice of you to make everyone else‚Äôs life hell until you get what you think you want*.



But guilt immediately consumed me. I mean, what the hell? It wasn‚Äôt like this was normal behavior. And he couldn‚Äôt help it. He was literally out of his mind, and all because of me.



‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù I asked.



Instead of answering, he pulled me in for a hug. He was tense at first ‚Äî dangerously so ‚Äî but slowly relaxed.



But as he relaxed, *I* tensed up. It was his hands again. In my mind‚Äôs eye I saw them tearing Isam‚Äôs skin off his shoulders. Then I saw him tearing into other things, other people, other women ‚Äî



I closed my eyes, which helped.



We were quiet for a little while.



When Christophe finally spoke, it was like a dam broke.



‚ÄúI do not know what the Harlequin did to me, but it made me sure that you were dead. I thought I killed you. I remembered doing it. I still do.‚Äù



I waited.



‚ÄúI cannot smell you anymore. I can smell what you are wearing. Your clothes, makeup ‚Äî those smells are there. They smell like you, but they aren‚Äôt you. It‚Äôs like they are pretending. Like‚Ä¶like a ghost wearing a sheet. It looks like it is a person until you pull the sheet off and you see nothing underneath.‚Äù



I got a sudden mental image of disembodied lipstick smile floating through the air, and shivered.



‚ÄúThe only people who have smelled like nothing to me have been threats. I know you are not a threat. I *knew* it. But I could not believe it was you. I still can‚Äôt, not quite. But please don‚Äôt be angry. I will get used to it. I am already starting to.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not angry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot‚Äî‚Äù



My pager went off.



‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù he asked.



‚ÄúThe Harlequin,‚Äù I answered wearily. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the director now.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know. Rafael told me. But this is your time off. And it‚Äôs four in the morning! Why is he calling you?‚Äù



I checked the message and groaned. ‚ÄúMy employee review was supposed to start two minutes ago.‚Äù



He pulled the pager from my hands and checked it himself, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat is he going to review?‚Äù



‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll find out.‚Äù



I arrived at the director‚Äôs office to find the Harlequin wearing perfect makeup and an immaculately pressed suit.



‚ÄúSit,‚Äù he said.



I sat.



He spun around in his chair once, twice, three times. ‚ÄúThis is very difficult for me. But the best way to handle difficult situations is to dive right in. So, allow me to dive: You are a severe disappointment.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou have been underperforming ever since I took this job.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here for like‚Ä¶a week? Not even?‚Äù



‚ÄúA week with no improvement on your part. Your patient outcomes are far too gentle. You‚Äôre treating them like broken dolls instead of the forces of spirit, nature, and vengeance that they are. You‚Äôre coddling their weaknesses while suffocating their strength. Worst of all, I found no less than four typos in last week‚Äôs work.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the acceptable number of typos?‚Äù



‚ÄúNegative seven.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt even argue.



He spun around in his chair again. ‚ÄúHow is your bad dog doing?‚Äù



‚ÄúPoorly.‚Äù



‚ÄúExcellent. You may go. I expect you back in this office tomorrow for your monthly review.‚Äù



‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt this my review?‚Äù



‚ÄúThis was your weekly review. Your monthly review is an entirely separate matter, although I must make it clear that I expect substantial improvement between now and tomorrow. Also, please be aware that I have scheduled a team-building exercise tonight. Your attendance is mandatory.‚Äù



I left.



Halfway down the corridor, Birdy trundled toward me.



‚ÄúHi, Birdy,‚Äù I said.



She ruffled her feathers, sending a cloud of sparkling dust into the air. ‚ÄúIs Asher afraid of monkeys?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



‚ÄúWould he rather have a leg cut off, or an arm?‚Äù



‚ÄúProbably neither.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the question.‚Äù



‚ÄúProbably an arm.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs he afraid of rollercoasters?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes. Or at least, he was. I mean, mine was. I don‚Äôt know about this one.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes he know that stars sing?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes he understand magnetars?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



She withered.



It struck me again just how big she was. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt Merry feeding you?‚Äù



‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let him.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, would you like something from me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúJust a bite, to take the edge off?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, I would.‚Äù



I tore my room apart until I found two solitary truffles, then popped them into her beak.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said happily, and hobbled off once again. I sat down to rest for a second.



Next thing I knew, sunlight was streaming through the window and Merry was pounding on my door.



When I answered, he immediately shoved a smoothie into my hands. ‚ÄúCome on. Christophe‚Äôs asking for you and Dr. Courtland‚Äôs ready to kill him. I, like you, would rather that not happen for several reasons, so let‚Äôs go.‚Äù



Based on his reaction, I expected something borderline catastrophic.



But when we got down to Medical, Christophe was fine. I mean, he looked at me like I was his mortal enemy for a second.



But only for a second.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre letting me out tomorrow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wanted to tell you.‚Äù



I caught the anxiety in his tone, but I was too tired to address it verbally. Instead I approached ‚Äî casually but carefully ‚Äî and hugged him.



He briefly went rigid before hugging me back.



Merry‚Äôs pager went off. Then it went off again. Once, twice, three, ten times ‚Äî so many times, in fact, that a flurry of staff came rushing in because they thought it was Christophe‚Äôs monitor.



Once they dispersed, I asked Christophe, ‚ÄúSo, do I smell like anything yet?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs being around me any easier today?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. Even now‚Äî‚Äù he pulled me close ‚Äî ‚Äúit is like holding a ghost.‚Äù



Unbidden, I thought of Gabriella. ‚ÄúIs it like I‚Äôm nothing?‚Äù



‚ÄúSometimes. Other times it is like you are a danger. But only until I see you.‚Äù



We were quiet for a little while.



Then I decided to ask a question that‚Äôs been on my mind for weeks:



‚ÄúIf my scent was different, would I still be someone to you?‚Äù



The silence that followed hurt a lot more than I expected.



Finally he said, ‚ÄúEveryone here thinks the scent is something I was waiting for. Something I wanted. But I never wanted it. Everyone thinks it means love. They forget that it means death. Your scent did not make me want to know you.‚Äù



He paused.



‚ÄúIt made me hate you before we ever met. When we met, I hated you even more. The only thought I had toward you except contempt was that you were someone I would have used my teeth on. I had not had that thought toward anyone in a long time.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt dare let myself feel.



‚ÄúOn the night they made us eat together, I knew how afraid I made you. I knew that you knew your fear made me happy. You sat with me anyway. You ate what I gave you, and then you gave me something back. It made me feel guilty for the thought I had of using my teeth. So guilty that I did not know what to do. I almost lost control. What I did instead was‚Ä¶what I did.‚Äù



I remembered him wrenching his own teeth out with pliers at the dinner table. It was a pretty awful memory, but still preferable to what the sight of his hands kept doing to me.

  


‚ÄúI had never taken out my own teeth only for having a thought,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut just thinking those things about you already felt so wrong. You were already someone. And it had nothing to do with your smell. It was because you ate with me.‚Äù



*Eat or be eaten*, I thought.



‚ÄúI still did not like you,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI did not want to be near you. I hated your smell more than I have ever hated anything except the way you looked at me. I was very angry when they said I had to get used to you. I told them I didn‚Äôt need to. I told them I didn‚Äôt want to.‚Äù



He shifted uneasily.



‚ÄúI stopped hating you after the Bag Lady, when you yelled at Rafael. I respected that you yelled at him, and I wondered what it would be like to have you yell at someone for me. I wanted you to.‚Äù



I wanted to say something, but had no idea what.



‚ÄúI wanted it more every time you did it for someone else, and you did it for so many. But they were all someone who had had things taken from them. I am someone who has taken much more than has been taken from me. It did not stop me wishing that you would do it for me. And one day, you did. After that, it did not matter how your scent made me feel. What mattered was the rest.‚Äù



He ran a hand through his hair, triggering a sharp memory of that same hand folding Kyle‚Äôs arm back at an inhuman angle.



‚ÄúWhat I am saying is nothing about your scent made me feel what I feel for you. It stopped me. I do not care about you because of it. I care about you in spite of it.‚Äù



We were quiet again for a while.



‚ÄúThere is one more thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know that you do not like what you feel for me. Your doubt has a scent too. Very sharp and hot, like a lightbulb about to pop. That smell is always on you, so I am always afraid that your feelings will pop, too.‚Äù He tried to smile, but failed. ‚ÄúThe way you smell has always made me afraid and angry. But now I can‚Äôt smell you, I can only see. And what I see makes me calm and happy.‚Äù



He drifted off to sleep not long after, which made me wonder if he really was ready to be discharged. I was too anxious to sit quietly, so I crept out of his room and went for a walk.



A few minutes later, Birdy accosted me yet again.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking everywhere for you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you where you‚Äôre supposed to be?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anywhere I‚Äôm supposed to be.‚Äù



She sighed sadly. ‚ÄúMe either. Does Asher know what birds believe?‚Äù



‚ÄúBirdy, what exactly are you doing with him?‚Äù



‚ÄúMaking him burn inside like he burned everything outside. l can‚Äôt burn all of him because I‚Äôm just one bird with just one heart, but I can burn enough to help. Besides, I like when things burn.‚Äù She cocked her head. ‚ÄúJust like you.‚Äù



On that ominous note, she bobbed off again.



The rest of the day was unremarkable. Merry forced me to eat by following me around until I finished whatever he‚Äôd foisted upon me. I spent several hours with Christophe. Despite doing nearly nothing, I was exhausted and went to bed early.



My chiming pager woke me at sunrise, summoning me for my monthly employee review.



The Harlequin was much more frantic this time.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made *no* progress in any of the matters we discussed at your last review,‚Äù he raged. ‚ÄúThis is unacceptable. I‚Äôm afraid I have no choice but to put you on a performance improvement plan.‚Äù



He made me sign twenty-seven different forms certifying my attendance, agreement, and understanding of the graveness of the matter at hand, all the while grumbling about bureaucracy and minutiae.¬†



At the end he said, ‚ÄúSend Captain Manlet up here. We have urgent tasks at hand.‚Äù



I staggered to the cafeteria and made myself coffee. Merry was speed-running through breakfast while Birdy trailed after him. He didn‚Äôt acknowledge me except to drop an orange in my pocket on his way out.



I tossed it out and made coffee. Then I went down to Medical, where Christophe was in the middle of his discharge exam. When he saw me, his eyes darkened.



But only for an instant.



It was a startlingly long exam with a psych component that a very ragged Dr. Courtland made me step out for.



Afterward, he came out to talk to me. ‚ÄúLook, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen. I cannot stress enough how dangerous this situation is for you. He probably won‚Äôt hurt you, but ‚Äòprobably‚Äô isn‚Äôt enough and honestly I‚Äôm even sicker of your face than I am of his, so don‚Äôt trust ‚Äòprobably‚Äô. You have your own room, right? Sleep there, because if he has a panic attack in the middle of the night, you‚Äôre dead. I had this talk with him, too, just so you know. He‚Äôs onboard. Please climb aboard, too.‚Äù



With that, Christophe was discharged.



Other than receiving seventy-four increasingly unhinged pager messages from the Harlequin, it was an easy day.



Christophe got sleepy early. I left his room right after dinner, but not before tucking him in.



My room was too chilly and too quiet, but comfortable. I skimmed the files for my upcoming Ward 2 schedule until I was exhausted. Just as I was ready to stagger to bed, someone knocked on my door.



It was Christophe, looking impressively forlorn.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù He hesitated. ‚ÄúPlease come back.‚Äù



It wasn‚Äôt a hard sell.



And despite all the dire warnings, it went fine.¬†



Until exactly 6:03 in the morning, when my pager went off so loudly it made me scream.



I picked it up, narrowly missing a panic-swipe from Christophe. Of course it was the Harlequin, informing me that I was three minutes late for my annual employee review.



The review went about as well as you‚Äôd expect.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve met exactly zero of the targets discussed in your last meeting. Your work performance hasn‚Äôt improved‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause I haven‚Äôt done any work. *I‚Äôm on vacation*.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no excuse! *And* you were absent from our mandatory team-building exercise!‚Äù



I closed my eyes briefly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWorse, even if you had attended, you would have brought your dog without even asking if any of the other participants were allergic ‚Äî which they were! But would you have cared? No.‚Äù He leaned back and heaved a sigh. ‚ÄúMy hands are tied, darling girl. This is your third consecutive meeting to address steadily worsening performance, now compounded by a hypothetical rampant disregard for your coworkers. It is my unfortunate duty to inform you that you and your dog are expected back here in my office at four-thirty Monday morning for mandatory counseling.‚Äù



I cried.



I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. I wasn‚Äôt even that upset.



But that didn‚Äôt stop me from sobbing.



The Harlequin shot out of his chair and enveloped me in a hug until I cried myself down to hiccups.



Then he smoothed my hair away from my face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right,‚Äù he soothed. ‚ÄúThese are growing pains. Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom ‚Äî *and* have our personal and professional deficits acknowledged by ourselves and everyone around us ‚Äî before we can grow past them. You will grow.‚Äù



He walked me back to my room. The second he was gone, I left and went to Christophe‚Äôs.



The second I opened the door, Christophe launched into an apology. It took me almost a minute to figure out he was apologizing for almost hitting me.



As the morning progressed, I noted that he was okay with touching me, but invariably tensed up when I touched him. That in itself wasn‚Äôt an issue, but the mountain of negative implications behind it very much was.



And the Harlequin‚Äôs right about one thing: The best way to deal with a problem is to dive right in.



That‚Äôs how I came up with the idea for a spa day.



By definition, spa days require a lot of touching in a controlled and defined environment.¬† It wouldn‚Äôt cure anything, of course, but it would be a start.



Besides, I like doing this kind of thing for boyfriends more than I actually like having a boyfriend.



Christophe wasn‚Äôt quite as excited. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou know, a spa day. Like‚Ä¶a manicure with a good top coat, and a facial, and I‚Äôll even try a massage. You should let me deep-condition your hair, too.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù



He eventually agreed, then took off to do other things. I, meanwhile, took another nap.



I woke up to light pressure and taloned feet on my chest.



I shot up.



Birdy stumbled back and flumped down into my lap.



She was big ‚Äî bigger than a bobcat now, but of course much lighter. Her talons pricked my shirt.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hungry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to eat but I can‚Äôt help it. Can you feed me?‚Äù



I obligingly fed her all the food I could find ‚Äî chocolate, a lone banana, pretzels, and three oranges.



By the end, she was the size of a cat.



‚ÄúThank you so much.‚Äù She rested her head on my chest for a minute.



Then she scrabbled off the bed and bobbed away, at which point Christophe entered with two plates of food. He sniffed and grimaced, turning to follow her progress. ‚ÄúWas Birdy here?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat did she want?‚Äù



‚ÄúFood.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs what I brought you.‚Äù



I made myself eat. Afterward, I prepped for the spa.



I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî it feels weird giving a detailed account for this. Spa stuff is nice, but it‚Äôs fundamentally boring. Ours was even more boring than usual because Christophe was flawlessly cooperative and so unwilling to hurt my feelings that he complimented everything and told me I was ‚Äúdoing so well‚Äù about thirty times.



I started with his hands ‚Äî intentionally washing them with all the meticulous care I could muster before moving on to the manicure ‚Äî and went from there.



He liked everything except the face mask because it itched. As soon as I washed it off and replaced it with regular moisturizer, he returned to excessive compliments.



In the end, the only notable thing about it is that I was right:



It helped.



Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîChristophe started off tense and he‚Äôd randomly flinch or even recoil from me, especially at first. But the longer it went on, the more at ease he became.



Even so, I fully expected him to bow out of the massage. I left it til last for that reason. But by the time I‚Äôd rinsed the conditioner out and towel-dried his hair, he was so relaxed that he ambled over to the bed and stretched out without prompting. Five minutes into the truly inexpert back massage that followed, he was asleep.



When he woke up for dinner, I deliberately reached for him. He didn‚Äôt flinch. He didn‚Äôt even tense up.



And his eyes stayed bright.



The next day would have been perfect in a lazily quiet sort of way if the Harlequin hadn‚Äôt called me in for my second PIP meeting.



For some reason Mikey and Gabriella were there when I arrived.



‚ÄúThere she is,‚Äù the Harlequin said. ‚ÄúLook carefully, children.‚Äù



Mikey looked at me helplessly. Gabriella waved, looking even tireder than I felt.



‚ÄúAs I was saying ‚Äîif you‚Äôre not careful, you‚Äôll end up just like her: Perpetually exhausted, supporting a lackluster partner with nothing to offer, fighting a losing battle to keep a figure that wasn‚Äôt worth the trouble in the first place, *and* wasting work resources and company time on a spa day.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat work resources?‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúI used my own stuff. And it was my day off.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnything belonging to T-Class inmates is property of AHH-NASCU. Therefore, you were using company property to illegally groom your bad dog.‚Äù



‚ÄúGrooming isn‚Äôt a crime.‚Äù



‚ÄúGrooming bad dogs on company time with company property is illegal in this facility. I‚Äôll let you go with a warning out of respect for our familial bond, but next time I will be forced to take more drastic action. Please sign here.‚Äù



A dozen thoughts of evil contracts and deals with the devil whirled through my mind. ‚ÄúWhat am I signing?‚Äù



‚ÄúAn attestation that you attended this meeting.‚Äù



I stared at him. He stared back.



I didn‚Äôt want to look away but I also didn‚Äôt want this to last any longer than necessary, so I randomly scrawled a signature without breaking eye contact.



He immediately frowned. ‚ÄúYou signed over my signature. HR isn‚Äôt going to like this, which I know because I am also HR.‚Äù



I asked, ‚ÄúWhat exactly did you do to Christophe?‚Äù



‚ÄúBe more specific.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt he smell me anymore?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause your magical scent is an exceptionally bone-headed method of delivery for an unforgivably tired plot device.‚Äù



I thought I was going to cry again. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



He rubbed his forehead. ‚ÄúFated romance is just so‚Ä¶*boring,* so *uninspired*, and so *uninteresting*. I can‚Äôt abide uninteresting things, so I exercised my directorial discretion to ax it.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou used your directorial discretion to ban romance?‚Äù



‚ÄúOnly that particular permutation of romance, and I stand by it. Destined lovers are boring. Nothing boring is allowed in my Pantheon, and the only thing more boring than soulmates are soulmates who already know they‚Äôre soulmates. Therefore ‚Äî banned.‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you make it so he smells *something* on me, at least?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs freaking him out.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy is that my concern?‚Äù



‚ÄúHow is he supposed to be productive if he‚Äôs freaking out all the time?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this insubordination is yet another black mark on your employee record. Is this harsh? Yes, intentionally so, but it is necessary to avoid even the appearance of nepotistic favor. You are dismissed.‚Äù



The rest of the day was uneventful.



Christophe and I went to bed early and woke at 3:30 the next morning to prepare for our 4:30am professional counseling appointment.



For once, it went better than I expected.



It started off obnoxious as ever when the Harlequin launched into his destined lovers spiel. At the end, he turned to Christophe. ‚ÄúI told her yesterday that I have banned destined love from the Pantheon. I have no doubt she shared this with you, given that she shares everything else with you. So, given that you are obviously aware that your relationship is of a type that has been specifically, intentionally, and punitively illegalized, why are you doing continuing it?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt is not illegal,‚Äù Christophe said.



‚ÄúAre you contradicting me?‚Äù



‚ÄúI would never.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen what precisely do you mean?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat type of relationship is illegal, like you said. That is your decision, and I respect it. But this is not that.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe are not destined for each other.‚Äù



‚ÄúNonsense.‚Äù



‚ÄúSense. Mr. Helping Hands did not curse me or write my future. He only showed it to me. But I am not even sure it was the future. This is hard for me to explain because English is not my first language or even my second or third, but I think in some ways the future was already happening back then and the past is happening now.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with destiny?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing. That is my point. I was simply shown a choice I already freely made. I just did not know I made it yet. But by seeing it, I became much less likely that I would ever make it.‚Äù



‚ÄúThis is senseless.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know there is a language barrier, so I will explain it differently. She and I are are not destined for each other. I might be destined to love her ‚Äî although I think that is not true, for several reasons that I am happy to explain¬† ‚Äî but she is definitely destined to kill me.‚Äù



‚ÄúI like this much better. Perhaps I will unban destiny after all.‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is no need. She and I have already banned destiny for ourselves. See, the only thing that smell meant to me was that she was the death of me. But she has decided she will not be the death of me.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you think you‚Äôre making a point? Because unfortunately‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúWhen I caught her scent, I hated her and she hated me. When you hate someone, it is much easier to kill them. But then she stopped hating me and started loving me. When you love someone, it is impossible to kill them unless there is a good reason, and there are no good reasons for her to kill me. This means we are already not doing what destiny says.‚Äù



‚ÄúI find your premise contrived at best.‚Äù



‚ÄúI smelled the thing that will kill me, yes? That thing was her. Her killing me is the destiny. If you hate fate because fate is the most boring outcome, you will have to hate it if she kills me and love it if she loves me. And she will not kill me.‚Äù



The Harlequin leaned forward, glowering. ‚Äú*I* might.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, I know. But that would not be fate.‚Äù



‚ÄúI disagree.‚Äù



‚ÄúMay I ask you a question?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou just did.‚Äù



‚ÄúI would like to ask another.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf you must.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy are you so upset? You and I used to have an understanding. Besides, even though she could find a better man than me very easily, she cannot find a better boyfriend than me. Even you know this.‚Äù



The Harlequin fell back, eyeballing us with what I can only describe as manic sullenness. ‚ÄúIf you insist on being my son-in-law, I may insist on being yours.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù



‚ÄúCourtney.‚Äù



Christophe considered this. ‚ÄúCourtney is an adult who can do what she wants. However, I think you should know that while I would be a good son-in-law, I would be a very bad father-in-law.‚Äù



The Harlequin‚Äôs expression was ghastly. For the first time, I was recoiling and Christophe was keeping his cool. ‚ÄúWhere did this courage come from, Mr. Wolf?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is no courage, only knowledge.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat knowledge is that?‚Äù



‚ÄúKnowledge that you will not hurt me.‚Äù



‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù



‚ÄúI can smell it on you.‚Äù



‚ÄúSmell what?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat you will not hurt me as long as she likes me.‚Äù



The Harlequin stared at Christophe for a very long time.



Finally he said, ‚ÄúTrue. Remember that, darling girl.‚Äù He looked up at the ceiling and spun his chair around and around and around.



Then ‚Äî



‚ÄúSign these.‚Äù



He shoved a stack of paperwork in our faces, then dismissed us.



The rest of the day was nice.



Christophe made me eat. Courtney visited. Later on, Merry forced us all to watch Batman Forever. Halfway through I started feeling sick, which Christophe used as an excuse to bow out. I got sicker overnight, but everything was fine.



And everything stayed fine.



Until last night, when I came down with a fever from hell.



It was the kind of fever where all the colors are too bright and you can count the threads in your pajamas and it feels like half your body is outside your skin.



At some point a soft weight settled against my chest. Talons pricked my night shirt.



‚ÄúBirdy?‚Äù I croaked.



‚ÄúI need your fever,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt take it unless you want to give it.‚Äù



‚ÄúTake it.‚Äù



‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



Something happened.



A vast net settled over and through my skin, sinking through the flesh and down past the bones. Then it tore upward violently, carrying something with it, something heavy and scorching, up and out and‚Äî



‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited about your surprise,‚Äù Birdy trilled happily. ‚ÄúIt will be ready soon.‚Äù



I opened my eyes.



Birdy was gone, and so was my fever.



I won‚Äôt bore you (or myself) by writing out the rest of my day.



What I will share is that an hour ago, I learned that Asher ‚Äî the Son of Hadron ‚Äî is scheduled for termination.



And the Harlequin has tasked me with carrying it out.

Fresh aloe vera - which I have posted about before - has been the primary thing I have used to keep those symptoms from getting too bad.  But a low level inflammation of the eyelids persisted.  

Some days would be better than others, which made me realize there may be a dietary trigger.  Lo and behold I came across a random blog post where a stye sufferer said their pharmacist asked them if they ate lots of almonds. That he had been seeing a big uptick in styes, and that he seemed to think almonds could be a culprit.

Guess what?  I‚Äôm a very healthy tennis pro.  I ate tons of nuts of all kinds, especially almonds, on a daily basis.  Had almond milk on my cereal and in my coffee.

I cut all nuts and almonds out of my diet 3 days ago.  My eyes have felt the best they have in over a year after just three days w/o nuts.  Crazy huh?

Well, turns out that almonds concentrate tons of heavy metals - including arsenic and cyanide (!!) - from the irrigation that they receive.  Even organic ones are still susceptible to collecting these poisons because it is coming straight from their water supply. 

Anyway, just amateur sleuthing here trying to problem solve my own issues and I seem to have stumbled upon something rather significant.  It‚Äôs already making a huge difference for me.  Hopefully it might help some of you.  ‚úåÔ∏è

It felt like a good day to let myself relax after doing some harder processing work in my group therapy program lately. So. I called them and feigned a migraine. It feels harmless. One day off then back to the grind tomorrow. It's not like I am physically unsafe or mentally unsound. I watched The Social Network at home for a little bit. I kinda forgot how funny that movie can be. And the cinematography is beautiful. 

So first I headed into the town center. It's so warm out. I couldn't not go outside and take advantage. I got coffee. Then I got to thinking. Im pretty witchy. I haven't been to Salem in a while. There's a certain restaurant that is award winning and has all this buzz. A hole in the wall diner type place that I've been wanting to try. So off I went. 

I am glad I went. It's one of those places that does indeed live up to the hype. The cinnamon french toast? Life changing. I called my friend. I thought I'd journal or read but I mostly just listened to music and spaced out. I walked into the center of Salem. I thought a Psychic/Author I personally am a big fan of had a store there but only today did I find out.... he does not. I had to ask him on Instagram to confirm this. But that's fine. There's always other amazing unique boutique type shops open there. 

I ended up wandering into a RPG accessory themed store and buying a beautiful handmade tiara. It was adorned with amethyst and a crescent moon centerpiece. I loved it. I walked in and out of that store more than once. On my second time going in I just couldn't resist buying it. Once I did I was ready to head home. 

We had homemade tacos. I was determined to be productive today so I sent five different inquires to different talk therapists my group therapy program found for me. One already wrote back with immediate space for telehealth sessions. So I will probably plan to follow up on that. 

My feet hurt but I can remedy that with the pedicure I have planned in the coming days. I also will buy the new sneakers I need to get around to buying. Eventually. For now I have to hop in the shower. ",2,1741829498.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

This peer of mine was shocked to hear of my promotion in meeting has since been on completely different terms.

He is just as he was with other reports of mine and other team members but ‚Äúhates to have my name mentioned‚Äù as per another person. I have myself felt that he does not like to join the team during lunch and coffee breaks if I‚Äôm there. He has no issue when I‚Äôm not there. I have hence stopped going to lunch or coffee breaks with my team so at least they get to gel together.

I have brought this to the notice of my dotted manager and my direct manager and they both feel that he is going through a tough phase in his person life. They told me about how he is having marital problems and how someone is his family is actually involves in a near death accident and someone else who is terminally sick.

While I don‚Äôt want to be indifferent about his personal situation but these problems were there before and it never impacted our relationship plus the accident story seems to be cooked because he never told this to anyone but the dotted manager.

Despite of all his personal problems, I see that he is seemingly fine when interacting with other people in the office but only when I say join the conversation, he ends it and slowly withdraws himself and just leaves abruptly. Everyone seems to have noticed this change in behaviour but I don‚Äôt know whose side everyone is picking.

As a manager of his, I‚Äôm now over compensating when assigning him work by assigning task which I feel will not ‚Äúupset‚Äù him. And he is not keeping me in the loop when he gets tasked assigned to him by our dotted manager, which makes me look like a weak manager.

I have known him for nearly 10 years now and I was the one who referred him to this company and (sigh) I feel that I have done a big mistake because his behaviour with his previous managers was also similar earlier.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I took first pill (Canadian generic - starts with L) at 730am small breakfast bar. 
Started feeling effects within 30 minutes but it was mainly a feeling of being ‚Äúoff‚Äù 
Then I had a few hours of better focus - but motivation still not there
I had a small coffee - this made me feel better 
After going to the dump - I had a nap because I was tired all morning 
By lunch I was having what I was call ‚Äúmunchies‚Äù feeling ‚Äústoned‚Äù kinda body buzzed
By 430 I became miserable - I wanted to tell everyone to fk off - this is so not like me. 
I took magnesium theronate- had a decent sleep
Day two kinda the same except less irritability and more headache this evening - which I made sure I drank water and only one small decaf coffee today. 

Why does it feel like this is not working for me ? 
Everyone I know that takes made it seem like their entire world got better from this. 

My partner says I‚Äôm completely out of it and it‚Äôs freaking him out 

I was supposed to go to 20mg but now I‚Äôm a little worried 

Last night when the effects were feeling gone I enjoyed this feeling- maybe I‚Äôm meant to live with ADHD forever ?

1ja0kbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1ja0kbw/6_food_helped_me_lose_weight_after_years_of/,6 food helped me lose weight after years of struggling,"I stepped on the scale this morning, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I‚Äôm proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A normal BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and magic diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn‚Äôt about suffering through endless workouts. I found these foods made CICO easier for me: 

**- Oatmeal: basic but undefeated fiber. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast: obviously:)**

**- Vegetables: I like tomatoes!**

**- Protein shakes: easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea: appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread: if you love bread but need to reduce carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn‚Äôt fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn‚Äôt going to solve itself. Here are some books i read that really helped me rewire my brain:

**-** [**How Not to Diet**](https://befreed.ai/book/how-not-to-diet-by-michael-greger)¬†**by Dr. Michael Greger (How fiber bulks up the foods and block some of the calories from being absorbed)**

This book was a¬†game-changer.¬†It breaks down the science behind weight loss and focuses on¬†foods that naturally help you eat fewer calories.¬†His approach really makes it¬†easier to feel full while eating in a deficit.

**-**¬†[**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter)¬†**by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you‚Äôve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-**¬†[**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer)¬†**by Herman Pontzer (You can‚Äôt outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn‚Äôt enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-**¬†[**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett)¬†**by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

¬†A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you‚Äôve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúeat slower‚Äù).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who‚Äôs ever felt like they ‚Äúfailed‚Äù a diet. It‚Äôs all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you‚Äôre struggling, I promise you‚Äôre not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don‚Äôt know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",21,1741829143.0,CICO,2,0.89,False

They'd be adjusting my salary to 115k and cover moving expenses. Now that I have the numbers, I'm trying to figure out where the best place to live in the city would be as well as get some perspectives on a few other things I've been thinking about. 

I've visited Chicago a number of times and have been able to visit some of the neighborhoods that peaked my interest. The two options I'm really considering are a 1 bedroom in either Lakeview and River North. My office is in River North and the thought of living in a high-rise does peak my interest a bit, but I've been to Lakeview and have had good times there too! Both have cool bars, though I will say Lakeview has the slight edge on food (unless I'm missing something in RN). RN seems to have more grocery stores in a short distance too. 

The main goal of moving is to be able to live a true urbanist lifestyle, meaning being able to live car-free and walk/bike/use transit instead to easily get around. Also, I'm single and looking for a place that isn't super family oriented, as I don't plan on ever having kids (i.e. a place where there aren't strollers everywhere). Cleveland really feels like the opposite of what I'm wanting in this regard. I like going to bars, getting food, being near coffee shops, and value walkability to do basic tasks/errands. I'm a big fan of music and concerts, especially EDM. I'm into collecting vinyls and retro gaming as well! I'm also more on the introverted side, so I'm not a loud party animal or anything like that. I'm also a very direct and honest sort of person, not afraid to speak my mind or say something that someone may not want to hear, but not in a mean way. 

Based on the above, any suggestions on what neighborhood could work best for me? Or if there are others I didn't mention, please share!

Now here are some other questions that I'm looking for an honest take on: 

* Other than cost of living, what are the things you like the most about Chicago and why you'd pick it over a place like NYC? 
* Is the CTA really as bad as some of the people on Reddit say it is? (I have my own thoughts but want to hear yours)",0,1741829142.0,AskChicago,14,0.38,False

Perfumes I didn‚Äôt choose. I must either find it in my heart to love them or abandon them on the side of a mountain. I‚Äôm wearing them to give them a fair chance because the bonus ingredient in every perfume is human skin. 

The methodology: two perfumes, two wrists. You see where I‚Äôm going with this? 

The hypothesis: when I tested these on paper I found Crystal Noir more pleasant. I think it‚Äôll be nice, but will it be amazing? My nose is twitching in anticipation. Cafe Rose on the other hand was rated ‚Äúbury it‚Äù by my cat. I think it‚Äôll be a high risk/ high reward scenario where I either love it or use it to repel feral cats. 

The Results

Cafe Rose: this is a little stinky, but in a cool way. Like a French person (Ceci n‚Äôest pas une hate crime). 

I feel about rose scents the way I feel about the oboe. When it‚Äôs part of an orchestra it adds something nice, but I‚Äôd have to be in a truly deranged mood to want to sit through an oboe solo. Luckily this rose brought an interesting stink to the party. I assume that‚Äôs supposed to be the coffee. What makes this work is that it‚Äôs somehow smooth together. This isn‚Äôt the orchestra. This is jazz. 

Crystal Noir: I liked this more on paper. I‚Äôm getting bubble gum and coconut, but it‚Äôs trying to be seductive. I fear this bubble gum has no rizz. I remain unmoved. 

One of my classmates used to keep magazine perfume strips in her desk. You‚Äôd peel apart these little folded edges to get a very limited preview of what different designer perfumes smelled like. Whenever the library got new magazines these things were like buried treasure. Crystal Noir is a magazine perfume. It has mass appeal, but I think it‚Äôs better if you enjoy it without thinking about it too much. The whole is better when you don‚Äôt go sniffing around for the sum of its parts. 

These aren‚Äôt bad when smelled together. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre passionately in love, but this could be an emotionally-satisfying companionate marriage. ",2,1741828470.0,fragrance,0,0.67,False

I sprayed it onto my wrist, I was feeling generous so went for three sprays.

I gasped. A deep, full bodied, audible gasp.

I began to tremble, my eyes twitching as I took it all in.

I gave myself a moment, some deep breaths. Letting it all sink in.

Looking out of my window, I said ""Oh, the cosmos! What is this... what do I smell? Is it mediocrity? A foul miasma creeps among the celestial wonders, tainting the brilliance of creation! Speak to me, ethereal forces! Is there nothing but drab shadows cast upon our dreams?""

I began to process it further, choosing to take in each note on my shimmering wrist. A sharp bergamot and orange mix, bright, but not particularly... imaginative. I felt numb with grief. Actually, I could feel agony sinking in. Sheer, wrought agony.

I decided to spray it in on my neck, to see if the situation would improve. It didn't. With a booming voice, (supported with vibrato) I yelped ""This abominable concoction - this perfume is nothing short of lacklustre!""

I couldn't believe it. Eventually, the tea note popped out, and it did absolutely nothing but add insult to injury. A feeble, quiet tea note whispering into the void.

I pulled the curtain down and screamed, I had to let it out.  A multi-octave scream that started from the boom of my chest and crawled all the way up until it could cut glass. I sustained it for 34 seconds with my entire body engaged in the moment. I rushed into my bathroom and scrubbed it off aggressively. Looking in my mirror, after 6 minutes of shaky breathing punctuated by the occasional sob, I picked up a microphone that I carry around with me for no particular reason, looked into the bathroom mirror and whispered with the urgency of an opera climax ""Imagination?!

1ja09un,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ja09un/aitah_for_calling_my_canadian_friend_bigoted_and/,AITAH for calling my Canadian friend bigoted and blocking her,"Sorry for formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile. 

I‚Äôm (23f) an American living in Japan. About a year ago I made friends with a Canadian student (f21) who‚Äôs here for college. Recently since America has been fucking awful and threatening Canada, she‚Äôs been pretty outspoken about America. Which, fair. But she‚Äôs been turning this into an ‚Äúall Americans are stupid Trump lovers including you‚Äù thing which I am much less okay with. 

She‚Äôs also been pretty hypocritical about what she says and what she does, which is probably why I ended up so pissed off about all of this. For example, I invited her to come with me to the Costco in our area since it‚Äôs pretty far away, she doesn‚Äôt drive, and lord I needed some American cheese because the cheese here is horrendous. She lectured me about ‚Äúvoting with my wallet‚Äù and told me she wasn‚Äôt spending money on American companies. This put a bug up my ass because 1) I do boycott problematic companies, such as Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs, which she goes to and invites me to FREQUENTLY. When I told her I was boycotting them she told me boycotting didn‚Äôt matter anyways. And 2) COSTCO IS A GOOD COMPANY who is standing up to our government and protecting the workers!! It was just an all around bad take. 

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was this week when I was talking to her on a phone call about a couple trips I‚Äôll be making back to the states to visit family. She said that she is refusing to travel to America and that the fact that I was is ‚Äúreally telling,‚Äù and asked why my family was unwilling to come visit me in Japan. She KNOWS that my family is dying to come visit me in Japan but they can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre poor as hell and my mom is disabled, so a long flight + Japan‚Äôs metric fuck ton of stairs would not be good for her. As much as I don‚Äôt want to play the fucking activism Olympics I told her that unless she stops putting money towards genocide every morning with her nasty ass dessert coffees then I didn‚Äôt want to hear her criticize me for spending time with my family. She blew up at me and went on a rant about how Americans don‚Äôt think about how their politics affect other countries, about how I was still ‚Äúcomplicit‚Äù in Trump‚Äôs election because so many people didn‚Äôt vote (I MAILED IN MY BALLOT) and how I couldn‚Äôt understand how it was affecting her country. She also said that only the Starbucks and McDonalds in America are corrupt and the ones here are fine. No clue how she came up with that one. 

I‚Äôve opened up to her about how scared I was when Trump got elected because my family survives on benefits he‚Äôs trying to cut. I also cried to her about possibly needing to cancel a trip out here for my sibling, who I haven‚Äôt seen in forever, because their passport application was suspended for having the ‚ÄúX‚Äù gender marker. She told me that a lot of Americans are ‚Äúhyper political‚Äù AFTER I VENTED ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE NEARLY GETTING ARRESTED AT A PROTEST. So her telling me that I don‚Äôt understand the effect these politics have pissed me the fuck off, because I DO.

I don‚Äôt want to just sit there and be like ‚ÄúbUt nOt aLL aMeRiCaNs‚Äù every time she says something shitty so at that point I‚Äôd already resigned myself to just not talk to this person anymore. I basically said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bigoted, hypocritical, and uneducated. You‚Äôre sounding more American than I am‚Äù because I knew it would piss her off, then I ended the call. I then sent her a message saying she can fend for herself next time she can‚Äôt read something because she won‚Äôt study kanji and blocked her. I know it was petty as hell but I can‚Äôt really bring myself to give a shit.

My partner (also American) is with me and agrees that she‚Äôs being shitty. But he thinks that what I said to her + blocking her might have been a bad idea because now she‚Äôs more isolated from Americans and is more likely to believe all of us are like that. I feel like it‚Äôs not my responsibility to serve as an ‚Äúexample‚Äù for her and she seemed pretty set on believing whatever she wants to. However, I can see where my partner is coming from, and I do feel like this is a recent issue of hers that‚Äôs probably coming from being stressed about politics, and I really do get that.

1ja089u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseMedicine/comments/1ja089u/advice_needed_is_my_tcm_practitioner_too/,Advice Needed: Is My TCM Practitioner Too Restrictive?,"
I‚Äôve been seeing a reputable TCM practitioner and acupuncturist once a week for the last four weeks.

## Western Medicine Diagnoses:
- Vulvodynia  
- Chronic Candida  
- Narcolepsy  

## TCM Diagnoses (from what I understand - there is probably more):
- Dampness & heat  
- Something about needing to get my energy up?  

## Progress So Far:
- She says my tongue looks better, and the progress photos she‚Äôs taken do show improvement.  
- I‚Äôve had less brain fog, but I‚Äôve also taken myself off the Modafinil my sleep doctor prescribed because that was affecting it.  

## How I Feel About It:
- I‚Äôve left my last two sessions in **tears**.  
- I‚Äôve followed her plan **exactly**‚Äîno deviations, using only the recipes from her patient guide.  
- Each time I go in, she **removes more foods**.  
- When I express concerns, she tells me: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt see it as restricting, see it as nourishing.‚Äù*  

## Examples of Restrictions:
- I asked what I should do for a breakfast date with friends, and she said:  
  *‚ÄúEat before you go and just have tea at the caf√©.‚Äù*  
- I asked if I‚Äôll ever be able to reintroduce foods, and she said:  
  *‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù*  
- I told her my **fatigue is still bad**, and she blamed the **gluten-free, sugar-free turmeric & cinnamon pancakes** from **her own recipe guide**‚Äîdespite me eating them for three weeks with no prior issue.  
- I had **one coffee** the other week with a friend, and she told me to **cut that out**.  
- I was **roasting vegetables** because steaming doesn‚Äôt have much flavor and I love roasting things‚Äîthat got **cut out** too.  

## My Background & Concerns:
- I‚Äôve done elimination diets before with doctors/naturopaths, and they **never solved the root problem**. This is why, a long time ago, I made the decision that **super restrictive diets were not for me**‚Äîjust changing your diet alone doesn‚Äôt fix everything.  
- I‚Äôve worked hard to **heal my relationship with food** through cooking, sharing meals, and experiencing different cuisines. It brought **joy** back into food for me. It took me a long time to get that back after all the elimination diets.  
- I told her this in our **first session**, and she just said: *‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù*  
- I feel like her approach is **overly rigid and controlling**, even though I‚Äôve been **100% compliant**.  

## Current Diet Guidelines from Her:
- **No:** gluten, dairy, sugar, cold foods, fermented foods (e.g., kimchi), dark chocolate, honey, maple syrup  
- **No:** tomatoes, potatoes, zucchini, pumpkin, peppers, corn, cabbage  
- **No:** roasting veggies‚Äîonly steaming  
- **Only:** dry roasted almonds (no other nuts)  
- **Only:** dandelion tea 2-3x/day  
- **Only:** macadamia milk in matcha (1/day max)  
- **No more:** buckwheat cruskets‚Äîonly plain rice wafers  

## My Lifestyle:
- I exercise **30-45 min/day**, broken into morning and afternoon movement  
- I do **Wim Hof breathing, lymphatic drainage massage, and meditation**  
- I consider myself otherwise **healthy**  

## My Questions:
1. **Is this normal** to be on such a restrictive diet long-term?  
2. Should I **stick with it** and just suck it up?  
3. Should I **consider changing practitioners**?  
4. Any **recipe suggestions** that fit these guidelines?  

If this is **truly** the norm in TCM, I‚Äôll push through, but mentally I feel like I need **less restriction and more balance**. Although my tongue looks better, **this is not how I will be choosing to live my life 100% of the time long-term**, and I‚Äôve **tried** to tell her that this isn‚Äôt sustainable for me. Instead of a discussion, I just feel like I get guilted for not wanting to be rigid all the time or told *‚Äúwe‚Äôll talk about it later.‚Äù*  

Would love to hear from others who‚Äôve been through this!",1,1741828150.0,ChineseMedicine,6,1.0,False
1ja0899,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ja0899/price_disparity_for_el_salvador_coe_winner/,Price disparity for El Salvador COE winner?,"I just tasted this coffee from Bean & Bean:

https://beannbeancoffee.com/collections/shop-all-coffee/products/el-salvador-cup-of-excellence-1-honey-score-92-00

I purchased a single dose (along with a larger order) and paid $15 before shipping.

It was stunning coffee, but was a month off roast, and I couldn't help but feel a) it was a little past it's prime and b) the 92 point cup score was slightly inflated (as is often the case at these COE competitions). 

Provided more than a single dose, it's certainly possible I could've dialed it in further and gotten even more amazing results that might justify the 92 points. It certainly was the best pacamara I've ever tried (I've had perhaps a dozen).

While reading about the coffee, I stumbled upon this roaster (I've never heard of) offering a whopping 8oz of the same coffee for $37 before shipping...

https://www.cultivarcoffee.com/products/el-salvador-la-bendicion-1-coe-winner?variant=44438663037114

How is this price possible? The roaster seems to be a legitimate business with positive reviews. I also understand that Bean & Bean is a high-end, well-regarded roaster based in NYC, so certainly,a higher price seems justified. But nearly FOUR TIMES the price!? That just seems impossible. Am I missing something? Is anyone familiar with Cultivar coffee roasters? Is Bean & Bean a rip off? What gives?",5,1741828149.0,pourover,10,0.86,False
1ja07y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ja07y4/people_coming_in_the_kitchen_while_im_cooking/,People coming in the kitchen while I'm cooking.,"It's mostly my grandfather, but it's really starting to irk me. I don't ask for much when it comes to the common areas of the house (my grandfather has control of the TV in the living room all day every day), and technically it is his house that I live in rent-free (his choice, not mine) but I've asked so many times for him to stay out of the fucking kitchen while I'm cooking (pet peeve, hate it when people are in the kitchen while I'm cooking).


 He *can't* cook (disability) and my mom can't cook for shit, so I do 90% of the cooking in the house. And I make *good* food. All I ask is that people stay out of the kitchen while I'm making food. And yet I can't even tell you how many times I've started cooking, and turned around to see him going in the fridge, or making coffee, or getting a snack. And he doesn't get up until I do! He'll sit in his chair for hours and the moment I get up to cook, he's right fucking there behind me. And if I complain, he just says ""Oh I'm not getting in the way"" or ""Oh it's just this one thing"", and he says it in that condescending tone, like I don't have a right to be upset that he's *always* in the kitchen when I'm trying to make dinner. I don't care if he's not in the way, I don't want him in there. 


There's been times that I'll straight up stop what I'm doing and walk away until he's done doing whatever is so important that he needs to be in the kitchen *right* now. I've also threatened on occasion that if he continues to do it, I'll make good food for everyone else and give him PB&J and chips or something else bland and boring. How hard is it to stay out of the kitchen for 30 minutes-1 hour tops??",1,1741828121.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

This is a small expedition, which might completely fail, to find a cute girl who was checking me out at the N√ºrnberg HBF while we were traveling to Munich. I noticed that she gave me a hint at the beginning, but a friend had come to drop me off, so I thought it might just be a one-time thing and let it go.

Then, she ended up boarding the same coach and checked me out again while organizing her luggage, which seemed heavy. For the next two hours, there wasn‚Äôt much interaction, and I was busy working on my laptop.

When we reached Munich, everyone got up, and I waited for people to leave. She checked me out once more before leaving. I didn‚Äôt approach her or ask her out because I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass her with so many people around.

I thought about starting a conversation after we got off the train, but she vanished, and I couldn‚Äôt find her. Now, I regret not getting to know her because she was very cute and wore a sweet sky-blue jacket.

Well, hey üëã, if you‚Äôre the cute girl who checked me out and you‚Äôre reading this, please ping me on Reddit. I‚Äôd be glad to get to know you more and invite you out for coffee or a walk in the English Garden üòâ.

I purchased the mauve colored 3.5 quart braiser but want to return it since I feel the 6.75 quart will be more versatile. That mauve color is so beautiful though!

Education and teaching light up my world, and I‚Äôm excited to keep growing in this rewarding field.

I‚Äôm **5‚Äô4‚Äù with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos.**

I love life‚Äôs simple pleasures‚Äîsipping a **cranberry vodka or gin and tonic** while taking in the city lights, sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake, or getting lost in a bookstore for hours. I prefer **quiet moments over loud parties and thoughtful conversations over small talk.** Libraries, bookstores, and cozy coffee shops? Always a yes. I also love **skylines and late-night drives‚Äîthere‚Äôs something magical about city lights against the night sky.**

So, why am I here instead of on a dating app? Glad you asked! Dating apps often feel like an endless cycle‚Äîswipe, match, chat, go on a date, realize there‚Äôs no spark, and repeat. It gets tiring. I want something more organic, more *real*.

I‚Äôm looking for **an old-fashioned romance**‚Äîthe kind where you go on real dates, where a night out means exploring the world together, not just hanging out at someone‚Äôs place. I love creating meaningful memories in real-life settings.

When I‚Äôm not working, you‚Äôll find me **writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films.** I‚Äôm a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007‚Äîno reboot, please!) and would love a partner who‚Äôs down to binge it with me. Some of my favorite films include *Dogfight, Cruel Intentions, Stand By Me, Career Opportunities, Secret Admirer,* and *The Bling Ring.* My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like **‚ÄúSunset‚Äù by The Midnight, ‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù by Coastal, and ‚ÄúMiracle Love‚Äù by Lazer Club.**

While I treasure my independence, I‚Äôm ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I want a connection that‚Äôs built on **laughter, trust, and genuine care.** I picture us as that couple who creates silly inside jokes, enjoys the little things, and has each other‚Äôs backs through it all. Romantic moments are my favorite‚Äîthose quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and just *know*.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** Preferably 5‚Äô10‚Äù or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is fine
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (U.S./Canada preferred)
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential‚Äîbonus points if you‚Äôre open to a family someday!

# A Few Must-Haves:

* You‚Äôre emotionally available, stable, and single
* You communicate openly and value consistency (the little things matter!)
* You‚Äôre excited about real dates and meaningful experiences
* You‚Äôre present in your current life, not caught up in the past

If you‚Äôre **kind, stable, and looking for a relationship filled with joy and mutual respect**, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Feel free to send a message, and if we vibe, I‚Äôm happy to exchange photos. Let‚Äôs see where this journey takes us. üíï",0,1741827772.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I know Ethan hasn‚Äôt been officially diagnosed yet (chill Doolittle), but the number one piece of advice I can give Ethan is track everything you eat and avoid them at all costs. 

I‚Äôm still finding foods that are affecting me. Most recently, lactaid milk. I‚Äôve got no problem eating food that has it cooked in it, but a smoothie with it as the base sets me off. Much like Ethan, I‚Äôm out for days at a time, frequently visiting the bathroom up to three times an hour. Other foods for me that are like that are: cream cheese, half and half that sits on the counter, coffee creamers, ham, any whole grain foods, (Deez) nuts, sunflower seeds, corn, lettuce, and those Ghost sugar free ultra caffeinated drinks (but tiny Red Bulls are fine).

The beginning of the diagnosis was rough though. The doctors flopped around from IBS to Ulcerative Collitis, where they finally landed on Crohns about 8 years ago.

The point of this post was for more clarity if Ethan needs and hoping he has similarities to me so that he can bring this to his doctors.

Don't assume that people who make posts here are dumb and never considered environmental factors that they could change or control. Don't assume they never heard of behavioral treatments like CBT.

I'm not saying these things are useless. For some people with occasional insomnia, these help. Especially for people who have okay lives otherwise and insomnia is their only issue. Reading up on CBT-i can make a difference.

Not so for countless people with major trauma or genetic factors or other difficulties that go way deeper than that. These people tend to know very well about behavioral factors, not because they are smarter but because chronic and severe insomnia causes so much suffering that they've spent hours reading about every possible treatment. When you can't sleep more than three hours a night, that's what happens. You get all this extra time and motivation to find a solution. And you become desperate. You get tired of hearing the same thing over and over again, from people who don't know what severe insomnia is like. Not getting sleep is a kind of torture. Actually it is torture. You do that to a person and that's a crime.

So if somebody makes a post here, it's okay if you want to give them your usual CBT/sleep hygiene/see a doctor speech, but don't push it on them. Say it once and let it go. And don't say it in a way that suggests they are dumb or addicts or doing this to themselves, or looking for an easy way out. If you can't show compassion, if you can't bother to care, then be quiet and move on. Nobody is begging you to comment and make them feel worse about themselves and problems. Yes, you.

The silence was luringly warm, even as the cold wind brushed against her nose. Beneath the boat, the waters were gentle enough to keep the ship steady. Yet there was still the calming sound of waves crashing against the hull. Although idle, she could still see the shimmering of fish scales. Fluttering fins splashed against the surface as fish mistook the boat's bubbles for food. Besides the putrid scent of wasted oil and rusted metal, the evening was unusually peaceful.

¬†

""Ms Bayahibe,"" Emelia called playfully, emerging from the shadow cast by the cabin. Her body was gentle as she moved with her hands clasped in front of her. Emelia‚Äôs eyes focused on a single spot in the darkness. ""Perhaps you should step away from the railings, I wouldn't want you to come to harm.""

""You can just call me Rosa,"" She replied, smiling, her arms dangling over the side as her hands shifted with the breeze. The air felt grainy as it hit her skin and tangled between her fingers.

""Formality is safer,"" Emelia replied, her voice was still soft but more confident, as she positioned herself next to Rosa. She smelt heavily of lavender pillow mist and camomile tea, with a small hint of Captain Cecil‚Äôs cologne. Rosa stared at her as she took careful steps, ensuring she didn‚Äôt make a sound. Emelia often wore a fancy robe and nightgown that barely fit her, often hanging off her thin frame. Rosa, too, was in her nightwear, but she wore fluffy pink pyjamas and deck-ready boots. Her clothes were clean, mostly, other than a slight ketchup stain on her shirt. Not that she minded. Pyjamas were for comfort alone.

""Okay.""

""How was your day?""

""Long, as usual,"" Rosa smirked, returning her eyes to the darkness. ""The captain had me running around like I lost my head. Honestly, I don't know where most of these fuckers get their energy.""

As Emelia chuckled, toying with the edges of her nails. ""Coffee mostly. Captain Cecil managed to have it imported in the tonnes."" She turned her head slightly. ""Besides, aren't you just a translator?""

""I thought so, too."" Rosa snorted, ""But apparently, I'm also a busboy, a Stewart, a cook, a cleaner, a baker; all I need now is to start knitting,""¬†¬†

""Shit, knitting?"" Emelia giggled, brushing the sparse, dry hairs from her face before planting her palms firmly against the cold railing and sighing. ""Jonathan's a dick.""¬†

""Hmph."" Rosa's smile lowered slightly.

Silence crept from the depths, forming a cavern between them. Rosa leaned against the railings, lifting her head and devouring the salty air like fresh water on a hot day. The ship's steel creaked beneath her as she shifted her weight. Her long black coils were drenched in seawater as a few specks jumped over the sides. Emelia‚Äôs long copper-red hair was confined in a messy bun at the back of her head. Which meant the water brushed past her, coating her ears instead.

""Hey, Emi,"" Rosa whispered.

""Hm?""

""When you were back home in √Ålfurland, did your papa ever dance with you?""

Emelia glanced at her, confused, ""What?""

""When you were little,"" Rosa continued, her eyes lowering. ""Did your papa ever take you dancing or to kids' clubs or anything like that?""

""No."" Emelia snorted softly, ""Why do you ask?""

""I was just thinking.""

""Oh‚Ä¶"" Emelia twiddled her fingers, her eyes darting from the edges of the sea to the sky above. ""Did your papa take you to anything?""

""My papa took me dancing once a month as a kid,"" Rose replied as she lifted her head into the air again and leaned backwards, placing her weight onto her hips. ""It was something special we did together. I used to walk to the council building in my little blue dress and dainty shoes.‚Äù She smiled, lifting her eyes to face the moon. The wind felt like ice against her skin. The echoing sound of drums pounded inside her head as she allowed the memory to seep into her mind. ‚ÄúMama made the dress. It‚Äôs the most precious thing I own, not that I can use it.‚Äù Rosa whispered. ‚ÄúI can't dance anymore because I'm here and because I'm an adult. Because somehow, I'm less of a daughter."" She paused, ""I miss my parents; I-I know I'm older now, but things are hard. I keep having these moments of wanting to just give up. To go back home but never say the word and pretend this was all a bad dream. Y‚Äôknow?""¬†

Emelia nodded silently, her throat burning as she inhaled the air around her.

""Sorry, I shouldn't have unloaded on you like that.""

""I understand.""

Rosa leaned back in and faced Emelia. ""Really?""

""I felt the same. Not so much about my parents, they weren't around, but I did have someone who I was close to back home,"" Emelia murmured. ""Her name was Ms Williams. She took care of me, but she was in her eighties and couldn't do much for herself. Yet whenever I needed her, she was there."" She quietly huddled into herself. ‚ÄúAnd I was there for her. I used to fetch her food and grab her medicine. We needed each other.‚Äù Emelia‚Äôs eyes began to burn, ""She warned me about Jonathan, told me nothing good would happen, but here I am.""

Rosa sighed. ""Mama warned me about him too; she wanted me to become a translator with a firm instead of working for the Royal Navy."" She grinned lovingly as she took Emelia's hand, ""I guess we should‚Äôve listened.‚Äù

Emelia tangled her fingers in between Rosa's. ""I guess so."" She smiled softly before shifting the subject. ""Why did she want you to join a translating firm? Do they pay better?""

""Nah, but it's less‚Ä¶ Ca√≥tico."" Rosa paused. Her mind whirling as she attempted to translate the final word.

""What?""

""I forgot the word in common."" She covered her mouth as she began to laugh.

We currently rent in Old Town Alexandria (and love it!) for the good public transit and walkability (I‚Äôm disabled‚Ä¶more on that in a minute), but we want to buy and need a little help focusing our search. My disability makes it hard to get out and drive around neighborhoods, so maybe one of you kind redditors has a suggestion or two?

My disability causes extreme vision fatigue, so I rely on a combo of walking, easy public transit, and short/not complicated drives (think minimal turns/traffic) to do daily tasks, otherwise I‚Äôm housebound. I‚Äôm willing to live in a suburb, and am flexible on house vs. townhouse, but need to be very close to ‚Äôstuff‚Äô‚Ä¶ie. no 10 minute drive to get out of a subdivision, or zipping across 6 lanes of visually intensive traffic to complete basic tasks. We also have an academically inclined, sensitive kiddo entering 6th grade next year and have found the local elementary school here to be underwhelming. I don‚Äôt think that will improve with jr high.

Spouse works in western Alexandria a couple exits up 395 from the beltway, but also goes to other locations (Pentagon, Belvoir, Bolling, etc).

‚ÄôStuff‚Äô we like to get to includes book/board game stores, pool, library, aikido, music lessons, robotics club, green spaces, grocery/pharmacy. We  also like coffee, non-chain little restaurants, and heading into DC on occasion, though admittedly we don‚Äôt go downtown super often. I like that I easily can, though.

We checked out a Burke neighborhood recently for the schools, but it felt a bit too removed. At least for the house we looked at, it was a lengthy drive to get out of the subdivision, so was a no-go for me.

I suspect there are multiple areas that would work, it may come down to the location of specific properties relative to businesses I frequent, but can anyone suggest a couple neighborhoods that balance schools and ease of access for a limited driver without adding a soul crushing commute for spouse?

With Olympic Orchids you can get a 10 pack of 1ml oil samples for only $25 including shipping and tax which is a totally insane pricing structure IMO. So should we believe the hype? Let‚Äôs get into it!

*Likes*: green nature scents like pine, dirt, rain, woods, musk/skin, oil, hints of salt, and gourmands like fresh bread/mall pretzel.¬†

*Dislikes*:anything synthetic, rose, lilac, strong florals, jasmine, white florals, powder, patchouli, lily, incense, oakmoss, and did I mention patchouli?

*Method*: I do an initial sniff test, and then each fragrance gets a solo journey on my wrists for one day. I tend to sniff first and then look at the notes later, so apologies if some of this is not very exact.

**Blackbird:** I was very excited to try this one and all was going well initially: woody, ripe blackberries and a hint of forest. Suddenly and tragically, however, it went soapy. I‚Äôve heard other reviewers complain of a metallic note in this and while I wasn‚Äôt getting that exactly, there was something decidedly soapy to it which ruined my enjoyment. It smells almost exactly like an Herbal Essence's berry shampoo without the promised woody notes, and I ended up scrubbing (somewhat uselessly, since the sillage is a beast) a few hours later. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad per se, but I don‚Äôt really want to smell like children‚Äôs shampoo all day. Really glad I didn‚Äôt blind buy this one because tbh the notes make it sound perfect. ***Notes***\*: Himalayan blackberry fruit, dry grass and leaves, elemi, cedar wood and resin, woody-amber accord, fir balsam absolute, musk\*. 4/10

**Kingston Ferry:** I‚Äôm still very new to the world of indie fragrances and especially new to aquatics, so I‚Äôm not always sure what I‚Äôm smelling. This reads to me as a salty, fresh cologne with the prominent diesel stink that even my uncultured nose can pick out. The diesel is STRONG and it only becomes more defined over the dry down, along with some emerging mulchy notes. I don‚Äôt have too much to compare this to other than Pineward‚Äôs Coastal Veil which was much more of a 50/50 vegetal/medicinal situation. This is like high quality aftershave with‚Ä¶diesel. And you know what? I don‚Äôt hate it. Maybe that je ne sais quoi was actually diesel this whole time? Super interesting but not quite feminine or wearable enough for my everyday. ***Notes***\*\*: salt air, rhododendron, lavender, tarragon, chamomile, heather, cedar leaves, the sea-weathered wood pilings, diesel fuel (a botanical accord), seaweed, sun-dried driftwood, charred firewood\* 6/10\*

**Cafe V:** I tried, I really did, but much as I sniffed all I got was ‚Äúold leather couch‚Äù from this one. Just 100% leather couch.¬†Not much to add here. ***Notes:*** *espresso-roast coffee, dark cacao, vanilla, cream, spicy chai, cardamom, leather, and well-worn wood.* 4/10

**Carolina:** Right out of the bottle it‚Äôs a strong, sweet ‚Äúpurple‚Äù floral that smells a little bit like grape juice. Initially, there‚Äôs something sharp which anchors all the floaty florals. The grape juice fades and white floral scents emerge. Honeysuckle? (I checked the notes and yup, that‚Äôs honeysuckle dominating the second wave of smell, along with a bit of sharpness from the pine and some dusty sweetness from the hay.) My husband says ‚Äúmy mother had a perfume like that. It‚Äôs a nice smell.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing artificial or ""mature"" here, but it *reminds* me of something that *could* smell artificial (I suspect it‚Äôs the jasmine). While I was waffling around on whether I liked it or not, it faded away to a whisper on my skin, so the jury is still somewhat out. But if you do like florals, you will probably like this one. ¬†***Notes***\*: longleaf pine, hay absolute, magnolia, kudzu flower, tea, honeysuckle, star jasmine, vanilla, tonka, and tobacco leaf\*. 6/10

**Seattle Chocolate:** Goes on dark, almost bitter, and then immediately lightens on me to something powdery and faint with hints of‚Ä¶leather? This is not a sweet, gourmand scent at all although after a few hours I did detect a little bit of sweetness coming through. I thought the sillage was pretty weak but my husband commented ‚Äúyou really doused yourself today‚Äù and that I ‚Äúsmell like patchouli‚Äù so one of us is clearly lying, and it‚Äôs probably my nose. Either way, this is definitely an adult chocolate scent but not one that I‚Äôm drawn to. ¬†***Notes***\*: dark cacao, black Bourbon vanilla, sweet poplar bud, evergreen wood, oakmoss, gourmand musk, silver fir, and fir balsam absolute\* 5/10

**Chevalier Vert:** I thought I had already smelled the greenest green that had ever greened when I got a sample of Alkemia‚Äôs ‚ÄúVert Sur Le Vert,‚Äù but oh boy does this blow it out of the water. Intensely green and dry and even bitter, which, once I checked the scent notes, I realized was the rhubarb. There is absolutely no sweetness here - I feel like this is almost the ‚Äúanti-perfume.‚Äù Unfortunately my husband wrinkled his nose and said ‚Äútoo bitter‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think this will be wearable for me. Incredibly impressive though what Ellen Covey is doing and I respect it! ***Notes***\*: citrus, rhubarb, tomato leaf, armoise, violet leaf, violet, orris, and peony, Sichuan pepper, and soft woods\*. 7/10\*

**Night Flyer:** I don‚Äôt even know what to say about this that has not already been said, but YES it smells like a cave and YES I want to put this perfume on my body! I absolutely do not understand how she can make a perfume that smells‚Ä¶humid? Perfectly captures the soil and dampness of a cave, a staleness in the air, with an overripe fruit note in the background. Sillage is also a beast; I accidentally spilled half the test sample of this on my friend‚Äôs arm and it was so powerful it completely blocked out the scent of the pepperoni pizza in the oven. Is it ‚Äúmusty?‚Äù Maybe. But so are caves! Is it ‚Äúwearable?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know, but what I do know is that I need this in my life and will be full-sizing. ***Notes***\*: sandalwood, olibanum wood, vetiver, furry musk accord, wet earth, damp air, mineral notes, resins, leather, figs, banana, soft tropical fruits\*. 9/10

**Woodcut:** Oh my goodness‚Ä¶this is lovely. Fresh cut wood, sweet and golden, and something else I‚Äôm picking up in the opening - it‚Äôs not mint, but it‚Äôs a tiny bit sharp to counter all of the woody sweetness. I have read other reviews that said this turned caramel on the dry down, but this wasn‚Äôt my experience at all. Lovely sillage and projection and subtly wraps you in a cloud of fragrant wood cuttings.¬† I think this works really well with my skin and the notes just get warmer and cozier during the dry down. This is the gourmand of nature scents. My husband is generally ambivalent towards my weird fragrances but noted that he particularly likes this one and it smells ‚Äúlike a cedar sauna.‚Äù I put this on in the morning and 12 hours later I could still get little whiffs of it here and there. I think this would be a crowd-pleaser and will be full-sizing this one. ***Notes***\*: Fractional distillations of pine and cedar, oakwood absolute, tolu balsam, olibanum, caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla\*. 9/10

**Olympic Rainforest:** I adore earthy, wet notes and this was the scent that drew me to this house in the first place. On mail day, my initial impression was of a gloriously wet forest. I was SO disappointed though about a week later when I went to wear it on my skin and it turned into something aggressively piney in the same neighborhood as Pine Sol. Where are the wet notes? The mushroom accords? The loamy, muddy goodness of the forest floor? Is something wrong with my nose?? I do love a heavy slap of pine to the face, but not when I am expecting a damp forest floor. Going to return to this one and update my impressions/rating if anything changes.¬†

Updated review: I did another smell/wear test when I was not PMS-ing and this did actually smell different for me. Still heavy on the medicinal pine, but now with more body and darker forest dirt notes lurking beneath it. Still not quite the wet, loamy, mushroomy base that I wanted but firmly out of Pine Sol territory and quite pleasant. I‚Äôve never had this happen to me and a specific scent before, but it‚Äôs kind of wild how my perception of this smell changed over just a few days. Probably still not going to full size, but bumping up my rating accordingly.

Additional Note: I‚Äôve read a few reviews of this that complain that this doesn‚Äôt smell like a tropical rainforest, which I think is silly because the Olympic Rainforest is a temperate rainforest and a very different smell profile!!

¬†***Notes***\*: cedar leaves, green sword ferns, rhododendron, forest mushrooms, beebalm, myrtle, wildflowers, oakmoss, black spruce, balsam fir, Port Orford Cedar, earthy accord\*. 8/10

**Gujarat:** There‚Äôs a lot going on here and my initial thought was of spices, lime, some kind of soda and‚Ä¶plastic? My husband took a big sniff and said ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù and then circled back to take another sniff and specified that it was triple sec. This was not sweet or floral to my nose in the slightest so I was really surprised when I read that there was rose and jasmine in this, which for me usually dominate anything they‚Äôre in. This dried down to a lovely spicy musk which I would‚Äôve liked except for the fact that the plasticky note was still there 8 hours later. Is this the ‚Äúsmokey wood‚Äù note mentioned in the description but not explicitly in the scent notes? Perhaps we will never know. ***Notes***\*: saffron, tulsi, lime, tagetes, jasmine, rose, cardamom, cumin, fenugreek, ginger, curry leaf, turmeric, mango, spikenard, olibanum, vetiver, patchouli, choya loban, black agar, and sandalwood\*. 4/10

All in all, there were a few absolute standouts (Woodcut, Night Flyer), and not that many misses. From what I‚Äôve read, Olympic Orchids is a one-nose house, and that nose belongs to the very talented Dr. Ellen Covey. I really appreciate that these scents are more works of art than standard perfume, and that she doesn‚Äôt seem to soften any of the sharp edges for mass consumption. I know this won‚Äôt be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I‚Äôm a fan.",22,1741827289.0,Indiemakeupandmore,4,1.0,False
