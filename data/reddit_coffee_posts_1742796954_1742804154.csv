The coffee didn‚Äôt taste like it came from a dirty machine. It didn‚Äôt taste burnt, or like motor oil. It just tasted like coffee. Really good coffee. That‚Äôs insanely rare nowadays. 

The service was fantastic. The prices are almost as good as Tim‚Äôs. They use biodegradable plastic straws instead of paper ones.

The best part? It‚Äôs actually Canadian! Unlike Tim‚Äôs, it isn‚Äôt owned by an American company.

I feel ashamed for never having gone there before. I genuinely never want to go back to Tim‚Äôs or Starbucks again. Second Cup is better in every single way. 

If you guys haven‚Äôt been there, I strongly recommend it :)

A month ago, I decided to host the first **Side Quest Meetup: Creators & Career Shifters Circle** here in Bonn. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but it turned out to be a great evening of deep conversations, idea-sharing, and genuine connections. We had people from different backgrounds. Some working on side projects, some exploring new career paths, and some just curious about what‚Äôs next. The energy was what I had been looking for: friendly, supportive, and inspiring.

If you missed the first one, let me reintroduce myself. I moved to Bonn 4 years ago from Istanbul, currently a 32-year-old Software Engineer. Over time, I‚Äôve joined various expat groups and social meetups. Some were fun, some led to meaningful friendships, and some just faded away as people moved on. What I realized is that people connect best in spaces that have a solid, shared purpose whether it‚Äôs creativity, personal projects, career shifts, or simply exchanging experiences and passion.

Since I couldn‚Äôt find that kind of meetup in Bonn (at least in English), I decided to create one myself. **Side Quest** is a relaxed, creative gathering where we brainstorm, share feedback, and help each other refine our ideas. Whether you're exploring a new career path, developing a passion project, or just figuring out your next step, this is the place to connect, learn, and grow together.

üìç **Where?** James Joyce, Bonn  
üóìÔ∏è **When?** Monday, 31 March, 19:30  
‚òï **Language?** English‚Äîopen to everyone!

‚úÖ **Who is this for?**

* **Passionate minds** ‚Äì People working on something they deeply care about.
* **Side hustlers & creatives** ‚Äì Whether it‚Äôs a project, startup, or artistic endeavor.
* **Career shifters** ‚Äì Thinking about a change and looking for fresh perspectives.

What to Expect?

* Casual format that keeps things fun and productive.
* Honest, constructive feedback to help shape and strengthen ideas.
* A small group so everyone gets quality input and connection.
* A friendly, welcoming atmosphere‚Äîno pressure, just good conversation and collaboration.

I‚Äôd love to see some familiar faces from the last event and welcome new ones. If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, **drop a comment or DM me**. And if you're just up for a coffee and a chat, I‚Äôm always happy to meet new people in Bonn. üöÄ

1jiliu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1jiliu1/another_day_same_madness_different_scenery/,"Another Day, Same Madness, Different Scenery","we arrived. Pattaya. First impressions? It‚Äôs like someone took Las Vegas, threw in a beach, added a few confused retirees, and said, ‚ÄúHere, enjoy.‚Äù

The first thing that hit me? The heat. It wasn‚Äôt just hot, it was personal. The sun in Pattaya doesn‚Äôt just shine, it follows you like it has unfinished business.

Checked into my Airbnb, expecting a sleek getaway. Reality? A room that looked like the pictures were taken during its golden era, twenty renovations ago. But the host greeted me like I was family, and suddenly, I felt too guilty to complain. Hospitality so strong, it gaslit me into loving the place. 

Took a boat to Coral Island, dreaming of paradise. Instead, I arrived at a sunscreen scented battlefield of tourists, jet skis, and selfie sticks. The water was gorgeous, when you could see it between a hundred splashing feet. Tried snorkeling, but the fish looked at me like I owed them rent. Still, the seafood was fresh, the sun was hot, and I left with a tan that screamed, ‚ÄúI underestimated Thailand‚Äôs UV rays.‚Äù 

After that, I went to The Sanctuary of Truth, thinking it would be a quick temple visit. What I found was a giant wooden cathedral built by a philosopher with too much free time and an unlimited lumber budget. Every inch was carved with stories of life, death, and probably a few things lost in translation.""

After lunch, I went to Pattaya Floating Market, hoping for a peaceful boat ride. Instead, I got ambushed by souvenir sellers, nearly adopted by a coconut vendor, and left with a hat I didn‚Äôt need but was too polite to refuse.

I went back to the beach to sit and relax. I found a quiet spot, but the water had a color that made me wonder if Mother Nature accidentally spilled her morning coffee in it.

Walking Street at night was like a buffet where the food chooses you. Neon lights flickered, music blasted from every bar, and night shift romantics stood in formation like they were waiting for a job interview with the interview happening right there on the sidewalk.

Some girls leaned on bar stools, giving ""come here"" looks to anyone with a heartbeat and a wallet. Others pretended to check their phones, as if their long-lost billionaire boyfriend might suddenly text back. Meanwhile, the customers came in all types: some confused, some confident, and some already deep in negotiations like they were closing a business deal with a limited-time offer.

A few guys walked past, pretending they weren‚Äôt interested, only to return five minutes later, holding hands with their new ""soulmate."" Others skipped the process altogether, strolling out of bars with beers in one hand and a rental girlfriend in the other, as if they were part of some all inclusive package deal.

Pattaya was wild, hot, and full of surprises. It‚Äôs a place you won‚Äôt forget, whether you love it or not

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.

Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:¬†India,¬†Spanish,¬†Arabic, ¬†French, German,¬†Portuguese,¬†Russian,¬†Chinese,¬†Japanese, ¬†Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.

**Other IRL Products/Events**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu is a head sponsor at Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy, yes we have an energy drink, they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  
Kendu is also featuring on Florida Radio Stations:Revolution 93.5 and University of Miami Radio Station WVUM.

**Kendu Conquest**

Kendu Celt and Kendu GNX have teamed up and created a board game called ""Kendu Conquest"". This is an extremely well designed board game, which can be played with family or friends. Kendu once again showcases community spirit. Massive respect to those 2 Chads.

**Kendu Games**

Coop Velociraptor and a few other guys have been working on Kendu Games, whilst a lot of the game is still a secret. What we do know is that it is a 2D platform RPG and there are no crypto or NFTs in the game. The company will use a portion of net profits off of sales of the game to buy and hold Kendu (effectively a constantly growing burn wallet). This sounds like a great idea and the game will be available on Steam and it will be able to port to consoles. This will not be a blockchain game.

**A Few Interesting Ideas**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.  
Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )  
Skip the Five Guys and put the money into Kendu, $15 can easily become $15000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

I was getting my coffee from the coffee machine, i was on the phone ringing my mum, lost in all the learnings and awakenings i had in the past month (phew the month was crazy), i see from the corner of my eyes, someone beside me keeping his mug in the sink. I‚Äôm pretty sure he timed his presence in the coffee area. I turned my head to the right, it was him, looking straight in my eyes and smiling. The smile was not mechanical professional politeness, it was warm. My head couldn‚Äôt process what was going on, i was so zoned out, i looked straight in his eyes with a blank face for 2 seconds that felt too long, i just remember seeing the circle of his eyes. Then i composed myself, as i realised, he is smiling and i have to smile back, i smiled back faintly. But all throughout the moment, he had that same smile plastered. Like he didnt know himself how to react to that uncalled for stare that felt intense. I am sure, he noticed cuz you notice these things. Then my mum picked up and on the phone i said ‚Äúyeah i reached office‚Äù. He heard that too but he didnt know it was my mum.

I asked my brother and he said men don‚Äôt get acknowledged so often, so even a eye contact held for a moment longer feels like validation. Especially if hes a man in his 50s, he said they dont get much attention from younger woman, so everything feels like a moment for him.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

This weekend was insane! Friday i went out with a group of friends, and attended a high end restaurant, and ended up at a bar afterwords drinking until about 5 in the morning. Saturday i was out with my in laws, and again a nice restaurant, cocktails afterwards, etc. the 3 kg gained between saturday and sunday is of course not just fat, but i am guessing a lot of water that will also come off soon.

Honestly i am most of all just amazed at how much just 2 days of going at it, can affect you. Luckily it has not made me loose my motivation, and as of yesterday(sunday) I am back at it with just OMAD.

Stay safe out there!

1jilal3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jilal3/food_symbolism_and_emotional_intimacy_seasons_1_2/,Food Symbolism and Emotional Intimacy (seasons 1 & 2),"I just watched all of Severance this weekend and want to talk about some themes I noticed!

Food in Severance is used as symbolism for emotional connection. Additionally, the noted lack of it is used to identify emotional disconnect. The control of food by Lumen parallels how the company attempts to control relationships.

Here, I will discuss notable scenes in S1 and S2 revolving around food and what this can tell us about the relationships of the characters involved.

# Foodless Dinner Party

‚Äú*I think the lack of food has already allowed us to \[dig in\] on a much deeper (emotional) level.*‚Äù - Ricken

The foodless dinner party is an imitation of human connection. Everyone gathers around the table and pretends they all care for one another, but the space on their plates is just air and so are their words professing understanding and empathy. Despite the subject being his life, Mark does not connect emotionally with the people there.

Immediately after, Devon serves Mark food. They have a close sibling relationship and Devon cares about Mark, understanding that the dinner party sucked and asking about his welfare. Mark however is evasive to Devon‚Äôs attempt at closeness, both in terms of dialogue and in his eating habits. He drinks alcohol to numb the pain of emotional discomfort and picks at the food he receives. 

[Mark picks at his food and admits he is not going to therapy](https://preview.redd.it/o2ubvf1a6lqe1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=83dcd6553daf09f65913ea8d3288718ba89c554b)

# Petey‚Äôs desire for connection

Lumen has handed Mark a coupon for a food service at an establishment the company owns. Mark goes to the restaurant, but does not eat there. He rebuffs Cobel‚Äôs attempt to talk with him and refers to Petey‚Äôs arrival as ‚Äú*the food just arrived*‚Äù.

Petey is a personal friend of i!Mark‚Äôs. When Petey meets with o!Mark, Mark starts to become more emotionally invested in the life that he has severed himself from.

When Petey explains his integration in Mark‚Äôs basement, he is eating pizza. He is being emotionally vulnerable and talks about his daughter. Mark however, does not eat the pizza and refuses to consider integration for himself.

Petey collapses in a convenience store. On top of the reintegration process, he‚Äôs probably also tired, thirsty, hungry from walking all day. Realistically, he doesn‚Äôt have money to pay for the food. However he says, ‚Äú*I can‚Äôt eat with no tokens.*‚Äù

Lumen has made food simple, bland, and transactional. The lasting trauma of being their employee has made it so while he is physically present in a room full of food, he has a mental block that prevents him from eating (stealing) the food. Ultimately, he dies either from medical issues or corporate assassination, but metaphorically Petey dies because he‚Äôs socially isolated and Mark is unable to connect with him.

During Petey‚Äôs funeral, Mark drinks wine and still tries to repress his feelings.

# Dating Alexa

During their first date, they sit at a restaurant with sterile-white empty plates and Mark drinks. The seats and plates next to them are empty. We do not see any food. Alexa talks about compartmentalizing human relationships (‚Äú*You could have a girlfriend at lumen and not know it. And if you met someone out here, you wouldn‚Äôt know it in there.*‚Äù) and the camera shot goes to Mark‚Äôs refilled alcoholic drink. Mark responds with ‚Äúfor some people, it‚Äôs the point.‚Äù and immediately drinks.

The second date shows Mark openly eating food, and talking about his late-wife. Seats are filled with people who are also eating food. They form a connection and spend the night together.

Then they break up in an empty kitchen.

When Alexa retrieves her food, Mark eats chips and drinks alcohol. He again tries to suppress his grief over Gemma. Despite eating, he sabotages his relationship. **The quality of food connects to the quality of the relationship.** 

# Neighborly Cookies

Cobel attempts to build a relationship with Mark and get to know his secrets under the guise of being a good neighbor and bringing Mark cookies. This is not a genuine human connection.¬†

Mark, out of social politeness, eats Cobel‚Äôs cookies but doesn‚Äôt enjoy it and he keeps his emotional guard up. **The enjoyment of food connects to the enjoyment and willingness of emotional connection.**

Cobel is not a good chef and some of her baking attempts end up with burnt cookies. We know the inside of her fridge is extremely disorganized with half-eaten takeout food. Cobal is not good at forming authentic relationships.

She pours herself a glass of milk and watches Mark from her window. This is something she seems to habitually do: watch Mark leave for work or watch him drink himself to sleep in front of the television. Just as she is a neighbor voyeur watching him try to drown his sorrows, she monitors his actions and relationships as his boss.

# Cobel and Motherhood

Cobel is able to get close with Devon by pretending to be some sort of nurturer(?). She brings shea butter and calms the baby Ellanore. Right after Cobel guides Devon on breastfeeding, we have a hard scene jump of the two women laughing and enjoying each other's company. They then talk about Mark and how he is dealing with Gemma‚Äôs death.

When Cobel confronts Sissy about killing her mother, she references something about pulling ‚Äòthe tube from her gullet‚Äô, which makes me think the mother was killed by removing the feeding tube. I think Cobel is pretty strongly linked with motherhood since she acts as an authoritative guiding figure and has invented the chip, thus allowing for the creation of all the innies. But that‚Äôs a different post for a different day.

# Birth and Food

When Devon gives birth at the cabin, Ricken hangs kelp, which is often a food ingredient. (It‚Äôs also a natural green plant, which connects with some color theory symbolism). He and Mark have a slight, genuine ‚Äòreal talk‚Äô moment where Ricken acknowledges Mark‚Äôs lack of interest in him.

Devon also meets the senator‚Äôs wife while she searches for coffee. I‚Äôm not a big coffee drinker, so I think it‚Äôs very surprising for a woman in active labor to go out on a winter night in search of coffee, but I‚Äôm sure some people are really like that. Thematically, the choice of coffee is interesting, because it‚Äôs a very corporate, non-nutritious drink. Devon‚Äôs interaction with the senator‚Äôs wife is without depth and takes place when the wife is lowkey ‚Äòworking‚Äô.

# The Waffle Party

The waffle meal includes a glass of milk. When Cobel brings cookies to Mark, they pour some milk. Cobel drinks milk while she watches Mark. Cobel bonds with Devon through breastfeeding. Interestingly enough, the waffle scene is also paired with Cobel breaking down after being fired. 

I think the specific **use of milk is a power play**, used to bring to mind unequal relationships, often like that of a parent and child. The idea of a waffle party for an employee is condescending to begin with. Then things get explicitly domination/submission with the empty plate commanding Dylan to get on a bed that has a cat o‚Äônine tails with the nine values engraved on it.

# Lumen and Control of Food

Lumen treats physical human connection (congratulatory handshakes, comforting hugs) like how they treat **food: a regulated, transactional offering** to the employee in order to make them content.

An employee is allowed two tokens per day to receive simple corporate looking snacks from the vending machine. To reward an employee, food parties and vouchers are given. Milchick punishes his employees by ruining marshmallows. Lumen provides lunches, although we never see what they are. I believe those lunches are equally bland and generic.

Food is ‚Äòsanitized‚Äô in this way to force a corporate ‚Äòblankness‚Äô over its employees. This could be because unique foods can trigger memories in people. I think psychologically, Lumen picks out specific types of **foods to enforce white corporate culture dominance**.¬†

This idea mainly comes from me thinking that a waffle party with maple syrup and milk is a very specific idealisation of American breakfast given to a young school student. Like, based on how the company treats Milchick and Natalie, I don‚Äôt think the company kitchens are creating tikka masala or enchiladas for lunch. In fact, the food that Gemma eats looks like varying flavors of molded jello. It‚Äôs possible that lunch for other employees is also flavored jello, which makes the waffle party all the more special. ‚ÄòReward food‚Äô may be one of the only times the innies eat meals that look like normal food.

[Lumen using a lunch menu as a way to signal Milchick‚Äôs performance review will go badly.](https://preview.redd.it/c610d99f8lqe1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad6507230ccccdad62753bc2f01a3a239aaaa600)

Honestly though, I don‚Äôt think Lumen focuses on fruit because of a breakfast theme. I think **fruit is an artificial attempt at human connection**. Lumen sends out raw fruit for parties and gifts to make the employee feel the transaction is as natural and healthy as the food provided. However, this food offering comes from cold calculation, not genuine emotion. Milchick‚Äôs apologetic fruit basket is carefully arranged. Most of the party fruit is cut up to be the shape that Lumen wants instead of remaining that shape that it naturally grows in.

There‚Äôs also some pineapple-specific symbolism that isn‚Äôt directly linked with human connection, although possibly with asexual reproduction/propagation.

[Did anyone else become disappointed when this ‚Äòmelon ball‚Äô ended up not being the perfectly round sphere they expected? A subtle hint to Lumen‚Äôs lies.](https://preview.redd.it/5qkvrdgi8lqe1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8677c8f554d69efb28313b78fb28f2659a120c)

# The Specific usage of Eggs

‚Äú*Yeah, the egg bar is coveted as fuck.*‚Äù

Eggs are prepared in a few different ways in Severance.

Deviled eggs are used in the pre-waffle party. Irving chooses his personal relationships over Lumen and, in an act of rebellion and contempt, smashes a deviled egg in a Lumen-bible. Mark and Helly eat deviled eggs and admit they are nervous about working overtime.¬†

When Malchik meets Helena, he attempts to get closer to her by talking about how her father drinks raw eggs. It‚Äôs pretty ‚Äòbro-health-guru‚Äô to drink three raw eggs for breakfast, so this line primes us about Jame Eagan‚Äôs personality. It also matches with Lumen‚Äôs usage of raw fruit.

In S2E9, we get an eating scene with Helena and Jame that tells a lot about their relationship. Helena carefully cuts, arranges, and dissects an unseasoned boiled egg. Jame drinks from his cup and seems to forlornly moan in jealousy at Helena‚Äôs ability to eat.

‚Äú*I wish you‚Äôd take \[the eggs\] raw*,‚Äù is the only thing Jame says. It‚Äôs a very cold interaction between father and daughter.

This scene is about the control in Helena‚Äôs and Jame‚Äôs relationship. On the surface, Helena seems to be under Jame‚Äôs control. She is performing breakfast so that her father can watch her eat like a voyeur. Once he expresses dissatisfaction at her meal, she no longer keeps up the pretense of eating.¬†

However, Helena shows some rebellion in how she eats. She uses egg pieces to cover the plate image of two men disciplining a child. She uses a boiled egg instead of a raw egg. She cuts up her food in tiny little bites and eats slowly.

Helena‚Äôs exacting table manners mimics that of an eating disorder ritual, where a person will precisely arrange and cut up their food as that is the only thing they have control of in their life/situation. Eating disorders can also stem from difficult family relationships, as children battle with their parents over control of what they should eat. Helena does not have an ED, but she is subtly fighting with her father over her autonomy.

# Integration and Vulnerability

Reghabi offers a path for Mark‚Äôs integration. However, doing this requires trust and emotional vulnerability. When Reghabi and Mark progress in the integration, food is involved. Examples:

* Emotionally reeling from Reghabi‚Äôs murder of Graner, Mark throws up food.
* After Mark undergoes reintegration, recuperating from the procedure seems to involve pills and drinking some funky looking liquid.
* Mark and Reghabi, who is putting away food, have a conversation about how his integration process is going and Mark asks, ‚Äú*You good on snacks?*‚Äù, revealing he cares about her comfort.
* Mark and Reghabi talk about Gemma while Mark drinks something from a mug.
* Reintegration makes a person hungry.
* When Mark announces that he‚Äôs ready to go a step further for reintegration, Reghabi is eating icing.
* The first sign of i!Mark‚Äôs reintegration process is when the contents of the work fridge and his home fridge mix

[i!Mark looking in the work fridge and seeing food from his home](https://preview.redd.it/wf18oggv8lqe1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc272aa529daf061ad44e10c265a04ccf52e9ae6)

# Mark and Helena

When Mark eats his fill at the Asian restaurant (which possibly reminds him of his late-wife), Helena introduces herself. There‚Äôs this very interesting shot of Helena and Mark across from each other with a background of empty plates. Mark has eaten food, but Helena has not. In the conversation, Helena is guarded and covertly apologises for sleeping with Mark. Mark is much more open and flirts with Helena, possibly influenced by i!Mark‚Äôs feelings for Helly.

[Helena attempts to establish a relationship with Mark but does not want to be vulnerable](https://preview.redd.it/xvz3td6f9lqe1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=422a29cfe6b80dc8f5a6fb50f6ae08d3701fbe42)

# Miscellaneous Food Mentions

* Everyday, o!Irving brews coffee and attempts to communicate with i!Irving through painting and sleep-deprivation
* ‚Äú*What‚Äôs for dinner, kids?*‚Äù is a way Irving attempts to form closeness with his coworkers
* o!Dylan‚Äôs first date with his wife was over Thai food
* Irving bonds with Burt over food. Irving also attends a dinner party with Burt and his husband where they eat food and reveal hidden histories
* Both the retirement party and the funeral party use watermelons carved into the image of the departed‚Äôs head. This is eaten by the surviving coworkers.¬†
* After Dylan stares at Irving‚Äôs watermelon head, he uncovers Irving‚Äôs directions to the Exports Room.
* When Helly is newly severed, she asks if she is being used as livestock, and honestly, yeah. We know the company treats their employees terribly in order to gain power.¬†
* At the melon ball party, Mark and Helly bond while they eat food.
* At Pip‚Äôs, Devon and Mark argue about the possibility that Gemma is alive. The talk becomes hostile and Mark leaves in anger before food is served.
* A warning sign of Mark‚Äôs seizure is an inability to grab a glass of water
* A scene in the dead wife montage is Mark, Gemma, Devon, and Ricken having a meal together. Gemma subtly informs Devon that she‚Äôs pregnant because she passed on wine.
* When Mark and Gemma fight, Mark is seen preparing a sandwich but he is not shown eating it.
* When Gemma tells Dr. Mauer that she wants to leave, she seems to be placing a plate of unfinished food down on the counter.
* Cobel enters the diner on her hometown and there‚Äôs some food interaction with the locals.
* A certificate in Cobel's shrine apparently mentions condiments?

A sign of Gretchen‚Äôs rocky relationship with o!Dylan:

* Gretchen: ‚Äú*And did you do the cookies for Jim‚Äôs class? It‚Äôs our week for cookies.*‚Äù
* o!Dylan: ‚Äú*I did not do the cookies. Sorry.*‚Äù
* Gretchen: ‚Äú(muttering) *That‚Äôs funny. It‚Äôs a tube and you just need to slice them and then you put them in the oven.*‚Äù

Anyways, those are my initial thoughts about food. I just jotted a few things down, so isn't really a refined essay. I'm excited to hear what other people's interpretations are. ",1,1742801869.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

1jil9tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1jil9tk/tips_for_shooting_local_concert_gigs_for/,Tips for shooting local concert gigs for university project,"Hey y'all, usually I'm a lurker here and I need some tips on shooting film at local concert gigs for a university project. I have a Nikon EM with a 50mm lens and an SB-E flash (that I would prefer not to use because I don't want to accidentally blind someone temporarily), which basically limits me to a max 1600 ISO and aperture priority or a shutter speed of 1/90 and figuring the aperture myself on the spot. The venue that I'm going to is pretty small (its a coffee shop that host local bands/punk gigs) and has consistent lighting (i.e., basically one color lighting that switches every now and then with no strobing lights).

As for film, should I...

* shoot 400 ISO black and white at 1600 ISO and push it 2 stops
* shoot 3200 ISO black and white at 1600 ISO and pull it by 1 stop
* shoot 800 ISO cinestill/some repackaged movie film at 800 speed and have the lab develop it normally and hope for the best
* shoot 800 ISO cinestill at 1600 speed and push it by 1 stop

Tips, tricks, and advice are appreciated! Thanks y'all!

P.S. For those who say to shoot digital because getting good concert/music gig photos on film is basically like capturing a unicorn, unfortunately I don't own a DSLR. Shocking!

1jil7c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jil7c5/t64_ssp_burrs_carriers/,T64 SSP burrs carriers,"Been looking for a good value variable rate grinder for espresso and filter. Considered the DF64V but stumbled upon this T64 grinder. Did a bit of research and saw a few reviews. Thought it was good value. 

When it arrived, I naively thought I could swap out stock burrs with MP SSP since they were both 64mm.
Turns out they need specific burr carriers for SSPs 

I've since contacted the supplier to see if they can source them (last weekend so still awaiting).

Doing some trusty googling ,I contacted a few other suppliers abroad in Singapore but for some reason they were very obtrusive.  Stating they only sell the carriers to people who purchased grinders from them and then when I asked if I could contact manufacturer directly, they brushed me off saying don't bother they only deal with us not you.( From a customer service POV , complete fail)

I'm still awaiting a response from the UK supplier (hopefully I get good news but not holding my breath) 
Somehow I'm regretting the choice of taking a chance on a non-mainstream grinder. Should've just got the df64v . :')

I have already gotten a D in the past and when I decided to retake it I swore to my advisor that I would put 120% into it. *Even the professor who teaches the course advised I took a different course to fulfill my degree requirement.* I have tried so many different methods to actually sit down and study (it's a comparative endocrinology course). Studying at home, at the school library, at the public library, at coffee shops, and I always end up just staring at the screen or mindlessly scrolling through the same course website for hours at a time.

I am **fully aware** that I'm behind on my schoolwork and constantly remind myself of this fact throughout the day.

My psychiatrist has prescribed three different stimulants after adderall gave me a panic attack and full break down. The rest did nothing. If anything, I just go straight to sleep without realizing it. I've woken up multiple times on my desk in the middle of the night and just move myself to bed.

Time to rethink things.  I'm already on 3mg juice, perhaps try and cut down further?  At the min I'm restricting myself to have 5 puffs every hour and see how that goes.

I noticed that when I‚Äôm aligned with higher energies I experience much more synchronicities, higher the inner energies and bigger the synchronicity, this time was a small one but that could lead to a bigger one.

I was working in Camden in a cafe‚Äô inside the market and on Saturday a freelance barista shows up for the day to help, at first I thought was a customer and when I asked if he wanted a coffee he tells me that was there to work, nice guy but the interesting part was that he got a full time job for a coffee company that does events around the world included Asia one of my favourite part of the world, he tells me that with his company he spent a lot of time in different Asian countries and that normally they tell to their baristas few months in advance if they are willing to go for a month or more to work anywhere around this crazy planet, you can imagine the joy to know it because that would be the perfect job for me, working in coffee and being in different place of Asia but with the freedom to move around and don‚Äôt have to be stucked in one place, this is something I was thinking about it recently and this is one of the synchronicities, how to be able to work in coffee in Asia but able to stay freelance, this is the answer.

We aren‚Äôt done yet because the day after going to the gym in Sheperd Bush that is in west London early in the morning before work who is there working out? The same guy from the day before in Camden that is in North London, quite far from where I was, I see him and he see me and we have a small chit chat, for me this is a strong sign that I‚Äôm heading in the right direction, don‚Äôt know how it will unfold but no need to push anything because trying to control what is happening is like a sign saying you don‚Äôt trust the process, actions are needed obviously but only when it‚Äôs done going with the flow.

She is insanely beautiful and totally out of my league. However, I still tried pursuing her anyways, I asked her to be my project partner for an assignment and she began to take an interest in me. She added me on instagram and seemed really impressed by my intelligence. 

Recently, I asked her for coffee as a sort-of date testing the waters kinda thing, but I didnt specify date. She was quick to say yes and we went for coffee together on the wknd. There she asked why I had invited her and I just straight up said ""I like you."" and confirmed I wanted this to be a date. 

She said she liked me as well but ""lets do friendship first."" She explained that her ex boyfriend followed her across country to the city we are studying in. They broke up because he was insanely controlling and they had orginally got together because he was rich and paid her to do his homework. However, she got sick of his abuse and tried to move on. Now, he has been messaging her and harrassing her. She said she didnt want to involve me in any of the drama and that she is scared of her ex's reaction if she dates someone else. 

I just told her that friendship is fine and I connected with her by sharing my own relationship traumas. I told her that she is smart enough to make her own decisions but she shouldnt let her life be ruled by him. Overall we connected very well and talked effortlessly and deeply for hours. She mentioned that previous dating app dates were too shallow for her and that this was nice. 

Everyday since then my feelings for her are growing deeper but I don't want to step on her boundaries. I don't know what to do here. I am so into her and want her ex to just leave her alone. Its painful not being able to explore the connection we have made because of some psycho loser.

Sugar alternatives have ruled the health universe, and atop the pack are stevia and maple syrup. But when making the choice of the best natural sweetener, which one do you use? Is stevia perfect for weight loss? Does maple syrup actually have health advantages? Can diabetics safely consume either?

In this ultimate stevia vs. maple syrup review, we will break down their nutrition, health benefits, glycemic index, and ideal uses so that you can make the right choice for your sweet tooth!

# What Is Stevia and Maple Syrup?

Before diving into the comparison, let‚Äôs understand what these two sweeteners are

# What Is Stevia?

Stevia is a [natural, zero-calorie sweetener ](https://zindagistevia.com/zero-calorie-natural-sweeteners/?v=f9f0a42f293e)derived from Stevia rebaudiana plant leaves. Stevia is said to be between 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, so minimal amounts are used to achieve the desired result. Stevia can be found in powder, liquid, or granulated form, which makes it a popular choice for those wishing to cut sugar consumption.



# What Is Maple Syrup?

Maple syrup is a thick, amber-colored plant sweetener derived from the sap of sugar maple trees. Stevia contains no calories or natural sugars, whereas maple syrup contains natural sugars and minerals like zinc and manganese. Maple syrup comes in different grades with the darker syrups offering a stronger maple flavor.

# Stevia vs. Maple Syrup: Nutritional Comparison

Let‚Äôs compare the nutritional profiles of stevia and maple syrup to understand which one fits your health goals better.

https://preview.redd.it/3zxobdt68lqe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5237e4e23ffb036106656430ccf8ccd9a7b005a

  
We can tell from the table that stevia is a zero-sugar, zero-calorie sweetener, which is a perfect option for someone who needs to lose weight or has diabetes. Maple syrup, however, offers natural sugars and trace minerals, so it is a relatively healthier option than white sugar.

# Stevia vs. Maple Syrup Health Benefits

Both sweeteners provide their own array of health benefits. Let‚Äôs see what they are.

# Health Benefits of Stevia

https://preview.redd.it/1hmzue13zkqe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b2eef234a705a0a3ac78a3eead6749769772f3b

1. Zero Calories & No Sugar ‚Äì Ideal for weight management.
2. Controls Blood Sugar ‚Äì It can be taken by diabetics safely
3. Can Lower Blood Pressure ‚Äì Studies show that [stevia decreases blood pressure](https://zindagistevia.com/managing-blood-sugar-naturally-with-zindagi-stevia/?v=f9f0a42f293e)
4. Encourages Oral Health ‚Äì Stevia doesn't cause cavities like sugar

# Health Benefits of Maple Syrup

https://preview.redd.it/v3ufvo570lqe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f646f72492181104943f07bf6771fdbaa747cea

1. Rich in Antioxidants ‚Äì Contains polyphenols that fight inflammation
2. Nutrient-Dense ‚Äì Loaded with essential minerals like zinc, manganese, and calcium
3. Less Glycemic Effect Than Sugar ‚Äì Though still high, it's a little healthier than refined sugar
4. More Natural & Unprocessed ‚Äì If you would rather use pure maple syrup

While stevia wins the award as a zero-calorie sugar alternative, maple syrup has a nutritional quality that is missing in regular sugar.

# Which Is Healthier: Stevia or Maple Syrup?

The selection is determined by your health goals:

1. For weight loss: Stevia is the winner because it has zero calories and no sugar.
2. For diabetics: Stevia wins again with its glycemic index of 0, meaning it won't increase blood sugar.
3. For overall nutrition: Maple syrup wins out over the competition with its antioxidants and minerals but still needs to be consumed in moderation.

If you need a completely sugar-free alternative, then stevia is the clear winner. But if you want a[ less-processed, natural sweetener](https://zindagistevia.com/products/?v=f9f0a42f293e) that contains some nutrients, maple syrup is a better choice than table sugar.

# Best Coffee and Tea Sugar Substitute: Stevia or Maple Syrup?

Both have advantages and disadvantages when it comes to adding sweetness to your morning tea or coffee.

# Stevia in Coffee & Tea:

* No calorie addition
* Has a slightly bitter aftertaste

# Maple Syrup in Coffee & Tea:

* Contributes a deep, caramel-like flavor
* Adds sugar and calories

But if you want to keep calories to a minimum, stevia would be the ideal option. Otherwise, maple syrup can be your wonderful natural sweetener if you enjoy a rich flavor and have no issues taking extra sugar.

# Can Diabetics Use Maple Syrup Instead of Stevia?

Diabetics need to watch their sugar. Although maple syrup is more natural than table sugar, it also has a high glycemic index (54) and can elevate blood sugar.  
Stevia, however, has¬†***a glycemic index of 0***, so it‚Äôs¬†***much safer for diabetics***.  


# Verdict

Stevia is the safer choice for diabetics since it will not increase blood sugar levels.

# Stevia vs. Maple Syrup for Weight Loss

If you're trying to lose weight, you need to choose the correct sweetener.



* Stevia: No carbs, no sugar, and won't add up to weigh you down.
* Maple Syrup: Calories and sugar that can add up if used frequently.

To reduce weight, stevia is the choice.

# Is Maple Syrup a Good Sugar or Stevia Alternative?

Yes, but with care. Maple syrup is a superior substitute for white sugar since it contains some vitamins and antioxidants. But it‚Äôs not as great as stevia for those going sugar-free.  
If you want a natural, unprocessed sweetener, maple syrup is an acceptable option‚Äîbut if you want a low-calorie,¬†[sugar-free sweetener, stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/products/?v=f9f0a42f293e)¬†is preferable.

# Final Verdict: Stevia vs. Maple Syrup ‚Äì What to Choose?

https://preview.redd.it/w9g0q6x24lqe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc1504ebfa57b2098d651e159e5edd0a14ced41e

* **For weight loss?**¬†‚Äì Stevia
* **For diabetics?**¬†‚Äì Stevia
* **For minerals & antioxidants?**¬†‚Äì Maple Syrup
* **For taste in coffee & tea?**¬†‚Äì Depends on preference
* **For baking?**¬†‚Äì Maple syrup (better texture) 

If you desire¬†***a sugar-free, low-calorie, and diabetic-friendly alternative, stevia***¬†is the best natural option. If you would like a natural, less-processed option with some health advantages, maple syrup is a superior option to refined sugar.

‚ÄúStevia or Maple Syrup ‚Äîboth have their perks! Choose what suits your lifestyle and taste. For a zero-calorie, guilt-free sweetness,¬†[**Zindagi Stevia**](https://zindagistevia.com/?v=f9f0a42f293e)¬†has you covered!‚Äù",1,1742800786.0,u_Active_Career2911,0,1.0,False

\*\*How to Choose Fishing Waders: Waterproof Bootfoot Chest Waders 2-Ply 420D Nylon/PVC Duck Hunting Wader for Men and Women\*\*

Fishing waders are an essential piece of gear for any angler, whether you're wading into a river for trout or navigating a marsh for duck hunting. The right pair of waders can make all the difference in your comfort, safety, and overall fishing experience. In this article, we‚Äôll dive into the key factors to consider when choosing the perfect pair of fishing waders, specifically focusing on the \*\*Waterproof Bootfoot Chest Waders 2-Ply 420D Nylon/PVC Duck Hunting Wader\*\* by KyleBooker, a trusted name in high-quality fishing gear.

\### 1. \*\*Material Matters: 2-Ply 420D Nylon/PVC\*\*  
The material of your waders is one of the most critical factors to consider. KyleBooker‚Äôs waders are crafted from \*\*2-ply 420D nylon/PVC\*\*, a durable and lightweight material that offers excellent waterproofing and breathability. The 2-ply construction ensures double-layer protection, making these waders resistant to punctures, abrasions, and tears, even in rugged environments. The 420D nylon provides a balance between strength and flexibility, allowing you to move freely while staying protected from the elements.

PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is known for its waterproof properties, making it an ideal material for waders. This combination of nylon and PVC ensures that the waders are not only waterproof but also highly durable, capable of withstanding the rigors of both fishing and hunting.

\### 2. \*\*Bootfoot Design: Convenience and Comfort\*\*  
One of the standout features of KyleBooker‚Äôs waders is the \*\*bootfoot design\*\*. Unlike stockingfoot waders, which require separate wading boots, bootfoot waders come with integrated boots, making them a convenient and time-saving option. The boots are typically made from durable rubber, providing excellent traction on slippery surfaces like rocks, mud, or riverbeds.

The bootfoot design is particularly advantageous for anglers who frequently transition between different terrains. The integrated boots are designed to fit snugly, reducing the risk of water seeping in and ensuring a comfortable fit throughout your fishing or hunting expedition.

\### 3. \*\*Chest-High Coverage: Maximum Protection\*\*  
Chest-high waders, like the ones offered by KyleBooker, provide maximum protection by covering your entire lower body up to your chest. This design is ideal for deep wading, allowing you to venture into deeper waters without worrying about getting wet. Chest-high waders are also versatile, suitable for a variety of fishing environments, from shallow streams to deeper lakes and rivers.

The chest-high design also offers additional storage options, with multiple pockets for carrying essential gear like tackle boxes, knives, or even a thermos of coffee. This added functionality makes KyleBooker‚Äôs waders a practical choice for both casual anglers and serious hunters.

\### 4. \*\*Waterproof and Breathable: Stay Dry and Comfortable\*\*  
One of the most important features of any wader is its ability to keep you dry. KyleBooker‚Äôs waders are designed with \*\*100% waterproof materials\*\*, ensuring that no water seeps in, even during prolonged use. The 2-ply construction adds an extra layer of protection, making these waders highly resistant to leaks.

At the same time, breathability is crucial to prevent overheating and discomfort, especially during long fishing trips. The 420D nylon/PVC material used in KyleBooker‚Äôs waders strikes the perfect balance between waterproofing and breathability, allowing moisture to escape while keeping water out.

\### 5. \*\*Durability and Longevity\*\*  
Fishing and hunting can be tough on gear, so durability is a key consideration when choosing waders. KyleBooker‚Äôs waders are built to last, with reinforced seams and high-quality materials that can withstand the wear and tear of outdoor activities. The 2-ply 420D nylon/PVC construction ensures that these waders are resistant to punctures and abrasions, making them a reliable choice for even the most demanding conditions.

\### 6. \*\*Versatility: Suitable for Men and Women\*\*  
KyleBooker‚Äôs waders are designed to be versatile, catering to both men and women. The adjustable straps and ergonomic design ensure a comfortable fit for a wide range of body types. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned angler or a beginner, these waders offer the perfect combination of comfort, protection, and functionality.

\### 7. \*\*Ease of Maintenance\*\*  
Maintaining your waders is essential to ensure their longevity. KyleBooker‚Äôs waders are easy to clean and maintain, thanks to their durable and water-resistant materials. Simply rinse them off after use and store them in a cool, dry place to prevent mold and mildew.

\### Conclusion  
Choosing the right fishing waders is crucial for a successful and enjoyable fishing or hunting experience. KyleBooker‚Äôs \*\*Waterproof Bootfoot Chest Waders 2-Ply 420D Nylon/PVC Duck Hunting Wader\*\* offers a perfect blend of durability, comfort, and functionality. With their high-quality materials, bootfoot design, and chest-high coverage, these waders are an excellent investment for any angler or hunter. Whether you‚Äôre wading through a river or navigating a marsh, KyleBooker‚Äôs waders will keep you dry, comfortable, and ready for your next adventure.

Two weeks ago, I went to a networking event organised by my University where engineers would come in an conduct mock interviews with students. 

There was a man there who was the technical director of a major Civil Engineering consultancy. We had a really good conversation and he ended up giving me his email and told me to keep in touch. The next day, I sent him my CV, thinking that I had nothing to lose by doing so.

Tuesday last week I get a reply back saying that he'd love for me to come in and meet some of his team on Thursday. I didn't really know what to expect from this, because it wasn't really an interview, we just got coffee at a cafe by the office. They seemed to be really trying to sell the company to me and were asking me questions like when would I be able to start, and would I be keen to travel for work. This was really cool as what they were talking about is literally my dream job in the field that I am most interested in.

I thought the meeting went pretty well, and they said they'd be in touch. I know it's only been two business days since the meeting, but it's kinda stressing me out that I haven't heard back from them. I guess I just don't really know where I stand with the company. The official graduate programme only opened a week ago. What's going on? Should I get my hopes up? I'm kind of assuming that this isn't standard procedure, especially for an international company like this.

I have had Vietnamese iced coffee at a couple of cafes, of blue tokai and third wave.

I have been trying to replicate that, but I always feel like mine is a watered down version.

Latest experiment I tried with a 16:160 ratio of beans to water in the aeropress, and added about a 100 grams of ice to chill it down.

The amount of condensed milk as well, I started with 17 grams (was aiming for 15, but overshot it initially).
Didn't have the milk coming through in flavour and texture, so I bumped it up to 25.

This is getting close, but how do I get the last 15% or so.

Julia looked at Omsarch, the Ranorar Ambassador as a nearly apologetic smile spread across his face in response to her question. ‚ÄúThat is the gist of it, from what I understand. I‚Äôm over-simplifying by a couple of orders of magnitude, of course, and the explanation breaks down in a few places if you think on it hard enough, but that is where the really complex bio-chemistry stuff comes in, and I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt understand even half of it.‚Äù¬†

Julia gave a slow shake of her head, and took a few moments to try and process all the information she‚Äôd just been given. *I wish I‚Äôd recorded all of this.* ‚ÄúThank you, Omsarch‚Ä¶ may I call you Omasarch? I hope you will be willing to call me Julia?‚Äù He raised his glass and nodded, so she continued. ‚ÄúThat is a lot of information, and clears up hundreds of pages of ‚Äì mostly wrong ‚Äì conjecture that I have read. You do understand, though, that when this information hits Confederated Academia‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou expect that there will be untold numbers of requests for information or passes to visit our world. Sadly, I think you are mistaken. There are segments of your Academic circles who already know everything I have detailed to you: In fact Human scientists have helped us understand some of the nuances of what is going on with our bio-chemistry. I am afraid that we stopped studying it with any intensity a very long time ago, but you Humans and your insatiable desire to know *everything‚Ä¶* I think the Academic types of my own people found it refreshing, after they got over their initial shock.‚Äù

¬†Julia raised her glass in turn. ‚ÄúWell, I am glad to hear that Humanity was able to provide a service to your people after all. I wish I could say I‚Äôm surprised at the breakdown in knowledge on my side of the fence, but‚Ä¶ well that same insatiable curiosity you mentioned sometimes presents us with information over-load problems, and‚Ä¶‚Äù She waved a dismissive hand. *Get back on track, gal! This is something to follow up on, but not the matter at hand.* ‚ÄúWell, I am glad I have the information now, and appreciate your willingness to share it. So, your turn, anything in particular you‚Äôd like to know?‚Äù¬†

He stared off into the middle distance for a moment, then focused on her again. ‚ÄúOh, what to do with such a wide-open invitation? The list is terribly long, so I guess I‚Äôll state now that I will be taking you up on that kind offer of regular meetings for social and informational exchange. Hmmm‚Ä¶ where to start? I guess we will go with an outlandish one: Is it true that some of your governments have made deadly duels legal?‚Äù¬†

She gave him a half-smile. ‚ÄúWell, it is true that such things were legal in some cultures in our history‚Ä¶ but mostly well before we achieved space flight. We don‚Äôt bounce back from damage like you folks do ‚Äì which I understand is a lot of the reason behind your dueling-based culture ‚Äì and so our combat-based activities tend to have a lot of controls in place to prevent permenant injury, and fighting is done for sport rather than to settle disputes. Of course, there is a certain variance in the definition of ‚Äòpermanent‚Äô when you go from one activity to another‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

She let herself lecture for a few minutes about various forms of combat-sports and disciplines practiced inside the confederation, with promises to send him reading material later.¬†

The Ambassador proved to be every bit as pleasant a listener as he was a speaker: He paid close attention to her words and asked the most *intriguing* questions.¬†

Eventually, he put his empty glass forward for a refill. ‚ÄúWater only this time, please. Fighting you deathworlders ‚Äì even with the shields ‚Äì takes a lot out of these old bones. Now, I thank you for that explanation. You have certainly captured my imagination, and I think I may have a new topic of interest for some time.¬†

‚ÄúThat said, I get the impression that you had plans for our somewhat impromptu chat this evening, and that those plans didn‚Äôt center around our ability to regenerate nearly anything short of losing our heads.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúQuite so, sir, you are very observant. As fascinating as I find the subject, there is something else that came of interest to me more recently after some reading I‚Äôd done about various cultures.‚Äù He quirked an eyebrow at her in a gesture so Human-like she wondered where he‚Äôd picked it up. ‚ÄúThere is something that has always struck me as quite odd and ‚Äì after dealing with a few of you at practices and our delightful chat this evening ‚Äì I find to be even harder to understand.¬†

‚ÄúThat said, I am concerned that I may be treading on sensitive ground, so I will ask your forgiveness in advance, and will state that if I run up against any kind of taboo or something please tell me and I will withdraw my question.‚Äù His chin tilted up in what ‚Äì from a Human ‚Äì would have been considered a slightly disdainful expression. *Once again, body-language studies pay off. He is curious, at least.*¬†

She took a moderately deep breath, and decided to go all-in. ‚ÄúMy question is about the Pinigra. They seem to‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Omsarch held up a hand, and his face took on a deadly serious cast. *Oops.* He spoke in a grave voice as he reached into a side-pocket of his bag. ‚ÄúThe Pinigra are a subject that we do not discuss much amongst ourselves, much less others. It is a‚Ä¶ unsettling subject for us. That said, I have been enjoying our conversation and would like it to continue. Please, ask me something else. Anything else.‚Äù¬†

She tried to hide her disappointment as she formulated a new question, then her heart skipped a beat as she saw what he‚Äôd pulled out of his bag: *A privacy-field generator! And a good one, at that. Why not just give the hand signal?* He put the generator on the coffee table between them and gave her an expectant look as his hand hovered over the button to turn it on.¬†

*Oh. Hmm‚Ä¶ what to ask. Ah!* ‚ÄúOk, sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to tread on a sensitive subject. Let‚Äôs try another: Your world fascinates me, and the little bit you said earlier has really strengthened my curiosity. Could you tell me more about what it is like to grow up, and live, on a class-0 Lifeworld?‚Äù¬†

No high-pitched whine that usually accompanied a privacy field start-up came to her ears. Just a momentary sensation that registered as a pressure against her eardrums, and then everything seemed normal as the Ambassador sat back.¬†

‚ÄúI did not request to use your privacy fields for two reasons: First; yours won‚Äôt have the information required to fake the rest of our projected conversation. Mine is programmed to go on at great length about a number of topics, and the one you chose is high on its list. Second, your systems could record whatever is said inside such a field, but this is‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Julia nodded understanding and cut him off. ‚ÄúAn espionage-class model, that doesn‚Äôt have the tale-tell spin-up whine, and will prevent any recording, even if you were to try and make one.‚Äù¬†

He gave her a thin smile. ‚ÄúJust so. Now, I must start by apologizing for telling you something of a half-truth: While the Pinigra are a subject that we do not generally discuss in polite company, because we find the topic‚Ä¶ unsettling. It is not, however, one that is actually considered taboo, and speculation about them is sometimes a topic that close friends will go on about at great length.¬†

‚ÄúYou see, we don‚Äôt know, really, why the Pinigra react the way they do to us. We aren‚Äôt even sure if they hate us, fear us, want to destroy us, or want to hide from us. That said, I have my suspicions, and some of what I am going to give you is conjecture. So, I will ask you, please, do not put this in any official reports to your government, at least not for some time‚Ä¶ not until you‚Äôve interacted with enough of my kind, and studied enough of our history, to claim the conjecture as your own.‚Äù¬†

She nodded, topped off both their glasses, and sat back. *This is‚Ä¶ not at all what I expected. I expect it is going to be interesting, though.*¬†

A deep breath followed a somewhat long, slow pull on the Ambassador‚Äôs drink, and he spoke with a far-off look in his eye. ‚ÄúOur three Homeworlds have very similar histories: not hard to imagine when all three ‚Äòconvergently evolved‚Äô species live on a high gravity world ‚Äì nearly as high as Earth‚Äôs I might add ‚Äì that is constantly working to keep you alive rather than kill you. Famine, disease, war‚Ä¶ these are things that we knew of only from stories. We do love our stories, after all, every bit as much as you Human do‚Ä¶ possibly even more. After all, don‚Äôt all sapient beings ‚Äì except maybe the Gorfal ‚Äì crave excitement?‚Äù¬†

He gave her a sly smile, which she returned along with a wry, but amused, look. ‚ÄúThat borders on speciest, you know.‚Äù¬†

His smile broadened. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd agree with you, except that their Ambassador would probably interject the same comment if he was here.‚Äù¬†

She raised her glass. ‚ÄúTouche.‚Äù¬†

He drank with her, then continued. ‚ÄúAnd, it is from these stories that my only hint of the Pinigra comes. Our three worlds have many different stories, but there are some‚Ä¶ not even stories‚Ä¶ Themes? Archetypes? Elements‚Ä¶ that are deeply imbedded in our storytelling and myths, but to which we can‚Äôt trace an origin. Beings of immense power, cunning, and mysterious motives who can be boon or bane. Different in every culture, yet all with certain similar traits...‚Äù¬†

A pause settled over them, as the Ambassador paused and seemed to collect his thoughts. To Julia‚Äôs eyes he seemed to be trying to find a way to explain a concept, so she thought through his words and looked for parallels.¬†

A series of images sprang into her mind, and the word came out of her mouth before she‚Äôd even begun to process it. ‚ÄúDragons!‚Äù¬†

Omsarch started at her sudden, emphatic outburst. She hadn‚Äôt, quite, shouted, but she‚Äôd come close. He cocked a single eyebrow at her, inviting explanation. *I really need to find out if that is a Roranar natural expression, or if he learned it from one of us.* ‚ÄúDragons. Mythical beasts resembling huge lizards ‚Äì often with wings ‚Äì which exist in one form or another in the myths of nearly every culture on our planet: cultures which formed in isolation from one another, and had no contact, but had these creatures. Some myths have them as dumb but dangerous beasts, some as intelligent creatures who were good or evil. Nearly all of them the creatures could breath fire and otherwise render a Human dead with no effort; and often did. They‚Ä¶‚Äù She waved a dismissive hand. ""I can send gigs and gigs of reference material, and that is just the scholarly study of the matter.‚Äù She smiled and took a sip, but kept an amused expression on her face and her eyes on Omsarch.¬†

He, in turn, nodded appreciatively. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ think I see, and understand. Please do send that material along; I will admit you‚Äôve piqued my curiosity. That said, yes, I think there is a parallel there. So, now I can finally get around to answering your question, and answer it with a question of my own.¬†

‚ÄúWhat would your kind do, how would they feel, if they had come out into the greater universe and found a race which called themselves... say... Gragdons, who were a race of winged lizard-like people? Not a mythological creature, but real flesh-and-blood species who had beat you to space by only a few centuries ‚Äì not nearly long enough to have visited your world so many millennia ago when the stories which created the mythology must have come into being?‚Äù¬†

A silence settled over the two of them. Julia sat, tried to process what the man had just said, her mind grappling with two concepts to which she couldn‚Äôt seem to find a way to unpack.

My mom and I were called overseas (Korea from the US) to meet my sick grandfather before he passed several days later. He was battling cancer for 2 years. My dad was sticking by his side before we came, monitoring his condition. I hadn't seen my grandpa in months, and ever since I was a kid, we could only meet maybe once every year. It was scary, but it didn't feel real either. My parents knew that he would pass away in a few days, but I thought that he could be saved.



A couple of days later, he passed away at midnight. I didn't know until I woke up and saw my dad, who had said that he would stay at the hospital overnight. When I asked him, mom said, ""he died today, he waited for your cousin's birthday to pass."" I think I just responded with ""oh."" We started the funeral service that day, and later, we saw my grandfather in an open casket and makeup the day before he would be cremated. There were loud sobs everywhere from people, while I just felt numb and couldn't really cry.



Next day, we took a large charter bus towards a different location. My grandpa's coffin was hauled away, and people crowded around his body like the previous day. I was confused, but the workers quickly carted him away into a large room with the words ""ÌôîÏû•."" Living in America, I had never experienced a Korean funeral and mistook this as the more commonly used definition, ""makeup."" This made sense in my head because he had worn makeup yesterday for the viewing, and didn't ask any questions. We were all escorted into a room with colorful furniture to rest in while the ""makeup"" was happening. In the meantime, we got lunch at the cafeteria in the building. The building was pristine and almost felt like a mall, with people laughing and also having a convenience store and coffee shop. After lunch, I spent the rest of the time playing Balatro in our room that broadcasted the status of whatever was happening to my grandpa. Everyone seemed so depressed about the status that I probably should have noticed something was off.



When the ""makeup"" was done, we headed into another room where people came crying out of. There was a glass window with someone behind it holding a bag of bones. They then ground it all up and put it in a vase in under 10 seconds. I then asked my mom what ÌôîÏû• meant because the bag of bones couldn't have been my grandpa, right? She replied with ""cremation.""



The word ÌôîÏû• means both makeup and cremation in Korea.. I had no idea that the second meaning even existed. Even though it was a few months ago, I can't keep thinking that I could've been a better person to my grandpa when he was at the hospital and when he was burning.



I feel like I could have been way more respectful to those around me and to my grandpa, or I could have asked someone about the agenda beforehand. I am also posting this because the pain and genuine realization of losing him hit me just recently, which made me feel like I could have done better overall.

But I also want to reduce my caffeine intake. So far, the best decaf I've found was instant coffee from LIDL ( I swear, by far better than some random decaf beans I found). And beans, even ""cheap ones"" are still pretty expensive to start just messing around with all of them. Also, if the bean is awful, I don't want to have to fight through 300-500g of it before getting the next one (okay... couldn't even use the verb ""to move on""... come on mods).

I got a nice coffee machine to make it myself and have been having fun with it (it's the little things). So now, I was wondering if any of you can help me with my search for a nice decaf coffee bean brand/bag that won't explode my wallet? And if you have ideas, where do you order/buy it?

1jiksg3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jiksg3,Vitamin/mineral deficiencies,"Hey im looking for some advice or insight in regards to overall wellness as a poverty girly. so I'm 25f. Growing up my family was poverty stricken. My diet was as follows: I was always hungry for school breakfast. I ate all meals I was offered there, went home to some sort of snack like spaghettios/macaroni beef. Then had a home cooked meal which was typically some sort of meat, mash potatoes, and canned vegetable. Then a before bed time snack like cereal or doritoz. This was how it was until I turned 16 and could start working and would get a little bit of a healthier meal on the weekend for myself like panera or a starbucks tomato mozz sandwich and a coffee. When I furthered my education after high school I got to eat at a dining hall and would typically hVe a breakfast like hard boiled egg, cottage cheese, protein shake and then some sort of entree with salad for lunch and dinner. Supplements wise: as an adolscent my mom would occasionally buy the Flintstones gummies and I would take those for 3 or 4 days and then they would end up expiring until I asked and tried again for the next bottle. 

Today I'm eating at a 500cal deficit to help get to my goal weight and hopefully overall better my life. Im also drinking meal replacement shakes that seem to be really nutritious as well as a multi/immunity vitamin. My question for you if you've read this far is do you think that if I stay up on these supplements and fixing my relationship with food and calories, that I have a pretty good chance of healing myself in about 10 years to still be able to have a child? What are your experiences with your diet/wellness and having children while in poverty? 

Im ultimately really concerned that I didn't get enough nutrition as a kid and I won't have optimal conditions to conceive or feel the desire to commit to someone long term. You don't have to be a doctor or anything to answer, I will probably go that route too, but hearing from someone's POV that's in the same tax bracket as me could mean alot. 

Im attaching the two supplements I've been taking in tandem with each other. They are both loaded with nearly all the vitamins they consider essential at a high percent DV. 

Also if you have any other supplements you take that help I would really appreciate that too. I'm trying to get a regiment together to fix my life for whatever it could be worth.

But after hearing more from students about campus life here, I'm really starting to question my decision. 
I'm a Filipina from Texas, I'm introverted, don't like party life (drugs, loud people, Greek life, etc), and am generally not that into things like hiking or skiing. I chose to apply because of the Chem program, but even visiting the building, the facilities look a bit musty and people say that the classes aren't as intimate as they advertise. Plus, I have an autoimmune disease, so I worry a lot that the age of the buildings or the large number of students might screw with me a bit in that realm.

While it may sound like a clich√©, there‚Äôs more truth to this statement than most of us realize.

When you give your brain space to think without distractions, you allow your creativity to flow freely.

# 6. Build Confidence and Self-Discipline

Every time you wake up and follow through on your plans, you prove to yourself that you can stick to your commitments. This builds trust in your ability to show up for yourself and handle whatever comes your way.

**Conclusion: Your Day, Your Routine, Your Life**

Incorporating a morning routine into your life doesn‚Äôt require drastic changes or complicated rituals. Start small ‚Äì even [just a few minutes](https://chatgpt.com/) of mindfulness, a glass of water, or a quick stretch can make a big difference. The key is consistency. Over time, you‚Äôll notice subtle shifts in how you approach your day, and these shifts can lead to remarkable improvements in your productivity, mental health, and overall life satisfaction.

After owning my Bambino and 064s grinder for a couple of months and having tried multiple different specialty coffees from different local roasters (in Belgium & Netherlands) I was finally feeling like giving supermarket beans a go. (Yes, it‚Äôs considered blasphemy in here, I know)

I brought home a bag of lavazza oro yesterday, and now I‚Äôm wondering if any of you have any experience with those kind of beans.

Should I be making them the way I make my specialty coffee drinks and aim for a 1:2 ratio within 26-30 seconds? Or should I be using entirely different recipes? 

I don‚Äôt have much experience with espresso at home besides the past 2-3 months, so I‚Äôm not sure what the beans are supposed to taste like but I know that I really like the kind of espresso‚Äôs that they serve at italian restaurants.

ACT 2. Retro Camera.

After filling the notepad with as much info about you, it re-conjures itself into the retro camera as in the image above.

I have 10 maximum photos to take of you where you see yourself spending the most time (home, school, work, friend's house, coffee shop, etc.)

ACT 3. Newspaper.

After the 10 photos, the camera will poof and turn into a blank newspaper. It'll take up to an hour for the ""ink"" to manifest and dry.

We'll be able to read what happens to you in the future depending on how penetrative our investigation of your existence was.

Conditions

1. I can't use Pearl Jam on myself.

2. I can't use Pearl Jam on you again. So be heavily prepared and narcissistic as possible.

3. I can't use Pearl Jam for one week after use.

4. The more people who read Pearl Jam, the more the ink fades until it becomes blank. So keep it to yourself and your closest stakeholders like family and friends.",3,1742798811.0,HatsuVault,2,1.0,False

1jikjla,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jikjla/need_sleep_advice_please/,need sleep advice please!,"hello! writing because I really need some sleep advice. to lay it out for you, I am an early to bed person - around 9:30-10, and wake up very early most mornings - in the 6 am hour usually. this is crucial for me to get my workouts done in the morning. 

I've always been pretty good with sleep. ive long said I can drink coffee at 5 pm and sleep normally and for a while that was true, especially in college. I've been post grad for about 4 months now and htitngs have changed. 

I sleep great on nights when I am exhausted. however, I find if I have any thoughts at all after my head hits the pillow, and my mind travels at all, its like a switch turns and suddenly my mind is just SO awake - even though everything else, my body and eyelids, are xhuasted. I wont want to move, for being too tired, yet can't sleep and have an extremely untried, active brain. what is that all about??

to top it off, I get terrible anxiety about not being able to fall asleep, as I keep my routine so structured, and obviously that makes it a million times worse.

I could use some insight and tips!! I don't have much of a bedtime routine, honestly, so I'd love to hear anything that worked for you guys. thanks so much in advance :)",1,1742798412.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Some things have been absolutely worth it, while others felt like a waste. Sharing my experience, and would love to hear yours too!

Staples ‚Äì Worth It or Just Fancy?

	‚Ä¢	India Gate Basmati (~‚Çπ240/kg) ‚Äì Easily one of the best switches I‚Äôve made. It actually comes close to the quality of restaurant rice, making homemade biryanis and pulaos taste much better. Plus, it helps me stick to home-cooked meals rather than ordering in.

	‚Ä¢	Cold-pressed oils ‚Äì Haven‚Äôt switched yet but curious if they actually make a difference in taste or health. Anyone tried?

	‚Ä¢	A2 Milk ‚Äì Didn‚Äôt feel a difference personally, but I‚Äôve heard people with lactose intolerance benefit from it.

Fruits & Healthy Snacks ‚Äì Do They Help Stay on Track?

	‚Ä¢	Blueberries & Raspberries ‚Äì Expensive, but I‚Äôve started including them for their antioxidant benefits. Mixed with curd, they make a great sweet snack that helps me avoid unhealthy cravings.

	‚Ä¢	Brown eggs (premium brands) ‚Äì I‚Äôve noticed the yolk is more orange, and they taste better, especially since I prefer semi-cooked eggs. Supposedly, they have better nutrients too.

Gourmet vs. Regular ‚Äì What‚Äôs Worth It?

	‚Ä¢	Chocolates ‚Äì Tried switching to premium chocolates but didn‚Äôt enjoy them much. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather just have a small bite of Dairy Milk Silk. Open to recommendations, though!

	‚Ä¢	Coffee ‚Äì Moved away from instant coffee like Nescaf√© after realizing it‚Äôs mostly coffee dust. If you drink it black (Americano), the difference is massive. Feels like a healthier switch too.

	‚Ä¢	Low-fat / low-sodium options ‚Äì They‚Äôre usually 50-100% more expensive in India, and the variety isn‚Äôt as good as in Western countries. If anyone has found good low-fat or high-protein grocery options, drop a comment!

Would love to hear what others have upgraded in their grocery list and whether it was worth it! Have you switched to premium brands, and which ones actually made a difference?",3,1742797140.0,EliteIndia,19,1.0,False
