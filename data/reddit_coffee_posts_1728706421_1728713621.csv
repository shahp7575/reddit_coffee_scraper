Is the night club fun?

How is the hibachi? Other food suggestions? We both are picky/don’t eat seafood. 

Has anyone done the off road excursion where you hit a beach, cave, and farm to try chocolate, rum, coffee?

Anything else suggestions on where to set up daily in the pool? Where they host activities / close to the bar (this is honestly the most important to us lol)/ etc.

I went out this morning for what I thought was to grab a coffee with some friends and my partner (who I live with) and as soon as we all met up one of our friends told me ‘Oh my god you look so skinny’ and my other friend added on by saying ‘yeah it’s kinda scaring me’. 

For context, I’m not UW and I have what’s considered a ‘normal’ BMI. But, I have lost quite a bit of weight recently. I’m high restricting and definitely have somewhat of an exercise addiction.

Anyway we get to the cafe we’re getting coffee at and they all decide they also want to get food. Everyone got a sandwich, along with pastries and donuts to share. This was the first time I felt so seen and quite vulnerable as they kept asking why I wasn’t eating or if I wanted a bite of their food and the more I kept saying no, the more perceived I obviously felt. 

As I don’t have heaps of friends in the city I currently live in (moved here in the last two years), it’s easy to not get caught in social situations around food. I’m fine meeting up for drinks at a bar (I usually plan ahead of time). But today was the first time I really had to deal with this kind of situation and I can’t stop thinking about it and how they probably think I’m a freak, or are concerned for me…

What’s worse is my partner isn’t aware of my behaviour atm. They work full time in an office, whereas I work part time and from home a lot so they don’t see what I eat, or how much I exercise. Anyway not I’m worried my partners also catching on and I just feel like hiding.

Disclaimer: this might be a bit of a messy read, I’m a little tipsy after a night out with friends, my boyfriend was invited tonight and HE STOOD ME UP. So yeah. I’m crying while posting this.


I (21f) have been with my current boyfriend (bf-32m) since early June of this year. Bf came into my place of work with some friends, complimented my smile, and asked for my number on the spot. I thought he was sweet and gave him it.


It felt like it was meant to happen. He isn’t usually in the town I work in, he just so happened to be helping a friend locally, they just so happened to want food from my workplace, and I just so happened to get an opening shift when I usually never open. It was almost fate.


We went out the same day and it was really sweet. He bought me coffee, we went to a park and kissed in the rain, and on the way to drop me at home he pulled over and picked me wild flowers. It was a fairytale and he was my prince.


He came to my house maybe 5 or 6 times after that, all smiles and sweet gestures, texting me good morning and calling me beautiful and sunshine and pretty girl. I wanted to love this man so bad.


He was working on a construction site in my town one day and I offered to bring him lunch, he said that would be nice of me but when I asked him where to bring it and if he wanted anything specific he didn’t answer, and never explained why, simply ignored it and moved on.


My mum was doing a photoshoot in the city and asked me to invite Bf since we were going to a video game arcade, Bf said he’d love to go but then the day before he said he couldn’t go and never said why even after I asked. I made up an excuse about his work to not upset my mum, and we went without him.


He told me he wanted to take me to a new restaurant in my town, that restaurant has now been open for 3 months and we haven’t gone, and when I ask about going out ANYWHERE he simply doesn’t answer. 


My sister graduated grade 8 and I invited him to the ceremony with dinner after, he never showed up.



I’ve invited him 5 or 6 times to Sunday dinner at my mums house and he’s either never answered or said he can’t.


I invited him to my house one day, he said he had friends over but they were leaving soon and he’d be over after, I waited until 2 am before just going to bed. He told me the next day he ended up drinking and going to sleep.



One of my favourite coworkers is going into the military next week. Myself and another coworker planned a dinner at a local restaurant to say good bye to him. There were 6 of us coworkers and two of them brought their partners. I invited Bf obviously, and he told me he would go, he told me this yesterday night, not 24 hours before our reservation. He never showed up. I texted him and asked if he was coming and he said he was still at his house, then nothing, radio silence.



He is currently invited to thanksgiving this Monday (I’m Canadian btw) and Monday is also my birthday. I texted him about an hour ago now and told him that I would like to know whether he is coming to my mums on Monday or not. I want to know now so I’m not crying on my birthday if he stands me up again.


I want to love him. I’m mature far past what I should be at 21. I want to get married, I want to have kids, I want to love and be loved. I don’t want to party, I don’t want freedom. I want stability, trust, and just a goddamn partner who can say they’re sorry and show up next time.

We came to this agreement after I would wake up and worry why he isn't home, is he safe and the fact that the rest of the weekend is wasted with him catching up on sleep etc. This was my compromise- I said as long as you are home by 6am and you make me coffee in bed (this is the only day he makes coffee).

Here a few thoughts on the trip:

**Train 14: Montreal-Halifax**  
Boarding was smooth and without issue. Nothing to report here. I like the fact that the Montreal Gare Centrale station has options for food, drinks, convenience close at hand before boarding the train. It meant I didn't have to carry more things to the station as I knew I could pick up some snacks right in the station before boarding.

I opted for economy for the trip as I don't sleep all that great when travelling anyway, why pay extra for it? I was in a Renaissance car for the trip. As many people know it's a 2-1 formation. I originally chose a single seat, but I'd recommend the double seater if there aren't too many people and you wouldn't have to share. It's much more comfortable as you can stretch out more and actually lay down. I was able to switch over when someone got off at a later stop. Either way, the seats themselves are fairly comfortable.

I brought snacks with me, so the only thing I bought was a breakfast sandwich and coffee throughout the trip. There is an attendant with a cart who comes through the car regularly, otherwise there is a service car which also is the only car with Wi-Fi should you need it. Otherwise service is spotty throughout the journey.

The bathrooms on the Renaissance car are very small, and also got dirty very quickly. Expect delays. My train was about 2 hours late to Halifax due to waiting on CN trains. There is minimal overhead storage for baggage. There is some available under the seat, but won't fit most roller carry-ons. These will likely need to go in the baggage storage area of the car instead of at your seat. Otherwise it was a good trip. I really enjoyed watching the scenery.

**Train 15: Halifax-Montreal**  
Boarding was a bit slower here, maybe due to the fact that the Halifax station is unfamiliar to me versus the Montreal station. There are no food/drink/convenience options here other than some vending machines.

I was in economy again here. This time I was in a HEP car which are in a 2-2 formation. The chairs themselves are very comfortable to sit in, I particularly enjoyed the foot rest. Given the 2-2 formation, the 2 seaters are not as wide in the HEP cars as the 2 seaters in the Renaissance cars. This means that while you can lay across them, it's really not very comfortable. In fact, I found it really hard to get comfortable while laying down as there were too many hard edges there was always something digging into me somewhere. Having a pillow is beneficial here. The window ledge is hard which makes leaning you head on it rough, and the armrests are hard so leaning against them is not great. The Ren cars had much more padding. When they dim the lights at night, they are still much brighter than in the Ren cars.

On the plus side, the bathrooms are bigger and seemed to stay clean throughout the trip. The windows were bigger and provided a better view outside. Bigger overhead storage for your baggage. We were running about an hour behind schedule in New Brunswick, but made up the time sometime after crossing into Quebec and got to Montreal just about on time.

**Recommendations**  
I'd recommend bringing a reusable water bottle as you can refill it as needed on board and save yourself an expense. Bringing your own food/snacks is helpful if you don't want to have to buy food from the service car.  
If you can swing the space in your luggage, a pillow and/or blanket would really add to your comfort on board as well. There are a few longer stops, I'd recommend going outside to get fresh air and stretch your legs if you can. The stops aren't very long, but it helps. Wear comfortable clothes or have comfortable clothes to change into once you are on the train.

5 days dd! Oh and 6 months pregnant :) 

Important info for later: my partner and I separated in January 2023 for a brief period. We were not having sex, we were resentful of eachother, we were like room mates. I made the decision to move out at the end of January 2023. In February of 2023 I saw he had followed his ex on instagram, I phoned him and he told me he’d been speaking to her and he intended to have sex with her when he went back to his hometown this Easter. 

His ex is a girl he dated for 6 months 12 years ago and who he has had casual sex with ever since. Every time he is out of a relationship he has sex with her now and then until he finds a new one. She is in love with him and has told him this many times but they never had a relationship again, no dates, just met for sex. I begged him not to do have sex with her now as it would mean we were over for good. We started talking again and a few weeks later (while I begged) he agreed to block her and delete her number. By that Easter we were back in a good position and by August of that year I had moved back in. I thought that was that. 

My partner is from a different country and went to visit his hometown a month ago, as he has done many times before. When he got back he was completely normal but my gut told me to look through his phone. I found her number in his phone under a different name - it had not been there before I was pretty sure but not 100%. I confronted him and the truth trickling began over the next 3 weeks. First he said it was always there and I just didn’t believe it. Then he said fine in February 2023 we continued talking but didn’t meet. Then they did meet for coffee the Easter he was in his hometown but he felt SO guilty from that meeting he blocked her immediately after. Then no actually it was 2 coffee dates and then he slept with her and THEN he felt guilty and blocked her. 

Then the kicker. He had slept with her and blocked her in Easter 2023 but when he went to his hometown in September.. a month ago.. when I was 5.5 months pregnant.. he unblocked her and texted her to meet for sex. And she rejected him. But two days later (he was home by then) messaged him saying actually she wanted to meet and when he said he was home she told him she regretted not seeing him and she’ll always love him. An unimportant detail considering he tried to fkin cheat on me while I was pregnant but still. 

When he finally told me this part I messaged her. She denied everything and then SHE started truth trickling me. At this point their stories are starting to match up but I think that’s because I gave too much away on what I know. She said multiple times that she doesn’t want my boyfriend to think she’s trying to ruin our relationship or blame her. Ukh shut up. 

I don’t know what to do now. Partner is devastated and says he doesn’t know what came over him. I don’t know either - I don’t think he had cheated before our separation and he had also been to his hometown twice before September (since Easter) and nothing happened. Well he says nothing happened and she says nothing happened. He’s saying he’s going to go to therapy but who knows. It feels like she’ll never say no to him and I don’t know why he tried to go back while I’m at my most vulnerable so it just feels like it’ll happen again. 

I guess this is me venting and looking for advice and support. I never ever imagined this would happen to me and this is absolutely not what I wanted for my child. I was really happy with him and looking forward to the future and now I’m scared and I don’t know what to do or plan for or think of. I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m currently at my mums house and have asked to be prescribed anti-depressants as the emotions are just so strong and I’m scared of hurting my baby. Still can’t believe this is happening :(  ",7,1728709763.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,3,0.89,False

He is completing a fairly challenging stem degree and so I accepted he would have to commit more time to his work, but his reconnection with mathematics has become concerning.

He now spends a majority of his day 'studying mathematics', despite the fact I often see very little work being done. When I ask him how his work is going, he gets very defensive and refuses to open up, claiming it's in my best interest because 'it will be boring to me anyway'. He then retreats to his room, where I hear either classical music, or the now familiar voice of youtuber 'The Maths Sorcerer' through the door (Some kind of mathematics based motivaitonal guru).

He also has taken up chainsmoking during the day, which although I'm personally not too bothered by, has become another issue where he becomes very defensive. He regularly sends me studies and reddit anecdotes about the efficacy of chainsmoking as a nootropic, and how universities like MIT are littered with cigarette smoke from 'high performance humans'.

He goes so far as to tell me that all of the greats such as Betrand Russel, Einsten and 'Rachmandynoff'(?) were all habitual smokers (Anyone know who tf that last person even is?)

I've tried to contact his friends to see if he shares more about his new secretive lifestyle with them, to which I was told that he basically just talks about drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, eating eggs and doing mathematics without going into any further detail.

I feel like he has completely changed personalities and lives as some kind of isolated savant rather than my loving boyfriend and I have to fight to even spend time together. I want to try and maybe meet him where he's at and become more interested in what he's doing, but he just keeps everthing so secretive?

My personal brief, general, and vague background is I'm an alcoholic addict in recovery (many years), very religious upbringing until teens from quiet father and mother, mum is a fox news tucker Carlson viewer and dad stays quiet about it but listens to fox. I'm college educated they are not and believe I'm ""a Marxist radical leftist"" because I was brainwashed. We almost never talk politics and get along fairly well because we both know it's a powder keg for us both. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago we started talking about my house hunting, she made a racist comment about immigrants (something she's at least never said so blatantly) I'm not going to let that shit slide so stormed out and involved us not speaking for a couple days. She was unrecognizable. 


Now today I'm visiting them because we're back to being friendly (terrible out of sight it's not a problem if we don't talk about it issues in my fam) and my nephew and mother's first grandchild is growing up so fast and starting to talk jibberish. 

My mum starts reminiscing on raising me, laughing, how adorable I was, the crafts we used to do and how my nephew looks like me and dah dah dah 

So I asked her: So do you want [NEPHEW] to grow up to be like me, or grow up to be like Trump? 

It was dead silent for what felt like eternity and she got up to put on some coffee and put out some cookies.

It was a look of self reflection I had never seen in past arguments but I think it got her in a situation where she either was a terrible parent, or admits her son is a terrible person, thus admitting she's a terrible parent.. 

For the record, my mum was and still is a wonderful parent but somewhere along the line something broke. I think, if my hopeful predictions are correct, I think I fixed whatever was broken. I know she's going to make a great grandparent too ",80,1728707942.0,QAnonCasualties,7,0.98,False

Looks like a bunch of cops or something ran out and shot him. He disappeared and I remember feeling a huge wave of relief, then the dream ended. What the hell does this mean? I don't think of it as a nightmare or anything, cause I usually wake up sweating from one, Although I dont usually have nightmares anymore growing up. I am religious but not the most I always feel like I'm on the line of atheist and Christian. Can anyone shed any light or explain what this means? I keep thinking about this all day.



TLDR: Stressed in life, had a good dream was then ruined by a Big grey demon with horns looking at me then chasing me screaming nasty stuff. Decided to scream back at him then he disappeared, then I felt relief.

What does it mean?,"Sorry I'm not that familiar with reddit, but I can't stop thinking about my dream last night. For context I'm 20 years old (M) I moved to another country to help my family's businesses. I've been under a lot of stress trying to help manage everything but I am so new to this, I've been an employee for so long and jumping to this has been a stressful challenge, but I truly love what I do and my family's businesses, its the first time I've been passionate of doing something. Sorry for the background monologue, just wanted to give a detailed context. So my dream last night was I was back in highschool and seeing people I used to know and they we're all saying how much I changed and how I got a lot slimmer, and just a bunch of compliments, which is yes very conceited of me to dream about that lol. Then I saw this grey demon with horns watching me through the window, He was probably like 6'2 really buff and typical demon face with black horns. Later in my dream I was in class and I decided to go to Tim Hortans to grab a coffee and some breakfast. While walking to this metaphorical Tim Hortans it instantly turned to night, I saw the demon again at the tree line just watching me only moving his head so he can look at me, He started yelling at me, I can't remember what he said but it was all negative words and slurs. So I guess I got scared in this dream and ran into the Tim Hortans and slammed the door to lock it. I noticed he was running after me full speed then stopped right outside the locked glass door. He continued to keep screaming at me this time I remember what he said,  he yelled at me saying this, ""You're fucking dead I will catch you you nothing can stop me!"" and said similar things to that. For some reason I decided to yell back at him. I said, ""You will never catch me and you can try!"". Then me and this demon started exchanging some nasty words to each other. Then he raised his arm like he was going to grab me through the glass door. I flinched and got scarred, but then at that moment I saw sirens outside.

He just said he had to go home and left. The next day, he just started being credibly off and then invited me out to coffee after I didn’t hear from him the whole day and said that he didn’t feel like he could be the support I needed emotionally and physically since he will be doing a lot in this next few months. You know the whole it’s not u it’s me I can’t offer stability in the relationship. I know he was busy, but I never really distracted him from getting work done. Our whole thing was kind of that we both were workaholics like always motivating each other.

Maybe the idea of committing really scared the shit out of him????

1g1saqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1g1saqy/boomer_goes_to_the_car_dealer_part_2/,Boomer Goes To The Car Dealer Part 2,"It’s been a hot minute since I last posted here but said post seemed to entertain you fine folks so I figured I would try this again. Instead of one long story I’ll just share a few highlights and observations from my interactions with these joyless dirtbags.

Observation 1: They’re incredibly misogynistic, even the women. I’d wager that 90% of the time one of these ancient ghouls wants to sell their car or trade it in, they will blame any damage on their vehicle on their wife/female family member. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard “oh my wife did that. You know how it is.” Sure thing, Fred. They will also be straight up rude to their wife in front of me. I’ve literally heard grown men tell their wife to shut up when they asked me a question, as if they’ve been undermined for asking me a question instead of just being a silent drone. Contrasting that, the same men will act like they can’t take their next breath without the permission of their wife. I’ve also heard so many boomer women say things like “I don’t know how this works, I’m a woman!” Way to give yourself credit, Cheryl. 

Boomer 1: Old boomer woman who is about the size of Yoda and always wears sweaters with cats on the front. When she comes in for service she can never remember the name of the man who sold her the car so she will just wander into the showroom and ask whoever she runs into first “does the colored salesman still work here?” She says it with such excitement and is always over the moon to see the person she’s looking for but cannot grasp that what she’s saying is wildly inappropriate and can’t be bothered to not be a racist old bitch. 

Boomer 2: Gus the boomer is a miserable old shit who must be about 127 at this point. I think the only thing keeping him going is spite and evil. He may actually be satan but I can’t prove it. He comes about once a month for no reason other than to grab free coffee and fuck around. He’s said things like “I like the blacks down south. They know their place”, “The Jews run FedEx, that’s why I never get my packages!” and “My daughter ran off with a Chinaman and won’t speak to me anymore.” The scariest part is the complete calm with which he says this shit. He almost always has this demented grin across his stupid face too. It’s like he can pick up that everyone around him is disgusted by him and he someone feeds off that energy. He’s cartoonishly awful. I’m still shocked that he exists. 

Boomer 3:

I sold Gerald the boomer a new car. He comes back the next day with the tire light on and a nail in the tire. We agreed to pay for it since our building was getting renovated and there was a decent chance the car picked up a nail on our lot and had slowly been leaking air. We didn’t have the tire his car needed in stock and had to order one. None of the cars on the lot had the same one that we could swap it from either. We offered him a ride home or a loaner car for the night. He opted to take the loaner car. However after having to wait 3 minutes behind someone else to sign the loaner agreement, he got impatient and decided he would take the car with the punctured tire home. We begged him not to for safety reasons. He said it was fine since he lived close by and that worst case scenario he’d have a flat in the morning. Okay, Gerald, go for it. I come in the next morning and have 4 voicemails from him screaming at me about how he “has a flat how am I supposed to come in and get this fixed now!” Roadside assistance had to go get his car and tow it in. 

Boomer 4: 

Katherine the boomer LOVES small cars. She has a very small car currently but it’s getting too old and has a shitload of miles on it, presumably from driving to and from church 87 times a week. It’s so old in fact that the model isn’t even made by the brand anymore because every brand is obsessed with pushing SUVs down our throats. She came in one day wanting to buy a car she “saw online.” Sure thing, Kathy. Show me what you found. I shouldn’t have been shocked but yet I was. She had been doing all her research on the UK site for this brand. I explained to her that we can’t sell her that car because it’s not a US market car. She confidently said “I know! You’ll have to order me one.” I wasted 30 minutes of my life explaining to her that for many reasons, some reasonable, some not, you can’t buy a new car in the US that’s not homologated for sale and use in the US. She could not wrap her mind around how regulated such things are. She acted like she was trying to buy a knit cap off of Etsy from someone in Poland. 

Boomer 5: Mark The Creepy Boomer LOVES to touch people. One of my coworkers sold him a car. He gave me creeper vibes from the get go but I ignored it. Later in his visit I held a door open for him. As he walked passed me he gave me a creep my smile and said thanks and the proceeded to put his hand on my stomach and rub it as he walked passed. I was too shocked too say anything. Later I passed my coworker and mentioned this to him. He told me that his customer kept touching his hands and arm during the test drive. I’m one of only a handful of people with the card for our fuel pump, so I had to gas this weirdos car up. He kept asking me if he could accompany me while I did this. I had to tell him no three separate times and eventually made something about their being insurance reasons customers can’t be at the fuel pump. He tried to touch my shoulder when I handed back the key but I dodged it. Figured I’d never see him again but this horny old dipshit kept coming up with excuses to visit us. He snuck up behind me and put his hands on my shoulders. When I realized who it was I literally slinked down in my chair and stood up like WTF MAN. He gave a meek “Haha sorry young man didn’t mean to startle you.” Anytime he’d show up I’d just leave the showroom until he was gone. Then I kept getting LinkedIn notifications that he was viewing my profile. Then he tried adding me on Facebook. When I told my manager about this he just laughed it off.

I’m a 20-year-old who just moved to Saigon and I’m looking to meet new people around my age here! I’m super excited to explore the city and get to know the culture, but I’m not exactly sure how to go about meeting locals or fellow expats. Any advice on good places to hang out, social activities, or events where people are friendly and open to newcomers?

1g1s8uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1g1s8uz/i_hate_my_boyfriends_dog/,I hate my boyfriend’s dog..,"Little summary here, I started dating my boyfriend almost a year ago and when we first started dating and hanging out, it was mostly at his house. He has a dog, full grown and I think ~4 years old. This dog is well behaved for the most part. He’ll sit and go to his bed when you tell him to, doesn’t pee or poo in the house etc. at first I didn’t have a problem with him, I’m just not a dog person so I never really payed attention to him. Fast forward to now, me and my bf are living together in a tiny one bedroom apartment which is perfectly suitable for us two, but he brought his dog with him. First of all, big dogs aren’t allowed in our apartment complex, but he just never showed his dog to the landlord etc. and second of all my disliking for this dog has WORSENED. He rips up everything you give him, his whole entire bed is ripped up and the stuffing from the inside is always all over the house no matter how much I try and clean it up. He gets into the trash also. One other thing is this dog SHEDS like no other. White fur all over my couch, my clothes, my coffee table. Everywhere.  My bf also works 12hr shifts so I’m left to feed the dog and walk the dog 2-3 times a day. And in an apartment complex with no yard and being in the second floor along with both our busy schedules, it just gets to be a lot for me. He also has been recently pooping blood and diarrhea which is very concerning and my bf isn’t doing no anything about it so every night after work I come home to blood and shit in my house with a ripped up bed, hair sheds all over my furniture and trash all over. It’s just gotten to a point that I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t hate animals, but living with this full size dog, that isn’t mine, in such a small apartment I just cause handle it anymore and my bf of course is wanting to keep his dog because there isn’t really anywhere else for him to go but.. any advice would be greatly appreciated 😭 I’m just not sure what to do at this point. I think if I ever moved out from living with my bf it would be because of this dog.. it’s just become my responsibility and I don’t even want this dog in the house ",0,1728706808.0,DogAdvice,9,0.17,False
