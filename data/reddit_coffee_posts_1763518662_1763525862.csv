This will be my first ZEP vacay. My dad isn’t well and is sending me & my kid to an all inclusive vacay as a mechanism to avoid my 8 yr old seeing him while he’s on deaths door for the holidays. Still not sure I’m taking him up on the offer (we lost mum earlier this year and the family dog this summer so please don’t think it’s cruelty to consider this, my child has experienced far too much when grams was dying and dragging us through it and including her in discussions about medical assisted death) ANYWAY the point…

Up until starting Zep I was plant based entirely so CUBA was never an option knowing there are food shortages but as we introduce animal based protein it’s a real option 

Note PLANT BASED VEGANISM is my preference but due to other health care issues re: absorption of iron vitamins and protein - and having lost mobility bc of muscle atrophy and losing the muscle mass to stand and osteo deteriorating bones and fibro flares keeping me in bed and not being able to move without some form of assistance we’ve readjusted…. Anyways back to story 

Was it difficult explaining Zep when travelling (psss do they sell it in Mexico btw and is it cheaper) 

How does extreme heat impact Zep

I’ve read up about alcohol but any tips on surviving an all inclusive would be greatly appreciated as I’m sure I’ll likely fall backwards before moving forward (I heavily drank before Zep but quit drinking booze and coffee bc of hydration and kidney issues) I also love VODKA CLUB SODA AND LEMON JUICE while catching a sunburn in a urine filled swim up bar…

In terms of CUBA - any resort recommendations or emergency foods to pack to ensure keeping on track? (Obv I’m bringing my good protein powder & greens powder & hydration sticks) ",1,1763525384.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

1. Infrastructure is better than expected 
2. Vibrant coffee culture 
3. People were nice. At least to me as may be I was tourist. 
4. Saw many industrial zones. Potential Job Opportunities?
5. Saw few schools building from outside. Seems to be very nice.
6. People have civic sense and responsibility.

I have almost 10 years of experience in Manufacturing. 

Major challenge I could see so far is Language. Apart from that, I don’t see any major hurdles.

At work, our department head always walks in carrying the most complicated coffee ever. Like “soy-half-sweet-two-pump-vanilla-extra-foam-87-degree” complicated. Yesterday, I offered to grab coffee for the team to look proactive.

She emails me her usual order, I copy it, paste it into the mobile app, hit pay, done.

Except… the app pasted everything except the spaces. Her order autocorrected into:
“soy half sweet poop vanilla extra foam”

I didn’t notice until I handed her the drink and she read the receipt.
Out loud.
Slowly.

She didn’t even react at first, she just stared at me like she was evaluating my entire place in the company.

Then she says, “You think I want poop vanilla?”

I panicked and blurted “ONLY HALF SWEET,” which made it sound like I was passionately defending the concept of poop vanilla.

She laughed, thankfully, but now the entire department refuses to say “pump vanilla” and keeps calling it “the forbidden flavor.”

**Int. Outside Police Interrogation Room (Night) November 4th, 2025**

Gabriel ignored the muffled screaming coming from the room. His head tilted to the ceiling, his eyes closed. Gabriel took a couple **of** deep breaths, doing his best to center himself, allowing the anger to dissipate. The light washed over Gabriel, and he felt a small surge of energy, though it was outweighed by the tiredness. This case has pushed him to the limits, both physically and mentally. Gabriel emptied his thoughts, allowing his mind to rest as he stood there. After a few minutes, he opened his eyes, feeling a little bit better. He slowly made his way toward the chair he was sitting in earlier before Blake decided to ignore protocols, as per usual. 

Gabriel sat down in the chair and noticed his coffee cup on the table was now cold, which irritated him more than he’d like to admit. He rested both elbows on the desk, using his hands to prop his head up. He noticed a lack of laughter or anything demeaning aimed at himself. Gabriel looked around the room, noticing that Blake was nowhere to be seen, probably taking a smoke break. Finally feeling himself calm down from dealing with Stolas, Gabriel couldn’t help but reflect back on the last thirty minutes or so, upset with himself over not controlling his reactions to Stolas’s goading. It was as if Stolas was stuck in a delusion that killing people would bring about some new world order. Granted, this case so far has been, in a way, one of the worse things Gabriel has experienced. It’s why the captain wanted to be here for the interrogation. There’s much more riding on this case besides just a simple murder suspect, though Gabriel and Blake were forced to keep quiet about the details. Hopefully, there will be some return to normality in the future; maybe Gabriel can use some vacation time to go relax on a nice beach somewhere.

The only bright side in all of this is at least they got a partial confession from Stolas, and even if the case gets thrown out, they have Stolas put away for killing multiple police officers. Gabriel still had his head propped on his hands, his thoughts turning to the last twenty-four hours, from finally finding Stolas to all the officers that they have lost due to the very same monster playing god. In his heart, those men and women that stood by his side didn’t deserve to die all to bring in one murder suspect. Sadly, if it wasn't for those who lost their lives, this monster would still be hunting down more victims in the streets.

It was a sad reality of being on the police force. You pray to go home to your family every day. Some people don’t get to make it home, don't make it to say goodbye to their family. Walking out that door every time for a shift could always be your last shift, the last goodbye towards your family. Gabriel let out a tired sigh as he was personally going to each door, explaining how each died on his watch, how he was the one to be blamed for failing. Even if the families are mad at him, he wanted to explain how they bravely tried to help save the city.

The screaming in the room finally stopped. It didn’t stop Gabriel from feeling tired; the little burst of energy he had disappeared. His body felt as if he was defeated even though the suspect was in cuffs—essentially, they won. The police had got another bad guy off the streets. Gabriel’s weariness had been going on for the two weeks, right around the time he got this case. Gabriel hasn’t been able to sleep well, the pressure from the captain to solve the case as quickly as possible making him exhausted.

When Gabriel was first assigned the case, you’d think he’d feel sick by the murders, yet going to the crime scene photos intrigued him. The way each body was arranged, it was as if Stolas hated Christianity and was denouncing the religion. As Gabriel noticed days ago, the bodies were hung upside down, a reverse image of the cross the churches use. That is what made Gabriel interested, more than interested; he felt the need to have to solve the case.

**Int. Police Station (Afternoon) 2 Weeks Ago October 21, 2025**

The sound of talking could be heard all around Gabriel as he bit his lip, his eyes slightly strained from staring at the files. A couple of days ago, he was assigned a case from the captain of his division. Usually, it's the lieutenant who assigns them, but Gabriel was personally asked to handle this one by Captain Drake, having one of the best track records at solving cases for a person his age. With a hint of pride in his steps, Gabriel graciously accepted the case. Now looking back at it, it was as if no one else wanted to take it, so it was foisted on to him.

If Gabriel knew how difficult just finding a lead would’ve been, he would’ve turned it down, found an excuse to not deal with this. It wasn't till after reading the case when he found how difficult it really was. Leaning back into the chair, Gabriel stared at the ceiling contemplating his next step. One of the major issues is that bodies appear out of nowhere, and witnesses report they saw no one placing the bodies. With places being so public, they’ve all been cleaned so there would be nothing left to find now for Gabriel.

The worst part was the bodies reportedly had the blood drained, and near the bodies were messages left in the blood of the victims. Gabriel has been wracking his brain on where to start, knowing that Captain Drake wants to keep this out of the press, nor does he want the FBI to get involved. It’s actually a godsend they’ve been able to keep most of this under cover from the news. Gabriel could only imagine the circus that would cause, specially with spreading fear amongst the people.

He sighed to himself. He really did have a choice if he wanted to move forward. While Gabriel didn’t want to, he was forced to ask for some help, and Gabriel did everything he could to not work with anyone on cases. Especially him; the way he acted on cases always left a nasty feeling in his stomach.

Finally making up his mind, Gabriel abruptly stood up from his desk, a frown on his face as he picked up the two completed files on his desk, the rest being just an assortment of random papers. He quickly began walking, his footsteps heavy as he was racking his head trying to make sense of the case he was recently assigned. He could see Blake’s messy desk just up ahead. No matter how much he doesn’t want to have to ask for his help, Blake might help with some issues he was having on the case. Since Gabriel wasn't making any headway on his own yet, it was a good chance to get a fresh perspective on things.

Gabriel finally approaching his desk quickly got straight to the point. “I’ve got assigned to a high-profile case, and I need your um, expertise on where I should start.”

“Ahh, finally coming back for help, eh, youngin’,” Blake mocked, his feet up on his desk, eating a donut. “Finally got a big shot case, and now you want to remember your old teacher, huh.” Not once turning around to face Gabriel, almost punishing him in a way for not wanting to be around him.

Gabriel scowled as he threw the folder at Blake. “Come on, be serious. I haven't been able to find anything that connects the suspects together.”

“Why don’t you go ask John for help then if you’re so desperate for help,” Blake mocked, tossing a paper ball up in the air, then catching it as the ball fell repeatedly.

Gabriel scowled, reaching out with his left hand, grabbing the paper ball out of the air before throwing it in the small trash bin next to the desk. “Seriously, man, for once can you stop goofing off. People are dying here, so I’d like to do my best to catch the guy before another body turns up.”

Blake sat up in his chair, letting out a sigh but decided to give in. “Fine, just this once, I’ll help you. Just know you'll owe me one,” he whined, grabbing the folder off of his chest, putting both feet on the ground.

Gabriel walked around the desk and pulled up a chair. “I looked up backgrounds, interviewed neighbors, family members and the works. All came back clean. Most were considered pillars of their respective communities.""

Blake didn’t comment, deciding to focus on going through the files. As he went over the pages, Gabriel noticed he stopped on a particular name. Blake took a closer look at the paper, taking it out of the folder as he studied all the details. “This guy here says his name is Jacob Ryder, age 38,” he spoke out loud. “I dealt with him before he went missing. If I recall, I was called in to investigate a domestic violence case.""

**“Wait, so you dealt with this?”** Gabriel questioned, leaning forward in his chair, his leg pumping down in excitement at finally getting a break in the case.

Instead of answering, Blake moved Gabriel’s knee out of the way. Leaning down, he opened up the bottom drawer on his desk. Inside was a pile of folders. To Gabriel’s shock, the drawer was neat, with the folders categorized in alphabetic order. Blake’s desk is usually a mess with food wrappers and empty cigarette containers. Given his appearance, you’d think Blake wouldn’t keep anything organized. Suffice to say, he takes being an officer seriously. He quickly found **Jacob’s** folder, placing it on the table.

“Let’s see if this victim is the same as the person in the case,” Blake explained, showing Gabriel the file. “Ahh, here it is. His ex-wife filed for domestic violence, but later dropped the charges. There wasn’t much to follow up on. After the divorce, she moved away and didn't have any trouble until his body turned up dead.”

“Wait, what?!” Gabriel gasped as he quickly picked up the folder. “When I asked around, no one mentioned he was married.”

Blake shrugged. “Yeah, don’t know why it didn’t pop up in the search, but since the charges were never filed, the domestic violence wouldn’t show as him getting arrested or charged for it.”

Gabriel looked hard at the folder, his mind racing at finally finding a connection. If he is acting as a vigilante, then he might be going after people that have committed crimes and got away with it. “I’ll have to start double-checking reports submitted in the last couple months, cross-referencing names to the people who died,” Gabriel explained, mapping out things he needed to start doing in his mind so he can get to work.

“That’ll be the best, Gabe, if I were you,” Blake agreed. “Now get the fuck away from my desk, I’m busy.”

Gabriel looked around Blake’s desk, seeing nothing important. “Yeah, I bet you have a lot of work to do,” he muttered.

Gabriel ducked under a can thrown at his head. He quickly wrote down a list of names to check with other officers, asking to see if any of the victims also had similar reports on them.

Gabriel also had a couple of C.I.’s that he could shake down for information. Even if he had to, he could arrange for the perp to go after one of them. If they can get enough information on the guy, more sleepless nights were ahead for him as he quickly went to another officer’s desk, trying to ask any of his peers if they had any interaction with any of the persons killed in the case.",1,1763524171.0,u_UncannyOracle,0,1.0,False

1p0x4zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p0x4zc/dont_blink/,Don’t blink.,"I don’t look at paper maps anymore. If I can help it, I don't look at fields, either. Especially when the corn dries out in October and the stalks turn that pale, bone color.

My name is Phoebe. I’m twenty-five, and until last month, I was a Junior Geospatial Analyst for a subcontractor that works with the Department of the Interior. Basically, I made maps. Most of the work is digital now—cleaning up satellite telemetry, correcting zoning lines for flood insurance, that sort of boring administrative stuff. It’s good work. Or it was.

Three weeks ago, my supervisor, a man named Derek whose only personality trait is drinking stale coffee, called me over to his desk. He had a quadrant up on his monitor. It was a section of rural Appalachia, tucked away in a valley that technically shouldn’t exist based on the elevation models we use.

“Data corruption,” Derek mumbled, tapping the screen with a pen cap. “The satellite sweep from '09, '14, and last week all show the same thing. A blur. Just pixels. Like someone took an eraser to the raw image data.”

I looked closer. It was a rectangular patch of gray in the middle of a sea of deep forest green. “Maybe cloud cover? Reflection anomaly?”

“For three separate flyovers over ten years?” Derek shook his head. “The county records say it’s BLM land, but an old deed says it's private agricultural. We can’t publish the updated regional topos with a hole in the middle. I need you to drive out there. Take the LiDAR drone, take the handheld GPS. Get me ground truth. Prove it exists.”

I was actually excited. Fieldwork was rare. I packed my gear into one of the agency Jeeps, loaded up a cooler with sandwiches and energy drinks, and started the four-hour drive into the mountains.

The spot was deep in the backcountry. I eventually had to leave the Jeep at the end of a logging trail that looked like it hadn’t seen a tire since the Reagan administration. The GPS on my dashboard had already given up, displaying a questioning circle, so I grabbed the heavy-duty Garmin handheld, my backpack, and the case for the mapping drone.

It was a forty-minute hike through dense scrub brush and pine before the tree line abruptly stopped.

It didn’t taper off. It stopped dead, like a wall.

I stepped out of the cool shade of the forest and into the valley. This was the ""black spot"" on the map.

The valley was bowl-shaped, surrounded on all sides by high, steep ridges that probably messed with radio signals. The sky above was a flat, heavy sheet of gray stratus clouds, diffuses light so there were almost no shadows.

It was farmland. But it was wrong.

The soil was churned and dark, tilled into perfect rows that stretched for acres. But nothing was growing. No corn, no wheat, no soybeans. Just acres and acres of dark dirt and patches of yellow, dying witch-grass.

And the silence. That was the first thing that hit my chest, a physical pressure. In the woods behind me, there had been cicadas, squirrels, the rustle of deer. Here? Silence. Total, vacuum-sealed silence.

I checked my equipment. The drone compass was spinning lazily, unable to find North. The GPS screen just read Calculating... indefinitely.

“Great,” I muttered. The sound of my own voice was shockingly loud.

I started walking down the center path between the tilled rows, intending to set up the drone in the geographic center of the valley. That’s when I saw the first one.

About fifty yards out, standing on a crooked wooden post, was a scarecrow.

It was fairly standard at first glance. Blue flannel shirt, faded denim overalls, a burlap sack for a head stuffed with straw. It faced away from me, looking toward the center of the valley.

As I walked past it, I felt a shiver crawl up my neck. I’m not a superstitious person. I’m a scientist. But the proportions were unsettling. The arms weren’t just sticks; they were padded out to look muscular. The hands weren’t loose straw; they were white gardening gloves, stitched tight, fingers curled as if gripping something invisible.

I kept walking.

A hundred yards further, I found two more. They were smaller. Child-sized.

They were positioned differently. They weren't up on posts. They were on the ground. One, dressed in a little pink dress stained brown by the elements, was seated on the dirt. The other, wearing a boy’s striped polo shirt, was kneeling opposite her.

I stopped. I took out my binoculars and focused on them. Between them, resting in the dirt, was a tea set. It was real porcelain, cracked and filthy.

“Who does this?” I whispered. It looked like an art installation. A really morbid, middle-of-nowhere art project.

I pressed on, deeper into the valley. The topography was flat, making it easy to see the layout as I moved further in. And as I walked, the dread in my gut turned into cold, heavy lead.

It wasn't just a few scarecrows. The fields were full of them.

There were hundreds.

And they weren't guarding crops. They were the crop. Or rather, they were the population.

I reached what looked like the ""town square"" of this bizarre display. In a wide clearing of dead grass, someone had dragged out furniture. Old, rotting velvet armchairs. Dining room tables. School desks. Park benches.

And the scarecrows were everywhere, enacting a silent, motionless pantomime of life.

To my left, a ""family"" of four sat around a dinner table. The father figure had a burlap face painted with a crude, wide black smile. He wore a suit that was rotting off his straw frame. The mother wore pearls—plastic, cheap pearls—and her painted mouth was a surprised ‘O’. They had empty plates in front of them.

To my right, rows of school desks held smaller figures. They faced a larger scarecrow at the front who held a ruler taped to its glove.

I should have turned back. Every instinct in my primate brain was screaming at me that this was predator territory. Run, Phoebe. Run back to the car.

But I had a job, and I had a camera. I pulled out my DSLR and started snapping photos. Documentation. Derek wouldn't believe this without proof. The sheer effort required to haul this furniture out here, to stitch these hundreds of dolls… it was insanity.

I moved through the ""park"" scene. Scarecrows frozen on rusted swing sets. A scarecrow walking a ""dog"" made of hay and wire.

It was then I noticed the wind.

The valley had been breezy when I arrived, a constant, low draft sweeping down from the mountains. It rustled the dry grass and made the hundreds of flannel shirts and burlap sacks flap and snap. Whish, snap. Whish, snap. It was the only sound in the world.

Then, it stopped.

The wind just died. The stillness that followed was absolute. It was as if the world had held its breath.

I stood in front of a park bench, about five feet away from a scarecrow dressed like an old man, complete with a flat cap and a cane.

I lowered my camera to check the light exposure on the screen. I frowned at the reading. It took me maybe two seconds. I blinked, rubbing grit from my eye, and looked back up at the ""old man.""

He was looking at me.

I froze.

Before, his head had been tilted down, chin resting on his chest, looking at the ground. Now, the burlap face was tilted up. The black, painted eyes—just erratic swirls of tar or paint—were fixed directly on my face.

“Okay,” I said, my voice shaking. “Wind moved you. Obviously.”

But there was no wind. The air was stagnant and dead.

I took a step back. ""It's just gravity,"" I reasoned aloud. ""The stuffing shifted.""

My heart was hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. I needed to leave. Right now. I didn't care about the drone data. I turned around to head back toward the tree line.

I looked at the schoolroom setup.

All twenty of the ""children"" scarecrows were now standing.

My blood went cold. I swear, my heart stopped beating for a full three seconds. A moment ago, they had been seated at the desks. Now, they were standing, their stick-legs awkwardly braced against the metal chair legs. And every single painted face was turned toward me.

I didn't move. I couldn't breath. I stared at them, eyes wide, burning.

Nothing happened. They stood there, inanimate. Bundles of hay and cloth.

Don't blink, a voice in my head whispered. Don't you dare blink.

I backed up slowly. My boot heel caught on a tuft of root, and I flinched, my eyes shutting for a fraction of a second in panic.

Rustle.

A sound dry as autumn leaves rubbing together.

I snapped my eyes open.

They were out from behind the desks. All of them. They had advanced maybe three feet. Their poses were stiff, jerky, like bad stop-motion animation frozen in time. One of them, a figure in a red sweater, was reaching out a gloved hand.

It wasn't a prank. There was nobody pulling wires. I was surrounded by acres of open ground.

The wind picked up suddenly—a strong gust that blew hair across my face.

I gasped, waiting for them to rush me.

But they didn't. As the wind blew, shaking their clothes and rattling their wooden spines, they remained completely still. They looked like inanimate objects again. The ""life"" had drained out of them with the return of the air currents.

I understood the rules. I didn't know how, or why, but I understood the logic.

Wind: Safety.
No Wind + Eyes Open: Standoff.
No Wind + Eyes Closed: Move.

I scrambled backward, turning to run while the wind was blowing. I sprinted past the dinner party family. Their heads bobbed in the breeze, lifeless and limp. I made it maybe fifty yards before the wind died again.

I skid to a halt, spinning around, terrified to leave my back exposed in the silence.

Silence. Total silence.

I stood there, panting, sweat stinging my eyes. I stared at the dinner party. They were fifty feet away. The Father, Mother, and two children.

My eyes were watering. I needed to blink.

""Come on,"" I whimpered, begging the sky. ""Blow.""

Nothing.

One tear leaked out. The burning was unbearable. I winked my left eye, keeping the right open.

Nothing moved. Okay. Okay, I can cheat. I swapped eyes, winking the right one.

The Father scarecrow shifted.

It wasn't a run. It was a glitch. One frame he was at the head of the table. I winked. Now he was standing on top of the table, towering high, his arms spread wide like a hawk descending.

I screamed. I couldn't help it. I blinked with both eyes in sheer reflex.

CRUNCH-RUSTLE.

I opened my eyes. He was right in front of me.

He was huge. Up close, the smell was overwhelming—rotting wet straw, moldy fabric, and something else underneath... something like copper and dried meat. His burlap face was inches from mine. The painted smile was cracked where the fabric had folded.

I stared into the painted swirls of his eyes. I couldn't look away. I locked my muscles, forcing my eyelids to stay up.

He was frozen in mid-reach, his white gardening gloves hovering near my throat. I could see the individual fibers of the burlap. I could see stains on the fabric that looked suspiciously dark.

The other scarecrows were moving in the periphery. I could feel them. Whenever I focused too hard on the Father, the edges of my vision blurred, and the others—the school children, the swing-set watchers—encroached.

I needed wind.

""Please,"" I whispered through clenched teeth. My eyes felt like they were filled with sand. My vision was swimming.

The silence stretched on. It felt like minutes. It was probably only seconds.

The Father's painted mouth seemed to be stretching. I knew it was impossible. It was paint on cloth. But the weave of the burlap was pulling apart, hole by hole, widening that black void.

I couldn't hold it. My eyelids fluttered.

I dropped to the ground.

It was instinct. The second my eyes closed, I threw myself flat onto the dirt and rolled.

I heard the swish of something heavy swinging through the space where my head had just been. It sounded like a baseball bat hitting a heavy bag.

I scrambled up, eyes snapping open.

The Father was twisted around, his waist contorted unnatural 180 degrees, looking down at where I had been. His gloved hand was buried up to the wrist in the soil.

I ran.

I didn't look back. I knew the wind was still dead. I knew that because I couldn't hear it in my ears. Which meant every time I blinked, they were gaining.

I tried to time it. Run run run blink.

Shuffle-thump.

They were getting louder. It wasn't just one or two. It sounded like a stampede of dried husks.

Run run run blink.

SHUFFLE-THUMP.

I could hear the fabric rubbing against fabric. A dry, rasping screeching sound.

I saw the tree line ahead. The safety of the forest. The boundary. I didn't know if they could leave the field, but I had to pray they couldn't. The scarecrows were rooted to this ""town,"" surely.

I was twenty yards from the trees.

The wind was still gone. My lungs were burning, crying out for oxygen, but my eyes were worse. I had tears streaming down my face, blurring my vision into a watery smear.

I tripped.

My boot caught in a hidden rut in the dirt. I went down hard, slamming my chest into the earth. The impact knocked the wind out of me. My eyes slammed shut in pain.

I didn't open them immediately. I lay there, gasping, trying to suck in air.

And I felt them.

I felt the sun block out. I felt them standing over me. I heard the creaking of wood straining against fabric.

I smelled the rot. It was suffocating.

I waited to die. I waited for those white gardening gloves to close around my neck, or for a wooden stake to be driven through my back.

But then... I felt a cool touch on my cheek.

It was a breeze.

Whish.

The leaves in the forest ahead rustled. The high grass hissed.

The wind was back.

I scrambled to my hands and knees, coughing, and looked up.

They were all there. A semi-circle of nightmare figures standing over me. The Father was in the center, his hand extended, inches from my hair. The ""Teacher"" from the school was there, holding his ruler like a dagger. The little girl in the pink dress was standing by my leg.

But they were swaying. The wind was pushing against them, and they were just... dolls. Floppy, lifeless dolls responding to physics. The malice was gone, replaced by the mindless motion of the breeze.

I crawled. I didn't stand up, I just scrambled on all fours until I hit the underbrush of the forest. I clawed my way into the pines, scraping my hands on bark and needles, until I was well past the tree line.

Only then did I stand up and look back.

They were still there at the edge of the field. They hadn't crossed the line where the grass turned to pine needles.

They stood in a jagged row, swaying gently.

As I watched, the wind began to die down again. The swaying slowed.

I didn't wait to see if they would move. I turned and sprinted the forty minutes back to the Jeep, moving faster than I ever have in my life. I locked the doors, threw the Garmin into the passenger seat, and peeled out of that logging road so fast I almost wrapped the vehicle around a trunk.

I didn't sleep for three days. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that burlap face. The Father.

When I got back to the office, I told Derek I found nothing. I told him the logging road was washed out and I couldn't reach the coordinates. I gave him the memory card from the drone, but I had wiped it with a strong magnet I kept in my toolkit first. I told him it malfunctioned.

I quit the next day. I told them it was family issues.

I've been living in the city since then. Somewhere with streetlights. Somewhere with constant noise. Traffic. People. Movement.

But I’m writing this because I checked Google Earth this morning. I don't know why. morbid curiosity, maybe.

The glitch is gone. The pixelated blur over the valley has been updated with a new, high-res image.

You can see the field. You can see the rows of tilled, dead earth.

But looking at the satellite image, zoomed all the way in... the arrangement is different.

The furniture is gone. The dinner tables, the school desks, the park benches. They've been moved.

They’re arranged in a new pattern now. A pattern that spirals outward from the center of the valley.

They’re forming a line. A procession.

And the line is heading into the woods. Towards the logging road.

They aren't residents anymore. They're migrating.

And this morning, looking out my fourth-story apartment window... the streets were quiet. The birds weren't singing.

And the wind stopped blowing.

If you see one—if you see a scarecrow where it shouldn't be, or a pile of old clothes in the corner of your room that looks a little too full...

Don’t blink.

God help you, don't blink.

1p0x2so,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p0x2so/if_you_have_regrets_dont_bury_them_in_the_woods/,"If you have regrets, don't bury them in the woods","Adios readers. My name was Dennis Copper. I heard screams from the forest and received cash for acknowledging them for about a week or two or more or less. I don’t know, I don’t remember how long it's been. I lost track of time on my pursuit after the unknown being of the shrieks.


The screams, at first, I thought were demonic, but I soon discovered they were more physical than metaphysical.


I visited a Pastor who had a similar noise problem like me. He was hearing cheers every night instead of screaming. I then visited a high school friend who became a Hedge Witch. Not a literal witch per se but more of like an unlicensed doctor/priest. 


She could treat you for your mental and physical problems as well as your spiritual ones. We had set up a perimeter of defenses against all things unknown and sinister, cryptids and demons specifically; however, this cryptid didn’t give a fuck about any of it.


Maybe because it had more than a valid reason for hunting after me.


The other two blogs don’t matter. They’re simply more details about myself and vagueness on what was screaming at me. Sorry in advance if my words aren't as fancy, or my writing as glamorous. Dying on the forest floor you know? With this known I’ll continue.


We discovered that the shrieks were erupting from an undiscovered cryptid. I’m pretty sure it’s unknown because I’ve never heard or seen anything about it on the internet.


Its name is The Plum Gardener because of its nature of feeding. Also the skin of it is the same chewy purple skin of plums. It also possesses the slimy contrails of a snail. Mainly, its knees are drenched in the stuff. That's probably why it's so fast when it crawls. Its head is almost a pink flattened circle with a tear shape jutting out on top of it. Slightly similar to a sonoma hat, if they had them in a wet flesh style. 


At first, I honestly thought it was wearing a cute pink sonoma, but it turned out that the brim of its ""hat"" split into two sections. The top of its mouth which only held half of the classic sharp fangs of maniac destruction and the bottom half which not only held the completed half of the beastly fangs but also a large hole in the dead center of its lower jaw. 


It has a teardrop crease shaped above its mouth that holds a pair of lime eyes. Its eyes aren't lime colored, they're lime shaped loaded with a starving curiosity and splotches of muted pastel blue.


If you bury something in the woods that you have a regret tethered too like I did, The Plum Gardener will find it and dig it up. Depending on how extreme your buried “regret” item is, the Plum Gardner will probably return them back to the soil. It might pay you a swift visit, if your regret item was something worthless like a Power Ranger’s lunchbox. 


Most people won’t notice her visit. You have to turn your head towards the woods when you feel a stare stabbing into your back. Make sure you whip around fast and for a fraction of a second your surroundings will blur.


If the Plum Gardener is paying you a swift visit, here’s how you can find out. Turn your back to the woods and turn around as soon as you feel you’re being watched. If a purple afterimage passes your retinas as you spin your head, then she’s dug up your regret item. If it's not important to her she’ll leave you alone after that. If it’s something worse, when you turn around not only will you see it, you’ll also see a perfect image of the thing you buried in the woods.


Later, whenever you earned your regret with said item, you’ll hear the main noise that was associated with it at the same time you got it. Don’t ignore it or else the noise will start to peel your skin off.


To better understand what I mean I’ll explain my experience with it. Something awful happened to me two years ago at 10:12pm. It lasted until 11:11pm. 2 years later, I heard screams at 10:12pm every night, sounding slightly different in some way. If I ignored them, I would hear them amplified and closer to my house for 11.11 seconds. 


The 11.11 seconds of deafening screaming would cause the skin on my ankles to peel up and my ears to bleed. The skin on my ankles peeling up and my ears bleeding was related to my buried items or at least what happened to them.


Truth is, the relics of regret I buried, I always knew that someday they would be uncovered by someone or something. I guess this purple psycho beat the police to it. After she exhumes regret worth her appetite, she’ll search for the main thing that made you bury it. Sometimes you might bury the reason with it, like I did. 


I told everyone in my first blog post about money being thrown towards me every time I heard the screams. This money was no mystery to me. It was the money I buried with the bodies. The screams weren't exactly random either. Sure the pitch and or frequency adjusted erratically every night, but the base of the screams remained the same.


After this creature finds the reason for your regret, it tosses seeds implanted into your reason at you. That’s what I think at least. Mine was “hush hush” money. I buried it closer to my backyard than the gravesite of the bodies. Still, it was buried at least half a mile away from my house and each of them were grouped up into 10k stacks. Those stacks aren’t too heavy but it’s not even within humanity’s design to chuck something that far.


It smeared some of its seeds on my cash and I fell for its deception. The seeds, they're extremely sharp and thirsty for opened skin. Once they slice you, they root themselves under your skin. Eventually, an orb of sorts begins to grow inside your gut. This forms a barely visible throbbing purple outline around you.


Have you ever taken a picture in the dark? Most of the time the picture turns out grainy and unfocused. If you zoom into the picture you'll notice the grain of your picture has some color to it. One of the most common colors you will see is a subtle purple. That purple is the same one that latches onto you and circles around you like malnourished sharks waiting for their prey to fall off the raft.


Most people won't recognize a difference on you unless they're looking for it. If they're weird as hell and they stare at you long enough they’ll spot it as well. The Plum Gardener, if you ignore her taunts by plugging your ears with some sort of noise cancellation, she will crawl over to you no matter where you're hiding. She'll ignore pretty much everything you try to counter her with to retrieve what she planted in you. 


You become her planter for her orb seeds. Though she holds the anatomy of a human, if you remove her hat head, I have never seen her walk on two legs. I have only seen her crawl on her slimy pointy knees. Once she reaches you, she shapes her fingers into a triangular shovel to plunge them into your stomach and unearth the seeds it planted in you.


The seeds grow into a weird almost reflective orb. Something vibrant swirls in it and I have no idea what it is.


All I know is that I have a non-lethal triangular hole in my stomach. No blood, intestines or anything of the insides of the human body have leaked out of it. . It could be from the black tumerine stone around my neck given to me by my friend, but I still don't really know.


When I fired upon the horrendous offense to my eyes, The Plum Gardener paused in her skating type of crawl. I uncontrollably trembled as I watched her knees straighten. She didn't advert her gaze on me, she kept her back aimed at me. As her legs were extending, I writhed in discomfort at the noise her joints echoed.


A soggy tree branch snapping in half combined with the wheezing of a lung cancer patient sounded from them. I imagined that it was going to trust fall onto me and mash me into a bloody moss patch on the forest floor. Instead, it allowed its knee caps to press pass its locked out legs.


The skin on the back of its knees stretched out like laffy taffy being pulled and stretched until moon white bone curtained the skin in half. Her protruded knees fell back to the ground with her head still directed away from me glancing up at the starry sky. 


I dreadfully viewed the end of my life unfurl as The Plum Gardener reversed-scampered towards me. She didn't use her hands for additional momentum. They were folded on her chest, slightly recoiling from the rapid thumps of her knees pounding on the earth beneath her.


Although I emptied my entire mag at her, because of the shock left behind by this creature’s unimaginable movements, I found myself missing most of my shots. I only stuck three of them before the monster was upon me. It shoved me over with its head, then reconfigured its anatomy to face me. Up close, I had no idea what gender this thing was or if it even had one.


It squinted its dark shimmering globes at me, scanning for something. It shook its head in disappointment as it backed off me. Yeah, it was disappointed in me for some reason. Maybe because I had failed to kill it, but that didn't seem like the reason. She snatched my gun from the ground glancing back at me, ashamed of me. 


She ate it then spit out a fragment of it with similarities to the ball it had excavated out of me. It tossed it at me then continued back towards the forest. Probably embarking on a new hunt for her next victim.


I know I literally just said its gender was unknown to me, but something about it told me it was female. I didn’t know how to explain it. I hate it, I hate where I am, I hate who I am, I hate the fact I am in the woods with a lost sense of time.


The firm frosty forest floor felt fine. Fuck! This ground I lie on is my coffin without the silky padding and polished mahogany case. For some reason, I'm still not dead, I'm able to write and my breathing stays at a consistent rhythm. I believe my necklace is the only thing keeping me alive, so when I pull it this blog will end as well as me. 


I fidgeted the shard around my fingers, not realizing that it was playing a video inside of it. My peripheral warned me of the movement and I readjusted my gaze from the star speckled sky to it. It was playing the memory I had wished to be buried with my past.


Before I continue I gave the money from the woods away. All 5 million of it. It's being donated to a charity responsible for protecting abused children. Hopefully this charity isn't a scam like a majority of them are. All I know is that it's not a charity run by a celebrity so I should be in the clear. 


The other five million in my bank account, I uh, witted it to my brother. He's at the top of my will. Below is who the bodies I buried are. Here’s my full confession:


I used to be a superintendent for a site in Lake Tahoe, California. The site was located approximately 732ft from a pricey resort usually loaded with tourists. 


Most of them would stroll past our construction site with no second thought. We would catch some ""huhs"" and ""wonder what they're working ons"" but besides that to them, we were basically an addition to the foresty scenery.


One routinely morning, as my men were warming up the trucks, churning the good ol gray slime drum, some unexpected problems occured. We only had two honey holes (shitters) for a crew of 23. Our Honey Wagon had been rearended by some dumb ass backing out...Fuck!


 Sorry to stop my story. I can finally feel the hole in my stomach. It stings like hell and has a soreness I have never felt pulsing around it. I will try to get back to my story.


A tourist backed out of the resort's parking, in a rental, without checking behind them. Our guy in the Honey Truck was blitzing through the parking lot. He understood the importance of our honey holes. Lots of men consuming junk food as fuel. 


Yeah, we needed those honey holes asap.I can't blame him for speeding through the parking lot. It was literally 6am in the morning, most of the resort's guests were snoozing or eating breakfast. 


Except of course, the one in his car who was also in a rush. He was in a truck and when it struck the back of the honey wagon, it was with enough force to break the ratchets hugging the 10 porta potties. We lost eight of them.


Our morning would've been completely miserable if a little foreign girl hadn't stopped by our construction site.


She would've given the Ted Talkers a run for their money. Any idea that she talked to me about, she sold it to me. Her and her family were on vacation in Tahoe visiting the magical shimmers of the sun rays bouncing on the lake as the sun lowered. Of course, they were also here to visit the small popular city engulfed in the forest and the beaches challenged with nature versus humanity.


Her family walked by our construction site every day to awe at what we were building. It was an observatory on top of a tree scattered hill, overlooking the great lake's horizon awaiting professional photographers and those with additional money. 


The first time they strolled by it, they just whispered to each other. The little girl, the way she glanced at me, it held too much unnecessary judgement. Her voice wasn't pleasant either. It was broken English with a dabble of demand.


I remember the second day they hiked past us. The family exclaimed words like ""wow, look at that!, huh,"" etc until their, if I had to guess 8-year old daughter, gazed with intense curiosity at the structure.


""What are you billding, sir?"" 


I sipped my coffee and glanced at my site and team.


""Well little miss, my crew are the ones building an observatory so some people can see the stars at night and the lake in the morning. It's mostly for world class photographers, guys with big fancy cameras. It's my job to make sure that it's finished within a set date."" She stared at me with adoration zipping here in her eyes.


""Well, if your boss for guys, can you also tell them to make more quiet?""


""Whadwasthat?"" 


""Make quiet. My family and me can't hear birds and nature because of your yellow metals.""


Her finger was angrily pointed at one of our tractors. I wanted to laugh at what she said, but when I bent my head down to do so, I was met with a stern stare. 


""Alright little one. How about this! There's an actual street you can walk down that has a bunch of really cool shops on it. You won't hear the yellow metals because you'll be far enough away from them. I am sure you will still hear some nature. Definitely more than here. And maybe your parents will buy you something cool from one of the shops.""


I didn't flash a wide grin. She was smart. If I did that she would've probably told me to go kill myself. I smiled, but concealed my teeth and nodded at her.


She looked at the tractor again then back at me. I could see her determination to force her brain to come up with a counter to my offer. Her eyebrows bunched then relaxed. 


A devious smirk carved on her. Before she could announce her proposal her dad interrupted.


""Daryna, come on. Leave the construction workers alone. They prefer to work in peace, not with a svinya swarming them.""


""One second papa! I wiiill win this argument. Watch!""


Her dad writhed in protest but was calmed down by his wife.


""Let her learn. Besides, if these men listen, maybe the loud noise will at least be lower. You know how our 3-year old boy is."" The mother pointed to the tiny kid strapped to her back. He had smaller eyes, but they were so full of curiosity and potential discovery that one would have thought they were floating out of their sockets.


I gave her parents a thumbs up, assuring them that it was fine. I have to admit. My curiosity was itching to hear her argument.


""Ok, no laugh at my English. It not very good. so please try your best sir to translate what I said."" She cleared her throat then proposed her plan.


""Just turn them off or put something over the eggsauces of them to muffle noise. It bothers ears and nature."" She put her hands over her ears and rubbed them in a circular motion.


I glanced at my men who were chuckling at her proposal. I glanced back at the little girl. ""Ok Daryna, right?""


""Correct boss man""


""Here's what we'll do for you. Since you got lucky and talked to the person who's responsible for this construction site, I will try out your strategy.""


She smiled at me then her family.


""However, I will only do this for you, if you and your family promise to quickly make your way past us. We can't leave our machines off for too long. They nooo like. Once they're rumblin they like to stay rumblin.""


She laughed and nodded at me, then continued on the path to the big blue with her family. 


At first the deal was perfectly held up. We would spot Daryna and her family and shut off our equipment. A fair amount of my men weren't too happy with it in the beginning. I couldn't blame them, but eventually most of my men came around. It was a nice five minute break and sometimes Daryna's family would bring us some home made Ukrainian dumplings.


I think they were called varkney or something, but whatever they were, I knew for a fact they were the best fucking dumplings I ever had. Fuck I’m hungry. It's definitely from this large gaping hole in my stomach, but still, I was and am always hungry for another one of Daryna's family's dumplings.


I will never have one of them again, not because I am potentially leaking my blood and intestines onto the forest floor, but because they're gone. They left the country to return to their chaotic home.


At least, that's what I was commanded to tell the investigators if they ever showed up. They never did. 


Daryna was horrible at withholding our deal. Our five minute breaks went from five minute greets to fifteen minute conversations. She was always brewing new ideas, new methods for how things should be done and how she would solve all world problems within two years if she was president of the United World. The craziest part is that I believed her.


She was gifted with a caring yet daring heart. She was all systems go to insert herself into danger if she knew it would help someone. Now the Grinch had a heart three times big, Daryna had one at least twenty times larger especially for her little brother.


Humanity wasn’t something she had given up on. In fact, she even told me her secret method to cope with it. Don’t place your hope in humans. We’re faulty and those of us aware of it are searching for repairs. It sure would be nice if we had someone else to help guide us.


On our last week for the observatory, I began sending some of my boys home early for them to enjoy an early break. Most construction workers don't get to have the luxury of having a break during summer. I made sure mine did. 


It was too friendly of a summer. Birds were singing more angelically somehow, the lake's short waves summoned you to enjoy its crystal touch, and even the tourists were less stupid and annoying.


In the morning, Daryna and her family had stopped by a little longer than usual. My men and I didn't mind. Daryna observed our workplace before gasping. She pointed at the two porta potties used to hell.


""You only have two? I was wondering what smelled like dead animal."" 


I laughed. The stench was awful but you only realized how bad it was when someone brought it up.


""Well Miss Boss Daryna, those two honey holes have been our only saviors for the most extreme emergencies! Without em, you'd be stepping in ""YOU KNOW WHAT.""


I watched her eyes widened as she stared down at the dirt in front of her feet. Her parents were chuckling at our interaction and their three year old was spectating the whole thing on his mom's back. He looked like a little gargoyle. His hands were basically cemented into his mother's shoulders and he was always staring at me with half of his face shielded by his mother's neck. For being a three year old he was more creepy than he was cute.


""I like Miss Boss Daryna. It sounds good on me."" 


I broke free from her baby brother's demonic trance to face her. She was grinning, confidently marching around the site scanning for errors. 


""We need more honey holes, men. They make my family’s face scrunch too much. You don’t want to harm a baby with this disgusting stench, right men?” My men shook their heads in unison.


“Wait mister was-boss, why are they called honey holes when they smell nothing like honey?""


""Well--""


""No sweet smells in the air. Only death.""


My men and I burst out laughing at Daryna. She was the funniest boss any of us had ever had. She didn’t even care for my answer. She was proud of herself for entertaining us like a comedian who had finally found her crowd. She disappeared down the trail with her family before we turned our loud yellow metal back on.


At 5 pm, the project was close to completion so I called up the project manager. When she arrived at 5:22pm it was just me and two of my men. My project manager was very pleased with how quickly we had finished the observatory. 


What she sort of knew was that I had set my main objective to finish this project as soon as possible. I had cut some corners. No, we didn't skip time on the bolting and screwing of the foundations of the project, nor did we sloppily fasten the wooden boards of the observatory. 


The only corner we cut was time. We were too fast fastening the straps on our machines, we basically dumped the cement foundation, and even almost overheated one of our bulldozers leveling the earthy floor. If even one strap isn't secure, shit can go wrong in the blink of an eye. I was aware of this and so were my men. Our project manager wasn't.


There was a crane cradling the reflective chrome dome of the observatory. It was remarkably heavier than standard observatory domes and wider. It had modern technology installed in it, some additional wiring plus some odd implanted projector in it. My guess is it was to show the viewer a more telescopic view of the studded night above. 


When we had strapped it down we barely had to tighten the straps. We had it hovering idle, above the ground all day to avoid dirt and rocks scratching it up.


Our Project Manager was a shorter woman with a suppressed god complex. If there was a delay, she wouldn't make her frustration visible, but she would take actions behind whomever was the unlucky superintendent to run into a delay. 


She always wore a flannel with a fancy tie. It wasn't a nice flannel, it looked like she had torn it off the back of a starved homeless guy. She probably did. I recall forgetting her name because I didn't want to be associated with her, but I know it was something like Amelia or Camila. 


She trusted me with the ""easiest"" site, so she essentially made me the project manager for my site. I didn't know the legality of it nor did I care. I was working hard to climb towards the top, so I took this moment as an opportunity. Well, I know I promised you guys a full confession tonight, but I am feeling a little sleepy at the moment. If I am still alive by tomorrow I’ll make sure to post the rest of it. Heh, stay posted.",2,1763523623.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

So, i'm a trans guy and I matched with this guy on old, and he wanted me to come over to his house for a date. I suggested meeting for coffee out in a public place instead because I felt kind of uncomfortable going to someone's house for the first meeting. He said he was feeling exhausted and just wanted me to come over for drinks and sex which I finally agreed to and was fine with. So I get there and he seemed normal and everything was fine, but once we started drinking and smoking weed, things took a turn for the worst. I mentioned that I work as a social worker in conversation, then he began making really weird comments about having sex with people with severe disabilities among other unsavory things. We relaxed and sat down to have our drinks and he said I seemed like I'm on drugs when I've never touched any drugs in my whole life. We had sex and he was like trying to post pictures/videos of us doing stuff online. I shoved the phone away and told him to stop. Then he really began to act strange, and was saying all kinds of crazy stuff that made no sense whatsoever and was acting extremely weird. He was also acting controlling by saying that if we ever dated I would have to stop doing x, y and z, and that I would probably be blocking him and reporting his online dating profile by tomorrow.At this point into the date, I felt incredibly unsafe and questioned whether he was on hard drugs or was severly mentally ill. As I was leaving, he pulls out his phone, calls his friend, lifts up my shirt, pulls down my pants and shows his friend what I ""have"". I've never ever had a dating experience like this before and I left feeling incredibly shocked, disturbed, used, disrespected, violated and fetishized. Should I report this behavior to the police?

Talk to a professional who specializes in STR tax strategy before doing anything.



**TL;DR FOR THE SKIMMERS:**

We self-manage 9 STR properties. Property #9 generated $72k cash flow + $441k in tax deductions in year one. Here's how:

* Average guest stay <7 days (triggers exception to passive loss rules)
* 500+ hours material participation (we actually manage them)
* Cost segregation study ($250k bonus depreciation year 1) + $191k renovations/furnishing + operating expenses
* Write off ""losses"" against W2 income while cash flowing

**It's 100% legit. But it requires real work and obsessive documentation.**

Full breakdown below ↓



**The Property**

Okay so I keep seeing people mention the STR tax loophole but nobody ever posts actual numbers.

Bought a beautiful chalet-style place near ski slopes about a year ago.

Market draws people from NYC, Boston, Philly, Jersey - high-income areas with short weekend stays.

Average stay is **under 7 days.**

This is **CRITICAL.**

Under 7 days = short-term rental for tax purposes (per IRS Reg. Section 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A) - the property is excluded from the definition of ""rental activity"").

Over 7 days = doesn't qualify for STR tax loophole.

*Completely different tax treatment.*

Average stay is calculated as: number of days rented divided by number of reservations.

**Example:**

* 30 reservations totaling 180 days = 180 ÷ 30 = **6 days average** (qualifies for STR tax treatment)
* 20 reservations totaling 150 days = 150 ÷ 20 = **7.5 days average** (doesn't qualify - over 7 days)

My wife and I self-manage and put in **500+ hours per year** (more on why this matters later).

This is what unlocks the whole strategy.



**Cost Segregation Study - What is this?**

Normal rental property depreciation = 27.5 years (long-term residential rentals) or 39 years (STRs/commercial).

STRs are treated as nonresidential property, so they use **39 years** for depreciation.

So if your property basis is $550k, you write off about $14k/year (1/39 = 2.56% annually).

Fine, whatever.

But a **cost segregation study** breaks down your property into components.

Appliances don't last 39 years.

Fixtures don't last 39 years.

Flooring doesn't last 39 years.

Cost seg engineer comes through and identifies what qualifies for accelerated depreciation (typically **5, 7, or 15-year property**).

The typical range for bonus depreciation is between **28% to 33%** of property value, with **30% being the midpoint.**

The actual benefit depends on the property's land value - higher land values reduce the depreciation benefit.

For our property: **$250k in bonus depreciation, year one.**

**Example breakdown:**

* $800k property with $200k land = $600k depreciable basis
* Cost seg might identify: $180k in 5-year property (appliances, furniture), $60k in 7-year property (fixtures), $40k in 15-year property (land improvements)
* Total: $280k in bonus depreciation (about 35% of depreciable basis, or 28% of total property value)

**Important note:** Cost segregation studies assign value based on the property's characteristics (style, size, construction type) rather than its age.

Whether a property is 30 years old or 2 years old doesn't significantly impact the assessment.

Instead of spreading it over 39 years, we took it *all immediately.*

Cost seg study ran us about **$2.5k.**

Best money we ever spent.



**Bonus Depreciation Update (July 2025)**

Quick PSA - The **One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB)** that passed in July 2025 brought back **100% bonus depreciation** for qualified property acquired AND placed in service after January 19, 2025.

The phase-out schedule is gone.

It's **100% going forward** (made permanent in the tax code, though tax law can always change with future legislation).

If you're buying an STR right now, *this is huge.*



**Year One - The Numbers**

We spent **$191k** on renovations and furnishing (got 0% financing, which was clutch).

All depreciable.

Here's what we wrote off year one:

* **$250k** bonus depreciation (cost seg)
* **$191k** renovations/furnishing
* Mortgage interest
* Operating expenses (cleaning, utilities, maintenance, insurance, supplies, platform fees, etc.)

**Total deductions: $441,000**

**Example breakdown:** $250k bonus depreciation + $191k renovations/furnishing + $30k mortgage interest + $30k operating expenses = $441k total deductions

**Actual cash flow: $72,000**

Cash flowing **$72k** while showing a massive paper loss.

That's depreciation for you - *paper expense, not actual cash out.*



**Revenue Breakdown:**

* Revenue: **$210k**
* Expenses: **\~$80k**
* Operating income: **$130k**
* Mortgage: **$57k**
* **Net cash flow: $72k**

Cash-on-cash return: **22%**



**Material Participation - This is the Magic (and Where Many People Screw Up)**

Here's where it gets interesting.

Normally, rental losses are ""passive"" and can only offset other passive income.

Useless for most W2 earners.

**BUT** \- if you materially participate in an STR, it's treated as a *trade or business*, not a passive rental.

These losses can offset **W2, 1099, business income, whatever.**

**Example of the difference:**

* You have $100k in STR losses
* **Without material participation:** Losses are ""passive"" - can only offset passive income (like other rental income). If you're a W2 earner with no passive income, you can't use the losses. They carry forward but are still passive.
* **With material participation:** Losses are ""non-passive"" - can offset your $200k W2 income, saving you taxes on that income immediately.

IRS has **seven tests** for material participation, but the most common for STR investors are:

* **500+ hours per year, OR**
* **100+ hours AND more than anyone else**

**Important timing note:**

Material participation can begin as soon as the property is **placed in service** (ready and available for rent), even if you don't have bookings yet.

**Example:** You close on March 1st, finish renovations April 15th, list on Airbnb April 16th. Hours start counting April 16th (when it's ready for guests), not March 1st (when you owned it but couldn't rent it yet).

You're accumulating hours from the moment the property could legally accept guests - setting up systems, creating listings, preparing the property, etc.

You have until December 31 of the calendar year to accumulate your hours.

**Critical:** Document these hours **AS YOU GO** with contemporaneous records (time logs created at the time you do the work), not retroactive guesswork.

Get a time tracking app. Use it religiously.

**What we use:** We actually suggest REPStracker for tracking material participation hours.

We hit 500+ hours managing it ourselves, but the 100-hour test is achievable for most people who actively manage their properties.



**Example of the 100-Hour Rule:**

You: **120 hours** managing the STR  
Cleaner: **80 hours**  
Handyman: **30 hours**

Since you have 120 hours (more than 100) **AND** you have more hours than anyone else (120 > 80), *you qualify.*

**BUT HERE'S THE CATCH:** If your cleaner somehow puts in 150 hours and you only do 120, you **DON'T qualify** under the 100-hour test.

You'd still qualify if you hit 500+ hours.

The ""more than anyone else"" part is strict - any single other person, including contractors, cleaners, handymen, whoever.

Track everyone's hours, not just yours.



**What Counts Toward Material Participation Hours**

A lot of people think you have to be physically working on the property, but that's not entirely true.

The IRS focuses on regular, continuous, substantial **operational** activities.

Here's what actually counts (based on IRS guidance and court cases):

**Example of how 500 hours might break down:**

* Guest communication: 150 hours
* Coordinating cleaners: 100 hours
* Managing maintenance: 80 hours
* Booking platform management: 70 hours
* Bookkeeping: 50 hours
* Restocking supplies: 30 hours
* Responding to reviews: 20 hours
* **Total: 500 hours**

**Day-to-day operations (this is where most of your hours come from):**

* Guest communication and customer service *(responding to inquiries, handling issues, answering questions)*
* Coordinating cleaners and turnovers *(scheduling, quality checks, follow-ups)*
* Managing maintenance and repairs *(coordinating handymen, scheduling work, inspecting results)*
* Restocking supplies *(ordering, tracking, managing inventory)*
* Processing bookings and managing calendar
* Handling check-ins and check-outs *(sending instructions, managing lockbox codes, troubleshooting)*

**Property setup and ongoing management:**

* Setting up booking platforms *(creating listings, uploading photos, writing descriptions)*
* Updating and optimizing listings *(adjusting prices, updating availability, improving SEO)*
* Managing the booking calendar and pricing
* Responding to reviews
* Handling guest disputes or issues

**Business operations:**

* Bookkeeping and expense tracking *(categorizing expenses, tracking income, reconciling accounts)*
* Processing payments and managing finances
* Coordinating with contractors and vendors *(getting quotes, scheduling work, quality control)*

Basically, if you're **actively running the day-to-day operations** of the rental business, it counts.

**IMPORTANT REALITY CHECK:**

Making high-level ""strategic decisions"" while someone else does all the actual work doesn't cut it.

You need to be doing the actual management work - coordinating, scheduling, communicating, tracking, organizing.

Think ""operations manager"" not ""passive investor making quarterly strategy calls.""



**What DOESN'T Count Toward Material Participation Hours**

Here's what doesn't count (and this is where people get audited):

**Things that definitely don't count:**

* **Travel time** to and from your rental property (this has been rejected in almost every court case). While you can deduct the mileage as a business expense, the time spent traveling doesn't count toward your material participation test.
* **Pre-purchase research** and property analysis (before you own the property)
* **Time before the property is placed in service** \- property must be ready and available for rent
* **General real estate education** or market research (not specific to operating your property)
* **Time spent arranging financing** or dealing with mortgage/legal stuff
* **Tax preparation time** (hiring your CPA, organizing documents for taxes)

**Gray areas that might not count:**

* **High-level strategic planning** without operational involvement
* **Researching furniture** or design ideas (unless you're actively purchasing and setting things up)
* **Passive oversight** where you're just checking in but not actually managing



**The Property Management Company Problem**

Here's where most people blow up their entire strategy:

**If you hire a full-service property management company, you don't materially participate.**

Why? They're doing all the operational work - guest communication, coordinating cleaners, handling issues, managing the calendar.

And if they're spending more hours on your property than you are, **you don't qualify under the 100-hour test.**

**What works:**

* **Self-managing** (what we do)
* **Limited service providers** \- cleaner who just cleans, handyman who does repairs when you tell them, VA who helps with messages while you make all decisions

**Limited service example:** You hire a cleaner who charges $150 per turnover. You coordinate all bookings, handle all guest communication, schedule the cleaner, and inspect the property. Cleaner just cleans - you're still materially participating.

**What kills the strategy:**

* **Full-service property management** \- company that handles everything while you collect checks

**Full-service example:** PM company handles bookings, guest communication, cleaner coordination, maintenance scheduling, pricing, and calendar management. You just approve major expenses. You're NOT materially participating - they're doing all the operational work.



**The Grouping Election (Advanced: For Multiple Properties)**

If you have multiple STR properties, there's a **massive** simplification available:

**IRS allows you to group all your rental properties as ONE activity** (Treas. Reg. § 1.469-9(g)).

What this means:

Instead of proving material participation separately for each property, you prove it for all properties combined.

**Example without grouping:**

* Property A: 120 hours
* Property B: 110 hours
* Property C: 100 hours
* Total: 330 hours

You materially participate in NONE of them (each is under 500).

**Example WITH grouping election:**

* Total across all properties: 330 hours
* You don't meet 500-hour test
* But if you worked more than any single other person across ALL properties combined, you might qualify under the 100-hour test

**Detailed example (when grouping works):** You have 3 properties. You work 330 hours total. Cleaner A works 100 hours on Property 1, Cleaner B works 90 hours on Property 2, Handyman C works 80 hours on Property 3. Your 330 hours > any single person's hours (100), so you qualify under the 100-hour test WITH grouping.

**Example (when grouping doesn't help):** You have 3 properties, work 330 hours total. But your full-service PM company works 400 hours total across all properties. Even with grouping, you don't qualify because 330 < 400 (you're not the person with the most hours). You'd need to work more than 400 hours to qualify.

**For us with 9 properties:**

We made this election years ago.

Our combined hours across all 9 properties easily exceed 500.

Makes documentation simpler.

**IMPORTANT:** This is an irrevocable election. Once you make it, you can't undo it.

For most people with 2+ properties, it often makes sense, but consult your CPA first since the election is irrevocable.



**Documentation: This is NOT Optional**

Let me be crystal clear about this:

**If you can't prove your material participation, you lose everything.**

The burden of proof is **on you** to show you materially participated.

Here's what you need:

**1. Contemporaneous time logs**

* Created as you go, not retroactively
* Date, time spent, specific activity
* Use a time tracking app or system (REPStracker, Excel, or other tools that create contemporaneous records)
* Don't wait until tax time to create this

**2. Documentation of activities**

* Email/message threads with guests
* Texts with cleaners and contractors
* Booking platform screenshots
* Calendar entries
* Receipts for supplies you purchased
* Photos of property inspections

**3. Contractor/cleaner hours**

* Track how many hours everyone else works
* If using the 100-hour test, you need proof you worked more than anyone else

**4. Detailed records of everything**

* Guest bookings and length of stay (to prove <7 day average)
* All income and expenses
* Property use logs (to avoid personal use issues)

**Personal advice:** Document MORE than you think you need.

If you think something might not count, document it anyway and let your CPA decide.

It's easier to have too much documentation than to scramble during an audit.

**We've been documenting everything since day one on property #1.**

It's become second nature.

Takes maybe 2-3 minutes per day to log time.

Worth it for the tax savings.

**Real talk:** The first month of tracking time felt tedious. Now it's automatic. I log time while waiting for my coffee to brew.



**The Personal Use Trap**

Here's another way to blow up your entire strategy:

**If you use the property personally for more than 14 days OR 10% of rental days (whichever is greater), it becomes a personal residence.**

When it's a personal residence, you **lose the ability to deduct losses** against your other income.

**Example (when 10% is greater):**

* Property rented 200 days
* 10% = 20 days
* 14 days vs. 20 days - **20 days is greater**
* You can use it personally for up to 20 days
* Use it 21 days? You're done. Personal residence. No loss deduction.

**Example (when 14 days is greater):**

* Property rented 50 days
* 10% = 5 days
* 14 days vs. 5 days - **14 days is greater**
* You can use it personally for up to 14 days (not 5)

**What counts as personal use:**

* You using it
* Family using it
* Anyone using it at below fair market rent
* Donation for charity auction (unless buyer pays fair market value)

**What doesn't count:**

* Days spent doing repairs and maintenance (if you're actually working, not vacationing)
* Days between guest bookings where property is available for rent

**Critical:** Keep a detailed calendar showing:

* Guest rental days
* Days available but not rented
* Days you used personally
* Days you were there working on the property

The IRS will check this during an audit.

Don't get cute with it.

**Important note:** Personal use limits are strict. Track your calendar carefully - going over by even a day can disqualify you from deducting losses against other income.



**How The Tax Strategy Works**

Normally you'd write off the building basis over 39 years for STRs (nonresidential property treatment).

But with cost segregation, we wrote off **$250k in bonus depreciation in year one.**

Add in the **$191k renovation/furnishing expenses**, mortgage interest, and operating expenses, and you've got **$441k in deductions** that shield your other income.

If you make **$400k from your job** and create **$441k in losses** from your STR, you could potentially pay **zero taxes** on that income (depending on your other deductions, standard/itemized deductions, and overall tax situation).

**Step-by-step example:**

* W2 income: $400k
* STR losses: $441k
* Without STR: $400k taxable income
* With STR: $400k income - $441k losses = -$41k (net loss after offsetting income)
* The $41k net loss can be used this year (subject to Excess Business Loss limits, but $41k is well under the $610k limit for married filing jointly)
* If you had more income to offset, you could use more of the $441k in losses, but in this example, the $41k net loss is what remains after offsetting your $400k income
* In year 2, if you have $200k W2 income and $50k STR losses, you'd have $200k income - $50k losses = $150k taxable income (or you could use NOL carryforwards if you had any from previous years)

Obviously depends on your specific circumstances, but that's the general idea.

The insane part? You're still pocketing **$72k in actual cash flow.**



**The Excess Business Loss Limitation (Important for High Earners)**

**Here's something most people miss:**

There's a cap on how much non-passive business loss you can deduct against other income in one year.

For 2025, the **Excess Business Loss** limitation is approximately:

* **$305,000** for single filers
* **$610,000** for married filing jointly

(These amounts are indexed for inflation each year.)

**What this means:**

If your STR losses exceed these amounts, the excess becomes a **Net Operating Loss (NOL)** that carries forward to future years.

You can still use it - it just takes longer.

**Example:**

* You're married filing jointly
* You have $700,000 in STR losses year one
* You can use $610,000 this year
* The remaining $90,000 becomes an NOL carried forward

**Year 2 example:** You have $200k W2 income and $50k STR losses. You can use the $50k current year loss plus $90k of NOL from year 1 = $140k total deductions against your $200k income, leaving $60k taxable income. The NOL is fully used up in this example.

**For most people, this isn't an issue.**

Our $441k in losses is well under the limit.

But if you're buying multiple expensive properties in one year or have massive depreciation, you might hit this ceiling.

There are planning strategies to maximize the benefit across multiple years.



**Depreciation Recapture (The ""Pay Later, Not Pay Never"" Reality)**

**Let's address the elephant in the room:**

This strategy isn't ""pay zero taxes forever.""

It's ""defer taxes now, pay later.""

When you sell the property, you'll owe taxes on the depreciation you took (unless you do a 1031 exchange or hold until death for stepped-up basis).

**How it works:**

Bonus depreciation from cost segregation (Section 1245 property - the 5, 7, 15-year components) gets recaptured as **ordinary income** (up to 37% for high earners), not 25%.

Only unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (straight-line depreciation on the 39-year building structure) is capped at 25%.

**Example breakdown:**

* You took $250k in bonus depreciation total
* Cost seg breakdown: $200k was Section 1245 property (5-year and 7-year components like appliances, furniture, fixtures), $50k was Section 1250 property (15-year land improvements like parking lots, landscaping, drainage systems)
* Note: The 39-year building structure itself doesn't get bonus depreciation - it's depreciated straight-line. The bonus depreciation comes from the 5, 7, and 15-year components identified in the cost seg study.
* You sell the property 5 years later
* Recapture calculation:
   * Section 1245 recapture: $200k × 37% = $74,000 (ordinary income)
   * Section 1250 recapture: $50k × 25% = $12,500 (unrecaptured gain)
   * **Total recapture tax: $86,500**

**But here's the thing:**

* You saved taxes NOW at your ordinary income rate (potentially 35-37%)
* You pay taxes LATER at the same ordinary income rate (up to 37%)
* You had the use of that money for 5+ years to invest and grow wealth
* The property (hopefully) appreciated, offsetting the recapture
* **The benefit comes from time value of money, not tax rate arbitrage**

**Strategies to minimize or avoid recapture:**

* **1031 Exchange** \- Roll the property into another investment property. Defers recapture indefinitely.

**Example:** You sell Property A for $1M with $250k in depreciation recapture. Instead of paying $86.5k in recapture taxes, you do a 1031 exchange into Property B worth $1.2M. The $86.5k recapture tax is deferred. You can keep exchanging indefinitely, deferring the tax each time.

* **Hold until death** \- Your heirs get a stepped-up basis. Recapture goes away. (This is our long-term plan for most properties.)
* **Opportunity Zone investment** \- If structured correctly, can eliminate some gains.

**Bottom line:**

You'll owe taxes on the depreciation when you sell, **UNLESS** you:

* Do 1031 exchanges indefinitely (defers recapture indefinitely)
* Hold until death (stepped-up basis eliminates recapture completely)

But even if you do pay the recapture tax eventually, the time value of money makes this incredibly powerful - you get to use that tax savings now and invest it for years before paying it back.

It's still a massive benefit.

Just go in with eyes wide open.



**State Tax Conformity (Brief Note)**

**One more thing to be aware of:**

Some states don't conform to federal bonus depreciation rules.

Your state might:

* Not allow 100% bonus depreciation
* Have different depreciation schedules
* Require add-backs on your state return

**This means:** You might get the federal benefit but pay state taxes differently.

**Example:** You take $250k in federal bonus depreciation. Your state (let's say California) doesn't conform to 100% bonus depreciation yet - they only allow 50%. So on your federal return, you deduct $250k. On your state return, you might only deduct $125k, and add back $125k as a state adjustment. You still get the federal benefit, but your state taxes are calculated differently.

Most states eventually conform, but timing varies.

This doesn't kill the strategy - just means the benefit might be slightly less than the federal deduction alone.



**The Trifecta**

So we're:

1. Building equity (mortgage paydown)
2. Cash flowing **$72k/year**
3. Shielding **\~$441k of taxable income**

This is **the trifecta** of real estate investing - *tax benefits, cash flow, and appreciation.*



**Our Track Record: 9 Properties, Zero Issues (And Why)**

I want to be clear about something:

We've been doing this for **9 years across 9 properties.**

We've never had an issue with the IRS.

Not even a letter.

Why?

**Because we follow the rules meticulously:**

**✓ We self-manage every property**

**✓ We track our time contemporaneously** on every single property

**✓ We keep average stays under 7 days**

**✓ We document everything**

**✓ We use a CPA who specializes in STR tax strategy** (same CPA since property #1)

**✓ We stay well under the personal use limits**

**✓ We do cost seg studies on every property**

**✓ We materially participate** (500+ hours combined across all properties)

**✓ We made the grouping election** early on

**Is it work? Yes.**

Managing 9 STR properties is a business.

We treat it like a business.

That's why it works.

**Could we get audited tomorrow? Sure.**

Anyone can get audited.

But we'd welcome it because we have:

* Years of time logs
* Thousands of guest messages
* Booking records showing average stay under 7 days
* Personal use logs showing we stay under limits
* Cost seg studies from qualified engineers
* Every receipt, every expense, everything documented

The tax savings are real.

The strategy is legitimate.



**Important Things to Know**

**STRs (rented <7 days average) are treated differently than long-term rentals tax-wise.**

This is the entire game.

**You need to self-manage** \- hiring a full-service PM disqualifies you from material participation.

**Get a CPA who actually specializes in real estate and STRs** \- most don't.

Here's what to ask them:

1. How many STR clients have you worked with?
2. Have you done cost segregation studies before?
3. Do you understand bonus depreciation and material participation rules?
4. What documentation do you require for material participation?
5. Have you defended clients in IRS audits for this strategy?
6. What services do you provide (preparation, planning, audit support)?
7. Do you understand the grouping election?
8. How do you handle depreciation recapture planning?

*If they don't know what you're talking about or haven't done this multiple times, find someone else.*

You want someone who's done this for hundreds of clients, not someone learning on your dime.

We've had the same CPA since property #1. Worth their weight in gold.

**The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) made this even better** \- 100% bonus depreciation is back permanently for property placed in service after January 19, 2025.



**The Risks (Let's Be Real)**

**IRS audits are increasing for STR tax strategies.**

They're looking for people who claim material participation but don't actually do the work.

**If you get audited and can't prove material participation:**

* All deductions get disallowed
* You owe back taxes
* Plus interest
* Plus penalties
* It's ugly

**Common audit triggers:**

* Claiming material participation but using a full-service PM
* No time logs or documentation
* Personal use that exceeds the limits
* Average stay over 7 days
* Suspiciously high deductions relative to income

**How to survive an audit:**

* Document everything from day one
* Track time contemporaneously
* Keep all receipts and records
* Use a CPA who specializes in STR tax strategy
* Be honest about your involvement

**Don't try to fake it.**

The IRS has seen every trick.

If you're not actually managing the property, don't claim you are.

The tax savings aren't worth the risk of fraud charges.



**TL;DR:**

Buy STR, keep average stay under 7 days, **actually manage it yourself** (500+ hours or 100+ hours AND more than anyone else), do cost segregation, document EVERYTHING with contemporaneous time logs, avoid personal use over the limits, write off losses against your W2/other income, save on taxes while building wealth.

But this only works if you're willing to:

* Actually manage the property (not hire a full-service PM)
* Track your time religiously
* Keep detailed documentation (receipts, messages, everything)
* Use a specialized CPA (ask the 8 questions above)
* Follow the rules (no shortcuts)
* Understand your state's conformity with federal bonus depreciation

**We've scaled to 9 properties using this exact approach.**

It works. But you have to do it right.



**Obviously not tax advice - talk to a CPA who specializes in real estate and STRs.**



**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:**

* Material participation rules are complex and strictly enforced. The IRS can audit and disallow deductions if you don't meet the requirements.
* **THE IRS IS ACTIVELY AUDITING STR INVESTORS.** This is not a ""set it and forget it"" strategy. You will need to defend your position if audited.
* Document everything - keep **contemporaneous** (created at the time) detailed logs of dates, activities, and hours spent on your STR business. Retroactive logs created at tax time will not hold up in an audit.
* Tracking contractor and cleaner hours is critical for the 100-hour test. If any single person works more hours than you, you don't qualify under that test.
* **Full-service property management disqualifies you from material participation.** If they're doing the actual operational work, you're not materially participating.
* **Personal use limitations:** If you use the property for more than 14 days OR more than 10% of total rental days (whichever is greater), it becomes a personal residence and you lose the ability to deduct losses against other income. Track this carefully.
* **Depreciation recapture:** When you sell, you'll owe taxes on the depreciation you took (unless you do a 1031 exchange or hold until death for stepped-up basis). Bonus depreciation from cost segregation (Section 1245 property) is recaptured as ordinary income (up to 37% for high earners). Only unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (straight-line depreciation on building structure) is capped at 25%. This is a ""defer taxes"" strategy, not an ""avoid taxes forever"" strategy. Plan accordingly with 1031 exchanges or holding until death for stepped-up basis.
* **Excess Business Loss limitation:** For 2025, approximately $305k (single) or $610k (married filing jointly). Losses beyond this become NOLs carried forward.
* **State tax conformity:** Some states don't conform to federal bonus depreciation rules. Consult your CPA about your state's specific treatment.
* Tax law is subject to change. What's true today may not be true tomorrow.
* Individual circumstances vary significantly. What worked for us may not work for you.
* This strategy requires **active management** and significant time commitment. It is not passive.
* The burden of proof is on YOU to demonstrate material participation. The IRS doesn't have to prove you didn't materially participate - you have to prove you did.
* **The examples and numbers in this post are illustrative.** Your actual results will depend on your specific situation, property location, rental rates, expenses, and tax bracket.
* Bonus depreciation rules have specific requirements about when property must be acquired and placed in service. Consult your CPA about timing.
* **For verified information and expert guidance, consult qualified real estate tax professionals** who specialize in short-term rentals and have experience defending clients in IRS audits.
* Some court cases have allowed certain activities to count toward material participation while others have rejected them. The rules are nuanced and fact-specific.
* This post is based on current tax law as of 2025. Future legislation could change these rules.
* **Our experience with 9 properties does not guarantee your results will be the same.** Everyone's situation is different. What worked for us may not work for you.
* The grouping election under Treas. Reg. § 1.469-9(g) is irrevocable. Consult your CPA before making this election.

Like, I can barely fit a toaster and coffee maker on my counter without it looking like a hazard zone. So when I started looking into electric lunchboxes, I needed something that wouldn't take over what little space I have left.

After dealing with sad microwave meals and cold sandwiches for way too long, I figured there had to be a better option. That's when I discovered portable heated lunch boxes, and honestly, they've been a game changer for my cramped kitchen situation.

**Why Electric Lunchboxes Work for Small Spaces**

The beauty of these things is they're compact. Most models are about the size of a regular lunch container, which means they don't hog counter space like a traditional microwave or mini oven would. You can literally store them in a cabinet when you're not using them.

I started researching which ones actually work well, and I found some solid options through this collection of [electric lunchboxes that are perfect for small kitchens](https://athomewave.com/electric-lunchbox). They've got different sizes and styles, so you can pick what actually fits your needs.

**What to Look For**

Here's what matters if you're tight on space:

- Dimensions that fit in your cabinet or a small corner of your counter
- Removable containers that are easy to clean
- Decent heating power (usually around 40-60 watts)
- A carrying handle if you want to take it to work too

Most electric lunch warmers heat your food in about 20-30 minutes. Not instant, but way better than eating cold leftovers or spending money on takeout every day.

**My Honest Take**

I'm not saying these heated food containers will change your life or anything dramatic like that. But if you're working with limited kitchen space and you're tired of the same boring lunch routine, they're worth checking out.

The portable food warmers I've seen are pretty affordable too, usually between $20-$40 depending on the features. That's less than a week of buying lunch out.

If you want to see what options are available, [check out these electric lunchbox models](https://athomewave.com/electric-lunchbox) that work great in compact kitchens. They break down the different types so you can figure out which one makes sense for your space.

At the end of the day, it's just nice to have hot food without dedicating half your kitchen to another appliance. That's the win for me.",1,1763523358.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False
1p0wyvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1p0wyvj/breaking_the_rent_lease_due_to_shady_roomate/,Breaking the rent lease due to shady roomate,"TLDR: Me and my roommates(2) want to break the lease because we are afraid of a guy who lives in the basement. Landlord warns us if we leave we have to pay her for the remaining months.

Full story: The way we knew of him was the during the night (around 9 on a Thursday) when my roommates and me were at the deck just chatting and suddenly a big and tall shaved head guy came from downstairs running with his face covered to outside the property and started howling like a wolf or something. Then again he went outside but this time he was laughing hysterically. The next day our landlord says the new guy complained about us making a lot of noise and that ""he likes the Burnaby noise by law of 10pm cut off time"" and then I told her about his behaviour  and she told me she will speak to him. A couple of days later I was on the deck in the morning having coffee and he came upstairs and told me he is right under the deck and wasn't expecting us to be ""deck people"" and to please be quiet and he was asking me about my roommates. I was seated and the guy was standing in front of me kind of trying to intimidating me (which he did).
Next week same situation, we were on the deck by 9 and the guy just yelled at us telling us to go inside and asking if we want him to come up (like a threat). We told him no, we are just talking, we can't be quieter and then he came back inside. We couldn't believed what happened and stayed there for a bit more. Then this time the guy came out, but this time he came upstairs and tell us to go inside and that we are very loud. This time we confront him and record the audio. We told him we are not going inside, that this is our living space and we aren't yelling. That the deck is exclusive for the people upstairs and he can't be here, if he has complaints he should do it through the landlord. In the confrontation he was miming us and telling us that the next time it will be more than this (another threat). We told him if he doesn't leave we're going to call the police but he said that he lives here, the police won't do anything. We decided to leave him there yelling and we just came back inside.
We messaged the landlord that we are leaving as the house doesn't feel safe since the guy came. We called the non emergency police line and told us the landlord has to sort this and if it happens again call 911.

The 3 of us met the landlord to discuss about him and how to get rid of him. She seemed to be on the same boat as us. The guy is shady and he might be volatile if he gets his eviction served.
We ask her to evict him as he broke the rules, and she said she's meeting the residential tenancy branch to evict him and offer cash for keys if needed. She ask us to write a letter explaining the events so the complaint can get done faster. So we wrote it and gave it to her.

Then again, on a Saturday morning my roommate was sweeping the deck and the guy came upstairs to telling him to stop.

She didn't filed anything, instead she wrote a letter to us saying she got adviced by the residential tenancy officers to tell us to 'keep the peace and call 911 if situations escalate"" and she emphasized that ""we sign a year lease agreement, we had to compensate the landlord for all the rental losses while rental remains vacant"" and then messaged us saying that the guy understood he can't come upstairs and won't threat us again and he's ok with the noise from us.

Now, the house is old. Back in the day it used to be connected with the basement with an interior stairs that now are locked, but you can still hear them and I bet they can hear us.
 
One of my roommates heard the landlord talking with the guy about not going to the deck. And the guy asked her if he can come up after 10 pm if he can hear us.

The guy doesn't seem to have a job. He might work from home but his demeanor suggests he's more inclined to have a physical job. My other roommate sees him just wandering alone around the block randomly. 

At this point even if he gets evicted he knows where we live and our routine.

The landlord told us if we leave we have to pay her the remaining months which is crazy.
We want to leave but we are afraid the greedy landlord sue us if we just leave.
She's putting us under a dangerous situation and she hides herself under the residential tenancy agreement. 

I'm calling residential tenancy branch tomorrow but I wanted to post it for maybe some ideas and hope lol. Their reviews on google has 1.8 stars so I don't think they'll help but is worth the chance.

1p0wyrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1p0wyrj/had_my_first_shift_today_uk/,Had my first shift today (UK),"
I should preface this by saying: I haven't eaten at a McDonald's in about 3 or 4 years. Nor do I drink coffee (this is important)

I came in early for my first shift at 9am. Dressed in a black zip up plain jumper and black trousers. I was supposed to get uniform, but they simply didn't have any so I had to wear a Mcodnalds hat and my name badge. Thankfully I didn't wear anything weird or too casual. All black looks formal enough.

I was expecting to get put on something simple. Perhaps the fries, the grill, or maybe more general cleaning, restocking etc to get a feel for the flow of things.

Nope.

I was put onto the drive through, as the presenter. Giving people their orders etc. It's sort of funny. First ever shift, and put at the end of the whole process when I don't even know how the process looks like.

I don't know what a flat white is. Or how a mcchicken looks like when packaged. Like I said, i don't eat here.

I managed to learn fairly quickly though (curse you drinks person for not using the little things you push in on top of the lids).

Thankfully my trainer was...helpful enough? She kinda just left after a while to do stuff so I was very much on my own. However later on she did bag a lot of stuff and hand it to me which was cool.

But that's skipping ahead.

For the next 7 hours (9 to 4) I discovered a fair though things: 

1. The order UI sucks. I don't understand why it is blocks on a black background. Probably a good reason for it but something nicer wouldn't kill right?

2. Communication by the bagging team. Would tell a customer to pull forward, grab their license plate number and jot it down on the recipt (since the order isnt ready and doesn't look close to being ready), but then about 10 or 20 seconds later I get told it's nearly ready. Too bad I guess? Runner needs to go to the parked car.

3. The whole jotting down their plate thing on the receipt. Doesn't feel...right? Feels like an incomplete system? I don't know. This is more like a nitpick than anything.

4. The whole timing thing. Our goal times. Apparently drive through goal is below 120 seconds. My time goal is below 20 seconds or so. Problem is:

5. The kitchen is slow. Waiting to bag stuff, but nothing immediate is happening in the kitchen. Therefore, my time just ticks up and up and ruins the whole 120 and 20 second goals.

6. UI again. This time for the bagging area. Wasn't shown it too much, but after you click a button what your trying to make...dissappears? IDK. Didnt spend too long baghining, mostly did the fries reading off my drive through receipt 

All in all, the worst part is the system/ui.

I just really dislike it. Need to learn it probably.

I'm frustrated my first shift was the drive through. I feel I can do much better if I did other things before. Having your first shift be: customer interaction, baggining, reading the system, chasing stuff, going in fully blind (my only training videos were on things like ethics and morals and not killing people), and in general big lack of communication from everyone. I didn't know myself I had a shift today. I thought it was just picking up my uniform and doing some more training, or having a tour of what stuff is. Wasn't on my shifts on the app.

Quite fun though tbf. Wouldn't wish for anyone to have this as their first thing they do when working in mcodnalds though. Would sap motivation.",2,1763523295.0,McDonaldsEmployees,2,1.0,False

1p0wwht,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostlostredditors/comments/1p0wwht/mixues_global_dominance_over_starbucks/,Mixue's Global dominance over Starbucks,"If Mixue Ice Cream and Tea were to significantly densify its locations across Japan and South Korea, expand outside East Asia, and somehow manage to ""defeat"" Starbucks, the implications would be massive for the global beverage and fast-food industries.

Here is a breakdown of what that would entail:

🍦 Part 1: Dense Locations in Japan & South Korea
Mixue's core strategy is built on extreme cost efficiency and high volume/low price. To densify successfully in Japan and South Korea, it would need to overcome several challenges:

Real Estate Costs: Both countries, especially major cities, have very high rents. Mixue would need to maintain its small-footprint, low-overhead model to keep prices low.

Quality Perception: Japanese and Korean consumers have very high expectations for food and beverage quality and service. Mixue would have to ensure its low-price offerings are perceived as a great value, not just cheap.

Competition: It would face established domestic rivals like Baskin Robbins (in South Korea for ice cream), Doutor, and local tea/dessert chains, in addition to Starbucks.

Potential Impact: If successful, Mixue could become the dominant low-cost, high-frequency dessert/beverage destination, fundamentally changing how young people and value-conscious consumers in Seoul and Tokyo spend their money on treats.

🌎 Part 2: Expansion Outside East Asia
This is where Mixue's model is truly tested.

The Model Challenge: Mixue relies heavily on its integrated supply chain (from fruit plantations to processing factories) in China to maintain its incredibly low cost. Exporting this massive, centralized supply chain globally is complex and expensive.

Cultural Adaptation: Outside of Asia, the brand identity—centered on its Snow King mascot and affordable price—would need to resonate. In Western markets, it would compete not just with coffee shops but with McDonald's/Burger King (for ice cream) and local boba/milk tea shops.

Target Markets:

Southeast Asia: The most natural next step, where a value-focused model and tea/boba are already popular (e.g., Thailand, Philippines).

The West (US/Europe): The biggest risk/reward. It would have to win over consumers not necessarily looking for the cheapest option but rather a unique experience or a specific coffee type (Starbucks' specialty).

🏆 Part 3: ""Defeating"" Starbucks
To ""defeat"" Starbucks, Mixue wouldn't necessarily need to sell more coffee, but rather capture more total beverage and snack market share and displace the daily ritual.

Starbucks' Strength	Mixue's Counter-Strategy (The ""Defeat"")
""Third Place"" Vibe (Comfortable seating, WiFi, long stay)	""Daily Treat"" Utility (Grab-and-go, quick fix, high frequency)
High-Margin Coffee (Lattes, specialized drinks)	High-Volume Tea/Ice Cream (Extreme low-margin/high-turnover)
Global Premium Brand (Status, consistency)	Global Value Brand (Accessibility, fun, frequent affordability)
Mobile Order/App Loyalty	Speed and Price (Making it so cheap and fast that the app is almost unnecessary for daily use)

How the ""Defeat"" Might Look:

Market Share Erosion: By offering a $1-2 ice cream cone or tea on every major street corner, Mixue would take away the impulse/after-meal treat purchases from Starbucks, eroding its total transaction volume.

Generational Shift: Mixue could become the default brand for Gen Z and younger—a fun, non-intimidating, and affordable place, contrasting with Starbucks' more ""adult"" or ""corporate"" image.

Global Store Count: Mixue already has a massive store count (over 32,000 globally). By aggressively expanding and maintaining its unit economics, it could easily double or triple Starbucks' physical footprint, dominating sheer accessibility.

Conclusion:

A Mixue that defeats Starbucks is a world where value and rapid, affordable dessert consumption have fundamentally replaced premium, sit-down coffee culture as the dominant daily consumer habit. It would represent a global victory for hyper-efficient, low-cost Asian supply chain management over the established Western premium retail model.

Would you like to explore how Starbucks might adapt to a globally dominant Mixue, or look into the specific supply chain challenges Mixue would face in the US or Europe? That's a powerful and not entirely unrealistic vision, as Mixue's current trajectory suggests its model poses a genuine threat to traditional F&B giants.

Here is a breakdown of the ""what-if"" based on the very real competitive advantages Mixue is already leveraging, particularly against Starbucks.

📈 The Current Reality Fueling the Scenario
The premise is less ""if"" and more ""how far."" Mixue is already executing on two of your conditions:

Store Count: As of late 2024, Mixue had surpassed Starbucks and McDonald's in total global store count (over 45,000 stores globally vs. Starbucks' approximately 40,200). Its expansion is driven by its low-cost, high-volume franchise model.

Expansion Outside East Asia: Mixue has aggressively expanded into Southeast Asia (dominating countries like Indonesia and Vietnam) and has already opened stores in South Korea, Japan, and Australia, with plans for the US (New York City).

The ""defeat"" is therefore a competition for transaction volume and accessibility, rather than coffee revenue alone.

🇰🇷🇯🇵 Densification in Japan and South Korea: The Key to ""Defeat""
To achieve the ""densification"" you describe, Mixue would have to solve its current initial hiccups in these markets (like supply chain and packaging localization) and successfully convert its low-price strategy into a daily habit.

The Price Anchor: In South Korea and Japan, where premium brands are everywhere, Mixue's $1-2 ice cream and sub-$3 lemonade/tea would become the ultimate value alternative. It would target students, high-volume tourist areas, and younger consumers who prioritize a frequent, affordable treat over a luxury experience.

The Model: Its dominance would be built on pure frequency and convenience. By placing thousands of small, low-cost franchised shops in high-traffic urban and suburban areas, Mixue would be physically closer and cheaper than almost any comparable competitor.

Starbucks' Weakness: In this scenario, Starbucks retains its premium ""third place"" status, but Mixue captures the entire ""daily impulse"" market. Consumers might go to Starbucks once a week for a work meeting, but they would stop at Mixue three times a week for a quick, cheap refreshment.

🏆 How Mixue ""Defeats"" Starbucks Globally
The defeat is not in coffee sales, but in the total number of consumer visits and market mindshare for freshly made beverages and desserts.

1. The Supply Chain ""Moat""
The ultimate weapon is Mixue's vertically integrated supply chain. They own:

R&D and production of core ingredients (syrups, tea concentrates).

Centralized factories (60%+ of ingredients are self-produced).

A proprietary logistics and warehousing system.

Mixue’s Edge∝ 
Cost of Goods Sold
Supply Chain Control
​
 
This allows them to offer a $1 ice cream cone with a 31%+ gross profit margin (for the company), making their low price almost impossible for competitors to sustain without operating at a loss.

2. The Franchise Explosion
Mixue's franchise model has a low entry barrier and often requires no royalty or profit sharing from the franchisee—the headquarters makes its money by being the sole supplier of the cheap raw materials.

The Outcome: This turns Mixue into a supply chain company that uses its franchisees as a highly motivated, rapid-expansion retail network. In your scenario, this model is deployed aggressively outside of Asia (US, Europe, Latin America), allowing it to build 1,000 stores in a new market faster than Starbucks can build 100.

3. The Brand Shift (The Snow King Effect)
The Snow King IP and viral, meme-based marketing become a global cultural phenomenon for youth. The brand is fun, self-deprecating, and highly shareable on social media, successfully breaking through the marketing noise in Western markets where Starbucks' brand feels increasingly staid or expensive.

🔮 The Consequence of This ""Defeat""
The Value Shift: Global consumers permanently recalibrate their value expectation for beverages. Anything above the Mixue price point is considered a luxury.

Starbucks' Future: Starbucks would not vanish, but it would be forced to retreat further into its premium niche, emphasizing its coffee expertise, its food menu, and its digital loyalty platform to maintain its margins. It would become a more specialized, higher-end establishment, no longer the everyday treat for the masses.

Global F&B Industry: Competitors like McDonald's, KFC, and local boba chains would be forced into a price war they cannot win, as they lack Mixue's vertically integrated supply chain advantage.",0,1763523105.0,lostlostredditors,0,0.5,False

----

**The Game:** 

The Glass Bead Game is the most important, beautiful, perfect game that has ever been created. It is the ultimate expression of humanity’s artistic drive - harmonious, strategic, elevated. The game is everything, and mastering it will elevate you to heights beyond your wildest dreams. 

**What I Like About This One:**

The Glass Bead Game comes from Hermann Hess’ novella Das Glasperlenspiel or Magister Ludi, and it’s sometimes seen as a kind of a Holy Grail of game design. The game itself is never actually laid out for us in Das Glasperlenspiel, the rules are never really expounded upon, but it is often described as being an abstract, formalized interdisciplinary pursuit that pulls from art, music, history, mathematics and more. Players utilize symbols and forms that create elegant, harmonious connections between seemingly disparate concepts, making it something between a game, an art, and an intellectual subject of intense study.

So I turned it into Yu-Gi-Oh! I love me a Serious Business milieu. 

**What I Would Do Differently:** 

Get the name of the city right. I didn’t dig out my copy of Magister Ludi to reference, and I ended up using the name of a city from Pokemon? 

There’s gotta be a way to make a Serious Business game multi-player, but I didn’t, so everyone else gets to be Joey on the sidelines yelling “You got this Yoog!” while someone else is battling it out with little shiny rocks.",2,1763522975.0,onepagerpgs,0,1.0,False

He got shot in the head while raising his head to see Meadow. Either bathroom guy or the other guy who was pouring sugar in his coffee. ☕️ 
Tony got it. 
No sound. Just lights out. 

Carmella & AJ might have got it too. 50/50
Killer has got them too because they must have a clean look at his face & that’s why. 
Meadow was spared a 100%. 
She must be looking like a shocked bystander to them, at best. They must’ve avoided her while going. 


So what happens next? Meadow is left with estate, that offshore money, bonds & some cash spread around in the house. 

But, the question, Who murdered her Dad & why? These questions will be big part of her life from the incident onward. She will spend good chunk of her career doing good, but she will find herself in one of the top government agencies, scanning through Rico files on her dad which will tell her what a giant SOB Tony actually was. 

That will be the real punishment which Tony will be served. His actual punishment isn’t death or can as he predicted. The real justice will be when his kid will never talk about him again, or be proud of what he accomplished in his life. They will rather take the pride in showing work of their great grandfather who was a stonemason & helped building the churches. 
Tony will be hated & considered the worst human being in the eyes of people he loved the most. 
That is gonna be the justice. 
To be forgotten. 
Once & forever. 

There is no other reason why Meadow steered away from Paediatrician to Criminal Law.  
Everything adds up by the end. 
God doesn’t place dice yall. 
Believe it or not, Karma is real. 
What goes around comes around.

1p0wt8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribewood/comments/1p0wt8l/what_is_acacia_wood/,What is Acacia Wood?,"Acacia wood is a type of hardwood that comes from the Acacia tree, which is native to regions like Australia, Africa, and parts of Asia. It’s known for its durability, beautiful grain patterns, and versatility, making it a popular choice for furniture, flooring, and even kitchenware. But what exactly makes acacia wood so special?

# Characteristics of Acacia Wood

Acacia wood is a dense, sturdy material that can withstand wear and tear. It’s harder than many other types of wood, which means it’s great for items that need to stand up to frequent use, like tables and chairs. The wood has a unique look, with a mix of light and dark tones that range from golden to reddish-brown. The grain is often wavy or irregular, adding a bit of character and charm to the final product.

One of the most notable features of acacia wood is its resistance to moisture. This makes it ideal for outdoor furniture or items that are exposed to high humidity, like bathroom accessories or kitchen items. Acacia’s natural oils help protect the wood from water damage and decay, making it a durable option for long-term use.

# Why People Love Acacia Wood?

Acacia wood is not only strong and practical, but it’s also beautiful. The rich color variations and unique grain patterns make each piece of acacia furniture or décor one of a kind. Whether it’s a sleek modern dining table or a rustic bookshelf, acacia adds a touch of elegance to any room.

It’s also relatively affordable compared to other hardwoods like oak or mahogany, making it a popular choice for people who want high-quality wood at a lower price point. Plus, acacia trees grow quickly, which makes the wood more sustainable and eco-friendly than some slower-growing species.

# How Is Acacia Wood Used?

Acacia wood is incredibly versatile. It’s used in all sorts of products, from furniture and cabinetry to cutting boards and even musical instruments. In the home, acacia is commonly used for dining tables, coffee tables, bookshelves, and accent pieces. Its beautiful finish and durability make it a top choice for kitchenware like salad bowls, spoons, and serving trays.

In addition to furniture, acacia wood is often used for outdoor decking, especially because of its ability to resist the elements. With proper care, acacia outdoor furniture can last for years without showing signs of wear.

# Caring for Acacia Wood

Although acacia wood is durable, it still requires some care to keep it looking its best. It’s a good idea to clean acacia wood regularly with a soft cloth to remove dust and debris. If it’s used in the kitchen, washing it with mild soap and warm water is usually enough. Avoid soaking acacia wood in water for long periods to maintain its strength and beauty.

You can also apply oil to acacia wood to help preserve its color and protect it from drying out. Regular oiling can enhance the wood’s natural shine and prevent it from becoming dull or cracked over time.

# Is Acacia Wood Right for You?

If you’re looking for a strong, beautiful, and affordable wood for your furniture or home décor, acacia wood is definitely worth considering. Its natural charm, coupled with its durability and moisture resistance, makes it a great option for both indoor and outdoor use. Plus, its eco-friendly nature and relatively low cost make it an attractive choice for budget-conscious buyers.",1,1763522845.0,Tribewood,0,1.0,False

My story goes as follows, was a binge weekend drinker(usually none at all during the week), daily nicotine user(zyns) occasional marijuanna user, and work day coffee drinker (1.5 cups - 5 days a week).  Had episodes here and there usually when hungover, tired, dehydrated or stressed.  But, i always attributed it to anxiety, never did i think i had a heart problem or anything like that.  Well, in July i woke up after a long day/night of drinking with friends and heart was racing (might have been what woke me up) fluttering and skipping.  Spent better part of 2 days trying to calm myself down and hoping it would go away on its own.  Finally i went to ER, found out i was in afib, had a 3 day stay in ER and got a cardioversion.  Immediately following the cardiologist said 1-2 drinks of alcohol was fine and cup or 2 of coffee was fine, however i chose to cut it all out entirely.  

Fast forward to now (November), i am 4 months sober and clean (no alcohol, nicotine weed or caffeine).  Had my 2nd follow up with my Cardiologist today and he still said 1-2 drinks and 1-2 cups of coffee are okay.  However, as someone who is around friends and family who drink a lot i think it is safer and less tempting for me to completely avoid it then take the risk and monitor myself.  I have had success replacing alcohol with sparkling water (bubly and waterloo are my favorites), sugar free lemonade, 99.9% caffeine free iced tea,  and non alcoholic beers (athletics and heineken zero are my two favorites).  

4 months post cardioversion now and according to my loop recorder i have no afib events since.  Personally i have felt single irregular beats here and there(at most will last 2 seconds and back to normal) Cardiologist didn’t seem to worried about that and said it could just be extra beats. Other than that i would say i am 100% barring any setbacks, fingers crossed.  

Still figuring out my new normal one day at a time, have taken up playing basketball in my free time but having trouble replacing bar nights with my friends since going to crowded, loud bars when you are sober is not the most exciting way to spend my weekends.  Any suggestions are definitely appreciated :)

Fields used it to escape, steal 3 trucks, murder a farmer, and rape another woman, all in the span of just 90 minutes.","[Convict Free an Hour, Kills and Rapes](https://www.newspapers.com/article/hope-star-charles-fields-crime-spree/185181512/)

Charles Fields was born in Indiana in 1931. He had good report cards, quit school in Indiana at 8th grade. After his parents separated, Fields and his mother moved to Arkansas. There, they worked on local farms. In January 1947, Fields, 15, was charged with raping a young housewife in Yellville. The crime was evidently extremely brutal, with newspapers describing it as ""most shocking and revolting."" Rape was a capital offense in Arkansas, but since Fields was only 15, a plea agreement was arranged. A month later, Fields pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor at the Arkansas Penitentiary. Historically, all life sentences are without parole in Arkansas. The only way for a lifer to be freed is executive clemency. So, the judge added the following recommendation.

>""It is also ordered and adjudged by the court that the defendant, Charles F. Fields, hereafter be denied the rights and benefits of any furlough, parole, or pardon, and if any application for either should be filed in the future, it is requested that the Governor and State Parole Officer investigate said case, and especially require the consent of the prosecuting witness and of the judge, prosecuting attorney and sheriff of Marion County before any favorable action may be extended.""

Fields was a model inmate and never caused any problems. He eventually gained the trust of prison officials at Tucker Prison Farm and became a prison trusty in 1954. He was given a job of attending hogs. At times, Fields was given a .44 caliber pistol to kill wild dogs that attacked the livestock. He started making clemency applications in the mid-1950s. Every time, however, his request was rejected on account of the brutality of the rape. Over time, Fields became resentful. After being turned down for the seventh time on January 3, 1962, he ran out of patience.

Had Fields waited at least a few more years, it is overwhelmingly likely that his clemency request would've been approved.

Unwilling to wait any longer, Fields decided to escape from prison. He walked away from the prison farm, carrying the pistol. He hiked three to the town of Altheimer, where he was spotted B. C. Howard, a prison employee who was driving a pickup truck, spotted him. When Howard stopped, Fields pulled the gun on him. He forced Howard to give him $94 and the truck, and he went southwest on U.S. Highway 79 toward Pine Bluff. He wrecked the truck on a curve. A farmer, 50-year-old Charlie Andrew Mencer, spotted Fields as he drove past him in his truck. Unaware that Fields was a fugitive, he stopped. Fields got into the car and ordered him at gunpoint to drive him to Memphis, Tennessee.

Mencer refused, then lunged for the gun. Fields shot him twice in the chest, killing him. The truck was wrecked during the struggle. Fields fled when the shots drew attention and went to a service station. He kidnapped a man there and ordered to drive him in his truck to Memphis. Fields later forced the man out, but soon abandoned the truck since it was too slow. Fields got between Sherrill and Altheimer on Highway 79. Finally, he went to the home of Gerald and Myrtle Taylor. Gerald was busy and most of the children were at school, but his wife and their 4-year-old son were watching television together.

>Mrs. Taylor testified that Fields had a pistol in his hand, and that, ""He told me to be quiet and to do as he told me and I wouldn't get hurt, but if I didn't that he would kill me because he had just killed a man and what he was going to do now wouldn't be any worse than what he had already done. He pointed the gun at me and asked me if there was any place we could go and I told him 'No' and he said 'then it will have to happen right here in front of your son.'"" Appellant then pushed Mrs. Taylor into the bedroom, and raped her.

Fields raped her a second time before returning his focus to the escape. He made a cup of coffee, and searched for clothes that he could wear. In a short time, Gerald, warned of an escape convict, returned home. Fields forced Myrtle out of the house, into the open, where her husband could see her, while he remained behind the house. Myrtle told her husband what Fields wanted, after which Gerald gave him the keys. As he was driving out of the yard, the prison superintendent and a  deputy sheriff approached, saw him, and gave chase. Fields wrecked the truck three miles down the road. He tried to break into another home, but was cornered by the officers. Realizing there was no way out, Fields surrendered.

>Mrs. Taylor, who according to the evidence, was hysterical, was taken to the hospital, where she was examined by Dr. Charles Reid, a physician of Pine Bluff. Dr. Reid testified that he found evidence of recent sexual intercourse, and that Mrs. Taylor was crying and upset and required a sedative before she could be examined or questioned intelligently.
> 
>While in the car with the officers, Fields was asked by Deputy Sheriff Buck Oliger of Jefferson County, if he had raped Mrs. Taylor. Oliger testified that appellant answered, ""If she said I did, I did."" Oliger also testified that he (Oliger) told appellant that Mrs. Taylor had said that he raped her twice, and Fields replied, ""No, only once.""

Fields was charged with first degree murder and rape. He was only tried for rape since the charge was far easier to prosecute in this instance. On March 27, 1962, Fields was found guilty of rape, with the jury fixing his sentence at death by electrocution. He filed several appeals. In his appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court, he raised several issues, including about whether the prospect of a civil suit resulted in him receiving an unfair trial.

>During the examination of Gerald Taylor, husband of Myrtle Taylor, counsel for appellant asked the witness if he planned to file suit against the State of Arkansas for damages. The court would not permit the witness to answer the question, but Taylor replied, ""I can't answer that."" Appellant asserts that he was attempting to show that the outcome of the instant case would have a material effect on a civil claim for damages against the State of Arkansas (based on the alleged attack on Mrs. Taylor). From appellant's brief, ""If in fact a suit was planned or contemplated, the credibility of both the Taylors testimony would be lessened considerably because of their monetary interest in the civil action. If such action was planned by the Taylors, this fact should have been given to the jury and the evidence weighed by the jury along with the other evidence of the Taylors.""

On December 26, 1962, the Arkansas Claims Commission ruled that prison officials were not negligent in arming Fields. In doing so, they rejected two suits, one for $142,603 by Verca Mencer, the widow of Charlie Mencer, and another for $40,000 by Gerald and Myrtle Taylor. In doing so, the commission noted that Fields had been a model inmate prior to the incident. The plaintiffs were given the option of seeking compensation from the Arkansas General Assembly, but it's unclear whether they ever received any compensation.

On January 14, 1963, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Charles Fields had received a fair trial and the issues he raised were all trivial or outright irrelevant. Fields was denied a rehearing on February 11, 1963. On January 1, 1964, Governor Orval Faubus signed a death warrant for Fields, with his execution being fixed for January 24, 1964. On January 23, Effie Byrd came to the governor's office and pleaded for mercy on her son's behalf. She was directed to John Browning, an aide who handled clemency matters. Byrd talked about her son's history. She noted that he had good report cards when he was younger and had been repeatedly denied clemency prior to his rampage.

Governor Faubus was unsympathetic and refused to grant clemency.

Charles Fields, 32, was executed by electrocution at the January 24, 1964. Fields's last meal consisted of sirloin steak, fried potatoes, baked beans, hot biscuits, coconut pie, chocolate milk. He declined breakfast, but asked for and received a cup of coffee. He had no last words, but told Prison Superintendent Dan Stephens, ""I'm ready to go."" Assistant Prison Superintendent Jim Bruton called Fields, ""The bravest one I ever saw.""

Fields was the last person to be executed in Arkansas prior to Furman v. Georgia. He was also the last man to be executed for rape in Arkansas and one of the last in the entire country. Six men were executed for rape in the United States in 1964. Fields was the last person to be executed in Arkansas prior to Furman v. Georgia.

1p0weko,https://www.reddit.com/r/hifitipstricks/comments/1p0weko/how_to_get_started_building_a_great_hifi_system/,How to get started building a great hi-fi system,"This is for anyone who’s looking into building their first stereo system and wants some guidance on how to do it. It’s basically the main tips I explain to first timers who visit our store.

Below I’ll cover what components you need, how to choose the right ones for yourself, how to explore sound signatures, and a bonus idea on how to pay for a new system.

To start though, it might be worth asking…

**Is going through the trouble of building a stereo system worth it?**

Most people are content listening to music through Bluetooth speakers, soundbars, their phones and so on. Does fidelity really make the experience better?

Something to think about is that our enjoyment of music can be *associative*. We learn to associate the sound of a song (or style of music) that we already know with the feelings it once gave us. In that case even poor quality reproduction can give us the feels we want, as long as its good enough that we can recognise the song (or style), and distortion isn’t distractingly bad.

Two questions then arise. The first is, would we enjoy the music we already love MORE if we heard it in better fidelity? This answer varies from person to person. But if you browse audio subreddits you’ll come across lots of first time hi-fi listeners who describe hearing a favorite song “for the first time,” or getting intense frisson (goosebumps), or crying, or “never going back,” and so on.

It makes sense when you consider that sensory perception is based on contrast. When the different parts of a piece of music are more separated, more nuanced, placed more accurately in physical space, they each command more of our attention and thus the experience is more stimulating to the senses. More stimulation usually makes for a greater emotional response.

The second question is, would we enjoy NEW music more if we could listen to it in better fidelity? This one is almost always a yes. If you have a great system you’ll listen to music more often, you’ll find new music, and your relationship to music will deepen.

**Okay, so here's what you need to build a stereo hi-fi system**

The basic components are a source, an integrated amplifier, and speakers.

Sources are things like network streamers, CD players, laptops, turntables. These things turn your media of choice into an analogue electric signal for the rest of the system.

Unless you know you want to play vinyl records or local music files or something else, I recommend network streaming. This can be a Wi-Fi or ethernet connection. It gives you the convenience of big streaming service libraries and app control. And it’s much better than Bluetooth because it’s more flexible, supports better sound quality, and is less prone to dropouts.

There are two “phases” when it comes to choosing your source, amp, and speakers. First is figuring out your objective needs (logistics). Second is figuring out your subjective needs (audio performance).

**Start by figuring out your logistical needs**

Just ask yourself questions like these:

* Do I want to use Spotify, Tidal or some other streaming service? (make sure the network streamer supports it)
* Do I want to use files in my own music library? (look look for a USB-A input or a streamer with UPnP)
* Do I want to play vinyl records? (make sure your system has a phono preamp — in the turntable, amp or separately)
* Do I want to plug any other devices into my system? (make sure the system has the inputs you need — like HDMI for a TV, or USB-B for a laptop)
* Where will I put the speakers? (this will help determine size and style)
* What performance level am I after? (this will help determine budget, floorstanding speakers versus bookshelves, whether to add a subwoofer, and so on)

As you think about this stuff, keep in mind that there are combined products out there which perform really well. I’m talking about streaming amplifiers (where the source and amp are in one unit) and wireless speaker systems (where everything is inside two speakers).

In general, at the same budget, separates tend to perform better than combined products. But there are exceptions, so if you prefer a combined product, it’s worth a demo to see if you like the sound. Which brings us to…

**Explore your sound preferences**

Hi-fi products (especially speakers, which is the best place to start) will have some degree of “sound quality” and they’ll also have a “sound signature.”

Sound quality is overall fidelity; how accurately does this product / system reproduce the original recording?

Sound signature on the other hand is timbre; what unique nuances does this product / system bring to the sound? This includes things like a room-filling sound vs a focused soundstage, a forward vocal track vs one more relaxed and set back, things like that. It’s affected by each component in the system as well as the acoustics of the room.

There’s no need to get stuck in the weeds, just understand that different speakers and different amps can be of the same “quality” but still sound different. And your goal should be to find components that *play the music you love in a way that enhances the emotions you associate with it*.

So start by thinking about your relationship to music.

What different styles of music do you listen to? Which are most important to you? What qualities (like bass or detail) might enhance them? When do you listen to them? Do you listen intently, by yourself? Do you listen while doing something else? Do you listen with others?

You’ll want to arm yourself with demo songs that represent your music listening habits. This will inform your search for good products (especially speakers, though amps affect timbre significantly as well).

You might also want to browse online and get a feel for what’s out there, and what to expect. Browse a specialist dealer’s catalogue and look at the brands they carry. Look for brands that have expensive high-end offerings, and see what their more affordable ranges look like, cost, and so on.

Then if possible, visit a specialist dealer and actually listen to the products you’re interested in. We all have a unique relationship to the sound of music, so this is the only real way to confirm that you’ll enjoy how a product sounds.

Be sure to check Google reviews for the shop first though, because sadly, a lot of hi-fi shops have terrible customer service. On the flip side a good shop will have friendly staff that are experienced and genuinely trying to help, which makes for a fun experience to learn and try different stuff. At our shop we have an espresso machine to make coffees for clients while we get to know their needs, and multiple private demo rooms — that kind of stuff makes it fun.

If visiting a store is simply not possible, shopping online will have to do. Look for reviews with “tasting notes” of the products you’re keen on. Look for feedback on how a speaker handles highs, lows, and soundstage. Look for indication of timbre: is it more warm and rich, or more clean and detailed?

If I had to make a general rec on this, I'd say busy, exciting music like rock, electronic and pop tends to sound best with a bit of warmth (maybe a lot of warmth depending on the listener). And acoustic recordings, or classical, or jazz, those styles often really shine with a cleaner sound.

**Regarding budget and payment**

If you don’t want to spend more than a few hundred that’s okay, and you may be satisfied with something in that price area. However it’s worth noting that good hi-fi products aren’t cheap things. A lot goes into them, including R&D, engineered materials, craftsmanship, experienced professionals and more — all of which are costly.

That's why sound quality jumps up a lot when you go from a few hundred to a few thousand dollar total system cost. (Not talking about second hand, anything can happen there.) Good products are also built to last and serve you for many years. So if you’re going to invest in a hi-fi system, I recommend getting something that really excites you. Even if that means holding off and saving more funds.

You'll want to prioritise allocating funds towards the speakers first, and then an amp second. The streamer won’t impact the sound quite as much (though it does, but it matters more so when the rest of the system is at a higher standard).

Depending on how you manage your personal finances, you have two options for paying for a new system. You can set aside cash over time and then spend the lump sum at once to acquire the gear. Or you can take advantage of a zero-interest payment plan, which allows you to use a portion of your monthly income and avoid pulling funds that could go into a rainy day fund or investing account.

The second option is much easier on your cash flow and you end up paying exactly the same amount as you would up front. We offer this service to our clients with plans going up to 18 months, which lets them take home new gear without pulling a lot of funds from their account at once. Again, this definitely depends on how you manage your finances — for a lot of people, saving up and settling the transaction in one go is their preferred choice, and that works too.

Okay that about wraps up this primer.

Sam’s Diner sat directly across from San Rafael High, which meant every morning it became a warm-lit holding pen for teenagers running on caffeine and pure disrespect. Our crew had been meeting there for years: Adam and Matt — the loud Caucasian twins; Shant and William — the quieter but more lethal Palestinian twins; plus Jimmy, Steve, and Mitch. A full seven-man breakfast militia.

The roasting usually started before anyone even sat down.

“Jimmy,” Adam said, pointing at him like he was naming a suspect, “back of your mama’s neck look like a pack of hot dogs.”

The table exploded — fists banging, coffee sloshing, Shant wheezing like a broken accordion.

Jimmy didn’t miss a beat. “Boy, shut up. You got on those ‘Roll-Em-Out-Specials’,” he said, flicking two fingers at Adam’s pants. “Your jeans got more wrinkles than my grandma.”

More chaos. Steve almost choked on his toast.

Matt had to shout over the laughter. “Hey, hey — Shant! What happened to Ivan’s mom at Chuck E. Cheese again?”

Shant covered his face like he was about to confess to a crime. “Man… that lady fainted in front of the animatronic band.”
The whole table disintegrated — chairs shaking, Mitch gasping for air, someone pounding the syrup bottle like a defibrillator.

At the next table, a middle-aged guy was trying to order breakfast in peace. The waiter, a thin man with too much optimism for 7:45 a.m., set down the menu with a flourish.

“Yes, sir — the French toast is out of this world,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck dramatically.

William froze mid-laugh, eyes widening. “Oh no,” he whispered. “That’s a nono.”

See, our group had rules. Very simple rules.
Rule #1: All roasting was fair game.
Rule #2: Any cliché spoken within a 20-foot radius was punishable by immediate verbal destruction.
Rule #3 (the most sacred): If you tried to “play it off” — scratch your neck, fix your shirt, adjust your hair — you were done. Finished. Cooked.

And the waiter had just stacked all three violations like pancakes.

Seven heads turned toward him. Seven evil smiles. Seven kids who smelled blood.

Even Sam himself — wiping down the counter — looked over, winced, and muttered, “Lord help that man.”",1,1763521710.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False

* Is there anything you wish you had done earlier?
* Are thumbnails, titles, tags, or upload frequency the most important early on?

I stayed 4 days 3 nights and stayed at Seaside Women’s Hostel in Waikiki! 

Hostel experience: 
Pros: cheap & great stay! I stayed in a 6bed dorm and there were only 2 other women there, so it was fairly private! We were given a set of sheets & pillow case and towel. Everyone working there was so kind. Felt extremely safe as you need a fob to get in the gate to begin with. Great area. Met cool people. Free coffee & brownies in the morning and cold filtered water. Cutie common areas. Clean bathrooms & rooms since no shoes were allowed inside (I still wore shower shoes around, not outside!) Comfy beds as far as hostel bunk beds go!

Cons: None of these things would deter me from staying again, just things that I would change if I could! This hostel has no curtains around the bed, so I used my towels to put up around me when sleeping, it was fine for me. No AC, cooled down fine at night & I used my plane blanket, but man it was hot during the day. The shower area got very stuffy and the shower never actually got hot, just luke warm, which was actually for the best bc I was a sweaty mess in the steamy bathroom & had to stand in front of the fans in the bedrooms to cool off haha. Lastly, not the hostel’s fault but the others in my room never locked the doors. One time I came in and the back door was WIDE open and no one was around… idk what that was about but luckily it was an extremely safe space and I never locked any of my things up, since all of us minded our own business :)

Itinerary: 
Day 1: arrived into Honolulu and took an uber to the hostel, it was about $33 and I landed at 3PM. Checked in to the hostel, changed and got my bed situated. Walked to the beach to catch the sunset 5-5:30ish and then ate at Maui Brewing Company (it was fine but expensive I wish I would’ve gone anywhere else lol) went back to the hostel around 7pm bc I was beat and slept for like 9 hours straight lol

Day 2: woke up at 7:00 am, had a cup of free coffee @ hostel and then started my walk to diamond head! You need a reservation, so I booked from 8-9. Diamond head is about a 45 minute walk (I’m a walker! 2.5 miles) the walk uphill was nearly as tough as the hike itself! I didn’t find it too challenging to get up, I’d consider myself a fairly average in shape person, but I do not work out! There were a lot of people & great views. After the hike I walked back to Waikiki and had coffee & avocado toast at Sunrise Shack by the Honolulu Zoo, again it was fine but I did find it overpriced. The rest of the day I wandered until about 2PM when I was off to a wedding, the reason I was there, for the rest of the day. 

Day 3: rented a car from enterprise on seaside avenue. It was about $75 for the full day. I had breakfast & coffee and Aloha Cafe over by diamond head and loved it!! Then I drove from the eastern side of the island basically around the whole island. Stopping when I found a beautiful overlook, wanted to take a walk, or sit at the beach. Had lunch in Kailua and looked at some shops, stopped at food trucks on the north shore, and basically did whatever I wanted! I was out for about 7 hours and drove around the entire island! Watched the sunset at Waikiki then ate dinner at Stix food court and it was 10/10. Then had an acaii bowl from ALOH which you get a discount at if you stay at the hostel :) such good bowls!!

Day 4: my last day, my flight wasn’t until 8PM so I got checked out & was able to leave my bags at the hostel! Another great perk! I bought some souvenirs from Duke’s marketplace & the international market place at coconene’s! Then spent the day at Kahanamoku Beach, had acaii & steak lunch from the shops by the beach! Then had time to go back, shower at the hostel (amazing of them) and uber to the airport! 

It was a great experience overall and I can’t wait to go back to explore more!

1p0w0dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1p0w0dz/conflict_avoided_too_hard_and_now_im_resentful/,Conflict avoided too hard and now I'm resentful,"First of all, long post, sorry lol. Second, elephant in the room, this is my fault. IATA. I know it's my fault. I feel bad for what I've done. I haven't been and am not being fair to this person. This is my responsibility to fix and I'm not ignoring that. Regardless, I do feel genuinely angry with this person and I have become paralyzed by my own emotions so I'm hoping for some advice.

So here's the background (I swear this is all relevant lol): I am in my third year of college, my friend Y their second, we have been friends since sophomore/freshman year of highschool. Y is diagnosed ADHD and on medication. We are both STEM majors (high workload), I'm really struggling in my degree but need good grades for grad school, so I spend a lot of time studying. Their prospective careers value experience over grades, so they don’t study as much and do lots of internships instead. They want to move out soon, I am staying at home till I finish college, but not just for academic/financial reasons. My parents fight often and it makes my home life fairly unstable. I am my family's emotional 'rock', especially so to my younger sister (16) who does NOT handle the stress well. Soon as the fighting starts it's either 'this is all my fault, I'm gonna unalive myself' or 'this is all their fault, I'm gonna unalive myself'. With my parents being preoccupied with each other and her reacting so violently, I feel there NEEDS to be a third adult at home: enter me. Before anyone suggests it, no, the situation is not severe enough for social services (I've tried. Don't tell them lol). It's not so much the situation that's out of control but their reactions, if they could all get into the habit of taking a fucking breath before going scorched earth, things would be better. And to their credit, they are. Explosive fights are still a threat at my house but they're becoming less frequent. My sister is starting to mature and handle things better. She'll be 18 by the time I finish my degree and I think she'll be independent enough that she won’t need me 24/7. It's not just that I don't reasonably feel like I can leave, I also genuinely think the situation will be better in \~2 years. And in the meantime, free housing and food! When I can use it lol.

I knew this year was going to be particularly rough in my family for a multitude of reasons, so for the first time ever, I confided in another person: Y. I wasn’t so much asking for support as just filling them in on what had been going on + what was going to happen. I mainly just felt like I was going to explode and go mental if I didn’t tell someone. Since then, they have offered support in a variety of ways and I have taken some help. In preparation for the school year, I studied with them nearly every day; they were taking summer classes I was planning on taking so we were working on that together a lot. I was initially planning on preparing alone, but might as well get coffee with them while I do, right? Mainly, I just tell them about whatever bullshit is going on at my house- when I can that is.

Y isn’t perfect, no one is. As a fellow neurodivergent person, I feel bad saying this bc I know it’s not their fault to an extent. That being said: their ADHD makes them hard to be around at times. For instance, I can never get through conversations without being talked over/cut off. I usually just give up talking to them by the second or third interruption, and this has been the dynamic for so long that they don’t even notice when I shut down around them. They also have sensory issues that affect where we can hang out/what activities we can do/what we can eat. Their sensory issues are nearly opposite of mine ironically enough, but mine are less severe, so I’ve just been accommodating them at my expense for years; it’s easier than it would be the other way around. They constantly talk or text me. I get around 8 text messages a day, not counting at least 3 instragram reels. I used to be able to handle it but with school + family drama, I haven’t been able to keep up with it for months. I’ve just been saying that I ‘forget’ to respond bc 1. I genuinely do sometimes, and 2. I can’t exactly ask them to text me less. Along this train of thought, they also want to hang out all the time and take me saying no as me not caring about them.

The last thing is the biggest though; Y claim’s it’s an ‘ADHD thing’ and they can’t control it and at this point, idc if that’s true or not, I’m ready to end the friendship over it. They all but refuse to take ‘No’ as an answer to things. This red flag popped up early in the relationship, and I ignored and therefore enabled it. That was my mistake. These are the examples that come to mind first: When I say I don’t want to eat/hang out somewhere, they claim they are making the request over sensory issues and I’m insinuate I’m being selfish for not wanting to accommodate every time. Same thing with driving- they NEED to carpool with me, in their car, with them driving, Sometimes, when I say ‘no, I’ll drive myself’, they show up at my house with their car 10 minutes before, and if I say ‘no’ again they make a big fuss about how they’ve already drove here and I’m being irrational. There have been numerous times over the years where I have ended up being trapped in a situation/place I didn’t want to be for hours after driving with them, but when I say anything they counter with ‘I get too anxious driving somewhere alone’. The next two examples are what makes my blood boil though, and there’s not a doubt in my mind that it’s justified. There have been times where I’ve told them very explicitly I need space and to not hear from/see them. Both times I have given them reasons and a date to expect to hear back from me and the second time, said I needed space from ‘everyone’ to soften the blow. These were times of crisis, I had seriously hit my social/stress limit and NEEDED breathing room. The first time, they agreed and told me ‘no problem!’, and then proceeded to text me 37 times over the 3 day period I asked for, and be passive aggressive when I came back over me not responding. I had even texted them to remind them that I ‘couldn’t respond to texts rn, I’ll respond the 30^(th)’. The next time, 28 text messages and they Showed.  Up.  At.  My.  Job.   To “Hang Out”.

I was livid. I still am. The problem has gotten worse too, they are no longer just insistent, they’re controlling. For instance, they know I have a gap on Wednesdays between classes, and on the first week of school I (naturally) did not have plans to spend it. \*Without telling me\*, they decided we had a study group together then. When I wasn’t in the library like they expected me to be next week (NEXT WEEK. This ‘study group’ I didn’t know I was obligated to had happened ONCE at this point in time), they flipped out on me, accused me of not caring about them, said they had a panic attack, etc. Despite all this, they did not tell me they expected me to be available Wednesdays until a month into school. By then, I had scheduled a study group with M, one of my classmates, who is rarely on campus and able to study. Y immediately started inviting themself to this study group. Because of my family’s bs, it’s hard for me to keep friends and I don’t have many outside of Y. M is the basically the only person I see outside of classes, we study together for 4 hrs max once a week. She’s super nice and I’d like to hang out with her more but her schedule and my workload don’t accommodate it.

So, I’ve been rambling a bit, here’s where we are now and what drove me to post. Last week, Y texted me, asking if we could ‘get coffee’ on Wednesday, “preferably without M”. I was immediately pissed. M is literally the only person I see outside of Y, she’s only available Wednesdays, and usually only for a few hours. I took “preferably without M” as “you’re spending too much time with your new friend and not enough with me”, and then reminded myself that I was mind-reading and needed to stop. I texted back “that’s the only time M is available, how about Monday?” Monday has a smaller gap in my schedule, which Y pointed out. I said “I have an hour between classes, we can meet at a coffee shop for \~30 to 45 minutes”. Y said “no, I want to meet on campus, have me drive us somewhere off campus, and hang out for a few hours”. By this point, I had basically explained why that wasn’t a reasonable request and was FUMING so I just didn’t respond, I had nothing left to say and was too angry to be diplomatic. A day later they responded with “fine, we’ll just meet at school” “I have stuff to talk to you about. Important stuff. Well, important to me, hopefully it’s important to you too but idk”.

Every time they say ‘we need to talk’ they say ‘you don’t spend enough time with me and I don’t feel like you care about me’ (side note, we currently see each other 3-4 times a week and I spend 4+ hrs of my Saturday with them). I say back ‘I’m sorry, but I’m busy at school and sometimes have to cancel for ‘family emergencies’. I’m already at my limit for how often I can hang out/study’. Their response is always “I’m emotionally dependent on you, you need to spend time with me regularly for my sanity.”. They become increasingly passive aggressive and unpleasant to be around after these conversations and continue to make requests they know I can’t fulfill and when I say no, it’s all “you don’t care about me”, “you’re being selfish”, “I rely on you for emotional stability”. All these (except the selfish one) are verbatim quotes.

So yeah, when I got that last text, I was livid. No way I was about to be chewed out for not cancelling my only other social contact of the week on a whim to get coffee before a midterm. I said I wouldn’t be on campus and we can call instead, and they immediately went ‘nvm’ (to the conversation) and asked why I wouldn’t be on campus. I know from experience that they don’t take answers like “I’m just not available” so instead I replied with “I am too angry for an in-person conversation”.

This is the first time I have ever told them I’m angry at them. “I don’t like \_\_\_”, sure, I’ve done that, but never explicitly “I am angry at you”. Yes, some of this behavior is objectively shitty but still, this is definitely coming out of left field for them. I definitely should have said something sooner, but I didn’t and now we’re here. I am so mad at them all the time. I dread checking my phone because I hate seeing texts from them, ‘good’ or bad. I skip classes because I know they’ll show up outside my classes before they start/end to ambush me when I’m not receptive enough. I feel on high alert on campus because of them and at home because of my family, and I’m cracking. I’m honestly ready for the friendship to be over but I don’t think its an option bc they know where I live, have a house key, know where I work, know my school schedule, and have demonstrated they have no problem showing up uninvited. I keep giving them excuses as to why I haven’t shared my schedule for next semester and the other day, they started looking up what classes they know I need to take in the student portal to find meeting locations. When I told them to quit it, they got mad at me for asking.

When I ask for space, they show up. When I say I can’t text, they text me relentlessly and fault me for not responding. I genuinely don’t feel like I can walk away. I feel like I could tell them tomorrow “I hate you and never want to see you again” (I don’t, I’m just trying to drive a point home) and they would still show up uninvited to try and schedule ‘coffee dates, to talk’. I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like no matter what I’ll do, they’ll respond badly and make my life a living hell over it, but after that last text it’s too late to stop any of it. I don’t know how to start this conversation or how to handle the fallout and I just want to ghost them so fucking badly, but despite it all, they don’t deserve that. Sorry for the long post, I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1,1763520561.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

**Move-in is flexible** anytime between **Jan 15 – Mar 1** (Feb 1 ideal).

My max budget is **around $3,200 for my share** and I’m hoping we can find something that feels like a true home, not a glorified dorm.

# Neighborhoods I’m targeting

* Off the **4/5** or **2/3** lines
* **Brooklyn Heights**
* **Fort Greene** (near Nevins or Atlantic)
* **Boerum Hill / Park Slope** (near Atlantic–Barclays)
* **Prospect Heights / Crown Heights** (around Franklin Ave)

# About Me

* 30-year-old
* Licensed psychologist — WFH 2 days/week doing telehealth quietly from my bedroom
* Friendly but independent; happy to cook together, hang out, or introduce you to my friends, but also totally okay doing our own thing
* Out several nights a week, so you’ll get plenty of quiet/alone time
* Clean, organized, and very respectful of shared spaces
* Have some furniture but flexible if you already have pieces you love
* **Has a cat**. He is very sweet, short-haired, fully litterbox trained, and non-destructive (has literally never scratched or bitten anyone). Mostly naps/hides but will cuddle you if you give him a treat. I’m very thorough about cleaning so there won’t be hair or odors.

# What I’m Looking For

* Someone who pays rent on time
* Clean and respectful of shared spaces
* Likes cats
* Open to signing a **12–18 month lease**
* Ideally would enjoy some chill hangs (and maybe watching *Severance* together when season 3 finally drops)
* Open to living with 1–2 roommates (I’m flexible if we find a great group)
* **Dealbreaker:** No cigarette smoking inside. But drinking or social substance use is fine

# Apartment Preferences

* Decent-quality building (not a party/dorm vibe)
* Elevator + in-unit W/D would be amazing but not mandatory
* A place that feels calm, comfortable, and like home

If this sounds like a good fit, shoot me a message. Happy to chat or meet up for a coffee to see if we vibe!",2,1763520523.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

I’m exhausted.,"I’ll try to focus on the code it’s pretty much down and very excessive but you can hide all on chart objects and show adjust whatever you like. I should have those in a few. Maybe Christmas as I want to properly test my strategy and have a course to go with it live using strictly my indicators I’ve built from my own strategy and 9 years in the market.

Trading isn’t easy by any means but with the right tools and mentor and the ability to be realistic and honest with yourself, you’ll find success.

You have to have an enough mentality. Do you keep trading until the account is gone or what is enough risk what is enough profit.

Do you really need to trade every day?

When is enough losing enough. And what spread is too much and things like that. I’d say risk about 5% your account balance per trade. If you’re scaling I’d say break that into to 10 trades at 0.50% each so risk is still maximum 5% I do 10% and sometimes if I’m retarded and greedy I do 20% never 50% never 100%. 

20% is bad trading but I’m quite confident in my ability and my actual strategy.

So in reality I could afford to blow every single account I have and I’d find a way back but slowly.

So if that’s the case why rush into trades and try to make a $1MM a day even though I could brag about it, I’d rather brag that I helped at least one persons family financially free with the information I’ve learned or the courses I created and the tools I created and all for free.

Why charge because I consider myself an expert😂😂😂😂 nah I don’t but. I have an urge to help. 

I’ll probably be smoking 300 turkeys Thanksgiving week and feeding the homeless.

Why? Why the fuck not. If you can give give and help those in need. 

Giving is easy pay for someone’s coffee and start small or help an older lady reach the top shelf.

Just give and give with an open heart and God will bless you.

I’ve been shit 3 times and stabbed 8 times. I shouldn’t even be here. And now I’m here giving my entire life’s work away for free. 

The odds. I’ll get everything done and most likely sell them off my website but obviously I’ll just do that because I’m curious what others think they are worth but everyone here gets everything for free always.

But I might sell some of the tools I made and help fund Christmas dinners and coats and jackets and sleeping bags and things if that’s nature.

I want to eventually build an apartment building for the homeless that also keeps families together and safe.

I’m quite grateful for all of yall.

Even my scalping has significantly improved. A lot less draw down and a lot more confident.

Does anyone know what I may have?
I woke up yesterday morning perfectly fine, nothing different in my routine. I had my breakfast and then enjoyed my coffee and out of nowhere I get this dizzy feeling which I have never experienced (i haven’t even felt dizzy before). It was not a spinning sensation it was an off balance feeling where my head felt like it couldn’t stay still like it was moving from side to side or a rocking sort of feeling. At the same exact moment I got this crazy sudden rush of nausea and I am used to feeling nausea as I have a fear of throwing up but anyone with this fear knows when they are actually going to and bam I did throw up!! It was awful but after that I didn’t throw up again. It’s day 2 and I still feel that swaying feeling. It only feels okay if I keep my head up with a pillow behind my head.

Fadi creep-ed out of the Babel doors. He went to the nearby woods. Towering trees stood over him, like giants about to crush him. He thought about their tyrant ruler, The Angels. He got on his knees and started digging with his bare hands. The dirt got into his finger nails. It got on his clothes. He was extremely dirty but he didn’t pay any mind. He finally got to a low enough point, where a red cloth finally revealed itself. He grabbed it slowly, lifting it out of the dirt. He looked around paranoid of if someone was watching him, breaking angel's law. It felt as if every animal in the forest was staring at him. No. Not staring glaring at him. They knew that if the angles were to smite him the and the animals would feel it as well . He opened the red bag. He had stashed it there years ago when he was 20. He carefully lifted out a map and compass. Cairo in Egypt was circled with the words, *Paradise* written in his own fathers blood. He held it close to his heart shedding a tear. It went down his cheek just like the Nile near Cairo. He stood up shakily. He walked for hours weaving through the forest mindlessly. He looked up into the sky to see not stars but his controlling overlords. He began anxiety creeping through his warm veins once again. He heard an agonizing scream coming from the skies. Four angles were holding an escapee up into the air. Slowly but surely pulling him apart. He knew he would have to listen to his screams for a few hours more as he traversed the jungle.

He tiptoed around the leaves and sticks careful not to share the fate of the man he heard being tortured. He looked up and was staring into two white pupils shooting right through him. A tiger he thought. This is where my life ends doesn’t it. It moved and he flinched back but instead of lunging it flew away into the night. It was an owl. "" Jeez "" he said under his breath.

A few minutes later he stepped on a vine. A tight rope shot out of the darkness and snatched his leg into a strangle hold. He was blasted into the air and started to hang from the top of a tree. He started to feel sick as he looked down at the ground. A hand from the dark reached at him like a snake lunging at him from tall grass. It grabbed his mouth silencing any noise coming from him. He felt lips near his ear whispering to him. "" Traveler, are you looking for *Paradise* hmm…” Fadi nodded slowly. "" Trust me paradise isn’t as good as it seems.” he uncovered his mouth. He responded "" My father is there he made this map for me when I turned 7. I need to get there.” The voice responded "" Master Anpu, was that his name?” Fadi gasped: "" how did you know!” The voice sighed "" He was the leader of paradise for a while till…….. The angels got to him. He's dead.” Well ….. he paused, "" He’s not exactly dead really. He's being used as a play toy for the angels. I don’t know where he his now. Though we found 9 of his fingers on the edge of the Nile.” Fadi started to cry silently, "" Why are they so CRUEL!” He babbled to himself. He gripped his shoulders and smacked him. "" Shut up! Do you want to die.” he let go of him and stepped back. "" If you want to see paradise we have to get to the next forest before dawn. We’ll be like bugs inside water. The man grabbed the vine and slowly lowered him to the ground he hit the grassy floor with pump. His head hit the root of nearby tree. The man jumped down and cut his leg binding with a bone wound knife. It was roughly strewn together with dark green vines with dirt covering it. The blade part was made of sharpened camel bone. Its handle was made of a deteriorated wooden piece. Fadi grabbed the man’s hand helping him stand up. Fadi looked up and realized how far he went up just a few minutes ago. The trees were towering over them. The man introduced himself as "" Ammon “. Fadi nodded and introduced himself. "" Come on, we need to get a move on.” Ammon whispered to Fadi who nodded silently. They started traversing through the thick and narrow forest. The roots of the trees were overgrown making the floor hard to walk on. The animals looked on curiously for they had never seen a human before. The moon beamed down between the tree leaves illuminating the pair every few steps. With his crude knife he tried to cut through the vines.

A few hours later

They had made a camp fire to cook a rat they found on their venture. Ammon slowly rolled the rat over the fire. Fadi was off into the forest collecting firewood. Ammon had a bad feeling about Fadi. "" His father? Its weird Master Anpu Came 25 years ago. How could he have given that map to *Paradise*. Maybe he left during the night and delivered it to his illegitimate son. Though it's weird, Master Anpu never mentioned him.” He thought to himself. Fadi was stepping around the forest in the dark wading aimlessly. A cold suddenly leaped through his body. His veins ran cold. He felt a strong breeze inside his clothes. His heart started beating slowly and felt freezing as well. He started to hyper ventilate as his lungs ran cold. He fell to his knees causing the leaves and duff crunch under his weight. He felt a slimy hand caress his cheek as his eyes shot open again. The slimy thing wrapped around his whole body making it even more difficult to breathe. There was a whisper in his ear with a raspy high pitched mixture to it. It was a voice that would only belong to an evil being making anyone to be chilly. "" Fadi. I heard your running from the angels.” The caressing continued on the other side of his face. He started to cry but the tears instantly froze. The thing began to speak again: "" You could join me, you know. I could make you as powerful as you want.” The world was spinning. It felt like he was being spun like a ball in a circle. His brain started to hurt. A blistering pain filled his head. Fadi felt like he would soon die due to the pain. The thing continued: "" You feel the pain don’t you? Hmm I can taste your fear. Do you want this power Fadi? To make the angels suffer? Hmm mm?” He felt a slimy tongue licking his forehead which was sweating profusely. "" Gosh there’s so much. So much FEAR! I could shrivel you up into a husk. I could take your soul and leave you wrinkled and dead. You wouldn’t want that,.. would you?” Fadi tried to escape his slimy grip. His grip got tighter: "" Trust me, I'll be back. The devil never lies, I'll have your soul when the angels have fallen.” The cold rushed out of his body and the slimy thing disappeared into the night. He ran back to the campsite tripping over himself. He arrived panting, his lungs were squeezed and his calves were on fire. "" d-d-devil.” Fadi hoarsely exclaimed. Ammon looked at him confused and replied: "" Fadi, what do you mean? Did something happen?” Ammon stood up slowly not sure what to do. He helped Fadi sit down on a log seat he had made. "" Fadi, tell me what happened in the forest.” No response came as the only sound that filled the surrounding area was that of the sparkling fire, its crackling making the silence sound even more deafening. Fadi slumped over falling backward. Ammon looked on without making a noise. He snubbed the fire and began dragging Fadi on the course ground.



***THE DESERT***

The sun began to rise, shining its blazing rays into the deep forest. A musky smell filled the air. Animals began to wake up. Fadi was still knocked out and Ammon was tired. He dragged his legs as he walked. He couldn’t handle it anymore and he dropped to the floor. The animals looked on in disappointment as they laid there. Fadi woke a few hours later as the afternoon sun made the dust in the air visible with a piney scent around the area. Fadi shakily stood up looking around. “Where are we?” He said under his breath. He shook Ammon violently. He coughed as his eyes opened, being blinded by the sunlight shining into the forest. "" What the hell are you doing man!” ( Cough,Cough ) "" Gosh could you have been less violent?” He groggily said to Fadi. Fadi nodded indignantly. Ammon got up on his feet brushing off the dirt on his cloth robes. "" It looks like we're taking longer than we should've. We have to stay low. If we keep at this pace we can cross to the end of the forest by the end of the day and cross the desert overnight.” Ammon told Fadi. "" Okay, if we don't, should we wait?” Ammon nodded. They started their treacherous journey across the forest. The air smelled of dirty animals, old plants and sap covered trees. If you listened closely you could hear ants marching with small remains of dead animals or any other form of food they could find. The sky’s edge turned blood red as the sunset began. Soon after the pair reached the forest's end and looked upon the deserts barren wasteland.

***June 28th 1988***

He slammed the book closed. ( What a weirdo. He’s gone mad, he has) He grabbed the rough handle of his recliner and lifted, making his chair stand upright. He stood up from his red and black entwined recliner. On the arm rest was an embroiled name in golden letters: (*Jefferson)* He never knew the man. He bought it second hand when he moved into his apartment. He slowly sauntered over to his small but usable window. It was slightly fogged up due to the winter season. He opened it to allow fresh air in. ( As fresh as I can get in this dumpster of a city). He heard honking in the distance though the street he lived on was mostly empty of cars. He looked down and saw a man standing under a street light. He looked dead. His body was slumping downwards. The street around mirrored how he looked. His clothes were ripped and disheveled. There was dirt on his pants and visible injection sites all over his arms. Even though it was thirty-three out he was wearing a darkly stained wife beater. There was wet trash everywhere around the man. It reeked of dog and aged urine including excrement. Cocaine*. I remember when I was there.* He remembered. *ROCK BOTTOM. The words rang through his mind. It bounced in his head like a loud echo chamber. It rang and rang. Repeating, torturing him with its noise. It* prickled him, taunting his mind. ( I remember. It was only 10 years ago. He was 19 years old and fresh into college. He went to a fraternity party. They were drinking. Someone over 21 brought it there. Someone handed him a line of cocaine. Never having drugs in his life he was exhilarated by the thought. He sniffed it up like it was his first glass of water after 10 years in the desert. His vision went blurry. He stumbled around and fell to his knees. His brain started to ache, like someone had blown a bomb next to him. He screamed out in pain. Then all of it went away. It was gone. He looked around and everyone looked like black squares. He felt euphoric, like all the struggles of his life were lifted off his shoulders. He felt light as a feather. If someone blew on him he would fly onto the road.) His eyes focused again and snapped back to reality. The man was on the street asleep now, lying on the floor. He felt the chilly air coming in through the window and immediately shut it. He shook his head and went to the bathroom stepping over the cardboard pizza box. He opened the ancient looking wooden door with a dirty golden knob. There were silver accents visible over the white paint the hinges had been doused in. The bathroom was narrow and barely had enough room to stand in. The shower mixed bath was in the forest point away from the door with a deep gray curtain covering it. The toilet was standard white porcelain though the floor around it was dirty with grout. ( I need to clean this up) He thought to himself begrudgingly. His sink had two dirt glass knobs that represent *Hot* and *Cold.* The sink was dirty and had a yellow ring around the drain. There was hair sticking out of it which disgusted him. He turned the knob to the coldest and washed his face with it. He rubbed his face and turned off the faucet. He looked at himself. ( Short haired, rough stubble, brown hair and eyes. He wasn't in the best shape though he was acceptable for his age.) *RING RING RING RING.* He looked towards the kitchen and walked over to it. His kitchen had white tiles *and* brown cabinet*s,* including brown counter tops*.* He picked up the sleek black phone attached to *the wall. ""* Hello? Who is this.” The voice coughed and replied: "" Scott, we need you down at the station we're about to make the catch.” His face scrunched slightly and asked: "" What catch?” "" Remember the meeting up at the Burger King.” He responded with okay and hung up. He looked at his calendar. and saw the address of the Burger King. He grabbed his brown coat from his rustic coat rack. He opened his front door with a loud “*creeeeeeek” Golden* letters *adorned the* bronze plate "" *17 ""* He stepped down the stone stairs. Avoiding the cobweb filled railing. He got into his bright yellow Ford Pinto. The inside was filled with trash and any sort of nick knack he could find at stores. He was an impulsive buyer, and when anything caught his fancy he would buy it. He turned the key and the car burst to life. The engine filled the silence of the parking spaces around here. Disrupting its chilly silence. The headlights were barely visible under the street lights, though after he exited the lights lit up his way. He then remembered what happened just a few minutes ago. The book he was reading was that of an wealthy old author that had been missing for 2 weeks. This was found bound together in a locked box. The rest of the 200 pages worth of book were filled with the words "" *I KILLED HER* "" The words haunted him ever since he read it. He was on trial for the murder of his secret affair. A young 20 year old lady named Vanessa. She was found dead dumped a few miles away from his vacation home. He disappeared before he could go on trial, or even get caught by the police. It seems like this was proof enough. He would tell his chief once they had finished the catch. They didn’t know what the person looked like, only knowing he was in his mid 40s. He had been sending letters to young high school girls. They got a decoy and they would catch him tonight. He arrived at the Burger King and went in. His chief was hiding behind the counter and ushered him over. The bright fluorescent light of the building hurt his eyes and he blinked to help relax his eyes. He went behind the counter and crouched down. "" Scott, our decoy is almost here, if you came any later the goblin would be suspicious. "" Scott nodded and chuckled at his chief's remark. "" Where's Jeffery.” He asked. The chief responded "" I don’t know, said he was sick.” Scott nodded and carried on waiting. The decoy came in a few minutes later. 20 in age but 17-18 in appearance. "" Jeffery. "" She said in a mild tone. She looked around until a bald man was waving at her. "" Over Here! "" He exclaimed excitedly. Scott and the others hopped over the counter with their guns in their hands. "" LIFT YOUR HANDS!” They all exclaimed. Then Scott dropped his gun. It slammed into the white tiled floor making a loud crash. It was his best friend Jeffery. He was sitting there with a shocked expression on his face. Then Scott’s vision was filled with a shade of red. His eyes were burning and a violent rage pulsed through him. Unknowingly his body moved on its own. Acting separate from his head. He lunged at Jeffery, like a lion pouncing onto an unknowing gazelle. He let a guttural roar as his unit held him back, struggling against his pulsating body. "" HOW COULD YOU! "" His friend shoved him to the floor. He remembered this exact scenario though under different circumstances. (He was in a drug induced rage. It was near a bust down pizza place. He had given the manager nine dollars even though the pizza was 7.50. The owner said "" Have a nice day! "" joyfully though you could tell he did it begrudgingly. You could tell he was a pretentious idiot by the way he held himself. Bright embroidered letters spelling out his name, under it was his title *"" Manager ""* He held himself high and he looked at customers with a look of disgust as people turned their backs to him. He grinned at people with a mannequin-like PR smile. He had not given Scott the thirty-three cents extra he had owed him. The same feeling of pulsating rage ran through him and he lunged at the manager. He looked as Jeffery was carried away in hand cuffs. He saw him mouth the words: "" I’m sorry Scott, I truly am.” 

***THE Therapist***

The room was a musty yellow. The light shined into the office. The office smelled of old wood. The scent filled Scott’s nose. His chief's desk was filled with a mess of papers. Manila folders were sprawled open. He noticed one of the top papers closest to the middle of the desk. "" *Letter to the board*. "" It was written in big bold print letters. Under it were a few messy lines. He could make out most of it though another paper was covering some of it. "" *Scott Simmons has had a leap of anger. I w ——— I believe he should visit a therapist of some sort to help with his anger.”* He stopped reading. The silence was deafening in the room. A ringing began to develop in his ears to fill the silence. The chief looked at him solemnly and began to speak "" Scott, I believe you know why you're here.” Scott looked down and nodded. "" Are you back on pills? "" Scott spoke under his breath and responded "" *no “* The chief nodded. "" You need help with your anger, so that I can convince the board to keep you.” Scott wiped his lips which at that point were drier than the Sahara. "" So you want me to visit a shrink then?” He nodded and reached into the inner pocket of his dark linen suit. He pulled a business card slowly out of his pocket. He pushed the card toward the other edge of the desk. It read *"" Dr. Fortatum. 13,W, Shock Checker dr. 1-871-9091”* He looked down at the card and wiped his forehead, he hadn’t noticed how much he was sweating. The room was hot and stuffy. He pulled his collar forward trying to loosen his clothes slightly to let more air in. He took the card and stuffed it into his respective inner pocket of his worn brown leather jacket. He stood up pushing the chair back which made a terrible screeching across the wooden floor. He walked out of the office dazed. He felt sick, like he was going to die. The door closed behind him. He looked back and saw the lit up golden plaque on the door ( *Chief, Jonathon.*) He turned back as his co-worker waved at him standing up from his plain looking cubicle. "" He ya Scott! You gonna be kept on the team?” Scott stared bullets through him. At that moment he couldn’t stand talking to anyone. He shrugged and Craig looked at him with a half frown on his chubby face. Scott walked out of the building not looking back to see Craig’s disappointed expression. The prescient parking lot was mostly empty. Mid day was a hot time for crime around here. Though at night you would be lucky to see a trace of life. He got into his bright red Ford Pinto. He felt something was wrong but he couldn’t place his finger on it. It felt like the world had shifted around him. He rubbed his face. He felt insane,like he was losing his mind. He turned the key to his Pinto and started on the Road. *God I hate Traffic.* He thought as the line moved slowly forward on the highway. He didn’t play his radio, he wanted to have his thoughts to himself. When he stopped at a red light he looked around observing the area. An alleyway caught his eye. A symbol painted in red paint. It was painted on the orange crackled brick wall. It was two hands clasped together, as if in a prayer. He heard honking behind him as he got out of his haze. He looked forward and saw the green light. He pushed his foot onto the gas pedal. He arrived at his apartment and a deep scowl swept across his face when he saw his neighbor Becky. She had large caramel brown hair and wore bright blue overalls with a white tee under it. She was tending to her planter boxes which resided right underneath the stair to his apartment. He got out begrudgingly, he wanted to stay inside his car to wait to enter back into her apartment. He never wanted to talk to her, especially after a bad day. He walked slowly towards his stairs hoping she wouldn’t notice him. "" Oh! Hey Scott, how ya doin?” He looked at her shooting bullets boring into her. She frowned and turned away. He walked up the stairs still avoiding the cobwebby railing. He put his key into the door, turning it slowly, shaking at the thought of going to therapy. He opened the door and went in. He went to his fridge and took out a lukewarm scotch bottle. He pulled out a small glass and pulled out ice filling the bottom of the cup with it. The ice clanged to the bottom dissipating the outside sounds of Jacky’s gleeful humming for just a second. He filled the glass and brought it to his parched lips. The bronze liquid slid down his throat, burning it slightly but lifting the stress on his shoulders. It flew away, now light as a feather. He went to his wall telephone and dialed the therapist's number cringing about having to go. He gritted his teeth and thought to himself: "" I have to do this to keep my job.” The phone rang for a few seconds before the phone was picked up. "" Hello, this is Dr. Fortatum’s office. How can I help you.” She sounded like a young lady probably fresh out of college looking for any job she could get. With a deadpan expression on, he responded in a joyful tone "" I’d like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Fortatum.” She on the other side with a tired expression responded "" Of Course! I’ll transfer you right now.” They were both faking their happiness but they would never know that. The call cut out before a man’s voice came over the phone. "" This is Dr. Fortatum, may I know whom I have the pleasure of speaking to?” His voice was incredibly fake. Scott had to hold in a laugh. His voice sounded as if it had been curated after years of PR training. It screamed that he did this to impress his higher ups. On Fortatum’s side he looked at the door to his room with a grim deflated expression on his face. "" Scott Simmons, is the name. I would like to schedule an appointment.” Fortatum responded with surprise. "" Ah! The person ole Jonathon told me about. I’m very popular with people from the department. I heard you need help with your anger. I should be helpful. I have many techniques to help with anger. If you read the card you can see I specialize in the art of anger management.” (*Cut the PR speech you prick!)* He thought to himself angrily. “ So are you free tomorrow at 2:30?” Fortatum replied “ Of course. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:30 then.” He signed off with his catchphrase *(MAY YOUR BRAIN BE WELL!)*  The phone hung up and Scott laughed to himself but quickly stopped himself as he remembered that he had to get to cleaning his place. His front door opened to his small kitchen. It was narrow and on the left side there were cabinets and a stove under them. They were hazel nut brown and in the middle of them there was an exhaust hood and right under it was a stove and oven mixture. It was white but was yellow in some places from food residue. On the other side there were more cabinets and opposite to the stove was the sink. It was wide and metallic with a long snout sticking out of it like a small elephant. Next to it was a white pale fridge. The majority of the space was for the fridge. The small compartment on top was a freezer. Then the room turned and around the turn was the living room. Against the wall there was his television. The floor transitioned from hard wood flooring into a soft carpet. In the middle of the room was the red and black entwined recliner with the words *(Jefferson)* inscribed into it. There were boxes of random bits and bobs and cola bottles thrown askew. The room reeked of old food that had been sitting there for a while. A hallway leading out of the living room contained the bathroom and the bedroom. On the closer part to the living room there was the door that led to the bathroom. At the end of the hall was his bedroom. He walked in and saw his plain bed which wasn't made yet. His top sheets which were pale and white and were coming off the bed. His pillows were thrown askew and the pillow was coming out of its case. He groaned slightly and plopped down onto the bed. He laid down and stared at the barren gray ceiling. He slowly began to drift into his sleep. He dropped deeper and deeper and finally fell asleep. The next day he woke up around [12.Pm](http://12.Pm) feeling like he had blacked out. *( Though he knew that he hadn't drunk that much.)* He got up and left the room. He went into his kitchen stepping over the *cola* bottles on his way. He saw a manila *post-it* and it read “ Remember Appointment with shrink at 2:30. The conversation came back to him and so did the fact that he had planned to clean his house. He didn't feel like it. Not a single muscle in his body wanted to clean. He went back into the living room and turned on the TV, he grabbed the remote and sat down on his recliner. He found the news channel. The newscaster *( who introduced himself as Jaren)* began speaking about last night's incidents. “Good Afternoon New York City, wasn't that game sure a surprising victory for the Jets. Go Jets ya know what I mean? Well after that we have received news that last night two bodies were found in a backstreet next to a liquor store.” Scott thought to himself “ Jeez New York is going down the drain.” The caster continued “ They are suspected to be part of an infamous gangster group, and it is suspected that this was a drug deal gone wrong. One of the men identified as Gregory Gentraficha.” A picture of the man appeared on screen. He looked tired and beaten, which reminded Scott of himself at the current moment. “ He was holding 3,000 dollars and a note which was stuffed into the inner pocket of his jacket. Written on it was a direct order.” They showed a picture of the note which read *( Kill Porta and grab the product. Show the money to him and when he turns his back stab him. Don't use a gun, it's too loud for a public area. You can keep the money I give you including a 30,000 bonus which you will receive on the 25th of November at 7:52 on the train leading to Brooklyn.)* Jaren continued “ Well folks that seems proof enough, moving onto other news. A new bakery makes headli—” He shut the TV off and looked down at his watch. It read 1:25. He gets up realizing he had to leave now if he wanted to grab a bite before going. He grabbed his keys and went down to his Pinto and turned the key revving up the engine as the cooler began blowing onto his skin, giving him chills. He started driving, stopping at a McDonald's and started on his way to Fortatum’s office. He arrived at the address at 2:20. The building was a big square with no architectural difference from any old office building. There was a sign at the front that read *“ Dr. Fortatum’s Office”* Under his name were his specialties. *“ Anger-Relanshonship-Deppresion”* He felt like this was some sort of trap. The building seemed so uniform and friendly but it made him weirdly nauseated and the hairs on his arms stood up. He got out of his car and walked in as a bell above the door rang. The lobby was small. On the left side there was a solitary hazel nut door with a silver knob that was shining, like it had recently been scrubbed clean. Above that ( a few feet or so) was a golden plaque that read *“ Dr.Fortatum.”* In the middle was a round receptionist desk. The lady sat on her office chair reading a magazine as she laid her legs onto the desk. There were papers strewn all over and around the desk. There was a small room behind the desk that had a printer, fax machine and an abundance of spare office supplies. She quickly adjusted herself and joyfully asked “ What can I do for you today?” Scott looked around again and responded “ I have a 2:30 appointment with Dr, Fortatum.” She looked down and flipped through a notebook and landed on a page. He couldn't read most of the page but at the top *July, 30th,1988.* She looked back up and said “ Mr. Simmons, I presume?” Scott nodded and Fortatum opened the door allowing him in. The room was built with a dark oak. The pillars were a deep brown almost black. There was a ruby red recliner chair that laid across from a small gray chair with a multi colored pillow. In the middle was a small dark brown coffee table. There laid multiple neatly stacked Psychology Today magazines. On top of a small glass coaster there was a lukewarm cup of black coffee. On the walls were fine pieces of art work including an original from Van Ghough. There was also a picture of the street leading out of the prescient. The picture was dated *June, 29th, 1988* in it you could see a man spray painting the logo he saw that day. ( Why did he have that? Who would even take such a boring picture? Even better yet why did he have it framed in his office only after a day.) “ Sit down Scott, let's talk, you're not paying to stare at my office walls now are you?” Fortatum flashed him a PR trained smile that screamed to him, I don't really care about your problems, I just want that one-hundred and twenty dollars for 60 minutes. More silently it said that he was a greedy bastard that thought he was better due to his taste in all forms of things. Scott sat down laying back on the dark ruby red chair. Fortatum started to say “ Well I’ll start off with a hopefully simple question, what causes you to be angry?” In fact it was not a simple question. He couldn't exactly pinpoint why he did. He just felt a surge of anger sometimes. Just like when he aimlessly jumped at the pretentious pity manager, when he didn't give him his thirty-three cents. He had been off drugs for many years, when he lunged at Jeremy. It was weird he hadn’t felt that rage in a desperate amount of time.

Budget around $100,"I have been wanting a new pair of ANC headphones for a while. I used AirPods 2 forever, but lately I spend more time in loud places like coffee shops and the gym, and they are just not cutting it anymore. After a few hours my ears start to feel tired, so comfort really matters to me. 

My budget is around $100. I know I am not getting something on the level of Sony or Bose, but I still hope to find decent ANC and good sound. I listen to pop and folk while working, and something with stronger bass when I work out. I also want something I can wear for hours without my ears getting sore. 

Anyone knows a pair that hits a nice balance between comfort, sound, and price? If there is something that punches above its price around Black Friday, I would love to hear it.",1,1763520089.0,HeadphoneAdvice,1,1.0,False
1p0vtz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1p0vtz7/seeming_immunity_to_addiction/,Seeming immunity to addiction,"I have recently been consuming content around addiction, and stumbled upon ""caffeine"" addiction specifically. I have consumed vast amounts of coffee in my life as it is so ingrained in my culture, yet I have never considered it anything more than a more bitter version of tea which only ever had the effect of making me slightly sleepy, and it has never caused any amount of dependence. Same with alcohol, no matter how much i drink I seemingly can just stop cold turkey with zero consequence. At one point I was consuming alcohol several times a week just like it was a glass of OJ, yet I never developed any addiction and now I haven't regularly drank alcohol for months due to some dental issues.

I am wondering if my ADHD could be interfering with the process that creates addiction and if this is the case for other people. Everything I have read myself points to ADHD causing the brain to be more addiction prone, which is why I consider it so strange that my case is antithetical to this conclusion.

I was wondering if there are any venues that might cater to such musicians to give them an opportunity to play, while the audience is aware of what the performer is going through and can expect it’s not going to be a perfect performance.

1p0vtvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1p0vtvv/my_experience_while_hunting_at_a_mountain_in/,My Experience While Hunting at a Mountain in Southern Utah.,"You know, I still replay the events of this trip in my head, even though it all happened a few years ago now. It was supposed to be the ultimate hunting expedition a classic buddy trip with my friend Gabe down to the Henry Mountains. 

I'd hunted all over Utah, but nothing prepared me for what we experienced down there. It’s hard to even talk about it without getting that cold, sinking feeling in my gut. What started as the fulfillment of a long held dream quickly turned into a week of dread, culminating in an encounter that changed how I look at the wilderness forever.

The kind of anticipation Gabe and I felt that November morning was almost painful. We’d been planning this trip for over a year, ever since we successfully snagged the permits to hunt the Henry Mountains. Anyone who knows anything about big game knows that these mountains, five hours south of our hometown in Salt Lake City, are legendary. They hold giant mule deer that rival anything in the Rockies, and a genetically pure herd of bison you can’t find anywhere else. 

Those permits felt like lottery winnings, and we were practically buzzing as we packed up the RV for the long drive down. The air was crisp and cold, already smelling like winter even though the official snow hadn't hit yet. We talked smack the entire drive, arguing over who would bag the bigger buck, fueled by stale gas station coffee and the sheer excitement of finally heading out to the high desert. This wasn't any normal hunting trip, it was a pilgrimage.

We finally found our spot, pulling the RV up near a dramatic cliff face. The view alone made the five hour trek worth the time and expense. Looking east, the expanse of Utah’s canyonlands unfolded in a breathtaking panorama. The light was starting to turn golden as the sun dipped, painting the rugged landscape in a hue that honestly stopped us in our tracks. It was the kind of vista that felt too big for humanity, instantly making you feel small and insignificant. 

We started setting up the basic camp, and right away, we felt a difference in this place. It wasn't just quiet; it was heavy. We saw the usual sign wolf scat and tracks but then Gabe found a massive paw print near the dry creek bed, too large and oddly shaped to be a standard black bear. It was unsettling, but we shook it off as a mountain lion or maybe just a misidentified bear. Our goal was to get camp secured before dark, so we were running lines for a canopy and hanging up some powerful LED lanterns. That's when I noticed it: hanging low from the branch of an ancient juniper tree was a crude, disturbing object. 

It was a totem made of old, dry sticks lashed together with leather strips, covered in faded feathers. It looked old and intentional. We both stared at it for a moment. ""Native folks probably used it for a blessing or something,"" Gabe mumbled, already pulling it down. I felt a weird prickle of discomfort, like we shouldn’t touch it, but we were focused on utility. We tossed the thing deep into a thicket of scrub oak just outside our lit perimeter and got back to work. As soon as that totem left the tree, the quiet atmosphere turned sharp, like a dropped knife.

The trouble started almost immediately after we discarded the strange marker. It began subtly, with faint, ambient sounds that we initially dismissed as the wind playing tricks. But soon, it evolved into something more focused, like whispers. They weren't loud enough to make out, just a low, indistinct murmur, like someone speaking a language we’d never heard, just beyond the edge of our hearing. It was constant, a low level static that frayed the nerves. 

One night, a few days into the trip, we were just settling down, listening to the crackle of the fire. The air was dead still. Then, from the dense forest line near the cliff's edge, a sound rose up a profound, heartbroken mourning. It wasn’t an animal’s cry, it was distinctly human, full of anguish and sorrow, a sound that chilled you to the bone. It didn't last long, maybe twenty seconds, but the silence that followed felt absolute, crushing. Another evening, while we were around the campfire enjoying a much deserved dinner of chili and cornbread, the forest ripped open with a horrible, piercing scream. 

I’ve heard injured animals before and that definitely was not an injured animal, it was prolonged and guttural, ending in a choke. We grabbed our rifles, hearts hammering, and searched with flashlights, but there was nothing. No tracks, no disturbed brush, just the same oppressive silence that seemed to swallow sound whole. There were other nights, too, when we’d wake up to the rhythmic beat of drums and deep, rhythmic chanting, like some sort of ancient ritual or dance party was happening just out of sight in the deeper woods, invisible behind the veil of night.

It was becoming clear that whatever this presence was, it was trying to mess with our heads, trying to lure us away from the safety of the RV. The most chilling example of this was the night I was jolted awake by Gabe violently shaking my arm. ""Will, wake up! Do you hear that?"" My ears were ringing in the dark silence, and then I heard it the unmistakable, thin cry of a baby coming from the trees. 

We spent an agonizing hour trying to find the source, eventually calling Search and Rescue, convinced a lost infant was freezing out there. SAR arrived hours later, searched, and found absolutely nothing. They looked at us like we were crazy. The next afternoon, the thing tried to trick me directly. I was cleaning my hunting rifle, doing some final checks, when I heard Gabe’s voice calling my name excitedly from the edge of the woods. ""Will! Come quick, you gotta see this! I found something cool!"" He was motioning rapidly for me to hurry. I secured the rifle and took three steps toward him when a voice, clear and solid, said right behind me, ""Hey Will, where ya going?"" I spun around so fast my neck cracked. There, standing just outside the RV door, was the real Gabe, looking bewildered, wiping grease from his hands. 

I whipped my head back toward the forest where the decoy had been, and there was nothing. No movement, no sign of anyone or anything. Gabe must have seen the blood drain from my face because he dropped his rag and asked what was wrong. I just shook my head, unable to articulate the sheer horror of seeing my best friend beckon me into the woods, knowing it wasn't him.

The night before we were scheduled to head back to Salt Lake City, we were completely exhausted from a full day of hunting that yielded nothing but frustration. We collapsed into our bunks around 10 PM. I guess we were so tired that the events of the last week didn't register until 2:00 AM, when a sound ripped me out of a deep sleep. 

It was laughter, but not human laughter. It was a high pitched, rasping sound, like a bird’s shriek mixed with a human snicker, coming from right outside the RV. It felt mocking and malicious. Before either of us could fully sit up, the entire RV started to shake violently not a tremor, but a rapid, rhythmic shaking, like something massive was grabbing it and trying to flip it over. The sound was deafening. When the shaking suddenly stopped, Gabe was instantly alert. 

He grabbed his .30-06 and, believing it was a very large, aggressive bear, flung the RV door open. He didn't even aim, just started shooting three rapid rounds into the absolute darkness, yelling, ""Damn bear!"" All I could hear was the booming of the rifle, and then, a sickening sound: an animal’s fierce growl, immediately followed by a faint, wretched human groan. Gabe had hit something, because the next sound was something heavy and fast crashing away through the dense, dry brush, running deeper into the forest. We spent the rest of the night wide awake, guns drawn, listening to the deep silence that followed.

We didn't sleep another wink. As the first light of dawn began to paint the sky with streaks of brilliant pink, we cautiously stepped out, armed and terrified. The first thing we saw was the devastation around the RV flattened ground, bent saplings, and then, unmistakable evidence of the night’s encounter. There was a huge, fresh paw print, far too big to belong to any black bear, and clear drops of blood leading away from the side of the vehicle. Gabe didn't hesitate. 

We followed the trail of blood and the massive prints leading directly toward the secluded part of the cliff face, the same place the mourning had come from days earlier. The trail ended at an old, gnarled tree right at the cliff's edge. Gabe, focused on the prints, walked straight under its branches. “Think the bear jumped?” he whispered, his voice catching in his throat. He turned back to look at me, but I had stopped about twenty feet back, staring up at the tree, a wave of cold nausea washing over me as the horrifying truth dawned on me. Gabe, seeing my pale, fixed gaze, looked up, too. Hanging from the high branches, wrapped in fading funerary cloth and aged offerings, was a perfectly preserved Native American burial bundle. He was standing directly on hallowed, sacred ground. 

My heart hammered with the realization that we hadn't been dealing with a bear or a mountain lion; we had disturbed something ancient and powerful by removing that totem. We didn't exchange another word. We raced back to the RV, packed our gear in a blur of panicked efficiency, and drove the five hours straight back to Salt Lake City, leaving the Henry Mountains behind us forever. I am convinced to this day that we tangled with something darker than any predator a Skinwalker or perhaps a Windigo. Whatever it was, the whole sequence of events, from the baby crying to the decoy of Gabe, was nothing more than a carefully orchestrated attempt to lure us into the woods so it could finish what we started when we tossed that totem into the brush.",12,1763520052.0,Paranormal,4,0.93,False

I’m moving to Baltimore soon and was hoping to get some insight from those of y’all who live in these neighborhoods!

I will be doing a 2 day visit soon (first time ever to Maryland!) and am creating a list of places I want to tour while on this quick trip since I will be needing to pick a place kind of quickly shortly thereafter!

I’m mainly looking at row homes that have some charm in the neighborhoods mentioned and hoping to find somewhere that will be a good fit for me as someone in their late 20s! I would love to be living in a welcoming & friendly community that also is pretty walkable! 

**A few things I love (not deal breakers, but definitely bonuses!):**

* coffee shops
* yoga/pilates studios
* beginner pottery or art spots
* walk clubs or other community events
* closer to patterson park or by the water (all dependent on what y'all suggest!) 
* able to walk to grocery/drug stores
* wandering around on foot to explore local places instead of driving everywhere

For those of you in Canton, Fells Point, Brewers Hill, or Highlandtown — what do you love about your neighborhood? Any downsides or things you wish you knew before moving in?

I appreciate any insight and guidance as I know this will definitely make me feel more at ease hearing from locals! This is a big and exciting move for me, but with doing it on a limited time frame, I have some natural nervousness as I want to find the ""right fit"" for where I will be living.

1p0vjs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p0vjs4/my_mom_sent_me_a_christmas_gift_i_think_its/,My mom sent me a Christmas gift. I think it’s breathing?,"My mom sent me a Christmas gift and I’m pretty sure it’s breathing. I’m not quite sure what to do from here, if I’m going to be honest. 

Six years ago, I moved across country to live  with the love of my life, and every year since then, my mother has sent me a gift every Christmas. At first, I would get your usual bits and bobbles - hand lotion, candles, cute decorations, candy, etc. It was the one little connection that I still had with my parents, and something I would look forward to around the holidays. 

A few years ago, the things she sent started to become less cutesy and more niche, but my parents were the evangelical prepping type, so I shrugged it off as them being odd, and tried to appreciate the fact that I was still in their minds, and at the least, that they were tying to protect me somehow. For example, a few years back, they sent me a lamb-skin bible stamped with a golden symbol I didn’t recognize - this was odd because not only were my fiancé and I not inherently religious, but I’m an animal lover, so the thought of a lamb being slaughtered and used for this book was off putting to say the least. 

Next, Jason and I opened a package that had both of our names on it, and in it we found two CB radios with a note that read:

“ Merry Christmas. You need to download the software on the CD you’ll find in the box. Your call sign is Polaris1277. Jason will need to come up with his own call sign. It is very important that you do this. 

From: Curt and June” 

I remember feeling uneasy after reading that, and in a way, almost hurt? Why didn’t they just call themselves mom and dad? I don’t know, I may have been overthinking it, but that being said, I never did download that software, and I never turned on those radios. 

The year after that, I received a burgundy wooden box, and in it lay a peculiar knife. I honestly thought it was some fancy pairing knife, and have been using it as such for years. But the symbols on the blade always perplexed me, if I’m being honest. Though, I tried not to think about it too much. Until now, actually. 

All in all, it’s safe to say that after the last few years, I actually might dread receiving a package from my parents. Today, as  I was pulling into my driveway, a large box sitting on the front porch, caught my eye. Thinking it was something I had ordered, I excitedly placed the car in park and sauntered over. But the closer I got, I could read the large red words: “FRAGILE” on the package and knew that whatever it was, wasn’t what I had ordered. 

“Jas!” 

I called for my fiancé as I plopped the box on our dining room table - it was pretty heavy if I’m being honest.

“Jason, come open this with me! I think it’s from my mom!” 

I heard him tell his friends something before getting off his computer, and when he walked out of the bedroom, he sighed softly and his lips curled into  a sheepish smile, as if he was saying, ‘Oh boy, are you sure you even want to open that?’

I didn’t. I really did not want to open that fucking package, but I couldn’t just throw it away, I would feel too guilty. 

“It’s kind of a big box this time, what do you think is in here? I’ll give you one good guess. Deal?” 

Jason examined the box for a minute and then said, 

“ i thiiiiink we haaaave a….. hmmm.” 

He scrunched up his face almost in a mocking puzzled expression before blurting out his answer, 

“ Computer! “

I laughed and then reached for the scissors to cut the tape on the box, 

“ Let’s see if you’re right. If not, you owe me a coffee.” 

I received a look of disapproval, which made me smile. As I pulled the cardboard flaps apart, and pushed away moist paper wrapping, that smile faded as fast as it appeared. 

What I saw in that box was a wet heap of hair. Fur? I don’t know. I reached my hand down wearily, and when I touched the ball of  whatever it was, my fingers were coated in red. 

“ What the fuck?!” 

Jason didn’t move, he just kept staring at that thing, jaw dropped in shock. His skin washed of color, and I could see the panic in his eyes.

“What the fuck. What. The fuck. Is this? Is this a joke?”

I rushed to the sink to get that warm, red goo off of my hand as fast as I could, and I could feel my heart literally pound. God, I felt disgusting. Scared. Why my parents put carnage in a box for their daughter? I couldn’t figure that out. 

Jason let out a weird squeal type noise, and thats when I turned around to see him reaching in the box, 

“It’s moving…” 

He whispered, and I rushed back over to the table and watched as he poked the fur ball once, then again. And I could have sworn I watched that…thing move like the rise and fall of a gentle breath. 

“Wait. Wait!” 

I stared at the monstrosity and waited. Waited to see the rise of the fur again, and I swear it felt like forever before I caught it again. Sure enough, the ball rose slowly, softly, and then fell. 

Jason must’ve seen it too because he whipped his hand out of the box and stumbled backward a step. It was at that moment I reached for the package and flipped the cardboard top back, closing in whatever was in there. I was almost tempted to tape it back up and take it outside, but part of me also wanted to help it. 

After a brief discussion, we decided to bring the box into the garage while I try to get in contact with my mother. I could have sworn I heard noises coming from the creature inside as I carried it out - faint, short bursting whines. I set the box down on the concrete floor anyways, and practically sprinted out before closing the garage door behind me. Trapping the ‘gift’ somewhere safe as I attempt to get some answers. 

It’s been about an hour, and I have reached my mom’s voicemail four times. I can’t stop thinking about what might be suffering in my garage, but I really don’t know what else to do. I’ll post again once I hear an update.

For now, wish me luck.

1p0vjos,https://www.reddit.com/r/HypochondriacAdvice/comments/1p0vjos/urgent_need_some_advice/,Urgent: need some advice,"Long story short, I’m a female in my early 20s and I’ve been experiencing a wild array of sensations. The sensations consist of tingling/crawling/pins-and-needles sensations throughout my whole body-and when I say whole, I mean literally everywhere. The tingling typically starts at the base of the top of my neck (right above my shoulder blades) and then will transcend down into my lower limbs, including my arms, legs, hands, feet, and even torso. Oftentimes I’ll get the tingling on my head and face, and it feels like bugs are crawling all over-it drives me absolutely insane.

I do take an SSRI (escitalopram 10mg) once daily, but I don’t see how this would cause these sensations in any way. I’d also like to mention that I did have an MRI of my head done in October, and the results came back all clear with no findings whatsoever. My neurologist also suggested that I get an MRI of my C-spine done, but I’ve had to postpone that until I’ve paid all the expenses for my head MRI. I’ve also had bloodwork done and no abnormalities were found.

I exercise roughly 3x a week, I do weights maybe once a week and the other two days I’ll do Pilates. I take vitamins like D3, magnesium glycerinate, vitamin E, and omega-3. I maintain a very healthy diet and keep my sugar intake low (except for maybe one coffee a day with sweetened creamer). I’m not sure what to do, and I know scouring through the internet is quite literally the last thing I should do-but I’ve consistently been given nerve pain prescriptions that haven’t helped and I’ve had it all marked down to just being anxiety. I’m getting so stressed out that it’s something way worse and that finding the root cause to all of this is getting delayed.

I am not someone who drinks super sweet coffee. I'm a little bit of sugar and cream type of person, but I have to add so much just to make the Nespresso coffee drinkable. And even then, it just tastes either bitter or weak. I actually prefer my instant espresso powder which is crazy. (or Kcups)

Honestly I have not had a coffee I have liked from this machine since maybe the first year I had it (bianco leggero knocked my socks off and then went poof). 

I might be ready to move on to a real espresso machine... nothing beats the taste of that, I'm often craving it and the nespresso just doesn't even come close IMO. I've been compressing these feelings, but now I've just had enough and want to express it somewhere. I'm tired of pretending I like it! Lol ",5,1763519228.0,nespresso,18,0.6,False

*""This painting is a catastrophe of proportion and intention. Harrison, once an emblem of spiritual cool, is here rendered as a blocky trench-coated phantom with straw protruding from his shins like he lost a fight with a hay bale. The bench, scrawled with jittery letters, looks less like ‘Dark Horse’ branding and more like the deranged scribbles of a desperate substitute teacher. The background is a brownish blur, equal parts cave wall and coffee spill. What we are left with is not homage, but hostage-taking—a portrait that captures Harrison only in the sense that it imprisons him in aesthetic purgatory. And yet, by failing so spectacularly, it succeeds: nothing could more honestly reflect the uneven shambles of Dark Horse than this oddball rendering.""*",1,1763519029.0,MSPaintAnyAlbumCovers,0,1.0,False
