1g28nnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g28nnm/aitah_for_quiting_on_my_boss/,AITAH/ for quiting on my boss ,"I worked at a coffee just and my boss didn't hire enough people, people are coming in asking for jobs and he just tells them we arent hiring. We already had one person leave and he didn't replace them so we are already understaffed. If someone is sick there's really no one to replace them minus the boss. My best friends brother died and I found out while I was at work with my boss when he asked me to send him something on my phone. I asked to go home as I was obviously crying and he said no ""its your work day you need to work"". Luckily another team member was also there sending him things on their day off and convinced him to let me go. I left and then 30 minutes later he called me saying he had an important appointment in 20 minutes if I could please come back. I don't know why but I thought I would help him out for this and just come back for him to have his appointment and then leave. I come back and he demands I stay because it should get over it that someone had died. He has had many people die before and this person isn't even family. I said I still wanted to leave and he told me again no and if he was suggesting I couldn't leave I didnt think I wanted to work here anymore. He told me okay I can work the rest of today and then not work here anymore, I said no I am going now and I don't work here anymore. I spoke to my other colleagues and they told me I should just apologise and get my job back as if I was in the wrong. I feel like I am not the asshole for quitting or staying because who the hell makes someone keep working whilst they're grieving, its a coffee job not a hospital if we had to close we had to close. And clearly his appointment wasn't that important because he worked through it anyway. I just feel guilty for my coworkers who now have to work even more and probably won't get holidays off now because no one will cover their shifts. ",1,1728763680.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1g28nlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g28nlu/the_burning_cars_on_i10/,The Burning Cars on I-10,"Every day, and every night of the week I made the same commute for almost three years. I used to work at the Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, but I live in Mont Belvieu, always have. It’s an hour drive, but it was simple enough. Just a straight shot down I-10 til you get to Winnie and take the exit onto Highway 73, taking you right into Port Arthur. I’ve driven that stretch of road so many times I could tell you anything you’d ever want to know about it. All the spots to fill up on gas, where to get a bite to eat, every name of every tiny town from Wallisville to Hankamer to Stowell. But, that’s not why I’m posting here. I don’t like to think, much less talk about that drive anymore if I can help it. If it can be avoided, I never drive east. At least, not that route. I’ll take the extra hour, hell I’ll take five if it means I never have to drive that length of I-10 again.

I’m only revisiting this memory that I’ve tried my best to bury for the sake of warning anyone living in the area, anyone traveling through there, a detour may be well worth your while. That drive nearly cost me my life, it’s the very reason I quit working at that refinery. If I’m still breathing after what I saw, I ought to do what I can to tell people about it. Might save someone a brush with the reaper, might not. Maybe they’ve moved on to someplace else. Either way, I like to think this is worth talking about. If nothing else comes of it, at the very least it might help me come to terms with what happened.

It started off unassuming enough. Two months ago, almost to the day, I was making my way home from work. I was tired, hungry, and ready for a shower, but even in such a state there was no mistaking what I saw. There’s a part of the drive between Winnie and Mont Belvieu where there’s little activity, especially at night. You don’t see too many other drivers, or much of anything really til you get close to Lake Anahuac. 

About halfway along that quiet stretch of road is where I saw it. An orange glow, off in the distance, slowly getting closer. I could just make out the pillar of black smoke rising above it, cutting through the dark blue of the night sky. As I closed the distance, the details of the scene became clear. It was a car, completely overtaken by fire, sitting in the median strip of the highway.

At least, it had once been a car. There was little left of it besides the bones. After taking in the sight for a second something really struck me as strange, nobody was around. No cops, no fire truck or ambulance, no signs that anything was out of the ordinary. When I passed by the wreck, I could feel the heat radiating off of it even through the side of my truck. I had the brief thought to stop, see if anyone needed help, but there wasn’t anybody on the side of the road, near the car or further along. I came to the morbid conclusion that if someone was in that car, and they hadn’t already been picked up by somebody, they had gone up in smoke with the vehicle they were in.

I’ve had to deal with fighting a few fires before, a refinery’s not the safest place to work after all, but I wasn’t equipped to deal with something like this by myself. So, I drove on home, accepting that if there was even anyone left to help, I wasn’t the one to do it. When I got back to my apartment I grabbed a beer, heated up some leftovers and tried to not think about what I’d seen. But, it was useless. 

For whatever reason, the image of that burning car had settled itself in my mind, there was something I found captivating about it. I questioned my decision to keep driving, my refusal to get involved. I tried to figure out what had happened with only that one piece of information, but it was futile. It felt like an incomplete picture, and I wasn’t satisfied with any answer I could come to, they all felt wrong. This argument with myself went on for an hour or so before I tired my mind out, and decided to go to sleep. That night, I saw the car again in a dream. I heard someone screaming from inside.

I woke up in a pool of sweat, like my body felt the heat of the fire even from within a nightmare. But, I had no time to worry about that, I had to get ready and hit the road in an hour if I was gonna make it to Port Arthur on time. It was another normal day at work, nothing out of the ordinary. I thought about telling my coworkers about what I’d seen but decided not to. They weren’t exactly a talkative bunch, and that kind of work doesn’t inspire much in the way of conversation. It’s hard, thankless. 

Since I worked there for a while they let me take longer shifts on weekdays to get guaranteed weekends off, usually you’re expected to be available any day of the week if they need you. I took the extra money, but I didn’t see much of a difference besides that. I just got home later. I didn’t do much with my free time anyway, the weekends always escaped me.

When it came time to clock out, an anxious feeling started brewing between my temples. I got worried, wondering if I’d see something like that again tonight. I tried to shake it off, but it followed me outside, stopped me in my tracks when I reached to open my truck door. I felt silly. “What are the chances of me seeing a thing like that again in my lifetime, much less two nights in a row,” I asked myself. This question was enough to quiet my whining nerves, so I got in and drove off the lot to make my way home. If only I knew, the chances were already rigged in advance.

I felt a knot come up in my throat when I made the switch from Highway 73 to I-10 in Winnie. I felt something else was gonna happen that night, another piece of that picture was waiting for me. As my truck glided along the asphalt I scanned the sides of the road, looking for anything to confirm my aching suspicions. Then, near the same spot I’d seen that car the night before, almost down to the mile, I saw the same glow that’d haunted me all day. There was another car between the opposing sides of the interstate, cocooned in flame. But, there was something different from the first wreck I’d seen. All around the car, a circle of people were holding hands.

The sight of them standing there was enough to tip the scales, curiosity weighed too heavy on me to let me keep driving without an answer. I came to a stop, parked my truck on the shoulder and got out to ask them what was happening. But, with every step I started noticing some details about this group of strangers that made me slow my pace. They were all dressed in long black robes, and I couldn’t make out any of their faces. Their features were obscured, even those facing the bright glow of the fire. 

They noticed me coming, and had stopped holding hands. Once I felt I was in earshot I had enough sense to stop my advance before I asked them, “what’s going on here? Is anyone hurt?” They didn’t offer any answer, all staying silent. There was a stomach-churning smell on the air, and it wasn’t the smoke. I tried again, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to stand that close, y’all might get hurt. I can call the police, did any of you see what happened?” At this they finally stirred, suddenly making their way towards me in unison, like they all came to the same decision at once.

I started backing away from them, saying with admittedly little confidence, “easy now, stay back.” This failed to slow their step, so I quickened mine. They didn’t utter a single word, all steadily approaching with their shrouded gazes fixed on me. “I have a gun in my truck, I don’t wanna use it, just calm down!” I was lying, out of some desperate hope this might get them to reconsider their course, but not one of them paused at the threat. I gave up any hope of reasoning with them and turned to run back to my truck. As I did, I heard the scraping of boots across gravel as they began to chase after me. A couple dozen yards had never felt so far.

Luckily I had forgotten my keys in the truck’s ignition, I’ve never been so thankful to be forgetful. I slammed the door shut and kicked the gas pedal to the ground, seeing flashes of them sprinting towards me in my right side mirror. As I took off I felt a thud against the side of my truck, but I paid it no mind as I raced back up to the speed limit. I escaped, but that anxiety I felt at the refinery was nothing compared to the panic I was lost in at that moment. Every few seconds my eyes darted from one mirror to another, looking to see if my pursuers had followed me in their own vehicle. After passing through Wallisville about 15 minutes later I finally eased up, figuring they hadn’t been after me any longer. The thought brought me very little comfort.

Even after concluding I hadn’t been chased back home, I wasn’t much less of a frantic mess when I reached my apartment. When I parked my truck I was breathing sporadically, hesitant to get out, so I took some time to catch my breath. That was when I noticed it, as my eyes reflexively checked that right side mirror again. Something was sticking out of the side of my truck bed. Whatever ease I had settled into left me, my whole body tensed up at the sight of it. I slowly opened my door and walked to the back to see what it was. It was a knife. One of them jammed it into the side of my truck right before I drove off. That’s how close they were.

After struggling for a bit I got the knife unwedged. It was a hunting knife, 8 inches long, still sharp even after being stabbed into the chassis of a truck. I ran into my apartment, dead bolted the door, locked all my windows, and helplessly paced the floor expecting I’d get a visit from those creeps at any second. Time seems to fly faster when your adrenaline’s pumping, because it wasn’t long before I saw it was midnight. 

I’d been obsessively looking through my window blinds for any shady figures but it was as quiet as ever. I hadn’t eaten anything yet, or even had a sip of water. That calmed me down some, but the whole time I ate I couldn’t stop looking at the knife, now laying on my coffee table. Sleep seemed impossible but I tried my best in spite of that. It took half of one of my emergency trazodone pills and some deep breathing, but eventually I coasted into unconsciousness.

I never dream when I take trazodone, but that night I was right back on I-10, staring into that fire again. This time, those people were there, all in a circle around me. The last thing I remember was them staring at me, all screaming at the same deafening pitch. I woke to that same sensation of a bed soaked in sweat, still groggy from the sleep aid. I dreaded the idea of going back into work, but calling out the morning of had never gone over well before. At the time I was convinced I couldn’t afford to lose that job, and I had no reason that would be good enough for my manager. He was proud to be a bit of a taskmaster.

That day at work was obnoxiously normal. Maybe I was looking for something extraordinary to happen, something to take my mind off of what I’d been through, but no. It was a typical, painfully slow day. When it came to an end, my body just wouldn’t let me leave. I was frozen stiff at the thought of getting back into my truck. My manager noticed me standing there. To my surprise he came up to me, and in a shocking moment of care he gently asked, “what’s got you troubled son?” I tried to play it off, saying I just needed a moment of rest before I took the drive back to Mont Belvieu. He could tell I was lying. “Really? It seems like there’s more to it than that, you’re looking awful pale. You can tell me, I’m off for the night anyway.” So, I told him everything.

I was shocked that he believed me, he even gave me what seemed like some good advice. “If those bastards were there round the same time two nights in a row, they could be there again tonight. I’d say it’s best that you stay here for a little while. Wait as long as you need, then head back home when you’re ready.” I’d never known him to be a man capable of being so warm, especially with his workers, so I decided to take advantage of this rare display of kindness. “Thank you, sir. I won’t be too long, I just don’t want to run into them again.” He could tell how frightened I really was. “Just stay safe son, and don’t get out of your car no matter what you see. You just head straight home. Good night, see you on Monday.” With all that was going on I’d completely forgotten it was a Friday night.

I waited there for an hour. A slow, patience-testing hour, but I refused to leave any sooner. When the clock finally read 10pm I made my way to my truck, and left Motiva refinery. I’ve not been there once since that night, and I’ll never return. Not after what happened on that drive.

Port Arthur to Winnie was uneventful. This late there were only so many drivers out on Highway 73, but I wasn’t worried about 73. I was sitting in silence, no music, nothing, trying to prepare myself for what I might see on the interstate. Just like the last two nights I saw nothing out of the ordinary coming out of Winnie, but I could feel my heart rate rise as I came up to that same spot the cars had been.

My body was tired, my eyes ached, but I didn’t even want to blink else I’d miss something. I had the knife in my passenger seat, and my hand started to grip the handle hard. I could feel how clammy my hands were against the wood. But, that 12th mile came, it went, and I saw no sign of a fire. There was nobody on the side of the road, not a thing. I’d never felt such a sense of relief, like years worth of stress all evaporated at once. It was short-lived. 

A couple miles down the road, my joy was soon snuffed out. I prayed it was just a string of headlights on the other side of the road, but I quickly gave up any hope of that being true. The highway was bathed in an orange glow, brighter than ever before. It took a moment, too long for me to recognize what I was seeing was really there ahead of me, but my vision hadn’t failed. Across the interstate was a line of cars, all ablaze. In front of them, shoulder to shoulder, was a string of people, all facing towards me.

I slammed on my brakes, brought the truck to a halt and made sure all my doors were locked. They didn’t move an inch, but as I looked around I realized what fate awaited me if I didn’t get out of there right away. I saw several cars on the side of the road between me and the barricade. It was hard to tell but the fire’s light was bright enough to make them out. Sprawled on the ground were several bodies, lying in pools of blood. 

Right as the impulse to hit the gas and turn around hit me, my windows were shattered from all sides. There were others, waiting on the sides of the road, and they had surrounded me. One of them reached in and slammed my head against the wheel. This disoriented me enough for them to unlock the car and drag me out, kicking and screaming. They brought me to the barricade, my legs and feet scraping along the asphalt. Once we reached the line of people, my captors grabbed the back of my head, and forced me to look up at one of their number. They broke the line and all flocked to him, the only distinguishable member among them. He had a symbol, a white M, on his hood.

Another hooded man brought him a knife, kneeled to the ground and presented it to him like he was a king. He held it up in the light of the fire behind him, looked at me and said in a cold, gruff voice, “took something that wasn’t yours, didn’t you?” They all began to laugh at this remark, but as he sharply raised his other hand in the air they stopped at once. I opened my mouth to protest, met immediately with a knee to my right side and a twist of my hair. After my silence was ensured, he looked back down at me, and pressed the knife against my neck. 

“You could’ve kept driving last night. You’ve been indifferent all your life, unphased, unbothered. You only had to look the other way one more time. But, you woke up from your stupor, you decided to be curious.” He pressed the blade harder. I felt the sting of a cut, a drop of blood run down my neck. “You wanted answers. This is your answer.” He pulled the knife back, raised it above his head, but just as I readied myself for the plunge one of the others stopped him. I opened my eyes to see blue and red lights flash across his cloaked face, and heard a shout from behind, “Freeze, put the knife down!” the police had shown up.

The masked crowd reacted immediately, rushing towards the cops in mass. Shots were fired off indiscriminately, some flying past my captors and I into the fiery barricade. There was an intense struggle right behind me that only my ears could sense. But then, I felt the grips on my arms loosen, and I saw my opportunity. I struck their knees, shook free and rushed for the treeline on the side of the road. I hoped none of them would follow me into the fields with the cops to worry about, but after the fight on the interstate was far enough away I could hear another set of feet running close behind.

I was tired and weak, my pursuer had little trouble catching up to me. He tackled me into the grass, and in spite of any effort to break out he flipped me over, pinning my right arm with his leg. “You just had to wait as long as you could!” Two punches landed, one to the cheek, one to the nose. He put a hand on my neck, digging his finger into the cut, “I thought about gutting you in the parking lot, but they don’t like me making a mess there. Well, that’s fine by me!” Even through dazed eyes, I saw a glint of light flash across the blade as he raised it above his head.

In the shine of the knife I could see death, and all the years he would take from me if I didn’t resist. Whatever strength I had, any dormant desire to keep living lunged out. I refused to die there on the side of I-10. With my one free arm I punched up, hard as I could manage, and made the bastard bite his own teeth. The knife landed just beside my head. In one swift, impulsive motion I grabbed the handle and shot my arm upwards before I could see what I was aiming for. It pierced his neck, right beneath the Adam's apple.

I pushed him off me, got up and looked down at my attacker. All that anger, that righteous fury had gone, and life was leaving his limbs. His body twitched, his mouth sputtered, and I was looking at a man dying. I briefly wondered what he might be thinking. Was he still angry, was he sorry he had ended up here, in a field off I-10? Or, was he just a blank page with no words left? I came back to my senses shortly, and remembered something he had said as he was just about to put that knife through my eye. Something he shouldn’t have said, but did.

I finally noticed, with just enough light reaching through the trees from the still burning cars, this was the man with the white M on his hood. Part of me may have already guessed, but I had to know. I couldn’t walk away until I knew. I lifted his hood, and saw a face that I’d seen every weekday for almost three years. It was Frank Cotton, 42 years old, father of two, and my manager as long as I had worked at the Motiva refinery. He was lying there, at my feet, choking on his own blood.

After staring at the ruin of that man for a few more minutes, I recalled the fight I had fled from, and realized how quiet it had gotten. I walked back to the highway, only to be greeted with an awful sight. If there was a winner there was no one left to claim it, as dozens of bodies laid lifeless between the two shoulders of the road. I walked over them, around them, slowly making my way over to my truck. I was lucky enough to be alive, but not enough to have an easy way out of there, all four tires had been slashed. The cop cars were no better, believe me I tried. 

So, I started walking. I walked all the way from there to Wallisville. It took me about five hours, I got there around 4am. The whole trek there I clutched the handle of that knife, listened for any give that I may have been followed. I was expecting I might meet one of those hooded freaks along the way. Once again, I was lucky. 

I found a small church, Middleton Memorial Methodist off the feeder road, and slept in the grass near the back door. I was terrified, but I couldn’t stay awake any longer. It barely felt like I had slept at all when I was woken by a pastor. He was kind enough to give me water and some food. As I got ready to explain everything, his radio already started telling the story. 37 found dead on Interstate 10 between Winnie and Anahuac. 8 were police officers. 20 of the other 29 bodies were all wearing matching uniforms. One was found in a field nearby.

After we ate, the pastor gave me a lift to my place back in Mont Belvieu. He never asked me what happened, why I was passed out behind his church, but I don’t think he needed to. That was two months ago, almost to the day. I work in Seabrook now, not sure I should say where. It’s a shorter commute thankfully, and I’ve been working on moving soon, maybe there, maybe League City, we’ll see. I don’t know what Frank was really up to with those people, if they had anything to do with Motiva, and I’m never going to know. I’m not looking for answers anymore, I made it out with my skin still on and my heart still beating, that’s all I can ask for. The last thing to do before I can leave this all behind me for good is tell people what really happened that night.

If you’re driving into Houston from the east, and you find yourself on that stretch of I-10 at night, don’t stop for anyone or anything. No matter what you see, it’s best you don’t get involved, and keep on driving. They may still be there, they may not, I’m not gonna be the one to find out. I hope you never have to find out. Lastly, if anyone who still works at that refinery happens to read this, keep it to yourself. Don’t ask questions, don’t let on that you’ve even heard of someone named Frank Cotton. You might be putting yourself in danger just by knowing this ever happened. Stay safe, stay alert, and never stop for a burning car on Interstate 10.",1,1728763676.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1g28lra,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddicts/comments/1g28lra/help_struggling_with_acne_perioral_dermatitis/,"Help! Struggling with Acne, Perioral Dermatitis, & Feeling Unsure about Diagnosis...","Hey everyone, this is my first Reddit post! Sorry in advance - this is a bit long, but I’m feeling desperate and really hoping someone out there has been through something similar and found a solution. I am still waiting to be accepted into the PD forum so chose to post this here in the meantime. Fingers crossed someone can help!

About two months ago, I started getting more whiteheads on my chin. Normally, I have clear skin, but I was going through a rough patch, so I thought the breakouts might be stress-related. I also tweezed a few chin hairs and wondered if the whiteheads were ingrown hairs. At the same time, I also got a cyst pimple on my chin, and had a non-surgical ganglion cyst treatment ""Aspiration"" that left me with a scar/dimples and almost a slightly deformed chin (to what it was before anyway).

To tackle the whiteheads, I started using my salicylic acid cleanser, peel, and toner daily, but soon my skin became inflamed, and the whiteheads stayed. I was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis (PD) by a dermatologist, which confused me further. I had never heard of it before.

I surf and spend a lot of time outdoors and I’ve always used mineral sunscreen with no issues. Because of that, I opted out of oral antibiotics as a treatment (like doxycycline) due to sun sensitivity and concerns about triggering a candida infection, which I had dealt with in the past on my stomach. My dermatologist prescribed a compounded erythromycin cream, which I used for two weeks with no change. My skin stayed red and inflamed, and new pimples/mostly little white ones kept forming, so I stopped.

Then I tried azelaic acid, which I’ve been using for about two weeks now. It hasn’t made things worse but hasn’t helped a lot yet either. I also completely switched my skincare to La Roche-Posay's gentle cleanser and sensitive cream. However, after four weeks, my face is now covered in blackheads. The cleanser doesn’t seem to effectively remove my skin’s natural oils.

I went back for a second opinion, and this new dermatologist said I had acne. She prescribed clindamycin + tretinoin, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and azelaic acid all at once. I was worried it would trigger a PD flare-up, so I stuck with just azelaic acid, the LRP cleanser, and cream. Things improved for a couple of days, but new red spots near my nose and fresh pimples appeared. Feeling desperate, I tried using the erythromycin cream again for the rash near my nose, but my skin reacted badly and instantly turned red, so I stopped.

I did some research and thought clindamycin on its own might help, so I got my GP to prescribe it without the tretinoin. I’ve been using it for three days, but while it doesn’t sting, my skin is super shiny and oily, and the redness on my chin has worsened.

As for the blackheads, clindamycin isn’t helping, and I feel like the salicylic acid wash I used for years kept them in check. I even used it on my forehead recently, where I don’t have PD, just to see if it would help, but I’m frustrated and don’t know what else to do. I also tried to wash my face with Manuka honey and filtered water for the first time today and did a Manuka mask, that actually felt quite nice and I had no reaction to it so far.

The redness, blackheads, and overall condition of my skin are really affecting me. I’ve avoided makeup as much as possible, ordered makeup products that are better for breakouts and PD like Inika, and even stopped surfing for a week to avoid sunscreen. I’ve changed my diet, cut down on coffee, quit chai tea because I heard cinnamon might contribute to the problem, take probiotics and other supplements, do meditation, have changed my toothpaste, laundry detergent, etc.

Though looking in the mirror ruins all my positive thoughts about it every time. I become obsessed about seeing improvements daily.

Does anyone have advice for me, and especially for managing acne-prone skin with PD? La Roche-Posay products don’t seem to be working for me, and I’m really, really struggling. Part of me even wonders if this is PD at all or if I'm dealing with a case of acne and candida possibly, and what to do about it since treatment would be very different. Should I ask for my GP to organise a skin scape test before I continue too long on the clindamycin?  
  
Should I just leave it alone completely and just continue using Azelic Acid, a safe moisturiser and even Manuka Honey as a cleanser? How long did it take for you to see some results with the topical clindamycin and azelic acid?  
  
Please help!

1g28l73,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrimarchGFs/comments/1g28l73/trench_works_chapter_3/,Trench Works [Chapter 3],"Hello everyone! Yes, it is now Chapter 3 of my little fic, which has surprised me above all. But it’s been a fun little project.

For this chapter, there is some crude language but nothing all that serious. Again if you’re sensitive to such content, feel free to skip.

Enjoy!

——————

Kisran couldn’t recall if the rain had ever let up in the past few days. It was always sprinkling to a degree and the sky was perpetually covered by a solid mass of gray clouds. His breath danced in front of his face as he let out a sigh, his eyes lingering over the page before him. A scrawling letter meant for his brother, wherever he was these days. Time and again he had filled out the page, only to cross it out before beginning again. Ultimately, he let it sit in its current draft state.

“Brother,

Can’t say things are going well thus far. Rainier than you could possibly believe. Should have taken Mom’s advice about the socks. Soaked through my last good pair, and I know you stole the thick ones before I left. 

Stay safe out there.

Love,

The Handsome One”

He quickly folded his letter into his shirt’s inner pocket as he heard footsteps sloshing through the mud and muck outside of the hastily erected tent he took shelter under. Kisran’s brown eyes quickly flashed in shock as he bolted to his feet seeing Colonel Hadrian stepping in.

“Uh, g-good afternoon Sir!” Kisran stammered, throwing up a quick salute.

Had Kisran known the Colonel was coming, he would have cleaned himself up at least somewhat. His amber hair was a mess, strands draping over his face while the rest of its shoulder length refused to cooperate with his small comb thanks to the humidity. A decent bit of scruff settled in over his jaw and cheeks, making him look far more haggard than usual.

“At ease, soldier.” Hadrian said. 

His tone was far more exhausted than Kisran remembered ever hearing it. Though he supposed the rain wasn’t doing his mood any better either. Heavy bags darkened the Colonel’s steely eyes, and his cheeks were constantly darkened by a scruffy 5 o’clock shadow that refused to abate. In the dim interior of the tent, the hard creases and lines along the Colonel’s face only looked more sunken than usual. 

“Heard from the boys you still have some coffee. Man to man here Kisran, Empress knows I could use a cup.” Hadrian said. 

Despite the war’s slow but inexorable progress and the conditions of the trench, Hadrian attempted to maintain some level of pride in his appearance. His fatigues, while worn, were more free of the usual grime and muck compared to the rest of his soldiers. His hat was sweat stained and waterlogged, yet Hadrian kept the brass and medals of his uniform as polished and bright as he could make them. A tired, but enduring visage of the Imperium. 

“Of course sir. We found a few cans in some of the provisions on the tanks. Figured we could spread the love a little to the boys.” Kisran said, keeping his tone light as he moved to make a fresh pot.

“Good man.” Hadrian said, before commandeering a rickety stool for himself. “Officer’s supply ran out two days ago, and I’m starting to see double without it.”

“Permission to speak freely sir?” 

“Son, the chain of command out here means about as much as a bucket of water in the ocean.” Hadrian said with a sigh. Kisran had no idea what an ocean was, but he was mostly sure of what the Colonel meant. 

“Respectfully, you may have a caffeine problem.” Kisran said with a light laugh.

“You don’t know half of it lad. Before all of this nonsense, I worked in data processing. Day and night didn’t mean jack and those brave enough to risk exposure to sunlight after three days of darkness were hailed as saints when they came back with coffee.” Hadrian joked.

“How’s morale?” He asked after a moment.

“Sir?” Kisran asked.

“Morale son, how is it? With the rain and the cold, the place has become the pits. Cold blankets, stale rations, not a blade of grass or whisp of blue sky above. Downright miserable.” Hadrian admitted.

A commander must do everything in their power to maintain morale amongst their soldiers. The constant gunfire, artillery barrages, flashes of explosions, the faces of men and women down in the dirt while your heart beats a mile a minute, it does things to the mind. Compound that with miserable, drenched conditions, and morale gets thinner than spider silk. Hadrian was not above being honest with his troops. It’s what led to his promotions in the past, and it’s what makes him a valuable commander to the Warsmith. The ability to just tell it how it is wasn’t something Hadrian saw too often in his time. 

“Things are… they’re going.” Kisran admitted.

His tent leaked, he had to make a ramshackle conversion of his bunk to a hammock after one of the posts broke and spilled him into a puddle, and he was almost sure his toes were blue. He lost friends, and had spent tears he didn’t have mourning them in the quiet hours of the night. But, above everything else, things went along. Day turned to night, and night returned to day. He was still here, still breathing, still surviving. 

“That’s about the same answer I’ve had everywhere else. Poor Samson lost his last bowl of oatmeal when I walked in. Slid right off his table into the mud. Never seen the will to live leave a man so quickly.” Hadrian said, his tone marginally warmer. Kisran managed a light laugh, sliding the fresh cup of coffee to his commander. 

“We’re sending a runner out tonight to deliver whatever mail you’ve got. So if you have anything, I need it in my hands, ready to go before 2200.” Hadrian said before downing the piping hot coffee in two gulps with a pained grimace. 

“Understood Sir.” Kisran said, fishing the letter from his pocket. 

Hadrian nodded and stood, adjusting his hat on his bald head before he took his leave back out into the rain. Kisran barely had time to pour himself another cup before the flap of his tent opened somewhat, letting a head peak through. A mop of messy black hair came down over a rattish face, while a brown eye and a red optic beamed up at him while a crooked smile crawled across their features.

“Hey, smelled the coffee. Got a spare?” The man, Tommen, asked. It shouldn’t have surprised Kisran to see the Ratling poking around, given his propensity for sticking his nose into far too much trouble.

“Sure do, quit letting the heat out.” Kisran said, pouring the last of his coffee into the remnants of a canteen. 

Despite the Ratling’s reputation amongst Imperial citizens, Kisran never had much going against them. They drank and cussed just as well as any of the Guard could, and Tommen had saved his life on more than one occasion. Tommen pulled himself in, grabbing the offered cup before taking a sip. 

“So just how long were you standing out there, hm? Planning on pilfering a can or two?” Kisran playfully accused.

“Well you heard the Warsmith’s orders. Better rations go to the prettier soldiers.” Tommen joked back, a wry grin stretching his face. 

“Well color me surprised she’d even consider you then. I’d expect to wake up seeing you in a kennel, considering you look like the business end of a dog’s ass.” Kisran laughed, lightly slapping Tommen’s shoulder. The Ratling simply flipped him off and shook his head.

“Saw the Colonel poking around here. What’s that about?” Tommen asked, setting his now empty canteen aside.

“Ah, the usual. Checking on things in person. Making sure us grunts remember to polish his boots later. How’s it up top?”

“Not much better. I get to squeeze into a box, so at least I’m not a wet rat down here.” Tommen teased. “My scope is cracked, so it’s been fun calibrating the sights to compensate. Beyond that, it’s a whole lotta nothing. Paradise as usual.”

“Mhm. Could be worse. Heard Trishan got chewed out recently. One of the hatches on a Raider wasn’t secured before the rain came, so one of the tanks got flooded. Didn’t do any damage, but still.” Kisran said.

“Yes, I’m sure it got the Warsmith’s great iron bosom all hot and bothered.” Tommen sneered. Kisran’s eyes widened as he shook his head.

“You can’t go around saying crap like that man! She’d pull your fat head right off your flabby body!” He quickly said in a hushed tone.

“Well that’s why I do it when you’re around! I can say that I was a good little boy and you’re a corruptive influence on me.” Tommen said, earning a mocking eye roll from Kisran. 

“Right, the good and pure Ratling. I’d sooner be invited to Terra to dine with the Empress than ever find one of those.” Kisran mocked. Tommen laughed, slapping his hands on his knees.

“Well, my shift is at an end. Gotta go get some shut eye. Hey, save me another pot if you make one.” Tommen said, with Kisran nodding. The Ratling slipped out of the tent without a trace, leaving the Guardsman alone once more. 

Kisran unfolded the letter he had, his eyes reading it and rereading it again and again as his pen sat idle. But, ultimately, he put his pen away and found a serviceable envelope. Short as it was, it would have to do. Night had fallen on the trench, and with it, came a lighter drizzle of rain than what had happened earlier in the day. Kisran’s boots splashed through the puddles as he walked, offering nods or quick words with his fellow Guardsmen on watch as he passed them by. Ahead of him was the command tent, lit and in a much drier state than the rest of the trench. 

He stepped inside, spotting Colonel Hadrian looking over the holo-map of the trench. Notes of all kinds were piled up around him, but Kisran couldn’t make anything out among them. Hadrian quickly snapped his gaze up to Kisran’s as he straightened out, setting his pen aside.

“Soldier.” The Colonel acknowledged.

“Sir, I came to turn in a letter. For uh, for tonight’s mail run.” He said. His words only faltered as a second figure strode into the tent, green eye and red optic catching his in a steely gaze. 

It wasn’t often he saw the Warsmith herself or interacted with her, with the raid from a few days prior perhaps being the longest he was in her direct company. He had also never seen her outside of her Terminator armor either, yet tonight seemed to be the night for firsts. Even out of the armor, she stood just above 7 feet tall, although the broad shoulders and metal hood of her armor had often made her appear much larger than that. Black ports lined her body, along with a myriad of surgical scars and other scars from her lengthy tenure as an Astartes.

Her attire was a simple black shirt, sleeveless and breathable. Matching gray trousers and boots completed the ensemble. Kisran hadn’t known of her cybernetics beyond the ocular implant, but his gaze did quickly note the metallic arm as her metal hand came to gently rest on the table. Small spots of grease and soot marked Trosa’s pale skin, while the scent of motor oil hung around her. At a guess, Kisran thought she must have been working with the engineers to finish repairs and retrofits on the remaining tanks in their fleet. 

“Ah, yes. Good. Just in time as well.” Hadrian said, quickly moving to snatch the enclosed letter from Kisran. “Dismissed, soldier.” He ordered, placing the letter with the small bundle of others. Kisran was quick to salute and bow before he beat a hasty trek back to his tent. 

He had heard some of the lads before all the started, on another front on another world, once talk about the aura a Space Marine had. Something about them, they said, uplifted the spirits of men under their service. They said that a Space Marine could inspire even the most cowardly of hearts and bring morale back to a raging storm from nothing but dull embers. Kisran hadn't put much stock in it at first. It wasn’t until he came into Trosa’s service that he believed it. 

As he began to settle into his crude hammock, Kisran’s thoughts began to wander to home again. Sunny fields of wheat and grass, cotton clouds, the small creek by his home. His parents, his brother, the friends from his hometown, they all danced around his head. He pondered a future, naively thinking that his tenure in the armies of the Imperium would be short lived and that he’d return home a triumphant hero. It was a good dream, one that had a wife beside him in a home all their own.

In this dream, he felt a certain strength from this mystery woman, warm skin counter played with the cold metal of a prosthetic hand. A loving gaze with the most vibrant green eye he had seen, while its twin was a deep crimson optic. Soft lips, trying their best to play up a warm smile even as a scar fought to keep her in a perpetual frown. Kisran quickly bolted upright, groaning as he tried to shake such thoughts from his head. Even as he told himself it was just a dream and that it was just stress from the war getting to him, a small part of his mind kept bringing it back to his thoughts. 

The shrill tone of whistles quickly dispelled such confusing dreams, and any hope of sleep as he bolted upright. Kisran quickly pulled his boots on and grabbed his lasgun, while a bright flash of orange flame made him squint into the darkness. He saw figures, his fellow Guardsmen rallying to their battlestations while other figures leapt into the trench. They were clad in cloth of dark blue and gray to blend into the shroud of night, cutting down his fellow soldiers and burning Imperial flags along the way. The Rebels.

Flashes of lasgun fire cut through the night, while pained screams filled the trenchway. Kisran didn’t hesitate, leveling his lasgun and unleashing quick flashes of death to the attackers. He thought he saw Tommen above him, his rifle picking off rebels with careful, clean shots, but he wasn’t sure. Adrenaline coursed through him, some of the woodwork near his head exploding as bullets and lasfire ripped into the trench walls.

As a customer I had a shopper bring me regular cucumbers instead of hothouse cucumbers.  Easy to tell apart, hothouse cucumbers cost three times as much as regular cucumbers

This morning, I ordered heavy cream.  The shopper says they are out and replaces it with half and half.  I said that isn't the right one.  Then he shows me pictures of flavored creamers.  Then he asks me do I want juice.  Apparently. he thinks I wanted juice.  

Of course, I had another Afro Caribbean shopper who doesn't understand English, let alone the difference between heavy cream for whipping and the stuff you put in your coffee.  

Before you accuse me of being racist, I hate these Afro Caribbean shoppers, and not for their ethnicity.  I hate them because they are horrible Shoppers.  They don't pay attention to my messages, and they are careless and inattentive.   I know a lot of them use more than one phone and shop multiple orders at the same time, which can be problematic, even for people who speak perfect English.  

A lot of people have been raised on junk food and don't know what things like heavy cream are.  I used to be a cook and sometimes, I know more than my customers about cooking.  Like the lady who ordered Parmesan Cheese and heavy cream, and garlic and I asked it were making Alfredo, sauce because those are all the ingredients, and she was surprised.  

I'm just tired of bad shoppers.

Dead. Silence.

I freeze. She freezes. We both know what just happened.

I thought, “Maybe she didn’t hear it.” Wrong. She just looks at me, smirks, and says, “Leg day, huh? Happens to the best of us.” I wanted to sink into the floor. But, instead, we both just burst out laughing. It broke the ice in the weirdest way possible.

To my surprise, we actually ended up chatting afterwards. Turns out she was new to the area too, and we bonded over our shared awkwardness.

I met this guy on Tinder 4 years ago - he used to be super shy and introverted with me when we started talking, I even had to convince him to open up to me more, because often times he wouldnt respond to my messages out of fear of not knowing to say. He asked me out for a coffee 4 years back (two months after we started talking), ofc I agreed but he said it'd the best after covid ends. So then covid ended, we still were in contact, I even reached out to him about the meeting that i'd be cool if we'd have met during summer (that was 2 years back) but it still didnt happen. He said he never reached the border etc.(He lives 60 km from my town in a different country) So i told him to ask me again when he's ready and he agreed, but still... Nothing. He said he'd like to meet eventually if we dont get nuked. I even dated someone else in the meantime because this guy is so slow.. I didnt want to force him so I never asked again.
During these 4 years we bonded a lot, I could even call him my best friend at this point. We know each other so well and I'm pretty sure he had a crush on me when we started talking, he even said he really likes me just because I really listen to what he has to say and he's never met someone like me before. These days I don't know how he feels because he's really open with me :D And i'd say the same about him - I truly care about him. I dont know if It's love but I really wanna be here for him.
 
It's just a shame that he doesn't feel like meeting, he told me once that having a relationship with someone wouldnt be good for him atm but maybe in the future.. And I'm just wondering if his interest wasnt even that big to start of with. That i wasnt good enough to meet up with? I sometimes have these scenarios in my head what Would have happened, what is he like irl? Ive never heard his voice either, I asked him once to send a voice message because I was really curious what he sounds like, but that didn't work out either.

I guess i'm just curious if you can just like someone and not be willing to meet up and really make it happen, because I'd have done it years ago.. i'm sometimes wondering, maybe I just like the idea of him and the way he messages me but I dont really know him completely and I can't know hin completely because he doesn't let me to and that just makes me really sad.
I'm not sure If I should just step back and not be as responsive? Maybe he just likes the attention i'm giving him, so that he's not as lonely.",1,1728763006.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1g28aad,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodtrucks/comments/1g28aad/generator_concern/,Generator Concern,"I have a generator 11K 240V 50amp. 8500 running watts. 

It is used to power my coffee trailer. 

Mini split 
Lucca A53 single head espresso maker 
Refrigerator
Ice maker
Ginder
Tankless water heater
Water pump
Lights

When you add up all the watts I am below the 8,500. Honestly the most I've seen on the output is 4,700. 

However the generator will ""die"" when running the trailer. (The generator continues to run but has to be restarted) On a 7 hour day in the 90s it ""died"" 5 times. 

I assume it's because the demand of the espresso maker and mini split is causing a problem. 

Any insight? 

I did use a separate generator to run just the espresso maker off a 120v 20amp and had no issues. 

I am trying to avoid running two generators. ",1,1728762633.0,foodtrucks,0,1.0,False
1g287hh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g287hh,Muddy Bed,"Hey all! 
I just got my first pour over (Hario switch) a few weeks ago and have been brewing a couple of cups a day with it since then. So far the coffee has been good but my drawdown tends to stall (fast at start much slower at the end) and my beds are very muddy, relative to what I see posted here. 

I was wondering if this had to do with my pouring technique or simply my coffee grinder? I am using a Df83v with their DLC espresso burrs (I mainly drank espresso before now) so it is not specifically for pour overs but should do great job as it is on the nicer end of grinders. 

In terms of taste definitely my first few batches were bitter and over extracted and I have since adjusted my pours to try and include less agitation. Now the brews are much better but still on the muddy side. I am also playing around with grind size and rpm’s (currently set the lowest it can go to produce less fines).  

I guess all in all my question isn’t so much about flavor or recipe but more just wanting to hear from others. Is this muddy bed simply what espresso burrs are going to produce? or is there some way I can structure my pours to break up this clay like surface to promote a faster draw down. 

Any input is very appreciated, tips and tricks as well!
I’ve been enjoying the pour over method and I’m excited to experiment with it more.

But but but. Lots of years of [DBT counseling](https://dbt.tools/index.php) remind me that you can hold space for two conflicting feelings at once. You can give yourself the grace of radical acceptance about a situation... and still work on changing it, for instance. Or, in today's case, I can be ecstatic because of a single emoji response earlier this week that told me that my oldest sister - who stayed, even though she was in a mandatory evac area south of Tampa, FL - was safe and had the bandwidth to react to a breakfast photo from the next-oldest sister. But I can also be heartbroken that said second-oldest sister's long-worked-for, dream retirement condo in Florida was condemned due to the double whammy, and all her belongings in it were a loss. I can be happy that all my online and IRL friends and family in the affected areas, and their pets, got through without physical injuries, while my hearts breaks for everyone that I know wasn't so lucky. 

On that weirdly appropriate note, let's get to finishing this thank-you post for mail received in the past week while I wait for my counseling session to start!

When I say workshops, I mean the ones that are catered to the creatives (candle making or phone case decorating being a few examples). 

My goal is that this is a group that we can all look forward to seeing regularly. Ideally, the plan would be to get together and do something crafty, then get some coffee/lunch before or after our arrangement. This is definitely something that leans towards people who like art but the floor is open to anyone who is willing to test the waters out. 

Preferably a female group that are in their 20s but age honestly doesn't matter much. If this is something that peaks your interest, feel free to shoot me a DM :)

Before the term started, I participated in an on-campus program for incoming freshman.

The first night of the program, there’s a big social event. Somehow, I ended up at a table for playing Catan. There were too many people there, so I ended up partnering with this guy, who I’ll call Dave.

We played Catan together for an hour or so, then made our way to the movie that was playing with a couple of my other friends. Eventually, we head back to our temporary dorm assignments. My friends get off at the lower floors, and eventually Dave and I get off on the same floor. We walk the same way from the elevator for a weird amount of time.

Turns out we were neighbors.

We’ve since moved into our term-time dorms, and we’re not in the same building, nor do we have any classes together. And we keep running into each other weirdly frequently.

Just the other day I saw Dave at a coffee shop. Before that, when we were taking our class photo of several thousand students positioned mostly randomly, we ended up next to each other. There have been several other encounters.

I literally felt myself get closer to her every time we got a chance to talk and play games online. We kinda broke it off because it was long distance, only problem was I was already moving to the city she lived for a new job. 

We sorta kept on meeting and disbanding a few times throughout last year through Tinder again and again, until around November last year, where I met her at the gym I was going to and we hit it right off. Great conversation and generally had a great time. We went out for coffee and food on Black Friday weekend and I genuinely started to feel a lot closer to her. 

For context I’ve had a shitty 2 years at the time and for me, this was a way to just get a breather, the only real good thing I look forward to everyday, the only person I wanted to talk to all the time. 

A week after that we decided we’d go out again like last time, except this time we’d get high. As if we couldn’t have been even more dumb, we got up to one of the mountains where you get a great view of the city. After smoking and laughing, I think I ruined the high by bringing up some struggles of mine over the past 2 years. Well it made things awkward and I was the only driver amongst us two, so she ended up calling her brothers to get her. 

As if things couldn’t get any worse, her brothers thought I did it intentionally to try and take advantage of her and it almost lead to me getting a beatdown before I could barely speak up and proclaim I’ll never see her again. The entire situation just went so sour so fast I couldn’t even believe it until I spent the next hour trying to drive home safely while still being blazed out of my mind. Haven’t spoken to her ever since. 

Getting this off my chest because everyone in my family knew how serious I was about this girl without spilling how things went horribly wrong the situation was afterwards. Even met her parents and family, and they seemed almost thrilled to have me. I still find myself trying to find the courage to dm her after all this time but end up quitting because I feel like she deserves better than a screw up like me. There was also a part of me that thought speaking up and clearing the air would just make things worse. 

I’m cooked big time and I haven’t been interested in anyone else after her. I can barely sleep at night without constantly reminding myself of how much I managed to fumbled  a perfectly good thing and how much of a wimp I felt that night. ",2,1728761202.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Well...I quit 3 weeks ago and I think it is for good. It was not out of choice. Tea just suddenly started to feel like a huge stressor in my life. I used to be able to sleep in spite of caffeine. But then suddenly I was totally unable to sleep if I had any caffeine in the past 24 hours.  It was torture wishing for sleep and feeling so obviously tired, but being unable to sleep.  It was bad enough that I felt sad looking at my tea stash instead of happy about it because I knew it would make me feel miserable in 12 hours if I drank it.

I bypassed all the caffeine withdrawal headaches by turning off my AC and sweating in an 85 degree house for the first week. I live in a tropical climate where it's still summer in late September. I quit caffeine on a Friday, with the afternoon off from work. I slept almost continuously in a hot house with the AC off, from Friday through Sunday.  And I slept almost continuously during the hours when I wasn't working every day for the following week. I sweated buckets during this time, but thankfully the water dump kept the headaches away.

1 week in, I finally started to feel thirsty and I focused on rehydrating.

3 weeks in, my sleep schedule is a little more normal but I still need naps. I am not able to do normal hobbies yet because of bad fatigue, but I did buy myself some running shoes because I have faith that it will pass.

1g27nl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1g27nl3/aio_in_regards_to_boundaries_surrounding_adult/,AIO in regards to boundaries surrounding adult kids coming to visit?,"Hi there. I'm not sure if I need a reality check or not. If so, please give it to me.

My husband and I are soon-ish to be empty nesters. One kid left to go. No rush though, of course. We each had kids from previous marriages when we got together, never had any ""ours"" kids. Our families blended pretty well, and for the most part, I'd say we're a happy bunch. I've done my best to be a positive adult in my stepkids' lives, and my husband is good to my kids as well. 

Where I'm having an issue though, is a recently developed trend where his kids pop up unannounced. This weekend it was his son. It's about an hour drive for him to get here, so he'll be staying the entire weekend. We had no idea he was coming until he just showed up around 9pm last night. I was already in bed. I totally get having an open door policy. If life is getting hard or something happened, by all means, just come over. No questions asked. I'll put some coffee on and we'll work it out. But nothing was wrong, he just wanted to surprise us. Both of the kids have been doing this lately. I wish I could say this is the best surprise ever, but honestly, I'm feeling a bit put out. I had plans for things I needed to get done around the house this weekend; we have places to be. Also, we downsized a bit after the older kids moved out. Our old place was insanely expensive. Still stayed in the same area for my youngest to finish high school, but as it stands currently, the only extra spot to crash here is the couch. So my stepson stays up all night, takes over our living room and TV and then sleeps all day, and I guess we just have to tiptoe around him. And I do mean all night--he was still up at 7am. He also has always had issues with proper hygiene. We tried so hard to help him with it when he was younger, but nothing would stick. Now, as a young adult, no one is checking him on it, so I guess I can add busting out the upholstery cleaner for the couch to my to do list as well, and washing blankets and throw pillows. Because he reeks. The whole common room reeks. It's almost 2pm and he's still passed out on the couch, stinking. I've relegated myself to our bedroom, because where else can I even exist  right now? With each passing hour, I can feel myself getting more and more frustrated with this arrangement. 

I tried to somewhat gently approach this with my husband. If we could have had some sort of heads up, we could have communicated that we have stuff going on, and either he would have to deal with being in the middle of it all, or perhaps choose a different weekend. My husband could have even communicated this with him last night--hey, bud, don't stay up all night because we all have to, you know, live here and you can't sleep on the couch all day; and btw hit the shower tonight too. I think communication and hygiene are basic enough things that most anyone is capable of, so *some* kind of conversation needs to be had. And my husband saw where I was coming from, but he also sort of threw it back in my face that my adult child is over pretty often. Which is true. And fair I guess. But my adult child elected to live nearby, and always communicates with me beforehand. It's totally not a big deal for me to be busy and see about hanging out another day. My kid also doesn't come to just hang out with me--both of my kids are very close. They go play video games in my youngest's room and it's basically the equivalent of him having a friend over for a few hours. And that's the other thing. My kid doesn't stay for days on end. She goes home after a little while. My husband also doesn't have to do anything extra simply because I have an extra person over. But when his kids are here, I'm usually the one doing all the extra cooking and cleaning. And they definitely make a mess of the place while they are here. And lastly, I'm the only dependable parent my kids have. I just think the two situations are a bit different. 

All I'm asking is that we communicate so we can all adjust our expectations accordingly. Is that an overreaction? Am I hedging into evil stepmom territory?",4,1728760855.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

1g27mh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1g27mh6/menopausal_cervical_something_else_help_please/,"Menopausal, cervical, something else? Help, please. Long.","I don't usually post on Reddit, but I, honestly, don't have anywhere or anyone to turn to. I'm hoping someone might have an idea or suggestion.

Menopausal or post menopausal 53 yr. old. It's been 2+ years since my last period.

Recent OBGYN checkup - everything okay, except borderline elevated blood count & liver. This was a surprise & shocked me, then I looked it up & it's common in Menopausal women, I guess.

Drink lots of water, a bit too much caffeine (coffee), long time cigarette smoker (about 10 or 12 per day) & occasional marijuana. 

Currently live with family in unfinished basement (damp & mold), mid 90's diagnosed with a mold allergy. Never bothered by it until we moved into the basement.

Terrible posture (trying to be mindful of it & stand/sit up straight). Recently, my right shoulder felt stuck higher than my left. I massaged the area & had family member do the same. Felt slightly better after this.

Got Tinnitus for the first time in my life in this basement & it never left. 



2 mon ago I was cleaning a spot in the basement, picked up something heavy, discovered a box with light mold on one side and dark mold on the other.  Threw the box away immediately. That night, I tilted my head back slightly & instantly had vertigo. I've had vertigo 3-4 times since coming to live in this basement, never before, & it always lasts for 2-3 hours. Once that subsided, it felt like a migraine or bad headache. Weird things have been happening since then. 

My sense of smell has changed. It's 2-3 times stronger. I can physically feel when the pressure changes in this basement.

On & off nausea. Not that hungry. Have to, kind of, force myself to eat.

Constantly lightheaded to dizzy, tightness in the back of neck. Sometimes there's tightness in mid to right upper back & shoulder. Sometimes it feels like the tightness creeps in or washes over me.

Feeling like I'm going to faint. It's been coming from my right side, but the other night, it felt like the dizziness was coming from the back of my head & neck. Sometimes the faint feeling is just there.

A weak feeling in head, neck, limbs. If I'm reading and tilt my head forward, neck suddenly feels weak and flashes of movement/dizziness come.

Moments where the world shifts in 1 second flashes of movement.

Flashes of color in front of eyes & sensitivity to light.

A heaviness that circles both eyes. 

Pressure in right ear (there is a bad upper tooth/molar there). 

Dull aches in head, ears, neck, shoulders.

A weird cold feeling in right shoulder. After massaging it myself, it kind of went away.

In late Summer 2017, was doing some cleaning & heavy lifting. Sat down and felt a pinch in mid lower back as I bent over slightly. Sat for a second, then continued on.

That winter, the pain in my lower back, especially while walking was so bad, I had to stop & let it subside a bit before continuing on. I figured I pinched my back more & did my best to rest the area.

The pain never went away & in fact, grew. I had my period then. The lower back pain would ""disappear"" when my period came, then return when it was over. It was 7 days of relief.

When my periods stopped, the lower back pain was/is constant, even when I sit or lay. I don't know when it changed, but eating started making my back hurt. I had to wait to have a bowel movement, before the pain would go down. It is like that to this day. If my bowel movements are slower than usual or if I over eat, it feels like the food or my organs are pushing against my lower back.

Is it possible everything is connected? One area is effecting the other?

The dizziness is making it more and more difficult to function. Did I pull or pinch something? I don't have any pain that feels like a pulled or pinched muscle.

I have state insurance (Medicaid). Getting a decent to good doctor that wants to help me & that accepts my insurance has been like a needle in a haystack. I have been trying, though.

I am aware of the dangers of smoking & know that I need to quit. My lower back pain is years old, everything else came on suddenly a couple months ago. I've looked up vertigo, teeth/gums, diabetes, more horrible things, etc. 

I know this is alot, but any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.

It is Manhattan, even the doormen can make 100k a year there. Because costs of living are so high.

Greg is the executive assistant to the head of a major news work. He’s not some intern that gets the coffee (anymore). He also does a lot of the dirty work (lying in front of congress, shredding the documents, firing people) and knows where a lot of the bodies are buried.  He more than justifies the salary.

Tom saying he might get busted down to 30k is also absurd. He would make more waiting tables. And have less chance of going to jail.

And now he’s presumably going be executive assistant to the CEO? That’s like a very important role. Basically like the chief of staff for a politician. 

I can see Tom giving him a very mild pay rise and telling him to be grateful for even that.

Tom just needs Greg to think he can’t do better anywhere else so he’ll stay. Even though after a few years at Waystar he probably would be able to get a good upper management gig elsewhere.",23,1728760748.0,SuccessionTV,23,0.74,False

Just a little lore doc here, as filler between this arc and the next. The first chapter is almost done. Anyway, without further ado:

-Missile silo

-Computation complex (contains the machines that run ED's equivalent to the unconscious mind and automatic biological processes you don't have to think consciously about to do, such as heartbeat and breathing. If this sentence made you spontaneously aware of your breathing, I apologize.)

-Living quarters for military grunts

-Several boardrooms for corporate meetings

-Fully equipped mini bar containing some very old and incredibly potent alcohols that would likely kill a human, near the boardroom section. Unfortunately, the bar is locked and the lock is pretty damn solid. The key’s been lost.

-Dr. Turven’s lab (adjacent to his workshop)

-Several experimental military vehicles, severely damaged by Federation incursion

-Living quarters for civilian personnel

-Living quarters for VISes: Very Important Skalgans. This would be corporate highrollers and Dayside Republic generals.

-Lobby acting as a sort of “hub” for the boardroom area, with moldy overstuffed chairs and speakers that occasionally jumpscare CC and Katha with distorted muzak at random times (it was left to play for far too long and now the player is extremely worn out)

-Administrative offices with the occasional faded pinup calendar that’s fallen off the wall (in some of them, the Skalgan pinup girls are still legible!)

-“We cannot afford a mineshaft gap!”-looking strategy room with a light-up map of ancient Skalga, not lighting up anymore. If the switch is flipped, it flickers for a moment before the switch starts sparking and smoking.

-Dentist office

-Interrogation chamber (don’t ask)

-Loading bay/mechanic’s area

-Several storage rooms containing canned ammo (still good), canned water (no longer good), canned food (still good, for a given value of good: it’s VP vegetables pickled in natron salts like fuckin Egyptian mummies and the Strayu version of American Civil War hardtack)

-Nuclear reactor, just barely ticking over and good to go for a *while* (minimal power load) (Thorium molten salt kind, too, for extra safety)

-The mortal remains of several exterminators from hundreds of years ago, with antique suits and long-obsolete flamethrowers.

-Some rusty vending machines, one of which steals CC’s last quarter after making a bunch of clunking, groaning, and thunking noises

-Plot twist: He came back the next day to discover that it had, in fact, eventually deposited a canned beverage after he’d left, and drank said beverage but spat it out because it was super turbo expired

-Old machine shop that CC is running his repair efforts out of, originally Dr. Turven’s private workshop, just adjacent to that one security office. You know the one.

-A coffee machine (that CC brought there in the first place) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqcvZNAUl8)

-Black Mesa style mini-trams for transport (all busted) (think of the little mini-trains in the abandoned bits of the facility later in the game, rather than the initial tram ride)

-Armory containing Skalgan infantry weapons that fire high-caliber exploding Gyrojet rounds. (Yes, my friends, BOLTERS! Although smaller in caliber compared to their Warhammer counterparts.) Mostly empty, as the Skalgan soldiers left with a lot of the weapons to go and fight the Feds, and most of what remains was to the Dayside Republic Army what a moldering crate of Krag-Jorgensens or Lee Navy rifles would be to the WWII US Navy: unbelievably obsolete surplus, in this case only there to pad the numbers. Now they’re priceless antiques!

-Half Life style box smashing room to pad costs for the original construction of the bunker.

-Dr. Turven’s office (E.D.’s father. Contains a framed photo of the day ED was brought online, as well as some of ED’s artworks (think less “tech bro scam AI imagery” and more “Simple figures drawn with machine-like precision and labeled with perfect Venscript, like a kid’s first drawing if he were a robot”), and a direct line to ED. Unfortunately, the Exterminators burst in through his secret passage down the hall with SWAT-like precision and killed him, taking the Skalgans off guard in a very rare display of Federation competency. His incinerated remains have been wrapped in plastic and are currently in the on-site morgue.

-On-site morgue, containing exclusively the bodies of Skalgans who died defending the facility. They dragged the Fed corpses out of the way and left them there.

-A bunch of ancient Skalgan vinyl records, some of which are of pop songs of the time in people’s lockers, but some of which are framed in Dr. Turven’s office and are his and E.D.’s version of the IBM “Music Through Mathematics” LP, the Skalgan version of “Switched On Bach” (also made by Turven and ED), and a Skalgan 45 equivalent containing the “Turven Ventures” equivalent of the IBM “rally song” “Ever Onward”.

-A metal plaque with the Turven Ventures logo on it, reading “We lead the way through the great unknown! Never knowing what we’ll find! We’re searching, expecting, exploring, connecting, so no one has to feel they're left behind!” And if that sounds familiar… [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLcRSIEtXwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLcRSIEtXwI)

-Lots and lots of panels of spinning magnetic tape reels, blinky lights, and retro dials that wouldn’t look out of place on my family’s hi-fi system, were it not for being in Skalgan numbers instead of English.

-Signs of a battle, fire damage, and a hasty evacuation of civilians, including a bunch of shriveled corpses wearing antique exterminator suits and carrying long-obsolete flamethrowers. The Feds broke in, killed Doctor Turven and disabled ED in the middle of a rest period, taking everyone by surprise in an unfathomably rare show of Federation competency. Then the civilians and the Skalgan military contingent rallied and won the ensuing battle, before receiving orders to meet up with another unit for fighting the Feds. They collapsed the main entrances on the way out to deny the area to the Feds (CC and Katha entered through an obscure side door Dr. Talven created as a secret exit from his office, which the Feds broke in through. The military thought the Feds had gotten in through the loading bay, and didn’t know about the side door.)

-Paperwork/blueprints indicating a set of paralytic neurotoxin sprayers for security (they were never actually installed and may sitting in a crate somewhere on site or may be completely lost to time)

-The secret hiding place of the last surviving bottle of the General’s favorite brand of booze that Dr. Turven stole from the General in honorable revenge for calling his artificial son “a danger to all Skalgakind” based solely on what usually happens in movies. (Yes, even ancient Skalga had rogue AIs in movies.)

NOTE: Everything metal is at least a *little* rusty and everything is covered in dust.

ANOTHER NOTE: The Skalgans of the Dayside Republic really loved their military industrial complex, which is why it’s both a civilian/corporate AND a military facility.",6,1728760691.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

We’ve done things like dinners, raves, coffee dates, walks in the park, and even stayed at his place and a hotel together. One weekend, we spent Friday to Monday morning together. There’s been some intense intimacy, but I’ve set boundaries and said I’m not ready to go all the way yet, which he seemed to respect. He’s organised most of the dates, paid for everything, and we’ve spent full weekends together. I’ve initiated one date and was the last one to check in before he travelled for work.

He’s mentioned that I’ve helped him come out of his shell, and it felt like we were getting closer. He also shared that his job can be stressful, and he’s currently travelling for a month. However, after spending so much time together, he’s been silent for almost a week. We didn’t text much before, but this feels strange, especially after he mentioned he's not ready to accept love.

I’m confused why he’s pulled away after all the closeness. Could it be my boundaries around intimacy, his work stress, or something else? We also have a 14-year age gap—could that be a factor? Was I expecting too much after a month? How should I handle it if he reaches out again?

Either I was never tired or if I was I'd wake up at 3am and couldn't get back to sleep. It's been a bit rough and my mental acuity just hasn't been there because of it. 

One morning I woke early, like 6am which is a full hour before I usually have to get up. I did a few things around the house, took care of the pups, prepared coffee, the usual. I sat down at my desk for a minute and thought ""I'll pop on before work and have a game."" I work from home. I have since before COVID and it's the only kind of job I've ever been good at. I had one of the greatest days at work that day. 

I've been doing that for a week now. Getting up a bit early, making some coffee, and sitting down for a few games as my brain gets going. By the time I have to clock in and get started I'm going full steam ahead. Knocking out tasks quickly, engaging with team members, etc. it wakes my brain up and gives me that little shot of dopamine to get moving. I'm not going to pretend it's specifically Overwatch that's doing this as I'm sure any fast paced activity would help but it's the one that seems to work for me.

I’m taking a gap year right now so I’m basically working and studying on my own until college starts and then i’ll be going to another state.

he basically lives with us and is super annoying, all the things have to be his way, he thinks he’s so smart and he’s super arrogant too. 

he’s coming to my house eating my goddamn fruit snacks, drinking my juice and using my consoles and PC. this dude will eat all of the things we buy for groceries. so for example, out of 10 , he’ll eat 4.

recently i got creatine and he STARTED using that, and my mom says I have to share. I understand that she buys it but he has his own money too. 

So I put laxatives in a creatine drink I made and was like “hey man, here i also made you one”

he didn’t even say thank you btw, just drank it and put the glass on the coffee table.

he still doesn’t know I did that lmao

I 34 F married to my 34 M husband for 7 years. Before i met him, i used to love celebrating basically anything. Birthdays, anniversaries, even friends birthday with grand parties. I love gifting people and receiving gifts! 

After i met my husband, celebrating any occasion slowed down. I don’t want to blame him for all but he never liked doing anything for any occasions. Never a big gift giver either. In the beginning, he forgot my birthday 2 yrs in a row. I was sad disappointed but its all in the past. 

Now 7 yrs later, our celebration basically looks like going for dinner and coming back home and carrying on with whatever. Talking about gift giving, for him i gave him clothings, his favorite concert tickets, planned a small gate away, city flights.. all most everything that i think would be romantic. But he would always gift me thing that need care and attention. We went to an animal shelter to adopt a dog for my birthday which was great, amazing. But when we had to choose a dog, we ended up choosing the one he liked the most. Which is fine. Atleast we are getting a dog. After that, most of the gift were like fish, plants, gardening supplies and all. I just came to realize last year that everything he gets me needs my attention and not something that i can experience or enjoy. Just a ticket to a movie would be great. 

Anyway, for this year, he got me an electric scooter. The lime scooter kind. Mind you i have only ridden those kinds, once in my life and i was scared to death. I do ride a moped but those are different. On this electric scooter you have to stand and balance as much as you can. First thing that came to my mind when i saw that was i might get into an accident and injured myself. I told him i like it but inside i was very very nervous. Later that day, i kinda asked him were there any other options like moped. He told me this was the only great item they sell. I kinda hinted him we may need to replace our coffee machine and that it would be great if he can return it and get me a nice coffee maker. That way we both can enjoy the coffee and use it every day. He looked at me and told me that i was the most difficult person to please and he was not happy about how i talked about returning a gift. I tried to tell him that im scared and winter is coming and it would not make any sense for me to ride it just to go to the park. I mean it wont even help me in my exercise. He stormed out and has not really responding to me yet.

1g27414,https://i.redd.it/di6elhd6hdud1.jpeg,The Use of Psychoactive Substances Among Christians,"LESSON 43 How Should Christians View Alcohol?

https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/enjoy-life-forever/section-3/lesson-43/

————————————————————————

Today, we will discuss to what extent Christians, including Jehovah's Witnesses, are allowed to use psychoactive substances, commonly referred to as ""drugs."" The Bible only directly refers to such substances in one verse; otherwise, it emphasizes keeping the body, as in 1 Corinthians, as a temple of God and the mind alert to dangers. The one direct reference to this topic can be found in Ephesians:

Ephesians 5:18: ""Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.""

For simplicity's sake, I will limit the discussion to four classic substances:

1. Alcohol
2. Tobacco
3. Coffee
4. Cannabis

————————————————————————

Alcohol is commonly derived from various sources, with wine from grapes and beer from grains being the predominant forms, which were also familiar to Jesus.

The physical effects of alcohol are heavily dependent on consumption. Small amounts are known to have beneficial effects, while larger quantities can cause stomach discomfort, headaches, and even be potentially fatal. Mental dependence, however, is often more severe. While small, regular amounts are socially accepted and usually harmless, heavy misuse can lead to alcoholism and mental decline. Long-term consumption of large amounts, especially hard liquors, can result in violence, accidents, crime, and destitution, sometimes leading to homelessness. Most Christian groups are surprisingly open to alcohol consumption and usually only forbid heavy drinking and public intoxication.

————————————————————————

Tobacco comes from the tobacco plant, which is native to the Americas. As such, it is not directly mentioned in the Bible and only came into contact with Christianity relatively late.

Tobacco is traditionally smoked in cigars or, more commonly in modern times, in cigarettes. Mental dependence is generally bothersome rather than severe, but the physical damage, especially from long-term cigarette smoking, is well-known. Many Christian groups frown upon or outright forbid tobacco use, particularly cigarette smoking, as is the case with Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. The attitude towards tobacco, particularly among Jehovah’s Witnesses, has shifted significantly in recent decades due to new medical findings.

————————————————————————

Coffee comes from the coffee shrub, native to Africa. The coffee bean was mainly cultivated and spread by the Ethiopian state, and a native people, the Kaffa, even gave coffee its name. Interestingly, despite its geographical proximity to the Holy Land and its later spread by Arab Bedouin traders, coffee is not mentioned in the Bible, which is one reason why Mormons prohibit caffeine consumption altogether.

Physical addiction to coffee is rare and relatively harmless. However, mental dependence in the form of habitual consumption is quite common, though less severe than addiction to other substances. Generally, most Christians, including Jehovah's Witnesses, encourage limiting the consumption of such substances to a minimum without outright banning it, as the Mormons do.

————————————————————————

Cannabis comes from the hemp plant, which was widespread throughout the ancient world and likely well-known to the ancient Jews and early Christians, primarily as a textile plant. The onset of cannabis use is a topic of debate among scholars, as it is often argued that wild hemp, due to its low THC content, was not consumable. Critics counter that the use of intoxicating substances like incense and myrrh has long been documented, even in the Bible.

The physical effects of cannabis are generally mild. It is known for its pain-relieving and relaxing properties and, unlike opium, has little impact on vital functions. However, mental dependence can develop, characterized by a craving for the substance and a loss of motivation and concentration. Jehovah's Witnesses oppose the private use of cannabis but fully support its medicinal application.

1g2710u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g2710u/seeking_advice_after_a_complicated_longdistance/,Seeking Advice After a Complicated Long-Distance Breakup,"Hi everyone. I am in search of opinions. This is a long story, so bear with me.

I (M26) was in an 8-month relationship with this person (M22) that I’ve known for the last three years. He is Western European, and I am Latino.

We met online, and after meeting in person a year ago, a few weeks later, we decided to become boyfriends. The chemistry between us was great; we connected on several levels and shared similar life plans and ambitions. Although our career paths were different, we passionately shared the things we were doing.

I was living near his country for academic purposes for a year, so we used to see each other every month and a half or two months and spend between 6 to 15 days together chilling or travelling. This helped strengthen our bond and feelings for each other, which were already growing strong from our constant daily communication and activities we used to do online like games and movie nights—a part of our long conversations.

Between the end of June and the beginning of September, things started to get a bit complicated between us. We had our first fight in June; it was because of a friend he introduced me to who had travelled to Latin America for almost a year. She spoke negatively about how Latino men are too clingy, emotionally dependent, and controlling. In addition, she mentioned how drugs were so easy to get in Latam. I didn’t appreciate her comments but didn’t say anything. But what made my then-boyfriend and me fight was when she asked how we met. After both of us told the story, with me finishing it by saying how much I love him, she said to him, “She would have been embarrassed if her boyfriend would say something like that to her in front of her friends.” After we left the restaurant, I told him how I felt about his friend’s comment regarding my feelings for him, but he didn’t seem to understand and saw it more as me taking things too personally.

It is important to note that this friend was someone he met a few months before through another friend. My ex became very involved in plans with her and other friends, going to parties and festivals. Because I knew he wanted to experiment with drugs, I expressed my concerns without trying to give the impression that I was telling him what to do.

He did some drugs earlier this year before this new friend came into the picture, but I didn’t say much about it, other than just to be careful. I guess because he told me in advance about it, and I kind of knew the people he was with, it was not much of an issue for me. But once he started to go out a lot with this new friend, who openly admitted her consumption of cocaine and other drugs, I started to fear that from experimenting, my ex would become like her, as he always used to say he “lives the moment.”

So, the small disagreements, not really arguments, we had started because of me expressing my concerns, and him not understanding my view, only his own. I am the kind of person who loves to communicate, so whenever I felt that things were not okay or going right, I would express my concerns to try to understand and improve things. By doing this, especially around these topics, things just started to get tense, and I started to feel him a bit distant in some way.

The thing is, after a while, I stopped mentioning these topics and started to trust him more. But his occasional cold reactions and other unusual actions made me start to feel anxious and concerned about the situation and how things would end up for us. He is the type of person who still has some of his exes on social media, and he would always tell me if any of them texted him or things like that. There was one that was in his friend group, and he went out alone with him. I felt a bit weird about it and told him about it. I didn’t tell him not to go out with the guy; I just said that where I come from, it is kind of strange that someone who is in a relationship still goes out with his ex or replies to their text messages.

I said that to him to let him know how I was feeling and to maybe understand the whole situation better. But he accused me of trying to be a bit controlling and tried to compare me to some bad ex that he had. The thing is, some ex-hookup he had before being with me (who he follows online and had on WhatsApp) constantly tried to follow me on Instagram. I also had these weird spam Instagram accounts texting me negative things about him. They would also text him. So, all of this situation made me a bit concerned and in need of just having everything clear.

I know that what he felt for me was real because he did the impossible to see me always and make me comfortable. His actions, especially in person, proved his feelings for me. And when he was away, even after being tired from work, his education, or a party, he would always call me to talk about his day. But everything that I mentioned before made me anxious and, to some extent, insecure about some things, especially when, for him, there was nothing much to worry about. He would rarely stress about anything. I know for sure he used to stress about wanting to know who was behind the Instagram account (that even came to tell him racist things about me).

Things got worse for us at the end of August. I exploded because he said he was mad at me because I was in his head when he wanted to try some drugs at a house party of his friend, and he didn’t. I got mad because he told his friends he didn’t do it because of me and gave some details about some traumatic experiences I had in the past with people who used drugs.

I was going through a lot of stress those days with my master’s dissertation and family drama, and when he told me this, it was like a spark to the whole situation. In my agitation, I told him it was best to ignore each other for a week. We talked over the phone for three hours after that and went to bed. The following day, when he called me, he was the one who wanted the break, and even though I felt forced to agree because I was the one with the idea, we didn’t take the break, even after agreeing that we would.

That day, when we supposedly took the break, he texted me after an hour of our last call, saying, “Just remember that I am not done.” He even texted a friend asking her to take me out for a coffee because I was not doing well. I later found this out because she told me.

The following day, he called me, I guess after a text I sent him the night before. And he said that he wanted us to fix things. The day after that, we had a long conversation where he said that I broke his heart when I asked for a break because it seemed that it was easy for me to push him away when things got complicated. He explained how complicated it was for him growing up and how people treated him, even his ex, and my attitude in some way made him feel the way these people used to make him feel, making him shut down his feelings to protect himself. Forgetting even why I was mad at him, I apologized and made it clear that I was upset that day and had too many things on my plate.

The following days, we continued talking like we usually would, but he was cold and less affectionate. I convinced him to let me go and see him to properly fix things, but he didn’t want to at first because he insisted that as a long-distance couple, we had to learn to fix things by being away from each other to be able to make things work. In the end, we agreed on my visit, and to my surprise, after a long conversation, with him in tears, he said it was best for us to break up because even though he believed we were good together, it was not the right time (he gave some specific reasons like age, both of us in different phases, etc.).

After a very long night of talking, with a lot of crying, we decided to remain together and set boundaries, which was something we never did before. That night he asked me to stay a few more days, and I did. It was a nice few days; we did a lot more things than we had before, and the passion between us felt even stronger.

I found out during the days I was there in his country from one of his friends (not the one that said those things months before) that I was hanging out with while he was at work, that he did try drugs that night when he said he didn’t because of me. I even found out about the misconceptions his friends had about me, like me being jealous of him with specific guys he used to hang out with, among other things.

That night, I told him about what I found out. And he explained to me the reasons why his friend maybe thought that I was being jealous. I even mentioned to him that his friend unconsciously told me that he did try drugs the night he said he didn’t and was mad at me because of that. I said to him that I wasn’t mad at him for trying drugs, but I was rather disappointed that he lied to me. I asked him not to lie again, and then we went to bed without any drama.

Because it was the first time he lied to me, or at least the first time I was aware of, that night my mind started to reflect on the spam account on Instagram that used to text me, his ex-hookup trying to follow me, and some stuff his friend said to me. After thinking about it over and over, I took his phone and searched his messages. This is what I found out:

His ex-hookup was trying to meet him in person to tell him something and asked why he wasn’t on Snapchat anymore. There wasn’t much conversation there—he told him that he was waiting for me at the airport and some other stuff.

With one of the guys he was hanging out with, whom he met through the friend who made the comments I didn’t like, I noticed that they used to text a lot. He would ask him how he was doing and things like that. Around the time when he was upset with me after I said I wanted a break, I saw that they were texting frequently, and there was a bit of light flirting going on. This guy even asked him how things were between us and told him he should think carefully about what he wanted to do, as it seems my ex had told him he was considering breaking up with me.

The last thing I found out was that between May and July, he was texting and calling this online person he had met before me, with whom they used to do sexting in the past. In the messages, he admitted to this person that he still had a video of him and would pleasure himself to it because he found him attractive. This guy knew he was in a relationship because he even asked my ex how he met me, and my ex would reply, “Call me if you want to know.”

The following day, I confronted him about these things. He said that he and the ex-hookup would talk now and then because things had ended well between them and they were never a match. Regarding the other guy, he said he was flirty just as he was with his “girlfriends,” and that he didn’t have any other intentions, hoping the other person wasn’t taking it seriously.

As for the guy he used to sext with, he admitted that it wasn’t just what I saw; in July, a week after our first fight, he had a sexual video call with this person and felt bad about it. He said it wasn’t planned, it just happened, and he didn’t want to tell me, fearing I would end things with him. He explained how guilty he felt and assured me that it was the only time something like that had happened since we were together.

We talked for about two hours, and I told him I wasn’t going to break up with him. He started crying, hugged me, and said he didn’t deserve me because I was too kind and loving. He promised that something like that would never happen again. A few hours later, I took a train back to the country where I was living, even though he wanted me to stay one more day. Before leaving, I reassured him that everything would be okay and that we would overcome all the obstacles. I left, hoping to see him at the end of September as we had planned months before.

When I returned to where I was living, I began to process everything and started crying. I talked with him, and he explained in more detail everything we hadn’t discussed on the day I discovered what he had done. I felt a bit insecure and distrustful of him in the days that followed. Sometimes I would express this to him, and he would say that he completely understood. I asked him to help me regain my trust in him, and I wanted us to work on it together.

Our story came to an end three weeks ago, which was two weeks after I found out what he did. After a session with his therapist, he broke up with me. I saw on his face that he was crying. This time, I didn’t say anything or ask him to talk through everything. I just thanked him for everything. He cried a lot and apologized for putting me in the situation he did, even offering to send me money so I could go back to my country earlier to be with my family—because I had been waiting to go on holiday with him and his family at the end of September before returning home.

Twenty-four hours after the breakup, he texted me, thanking me for everything and saying how amazing a person I am. I ignored him, and a week later, he texted again to see how I was doing and if I had made it back to my country safely.

I replied to him the second time and told him when my flight was. That night he asked to call me, and we had a genuine conversation. He told me how he spent two days crying after the breakup, how he cried while telling his family that we were no longer together, how he was eating his feelings away, and how nervous he felt when he texted me and I didn’t respond. He told me during that conversation that I should return to Europe soon after leaving. He even said that he realized what he did with the other guy in July wasn’t because I wasn’t enough—it was because there was a void caused by the distance between us, and in some way, he was trying to fill that void, which was even by going out with friends. He also said he broke up with me because he didn’t want to end up resenting me, as only negative thoughts about me had been on his mind in the last few months with the issues we were having, and it wasn’t easy for him to focus on the good things like I did.

After our phone call, he texted me saying he loved me and that he wasn’t done with me, in response to a letter I sent him by post the day after we broke up, which he received the night we talked.

Throughout my journey back to my country, we stayed in touch until the day I arrived. He would text me to see how I was doing and if my trip went well.

On the day I arrived home, I asked him if I could call him to tell him something funny that happened at the airport. He replied, “Maybe tomorrow, I am going to sleep, I hope that is okay.” I answered, “Sure, no problem,” and he left me on read. It has been 12 days since then, and neither of us has reached out to the other.

Based on this whole story, do you think:

Was he worth it?

Should I reach out to him even though he left me on read?

Do you think it was just the wrong time for us, and that a future together is possible if we work on our traumas and issues?

Honestly, I don’t want to get back with him right now. I am more aware of the things I need to improve and overcome, and I am already seeking professional help for this. He also has things to work on. If I’m being honest, I don’t want us to become strangers; I think the connection we had was good, but in the end, miscommunication and misunderstanding, along with the distance, ruined it.

I feel like reaching out to him, just to see how he’s doing, but I don’t know if it’s a good idea.

P.S. Please don’t lecture me about whether drug use is not that bad or that it was wrong for me to check his phone. I am already reflecting on these things.

Java Burn is a dietary supplement specifically formulated to aid in weight loss and enhance metabolism. This innovative product is designed to be mixed with coffee, leveraging the natural benefits of caffeine to boost its effectiveness. Java Burn aims to support users in their weight management journey by accelerating fat burning processes and increasing energy levels throughout the day.

**The Science Behind Java Burn​**

**Understanding Weight Loss​ :** To understand how Java Burn works, it’s essential to grasp the basic principles of weight loss. At its core, weight loss occurs when the body burns more calories than it consumes, creating a calorie deficit. Several factors influence this process, including metabolism, appetite regulation, and energy expenditure during physical activity.

**Metabolism and Weight Loss​:** Metabolism refers to the chemical processes in the body that convert food into energy. A higher metabolic rate means more calories are burned at rest and during physical activity, making it easier to maintain a calorie deficit. Java Burn aims to boost metabolism, allowing users to burn more calories throughout the day.  


**Appetite Regulation​:**  Appetite is controlled by a complex interplay of hormones and neural signals. Some supplements target appetite by affecting hormones such as ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and leptin (the satiety hormone). By regulating these hormones, Java Burn may help users manage cravings and portion control, supporting their weight loss journey.  
  


**Fat Oxidation​:** Java Burn claims to enhance fat oxidation, the process by which the body breaks down fat molecules for energy. Increased fat oxidation helps reduce body fat levels, leading to weight loss.

Regé and Phoebe had a coffee pact while shooting together. Basically, they wouldn't mind if either of them drank coffee before their scenes together. I remember how that little fact blew up after Regé's Colbert interview in March 2023.

>*""It's one of the things that you do: You approach your other actor and you go, 'Hey, so this scene's after lunch. What are our rules? Are we no onions? No garlic? Do I have to get the coffee in early?'"" Page told host Stephen Colbert. ""And then we both were like, 'Actually, I really like coffee, so I don't mind.'""*

>*""It was like, thank God!"" he said of their java pact. ""So we had a coffee safe space the whole way through that show.""*

During our relationship I didnt know I had borderline personality disorder due to my childhood trauma and I was very critical of him sometimes, would lash out, would get triggered and blame him etc. I was toxic and insecure for sure and right after the break up I started seeing somatic therapist to heal myself. 

My bf was caring and supportive, but also a real people pleaser, but also he was I believe enmeshed with his family. His dad was never emotionally present in his childhood and his mom and him to this day fight a lot becuase dad is very irresponsible.  During our relationship he still lived with his parents and siblings and I noticed that he helps them very much with all their problems and they all go to him for everything (from driving his sister around to listening to his mom complain about his dad, to dealing with laywers for some things etc). Basically he is very involved with his family and pretty much I would say surrogat husband to his mom and all her emotional needs. They are also poor and financially depend on him and he often told me he feels big responsibility and pressure to take care of his parents. I believe he had a lot of obligatory guilt towards them. His mom also wanted him to invest the money into their family home, which he told me he doesnt want becuase he will not be able to afford his one home one day due to that. I think she was very emotionally manipulative towards him from his stories.

Also, he goes shopping with his mom and sister, always asks for their opinion regarding what he bought if they are not physically there with him etc. His mom also buys him underwear, which I always thought was strange for his age.

 He was also arranging all his future plans according to his parents and I never felt like we were a team. For example in the future he was planning to buy his parents an apartment, but his parents didnt want to live in a smaller apartment so he would need to buy them a big apartment which he would be paying for the rest of his life and he never considered that such thing would also effect me if we got married one day. This is not to say i never wanted him to help his parents out, but all his decisions were based on his parents wants and needs (specifically his mother's) and he never talked to me about it.

However, even though he is super close with his family, he never introduced me to his parents. He met my parents and my extended family fairly quickly. He said that its not important for him and that his parents never asked to meet me. I did meet one of his sisters after a year and a half of dating after I practically insisted on it. He always told me that his parents never have people over that they feel pressure when someone is coming to their home etc. After I suggested to then meet his mother in a restaurant or cafe, he said that he doesnt see a point in three of us sitting for a coffee and talking. That was 2 years into dating. I always felt like his is trying to keep his love life fully separate from his family, and due to my wound of childhood neglect I often felt like there was no room for me in his family which made me resent his family very much. I felt like I wasnt a priority to him.  I would then have negative reactions to whenever he was doing something for his family in the end becuase I was so fed up. 


Also, i dont think he didnt introduce me to his family because of me, after we broke up he said he doesnt see anything wrong with not introducing me to his family and that he will not introduce his future gfs either for at least 2 years or more. Also I meet all his friends after a month or two of dating and I was very involved in his life in all other aspects aside from family.

He also rarely shared any family issues he was dealing with with me, when he was talking to his mother on the phone he would go to the other room etc.

He left me in the end, but now looking back I can clearly remember how I felt every time he excluded me from his family and there was no sign I would ever be apart of it. Before a break up I would sometimes mention how I think he is enmeshed and he would always get super defensive about it.

During our relationship he only twice cancelled his plans on me due to his mom's requests, and I often read stories when enmeshed sons do it way more often. But still I always felt not like a priority to his family and very much hidden as a separate part of his life from them.

This was both of us first long term relationship and I often wondered was I overreacting due to my own childhood wounds or was his behaviour very strange? Was he enmeshed?

I didn’t know this was gonna be so contentious lol so let me add something: if you like adding the cream and sugar yourself, there’s nothing wrong with that.

Also, I’m aware that hypothetically this could be avoided by double checking that every single person who says black coffee really means black coffee. But, when I’ve done that in the past, I have ended up with some minorly uncomfortable situations where the person who really did just want a black coffee now thinks I’m an idiot.

“So no cream and sugar?”
“Yes… a black coffee.”

We started talking everyday texts calls he said I love you on the 3rd day of knowing me I said it's a serious word and I won't be using it now he was okay with it he could tell me he liked like everyday. Since we had schedules that crashed it was hard to see each other but we planned for a coffee meet up and later he changed it to me going to his house so that he could cook for me. Since he had said that he lived with his folks I was like fine but turns out he wanted us to meet at his cousin's house who lived alone. I was hesitant at first since he kept talking about girls who wanted him in a sexual way but that he turned them down I was like do you want to hint on something but just in my head.

So I also left it like that I didn't call again and didn't text again I blocked him and ended everything tho he never asked me out to begin with.

However, the only “discharge” I’ve had is a a coffee ground like substance with an odd smell. It’s not watery or slimy, just feels gritty when I wipe. I’m assuming this is normal from the cauterization, but what type of discharge counts as worrisome?

My doctor stated that heavy, bright bleeding can be cause for concern, but I have no clue how I’m supposed to tell the difference between a concern and my normal period. ",1,1728757562.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

Week later came round and stayed the night at hers, ordered pizza in. 

I made some jokes about not falling in love first time we met, as I don’t have time or the funds, as a sarcastic way of the truth, she laughed and agreed herself.  

Days later met up to “study” after uni, had a nice time together, our humour is similar so it feels really natural. I tried to casually ask if she’s studying with other guys too, as I don’t like sharing, she said she agrees but around a week ago there was one, who she’s seeing for coffee this weekend, when she asked “will you be free for more studying” I said “if you’re not too busy on coffee dates” she explained it’s “just to get her hoodie back” which I doubt is the case but I honestly don’t mind- if we continue it as a casual thing,

But she messaged about our next study session. Giving the option to go “grab coffee or some real food and drinks” Being a student I’m not exactly cash heavy, and if I’m spending the little I do have on dates for a girl who’s not having a serious relationship, it feels a bit like you can’t have it both ways, she gets the advantages of a relationship but no commitment? 


Summarised - 
Either way not sure how to respond or continue this, I thought we both mutually want something casual together but there’s mixed signals. I’d rather not feel a fool being taken advantage of, having said that times amazing with her, her humour and mind is very attractive, as-well as her good looks, it doesn’t make the desision easier.

Been playing for a couple months now, trying to get ahold of my form so I don’t practice with bad habits. I don’t really have anyone good to learn from, just some friends that started playing for the first time together. 

What are some things you guys see? What I’m going to try to work on next I think is not running backwards at the xstep (anyone have any drills for this?) and getting the disc out further out and a little less behind. Still feel like I’m throwing with too much arm and not getting into the power pocket.  Trying to “pour the coffee” and reach out more square with my shoulders and not back has helped a lot.

First was a zetas moon 300ft, second was a Gorgon 320ft. I’ve gotten the gorgon to 350-360 a couple times. Sometimes both discs turn and burn (Gorgon more often) and don’t come back. Could this be from reaching back too far, not out, and rounding? I try and throw it the same as my mako3 3 for flat narrow straight shots but it feels like I have to put a lot of hyzer on both the zetas moon and especially Gorgon.
