1g5bfmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5bfmr/my_neighbors_alarm_clock_wont_stop_ringing/,My Neighbor’s Alarm Clock Won’t Stop Ringing,"I moved into my new apartment two months ago. It’s a small place, cheap, with thin walls. But for someone living alone for the first time, it was perfect. My neighbor, apartment 304, was quiet. A dream neighbor. I never saw them, never heard a party, not even a TV through the wall. Until the alarm clock started.

It was 5:57 AM on a Thursday when it first went off. That annoying, shrill beep-beep-beep that digs into your brain like an ice pick. It went off for ten minutes straight. I figured my neighbor had overslept. Happens to everyone, right? No big deal.

Friday, same thing. 5:57 AM. The alarm clock blared again, this time for fifteen minutes. Annoying, but still, maybe they had a heavy sleep schedule or something. I let it go. But when Saturday rolled around and that alarm went off again at the same time, I started getting irritated. I mean, I work late shifts. Sleep is sacred to me. Why the hell couldn’t they turn it off faster?

I knocked on their door later that day. No answer. I figured they were out and decided I’d try again another time. Sunday morning, 5:57 AM, the alarm rings. It goes for almost twenty minutes this time. I pounded on the wall between our apartments in frustration. Nothing. No movement, no “sorry,” no sound other than the relentless alarm.

On Monday, after the same damn thing happened again, I told the landlord about it. He shrugged it off. Said the guy in 304 was “weird” but always paid his rent on time. No complaints. “Maybe he sleeps through it,” the landlord said, as if that was a valid excuse. I pushed him to give 304 a call, just to make sure everything was alright. He promised he would.

Tuesday morning. 5:57 AM. The alarm screamed through the wall. I gave up trying to sleep through it and dragged myself out of bed. As I made coffee, I heard the landlord knocking on 304’s door. A loud, impatient knock.

No answer.

I watched through the peephole as he knocked again, then muttered to himself and pulled out his key. When he opened the door, I saw his face change—like something stung him. He stood there for a moment, frozen. Then he stepped inside.

I waited for him to come back out, but he didn’t. A minute passed. Then two. I thought about going over there, but something told me not to. I went back to bed, hoping to God that maybe this would finally be the day the alarm stopped for good.

Wednesday. 5:57 AM.

The alarm went off again.

This time, I was done. I threw on my hoodie and went straight to the landlord’s office. It was locked, but I could see the lights were on inside. I banged on the door until he opened it. His eyes were bloodshot, and his shirt was wrinkled like he’d slept in it.

“Hey, what’s going on with 304?” I demanded. “Did you talk to him? That alarm—”

“He’s not… there anymore,” the landlord muttered, rubbing his eyes like he was trying to wipe something from his memory.

“What do you mean? You went in yesterday.”

He looked away, fidgeting with the keys in his hand. “There’s no one in 304. Hasn’t been for months.”

I felt a chill crawl down my spine. “That’s impossible. Someone’s been in there. I hear the alarm every morning.”

The landlord shook his head slowly, almost like he didn’t believe his own words. “The last tenant died in that apartment. About six months ago. I forgot to cancel the lease. That’s why it’s still empty.”

I stood there, stunned, as he turned and shuffled back inside, mumbling something about needing sleep. I stumbled back to my apartment in a daze, trying to process what I’d just heard. I wanted to believe he was mistaken. I had to be hearing things.

But the alarm. I still hear it. Every morning. 5:57 AM. For ten minutes, without fail.

I tried everything—earplugs, noise machines, sleeping on the couch. Nothing works. I’ve even recorded it just to prove I’m not losing my mind. Every time I play it back, though, it’s dead silent. No alarm. No sound at all.

It’s 5:56 AM right now. I’m sitting here, waiting for it to go off again. Because this time, I’m going into 304 myself.

If you don’t hear from me again, check apartment 304. And if the alarm is still ringing…

Don’t open the door.",1,1729116294.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I have spoken to Citizens advice bureau and have left a message with a community law office.
A couple of years ago my brother sold his coffee empire for a few million dollars. At the time I had gotten out of a bad dv relationship and was homeless. He gifted me $100 000nzd to use as a deposit to help me buy a house. We had a handshake agreement that I would pay the loan back in 5 to 10 years. (He came up with that time not me) I asked if we should write this agreement down and sign it, which he declined, I also asked him if he wanted his name on the deed which he also declined. (Looking back I wish we had done the first and written it down)
I am 2 years into owning the house, have started my cleaning company (which has been going for a year and on track to do well however I am only just surviving and paying bills lol) and he has lost his millions on the stock market, so he has requested to receive his loan back. This would mean I need to sell the house and my daughter and I would be homeless again as there's not enough equity in the property as yet for me to have a deposit to buy another and pay him back his full amount. I live on the West Coast south island and house prices here are pretty minimal however the houses don't soar in price like everywhere else. I've paid off about 3 to 4 grand of the principal in 2 years (it's a 30 year loan). He has said that he's coming at xmas to ""liquidate his business"" which I take to mean sell my house. Does he have a right to do this? I told him through Instagram I had 3 years minimum to pay him back still due to our agreement and then I had to block him as he went really sour on me. Am I going to have to sell my home and pay him back?
Any and all advice appreciated I really wish we had something in writing but nothing at all.",1,1729116138.0,LegalAdviceNZ,1,1.0,False

1g5ba6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5ba6g/i_think_ive_been_cursed_by_my_childhood_friend/,I think I’ve been cursed by my childhood friend,"Twenty years ago, I lived in a small, remote village in the outskirts of Sindh, Pakistan. A village so isolated that it seemed untouched by time and the people clung to old stories, passed down through generations. Life was simple there, quieter than the bustle of the cities, and at times, it felt almost magical.

We had festivals every month or so—grand carnivals that brought Sufi singers, folk storytellers, and wandering traders. It was a celebration of life, community, and heritage. We would laugh and sing and play the traditional games that our ancestors had taught us. And at night, beneath a sky full of stars, the village elders would tell stories—tales of old Sindhi folklore, tales of love, religion, and bravery.

I grew up with only one other kid of my age and her name was Sahar. Our village was so remote that we spent nearly every moment together. We’d walk to school, a long trek that took us over dry hills and across narrow, winding paths. Sometimes we’d talk about the stories we heard from the elders, imagining we were the heroes or heroines of old, facing off against jinn and otherworldly forces.

But there was only one thing the elders warned us about more than anything else: *The Woods.*

The woods that stretched beyond the village were forbidden. They were thick and gnarled, tangled with roots and shadows that seemed to grow darker the deeper you went. There was an old woman who lived there, they said, a woman no one had seen in years. The elders would look at each other, their faces tightening with a fear they rarely showed, and they’d say, *""Stay away from the woods. She keeps to herself, but her presence is a bad omen, and if by chance you see her; don’t let her touch you.”*

We were children of course, so we obeyed our elders but there is only so much you can do in a village that doesn’t have any other entertainment available. We tried our best to avoid the woods even after coming home from school. We would end up playing ludo outside in the Otaq all night long as our elders played Sufi music together.

“Would you like to check it out?” Sahar asked me innocently

“No, Baba had forbidden us”

“Don’t be such a scaredy cat”

Suddenly, it had started raining and we all were forced to come inside our homes. We said our goodbyes and went to sleep.

The next morning, the sky was clear but it was a windy day. I had decided to not go to the school but the sound of Sahar outside my house had tempted me to give in. When we walked to the school, we found out that the school had been closed due to the heavy rain of last night and we had to walk back home.  

The sky had gotten a lot darker; I think there was a storm coming, most of the paths leading up to our village had been flooded and we couldn’t take the way back home easily. That’s when I felt my arm being pulled “I think we have to go through the woods”

“No way, you know Babajan would get mad”

“Well, it’s either that or we end up dying here. What do you suppose?”

She was annoying but she was right. I figured, Babajan would understand right?

The sky hung heavy with an oppressive darkness, clouds roiling and swirling like a tempestuous sea. The air was thick and laden with the earthy scent of wet soil, as if the very ground was exhaling its last breath. Each gust of wind sent shivers down my spine. The coldness settled in my bones, an unsettling chill that seeped deep, making me feel as if the very essence of life was being sucked out of me.

As we went deeper into the woods, the trees loomed over us, their twisted branches clawing at the air.

“What if we see her?”, I asked

“Don’t let her touch you or she’ll curse you” she teased;

The leaves rustled restlessly beneath our feet, and the shadows crowded us. We heard a branch snapped in the distance, and we saw her.

*The old woman*

She was standing by the path, a bent, withered figure draped in tattered robes. Her skin hung off her bones, gray and cracked like ancient parchment, and her eyes— they were…. *milky white*, like she’d been blind for centuries. She looked right at us. No…she saw us, in a way that pierced through flesh and bone, straight into our souls.

“*Are you from the village?*” she asked, her voice as dry as the desert wind. I remember my throat closing up, the words sticking there like glue. Sahar nodded, too scared to speak.

The woman’s cracked lips twisted into something resembling a smile. “Be careful,” she rasped. “A plague is coming to your village. Stay away from the water.”

I tried to brush her off, laugh it away like the foolish child I was. But when I glanced at Sahar, her face had gone pale—white as a ghost. Her lips trembled, and before I could even say a word, she grabbed my arm and bolted. We ran, the sound of our footsteps and the rain splashing through the mud, until we reached the safety of the village.

“What happened?” I asked Sahar; “Why did we run?”

“That old woman, she is supposed to be dead…. dead for centuries…. she shouldn’t exist”

“It must have been someone playing a prank on us, we shouldn’t have run.”

“Do not speak of this to anyone; promise me?”

“Do not be a fool”

“I said, promise me!”; She yelled

“I promise” I replied

We never spoke of it again, not for a long time. But things began to change after that. Strange things. The air around the village felt heavier, thicker. Sahar was the first to shut herself away. She stopped coming to school, stopped leaving her house altogether. When I asked her why, all she would say was, “I saw her. I felt her. She touched me, she has cursed me.”

I didn’t believe her. I refused to believe her. But then, *she fell ill*.

It started with fever, then boils—dark, festering sores that erupted across her skin, she had a terrible fever for days until one day, she vomited blood, stood up and collapsed right on the floor.

It didn’t stop with her. It spread. First, it was a few people, then a few more. Soon, the entire village was stricken. No one could explain it—no doctor, no healer. The elders whispered that the old woman had returned to bring a curse, to punish us for trespassing into her woods. I heard them speak of it in hushed tones, but it wasn’t just talk anymore. It was real. The plague consumed the village, took everyone it could, including my parents.

The village was nothing but a graveyard now, the grounds was scattered with blood and disease-ridden bodies, I was the only one left alone, *why was I left alone?* I had to leave, I had to run away…I had no choice.

When I finally left, the land had turned sour. And eventually, the village itself faded from memory, swallowed by time and the sands of the desert. I didn’t dare go back, no one could. It was a cursed place. A place that didn’t exist to me anymore.

I moved to the city, made a life for myself—something I never thought I’d be able to do after everything I’d seen. I got married, started a family. My wife, my children—they became my world. And the village became a distant, shadowy dream. I told myself the curse had stayed behind, buried with the dead. The old woman had touched Sahar; she might have saved me from her curse; maybe that’s why I was spared.

*But last night, she came back.*

It started with a dream. At least, I think it was a dream. I woke to find Sahar standing in my bedroom, her figure barely visible in the dark, just a shadow against the wall. My heart raced, my mind screaming that it couldn’t be real—she was dead, long gone, buried in that forsaken village. But there she was. And I knew, deep down, that it wasn’t a dream.

She whispered; *""You survived before…but not anymore.""*

“Please don’t touch me!” I wanted to yell on top of my lungs but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move. My body was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to scream, to wake my wife, but I couldn’t.....

I woke up with a cold sweat the next morning, thanking God that it had all been nothing but a dream. I brewed my coffee and told my kids that they can skip the school today. I would be taking them to the zoo.

“Why?”

“Every day is a blessing, don’t forget darling”

The kids roared in excitement and we smiled from ear to ear. I had decided I would go into work today and take an early leave. I had some unfinished work to do.

I clocked into work and went straight to my desk to pick up some papers…. that’s when I heard my phone ring…it was…….my wife….

*“Baby…please come home quickly…. it’s our daughter…she’s puking blood….”*

I think part of what is so exciting is the individual agency I have to advocate for my ideal dynamics. It also feels like a true expression of myself even though I have a lot of fears around it that I discuss openly with my partner.

Since I am new to poly and conceptualizing everything, I think it would be really cool to have 1 on 1 meet ups with my metamours only if they are comfortable doing so. I think it would give me a lot of comfort and be able to go “Oh ___ doesn’t seem so bad, I’m happy that my partner has a connection with this person.” 

Most of my feelings of jealousy can come from the unknown and as long as these people are consenting, I would be curious to see how this would help my feelings of unease. While I don’t expect to be friends with all my metamours I think having at least one meet up over a shared interest or walk outside/coffee might be beneficial. 

Have any of you ever done this? What did you learn, did you find it beneficial?

bf and i are to be engaged in the next 6 months, so this does feel timely . 


obviously, i am not planning on a cozy, close & personal relationship with BM, but it would be nice to have a civil/respectful open line of communication with her in case of an emergency or other exceptional/extraordinary event. 


my question is: what is the best format for meeting her? going out to lunch or something feels a bit absurd. i will also be asking my therapist her take on this, as she herself is part of a blended family, so she is well-versed on the protocol. 


should we go grab a coffee? lol i have no clue how to go about this. 


BM is NOT high conflict and maintains respectful boundaries + a coparenting-focused dynamic with my bf. there’s really no remarkable beef between the two of them - they just aren’t compatible romantically anymore. 


of course, i would be totally foolish to assume no conflict CAN happen between her and me… but my point is she’s really not the typical unhinged/unstable/explosive BM, so i’m not totally uncomfortable with the idea of a “friendly” meeting with her.


tl;dr: what is an appropriate meeting format with BM who wants to meet me, and what kinds of questions can i have for her about her kids? am i even going about this correctly?


 thank you, stepmamas!

I just tried some stuff and it worked. I used approximations and no firm measurements. You will need: hot water, carob powder, coconut milk, maple syrup.

  
I used the microwave to heat my water. Usually I'd use my kettle, but I live in the US and I didn't wanna wait that long. I used a standard coffee mug of water, but I left some room at the top to add the other ingredients. Carob powder doesn't dissolve the way coco does, so it will be gritty at the bottom. I just didn't drink it down to the last drop and it was fine. I used a tablespoon of powder (not leveled), shaken until it looked pretty close. I forgot to shake my coconut milk can, so I ended up spooning some cream in then spooning some milk in after I'd transferred the can's contents to another vessel. I added one glug of maple syrup.

  
It had an obvious coconut taste which paired well with the ""chocolatey"" taste. I couldn't really taste any maple and the sweetness level was good to me. If you prefer more sweetness, the additional maple syrup might start to add obvious maple flavor. That's seasonally appropriate for the Northern hemisphere, so maybe that's your vibe.

1g5b2re,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1g5b2re/time_looped_chapter_26/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 26,"Admitting that eternity was a game had benefits and drawbacks. Games usually had a set of strict unchangeable rules: only certain people who had joined eternity could get classes, each mirror only gave out a class once, there was no changing the key holder. That was enough to come up with a bunch of ideas or even a plan. The drawback was that the person most familiar with games in general was the most unreliable of the bunch.

“For real, bros,” the goofball said, chugging down cocoas as if they were water. “I’m the goat! Been playing games way before eternity.”

That didn’t sound in the least reassuring. Everyone instantly imagined the guy wasting hundreds of loops on mobile games and nothing else. For all they knew, he had done just that while working with Daniel.

“I got it covered,” Will said.

“I’m with Stoner,” Jace agreed. Against most expectations, he kept a surprisingly healthy diet, which had resulted in him ordering a glass of water and an apple. “His idea makes sense.”

“For real?” Alex slumped backwards in his seat. “I can improve it, though.”

“Alex!” Helen hissed. “What’s the plan?” She turned to Will.

“You don’t get your class,” Will explained. “The goblins won’t pop out until their mirrors see you. That’s why you don’t. Alex does.”

“I’m not trusting him with the knight.” The girl crossed her arms.

“I’ve been the knight hundreds of times,” the goofball grumbled.

“The *point*—” Will raised his tone slightly “—is for Alex to set up his traps in the room *before* you go in. Then you take your class, kill them off, and we see what we do from there.”

There was a long moment of silence, only interrupted by the barista passing by to refill Alex’s mug. As far as he was concerned, they were discussing the strategy of some mobile game. And even if he found anything suspicious, he’d forget about it in about five minutes.

“Good plan,” Jace said, his words soaked with doubt. “We can join in to help. A team is always stronger than a group of individuals.” He gave Will a glance. “Until they run off.”

“The three of you in the girl’s bathroom?” Helen asked mockingly.

“Won’t be the first time.”

“Bro,” Alex laughed. “That sounded so wrong. But nah. Key holder gets to keep the loop. She must do the kills. Maybe we’ll get something useful.”

Everyone nodded.

“The important thing is that we time and learn this,” Will said. “It’ll be our starting point from here on. Alex goes in, then out. Helen gets the knight, kills off all the goblins, then we meet up in class. And Jace learns what he needs to do to extend his loop.”

“Lame,” Alex said, grabbing the new cup of cocoa that arrived at his table.

“We’ll know more when we know more.” Will said and took a sip of his soft drink. It tasted of sweetened strawberries—definitely not something he’d try again in any future loop.

“So… we do this every loop?” Jace asked, only now realizing the situation.

“Seriously?” Helen gave him her typical glare. “What do you think this is?

“Hey!” Despite being the loop newbie, the jock had no intention of taking any shit. “What about shifting the classes a bit? During training, coach had us take on different roles so we got an idea how everything worked.”

That, to everyone’s surprise, was a remarkably good idea. Will even hated himself for not coming up with it first, despite thinking the exact same a hundred loops ago. With everyone knowing the pluses and minuses of their class alone, their way of thinking had become restricted. Switching up things would let everyone get a different perspective, not to mention that it would be fun.

“Let’s get the timing on this first, okay? Then we’ll try variants.”

It sounded simple enough. With everyone else doing the same things in the same fashion, it had to be. Will pushed his drink away. There were a few more minutes until the end of the loop. Part of him considered whether to have a mousse. It had been a while since he’d tasted one. Better not. There would be a chance to do so in another few dozen loops or so.

“Not that it’s my business, but aren’t you supposed to be at school?” the barista asked.

“Teacher’s sick,” Alex said without batting an eye. “Diarrhea.”

If there was a topic that was certain to end all conversation, it was discussing diarrhea in a coffee shop. Even with no people around, the barista instinctively pulled back, out of fear that he might get affected by the word itself.

“Way to go, idiot,” Helen whispered beneath her breath.

“Always works.” The goofball smiled. “Ready to go?”

Noone said another word for the next minute.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Will looked at the entrance. As far as he was concerned, this was nothing but a standard loop. Unlike Alex and Helen, his only goal was to do the same thing he did every loop and not draw attention. And that meant he could spend a few moments to chill.

“Cool move, weirdo,” Jess and her friend passed by.

“Thanks,” the boy turned to the pair. “You’re cool as well.”

Both girls reacted in a completely different fashion. Jess’ friend took that as an insult and doubled her pace in an attempt to pull her friend away. Jess, in contrast, saw it as a compliment and slowed down.

“Never noticed you came so early,” he continued.

“Yeah, my father has to get early to work, so he drops me off half an hour before class starts. I usually go to pick up Ely before we come here.”

“Maybe I can meet up with you sometime as well. There’s not much—”

“Jess,” Ely hissed like a viper before an attack. “We’ll be late for class.” She grabbed hold of the girl, pulling her towards the entrance. This time, Jess followed. Despite liking the attention she’d just gotten, she didn’t want to appear easy to get.

“See you around later,” Will said just as the entrance door closed behind them.

Usually, this was the point at which Alex appeared with his talk of muffins. The fact that no such thing occurred gave Will hope that everything was going as close to plan as possible. Waiting a few more seconds just to be sure, he entered the school building.

The normal thing to do was get the rogue and go to class. In typical teenage fashion, though, Will decided to casually stroll to the girls’ bathroom between the two. To little surprise, he found that Jace was already there.

“Hey,” Will said, trying to hide his disappointment.

“Yo.” The other nodded.

Several seconds passed in silence as students walked by in the hallway.

“Heard anything?” Will asked, trying unsuccessfully not to stand out.

“Nope.” Jace shook his head.

“Think everything is alright there? I mean, there’s no harm in helping.”

Almost simultaneously, both boys looked in both directions of the corridor. There was no chance that they’d enter unseen. On the bright side, neither coach nor any of the teachers were present. The worst that could happen was them being dragged to the vice-principal’s office, and even then they’d probably not even get to hear a full lecture before the loop ended.

“Think we should go?” Will said, knowing what the other’s answer would be.

“You go first, then toss me a knife. I’ll disarm any traps you step in.”

Not the worst plan someone could come up with. It was ironic that, of all people, Jace had to be selected as the crafter. As far as Will knew, the most complicated device the jock had seen was a football.

Taking one look around, the pair was just about to storm in when the door opened in front of them.

“Knew you’d be here.” Helen passed by, not even taking the effort to glare at them. “Classroom.”

Jace and Will looked at each other.

“Was lit, bros!” Alex said, appearing out of nowhere. “Sadge you weren’t there.”

A few moments passed.

“You know,” Jace said after a while. “Sometimes I really hate him.”

“Don’t,” Will whispered, even if the goofball wasn’t in his good book at the moment, either. “You get used to it. Besides, you can’t hit him. I’ve tried.”

Class proceeded as usual. Or rather, semi as usual. Jace took the time to meet up with the rest of the football team, while Will and Alex helped Helen in opening the windows. The stench was still noticeable by the time the rest of the class started arriving.

That annoyed Will somewhat. There was no reason they couldn’t discuss what had happened in the girls’ bathroom, yet Helen had been adamant that they do it during recess. Judging by Alex’s unusual support, there had to be a reason for that, although it made matters just a bit more complicated. For one thing, while Will knew what he was supposed to do to reach that time, Jace remained completely new, so to speak. It was going to take him dozens of loops at least until he found his own path. Then again, it dawned on Will—maybe that was the point.

Arts was long and boring. None of the loopers put any effort into their work, even if it would have earned them additional loop minutes. Whatever attempts Jace made, they had clearly failed, for by the start of class, the loop had already ended for him.

Visually, nothing had changed, yet everyone else involved knew. It was as if there was an invisible barrier that divided the looped with the non-looped. Once the time had passed, the jock seemed to have lost his vibrance, becoming part of the “gray” background. What complicated matters was that he didn’t seem to realize it, at least not fully. As far as this version of him was concerned, he was the same person with the same memories, just lacking the supernatural elements. For that reason, when recess came, he joined the other three in the yard.

“So?” Will asked the question.

“The plan worked,” the girl said. “Mostly.”

“For real?” Alex sighed. “Just needs some fine tuning.”

“The goblins didn’t drop anything,” she said.

“Not even knives?” Jace asked. “Even we could get some of those last time.”

“Those disappeared once I killed them all. And it wasn’t the normal fade, either. When the last creature was gone, all of them flashed away.”

That was new, though not unexpected.

“Any levels?”

“The usual one. And a scoreboard.”

“Scoreboard?”

“What was your score?” Will asked. The lack of response quickly let him know that wasn’t the right question. “Not that it matters since you’re the only one who—”

“I was fifth,” she interrupted. “There were four people ahead of me.” There was a momentary pause. “The Archer was second.”

That was something that no one expected. Only Alex seemed to be handling it better than the rest. His philosophy that anything new in a loop was a positive development seemed to do wonders for his attitude.

“The Summoner was first, with twice as many points as everyone else combined,” Helen went on. “The Druid was third and the Martial Artist was fourth.”

“Any sixth?” Will couldn’t help himself.

“No. That’s all.”

“What’s the big deal?” Jace joined in the discussion. “So you’re not first yet. Big deal. You’re still in the top five. That’s what counts.”

“Fifth of twenty-four,” Will said. “That’s not the scary part, though. When the fight took place, only a minute had passed. That means that the four ahead of her managed to kill more goblins in that time.”

“Nah, that’s not the big oof,” Alex corrected.

“What can be worse?” The jock ran the fingers of both hands through his hair.

“Team structure, bro. Five teams—five key holders. We’re in the minor leagues.”

It didn’t take much to calculate that out of twenty people, their team was dead last. Of course, that left the remaining sixth team, suggesting there was still one group that hadn’t started the tutorial.

“Welcome to the grind,” Alex said, taking out a muffin from his pocket.

“Do I want to know?” Jace glanced at him.

“The grind is the long period of doing lots for little progress,” Will said, who was already familiar with the term. Since they had just figured out something that Daniel hadn’t, he hoped that there would be more to it, sadly it was once again back to basics. “Helen will have to go through the entire school and find the other goblin rooms. Meanwhile, the rest of us would have to extend the length of our loops.”

“Speak for yourself, bro. I can go for weeks.”

Everyone, including Helen, stared at the goofball.

“What? It’s boring with Danny gone. You’re boring too.”

“Wait. You’ve spoken to us out of loop?” Will felt a chill run down his spine.

“Chill, bro! Your secrets are safe with me.” The goofball winked. “Only sad thing is that I had to repeat every convo again and again.”

All glances shifted to Jace.

“I’m not going to remember any of this, am I?” he asked.

“We tried to warn you.” Helen shrugged. “When out of loop, better do what you usually do. Less awkward that way.”

“Right. You better catch me up next loop.” The jock pointed at each of them in turn. “If you don’t, I’ll—”

 

**STAB**

**Surprise attack.**

**Damage increased by 1000%**

**Fatal wound inflicted.**

 

Alex stabbed the jock in the neck before he could finish. Jace crumbled to the ground, without even realizing that he had been killed in the loop. Instinctively, Will and Helen leaped back.

“What?” Alex asked in the most innocent way possible. “He won’t remember. Faster this way.”

Of all the things that came to Will’s mind, “faster” was definitely not one of them. That posed an interesting question—had Alex done the same to him and Helen as well? If so, maybe the lovable goofball wasn’t as lovable as everyone gave him credit for.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

1g5b0wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1g5b0wc/rant_had_easily_the_most_obnoxious_round_with/,Rant: Had easily the most obnoxious round with some close friends today due to speed golf pace harassment marshals. ,"TLDR; Played an expensive course with friends, we were harassed by a marshal 5 times about keeping pace even though we weren’t holding anyone up and nobody was in front of us, by the time we finished and packed our golf bags, we went in and complained. The group behind us walked in as this was happening and echo’d our complaint and said how absurd it was. Will never play there again. 


Some close friends and I that are pretty decent golfers had a round at a high end course near us. Tee times are about $130 for a morning round M-W. They’ve recently upped the prices by a good amount which kinda turned me off but it’s not often I get to play with these 3 guys so I was so excited to get out and play at the course again. When we tee’d off there was nobody in front of us, they were probably a hole or two ahead. From the start before tee off, and even BEFORE our range time 20 mins PRIOR until the tee time, the marshal gave us this whole spiel about pace of play, ready golf, marking times on our score card blah blah blah. Before I hit the range he told us to “stay close.”  These are things that I have NEVER HEARD at any course I’ve ever played at, even a tournament course like Golf Club of Houston.  We had a group directly behind us hopping on the box for the first 3 holes, but after that we were putting, or finished by the time they were at the box. Never waiting on us. We were approached by a marshal three times at hole 5, 6, and 7. We were told “there were two open holes ahead of you and we need to pick up the pace” which is ridiculous because we weren’t holding anyone up and our tee time was probably 10 mins after this group that was ahead of us. At the turn we all stopped for a quick dog and I got coffee. It took us AT THE MOST 3 or 4 mins. We walk out and the marshal immediately tells us to get our group together and get it going. My buddy got frustrated and basically told him you’ve told us this 3 times already, nobody is waiting on us, why tf are you bothering us? We’re playing normal paced golf. He just answered “just keeping up the pace, and you guys are off” over and over. We then finish 12 and were told “we’re going to let the group behind you skip in front of you.” THEY STOPPED AT THE TURN AND HADN’T SEEN THEM SINCE. They had to have been an entire hole or two behind us. By this point we were all pissed. Finished up with them constantly just coming around and staring at us. Ended up complaining up front and they told us that nobody complained to the clubhouse about us and that they were sorry that happened to us. While we were complaining, the group behind us came in and echoed us saying “yeah same here. What are we supposed to do? You guys never held us up and by the time you were putting or done with the hole, we were just hitting the box, it’s ridiculous.” It’s unacceptable to me we paid $140 with range balls, and were harassed the whole time. I will absolutely never spend money at that course again. A IYKYK hint to Houston area residents would be it’s a course that just finished their huge club house on a hill above the driving range and hole 1. Even though I feel we were disrespected, I won’t level with them and spill their name here.",3,1729115160.0,golf,6,0.64,False
1g5b0w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g5b0w5/professional_narcissist_advic/,Professional Narcissist Advic ,"Basically I (30F) had this friend (30F). We went to school together but only really became close after we finished. Fast forward many years and we've maintained the friendship. I've been with her through every trial life had thrown her way (abusive mother, bad breakups, friendship breakdowns, mental health issues). I've even been there for her when she needed support with her children such as organizing my husband's work roster to be home with our child so I can look after hers for the night while she gave birth to her second. She has a very low opinion of herself and basically hates herself as she has told me many times. In our teens/early 20s she would get her confidence by going from guy to guy at the clubs and having one nighters. That wasn't my scene so I never got involved but never judged either because I understood why she did it. Me on the other hand have only had two partners and I'm happily married to the second one. When I found my now husband, she got extremely drunk one night and tells me ""I don't like him. He's too young for you (he's four years younger than me) and he can't provide for you (I didn't need and still don't need providing for). She couldn't stand that I stayed with him and made things extremely awkward so I ended the friendship. Fast forward two years, she comments on a memory on FB that I was tagged in and we decided to meet for coffee and chat. That restarted the friendship (stupid me, I know now) because I really thought she had chilled out within herself and her opinions of others. Well we ended up pregnant around the same time and she had her baby a month before me. All is well (ish) for the first 4 years and the kids have grown up together and formed a close friendship. During this time her mask has slowly slipped and I've once again seen her for who she truly is and I decided to slowly distance myself. She would constantly bad mouth her partner, calling him a cunt and useless (he has his own issues but his efforts were never good enough for her), she even showed me a picture of his dick one day to prove that he's a ""grower, not a shower"". She's stated that if she could afford it she would leave him but she wouldn't be able to finance a house on her own with now two kids. Shes done a whole other bunch of things which she's proudly declared like withhold sex from him unless he was willing to get her pregnant again. She told him when she was pregnant with her first child that if he didn't propose to her before the birth then the child was taking her last name instead of his (he never proposed and they ended up hyphenating their last names together). Just weird controlling shit like that. Besides all of that, she constantly speaks poorly about her friends including me which I found out about and wasn't too surprised. Our kids go to preschool together so it's not like it affects them, they can still be friends. I've got no problems with that. 
Everything I've mentioned is less than half of what I could say this person has done to those in her life. Both our kids attend a weekly playgroup event for two hours at their new school for next year. One of the mothers told me that one week when I couldn't make it that this person was trying to plant seeds in the heads of the other parents about me, that was the final straw for me. Anyway, like I said, I've slowly been distancing myself. Accepting fewer invitations to things, not really divulging any information about my life to her, just giving her the bare minimum. I chose this course of action rather than speaking with her about it because I knew if I even hinted that she had done/said things that were upsetting/worrying/offensive then it would be gloves off and she'd attack me and paint herself as a victim. So I was hoping I could quietly just slip away from the friendship and let it die. Well wasn't that my biggest mistake? When she realized what I was doing she dug her heels in even further and started sending me messages of support such as ""I'm here if you need to talk."". She's never once done that before in the history of our friendship even when she knew I was low at times. It wasn't until she realized she was losing control that she decided to send messages of ""support"". I was nice in my responses ""Thanks a lot. I'll let you know"" or heart reacting and left it at that. 
Fast forward a bit further and it's orientation day for our kids who are starting the same school next year (yay). At this point I haven't seen her in approx 2 months and we've barely spoken on messenger so I thought ""Great, the friendship is running it's course"". Nope. She approached me quite aggressively at the orientation, didn't even start with a ""Hey"" or ""Hello"". She just walks up to me in a huff and says 'Whats going on with you? You've been quiet"". I said that I was just going through some trials at the moment but I'd be ok and I told her it wasn't anything personal (because if I did then I knew she'd get on the defensive and the outcome is never good when I've done that in the past). I thanked her for checking on me and left it at that. I was there for my child and wanted to focus on that. We ended the brief conversation on a good note or so I thought. A week after that interaction out of nowhere, she unfriends me on FB, leaves every single group chat that we were both apart of on messenger and gets a friend of hers to message me to tell me how horrible I am before blocking me. It was completely random and it felt like she was chucking a massive adult tantrum. I let it go and didn't respond in any way as I knew she was looking for a reaction via a message directly or me reaching out to a mutual friend to ask what was wrong. I completely left it because it wasn't worth my energy. 
Well a new term started this week and today was the first playschool back and holy shit it was the most awkward and uncomfortable interaction. We didn't acknowledge each other at all and when it came time for the kids to have morning tea, because our two kids are friends they sat next to each other. I naturally sat behind my child and she came over to sit near hers except in her big power move, instead of sitting facing the center of the circle, she plonked herself down and turned her back to me and cutting off her child from my own. Luckily her child was more mature than her and actually got up, moved around her and rejoined myself and my child while she maintained her position with her back to me, excluding me from the conversation being had with the other parents. I happily spoke to my child and hers like nothing was happening because I wanted to shield them from the bullshit. 
I just want to know, from that information alone (there's so much more of what she's done/said but this would turn into a thesis very quickly if I listed everything), should I feel guilty for wanting to end the friendship and should I feel at all guilty for trying to slowly slip away which triggered her huge reaction in the end? Id also really appreciate advice because I find this whole situation so mentally debilitating. She's very good at manipulating people (like me) so I know she will be getting into the heads of the other parents at my child's school whenever she can. How do I deal with this and not let it affect me? Thanks in advance",1,1729115160.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

My therapist suggested I start writing my thoughts down in a journal, saying it will supposedly help me understand and process my emotions, and I’ll get to know myself better as a result. I am sceptical, but what the hell, I’ll give it a shot! I have never kept a journal before, so I have no clue how to start… Uhm, hello, I guess. I’m me and I’m writing this to myself… Do I introduce myself now? To whom? I already know myself, and I highly doubt anyone else is ever going to read this, except my therapist maybe. I’m just rambling about nothing to a bunch of pages now, I can’t really think of anything interesting to say, so I’ll just end this entry here.

 



**June 18th, 2024**

Am I supposed to do this journaling thing daily, or what? My therapist simply told me to do it in whatever way feels right for me, but I haven’t figured that out yet. If I try to do it daily, I’ll just get annoyed and give up. On the other hand, if I wait too long, I’ll forget about it altogether. I should be able to figure it out eventually. Anyways, not much to talk about today. It’s a weekday so it’s the same old eat, work, sleep routine like usual. I will be hanging out with some friends later this week, so that’s something exciting to look forward to, I guess! I am happy to have my friends, they have been super supportive and understanding through this whole mess, I don’t really know where I would be without them. Look at me, rambling about random things again! I suppose this is par for the course when it comes to doing this whole journaling business? I don’t have anything else to write about, I’ll leave this entry where it’s at and head to bed.

 



**June 23rd, 2024**

Haven’t written anything for a couple of days, but it feels like it’s high time for another entry, so here goes! The weekend was fun, my friends and I had a fun time at the karaoke bar we went to. I think I drank a bit too much, though, because for the first time ever, my friends actually managed to convince me to try singing karaoke. Let’s just say, my mediocre singing voice paired with the effects of the alcohol in my system, made for a barely audible mess of a performance. One of my friends took a video and showed it to me the next morning. I was as red as a tomato from embarrassment, but looking back, I find it more amusing than something to be shy about! We all got a good chuckle out of it, so it is not too bad. That is everything of note, I believe. This journal is supposed to be about cataloguing my thoughts and all, but my mind isn’t filled with anything particularly exciting or interesting nowadays. I’ll keep trying to maintain this, but is there much of a point if it’s just me talking about the same stuff over and over? I will a have discussion about this with my therapist on my next appointment tomorrow, surely, she’ll be able to explain it to me better. I’m exhausted and will be needing my energy for work tomorrow, so I’ll stop writing for now.

 



**June 24th, 2024**

Brought up the topic I wrote about yesterday at today’s appointment. My therapist asked to see my journal. I showed it to her, and she seemed happy with what I’ve written so far. She told me that I am doing a good job with these entries, that doing this is another small but important step that will help with my healing process. Personally, I don’t really see any progress, but she knows more about this than I do, so I trust her. What happened today that I can talk about? Uhm, work was alright, I guess? Oh! It was my co-worker’s birthday today, we got to celebrate it on lunchtime. The cake he brought was surprisingly delicious! He baked it at home with the help of his wife, apparently. It is a nice change of pace from cheap pre-made crap my other co-workers bring to celebrate these occasions. Not like I am not guilty of doing the same thing, but listen, I am not able to cook even if my life depended on it. I’d much rather bring something mediocre than an inedible mess that could poison somebody! I am rambling again, damn. I was not expecting to enjoy journaling so much. My therapist is definitely onto something. I am feeling quite peckish honestly, could really use another slice of that cake, right about now! I have nothing else in mind that I want to write down, so I believe this is the end of today’s entry.

 

Well never mind, something really fucking weird just happened that I need to write about. While washing the dishes, I was absentmindedly staring at the view of the kitchen window. That’s when I saw… something. I can’t really describe what, because my mind has blocked out that part of my memory for some reason. I can only recall that I thought it looked like some sort of shadow, but much more… Tangible? I think that’s the word. Whatever it was, the brief glimpse I got of it was enough to make me stop what I was doing. My ears started to ring, my vision blurred. Then I remember hearing the dish I was washing falling into the sink and shattering into pieces. I regained some control of my senses, but I was still pretty shaken up, so I sat down to try to compose myself. I thankfully managed to do so quite quickly, but now I stand here bewildered. What the fuck was that? Why did I have such a strange reaction to merely glancing at it? Was it even real? I’m thinking I just had a panic attack, but I have never had one that’s felt as strange as this. I’m a little shaken and exhausted from that experience. Time to get some rest.





**June 25th, 2024**

When I woke up this morning, I couldn’t remember the events of last night, so I went back to my previous entry to refresh my memory. I can’t help but feel perplexed. Just what did I see that caused me to feel such a primal sense of panic? Why can I not remember anything? I can’t make heads or tails out of any of this! I would’ve thought it all to be a bad dream I wrote about or something, but the shards of the plate I broke yesterday that are in my trash can are irrefutable proof of the contrary. Oh whatever, I am just making mountains out of molehills, I freaked out over nothing, like usual! My mood has been soured, so I will end this entry and start getting ready for work now. Hopefully, the next time I write, it won’t be about something like this.

 



**June 28th, 2024**

Ever since that weird incident a couple of days ago, I haven’t been feeling like myself. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything; I just feel… off. Yeah, that’s the best way to describe it, off, like something just is not quite right. I cannot get the events of that night out of my head and cannot stop wondering about what the hell I saw. I have been trying to pretend that it is not a big deal, that it was just my mind playing tricks on me and I simply had a weird reaction to it. But I just can’t shake this sinking feeling that there’s more to it; something that I can’t quite put my finger on. I am going on with my life as I usually do, but the eerie undertone of oddness follows me everywhere. I have an appointment with my therapist soon, I will definitely be bringing this up to her. It’ll all be okay, I’m sure of it. Writing about this did make me feel a little better, so I guess there’s that. That’s all for now.

 

I am scared. I have a bad feeling that something terrible is going to happen. I am home, but I can’t help but feel like I am prey to a lurking predator, that’s ready to ambush me at any moment. I have checked and re-checked any possible hiding spots in my house, but there is nothing there. Of course there’s nothing there, what did I expect to find in the first place? I can feel my heartbeat racing. I will go to sleep early before I get any more worked up.

 



**June 29th, 2024**

I woke up feeling exhausted despite getting the proper amount of sleep. Why is this? Are my sleeping pills losing their effect? I hope not. I was supposed to hang out with my friends today, but I barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning, so I cancelled on them. I feel bad, but they were understanding thankfully. I have been feeling like a zombie, my head is pounding, and this damn feeling just won’t let up for Christ’s sake! I think this may be the depression making its return after all. Next appointment is in 2 days. I will be bringing this up to my therapist. She will know what to do.

 



**July 1st, 2024**

I did not write yesterday as it was more of the same, but I am happy to say that I got good news for today! I brought up my concerns to my therapist. We talked everything over and I feel relieved now. It was just a sudden panic attack, it caught me off guard so I overreacted to it. What I am feeling is just my mind processing it still. These feelings should go away soon, and I will feel better. I just need to be patient with it. I also mentioned to her that journaling has been surprisingly helpful for me, and I thanked her for encouraging me to try it out. My therapist smiled warmly at that, she said she was happy to be of help. She followed up by asking me if I wanted to show her what I’ve written thus far. I wanted to say yes, but something stopped me. A weird dread washed over me, that made me change my mind at the last second. That feeling, that dread, it still lingers over me. I just, didn’t want her to see my writings about what I saw outside my window that night. Now that I think about it, I avoided mentioning it at all, despite it being the cause of my panic attack in the first place. Why did I do that? Was it deliberate? Why am I so afraid of talking about it outside of this journal? I fear that the mere mention of its existence is going to make it worse, somehow. Worse in what way? I don’t understand. I am afraid.

 

I’m just being ridiculous again. I cannot believe that I am letting such a small thing get under my skin so much! I just need some rest, that’s all.

 



**July 5th, 2024**

I’ve been very busy this week. Work has been a handful, but it’s been keeping my mind busy. I think I needed that. I still feel the dread sometimes, but it’s been much more manageable to deal with thankfully. I have a full schedule on the weekend too. I will be visiting family and seeing my friends again. I will do my best to focus on having a good time.





**July 7th, 2024**

That was a lovely weekend! I feel great, like a totally different person. I’m refreshed and ready to take on work first thing in the morning! I don’t even really remember what I was so worked up about! I feel at peace. I am exhausted from so much socializing, so I’ll keep this entry nice and short.

 



**July 16th, 2024**

Been a while but I haven’t had much to talk about. Life has been fine. No weird occurrences, no bad dreams, no bad thoughts, just a smooth ride all around. It feels nice. Life’s good, I’m happy!

 



**July 26th, 2024**

I have been going out a lot lately and I’ve started getting burnt out from it. That’s okay though, it’ll pass, I just need to spend some time with myself to recharge! I purposely planned nothing for this weekend so I can have some nice quality me time. I don’t believe I’ll write about anything else today, but it certainly felt nice to do so after so long.

 

I was watching a movie when I started to hear a barely audible sound coming from somewhere outside. I can’t quite make out what it is, but the best comparison I can think of is a low growl mixed with some choking noises. Strange, but it’s probably my mind playing tricks on me again. It will go away soon.

 

The sound has been persisting for a while and it’s getting on my nerves. I’m dressing up to go check it out. I’ll update this entry if I find anything of note.

 

HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK!!!

 

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT WHAT THE FUCK!?

 

I am shaking like crazy, but I think this is as composed as I can be now. If I do not write about what happened, I will probably lose my god damn mind. I went out to investigate the noise, like I said I would. The thought crossed my mind of how strange it was that none of my neighbours went to check out the noise themselves. It had been going on for over an hour at that point, so surely someone else must’ve heard something, right? Right!? I looked around the apartment complex for the source of the sound. I started to think that maybe, it was a wounded animal crying for help or something, so I started to worry. After a lot of searching, in a very isolated corner of the apartment complex, I found it. I found the source. I found the source of that god awful sound. Oh dear God, what I found was no wounded animal. It was… It was… How can I even describe such a thing? It is the embodiment of fear, of pain, of everything that hurts and is bad in this world. Even thinking about it is making me want to vomit. I can’t breathe, I need a break.

 

My heart and stomach ache still, but I have managed to stabilize my breathing at least. I’ll do my best to describe what I saw. What I saw is definitely not of this world, it just doesn’t belong here. It’s a stretch to call it a ghost or a demon, it feels like something far crueller and more terrifying than that. It was like a shadow, but if it took a physical form. Its body was huge, its proportions nonsensical and it had eyes. So many eyes. On its hands, legs, body, it was covered in fucking eyes. Looking at them hurt. Trying to remember this thing hurts. Everything about this thing screams HURT, in every conceivable way possible. And the face? I cannot even begin describing the face. Even trying to piece it together in my head makes it feel like it’s swimming in a puddle of TV static. When I saw the thing, I froze. My whole body shut down as my brain was desperately trying to fight back for control again. I could only look at it as I realised where the noise was coming from. That noise, that sickly, disgusting noise was its fucking breathing. For whatever reason, of all the details, that one stood out to me the most. I felt stuck. I simply sat there frozen, for what felt like hours, listening to that thing breathing. It didn’t seem like it had noticed me somehow, but I just couldn’t get myself to move away from it. I struggled and I struggled, and I struggled, until finally, I managed to gain some control of my legs. I started to slowly back away from it. I was making some decent distance between us, but I wouldn’t be so lucky to escape so easily. I bumped into something and lost my balance. I hit my head on the floor and my vision went black for a moment. When I opened my eyes again, that thing had changed its position. All its eyes were looking straight at me now. I only remember fragments of what happened next. I screamed I think, then ran, ran like my damn life depended on it. I heard it chasing me, maybe, I don’t know. I hope not. Before I knew it, I was at my apartment. I ran inside and slammed the door shut, making sure all the locks were secured, then collapsed. My head hurts so much, I think there’s blood. I need another break.

 

I am shivering uncontrollably. This thing can’t be real, right? Surely not! It must be a figment of my fucked-up imagination, a beast from the depths of my subconsciousness that has come to torment me specifically! There’s no other explanation! No thing can exist and be that! Look like that! Breathe like that! Breathe…. Like…

 

I passed out. I don’t remember what I wanted to say. Everything hurts, I can’t even describe all the sensations I’m feeling right now. Is that thing staring at me from outside my bedroom’s balcony window? I need sleep.

 



**July 27th, 2024**

I woke up on the floor with a sharp pain on my head. I can feel a bump forming, but I don’t think it’s anything serious like a concussion. What even happened last night? I can only remember scattered fragments. I can feel my heartbeat elevating as I try to piece it all together. Whatever it was, it must’ve been one hell of an experience, because I have used up a lot more pages than I did with the previous entries. Should I read through it? This pain in my head makes it hard to think, read or write. I should give it a rest first.

 

After contemplating it a bit, I’ve decided not to look back on yesterday’s entry. It probably is just more of my ridiculous paranoid ramblings anyway. I’m going to take a painkiller for my head injury and move on with my day. I just need to calm down. Everything is alright.

 



**July 28th, 2024**

Everything is not fine. It is not fine in the fucking slightest!!! Last night that thing, the monster, has made my bedroom’s balcony its own personal residence! It went away after the sun came up, but now that it’s night again, it is fucking back! I have tried to think of anything to make it go away, but I have failed to come up with anything that doesn’t involve either opening that damn window, or calling the police, and I for shit sure don’t want to do either of those. I’ve resorted to always keeping that window locked and the curtains drawn. Even during the day, I just, I don’t trust it. What if it can somehow get in during the day, how can I be sure? My “solution”, if you can call it that, doesn’t seem to make the monster go away, but at least I don’t have to look at it. I keep trying to ignore it, but that horrid sound it makes… the “breathing” is always audible. No matter what I’ve tried to do to shut it out, I can never block out that ungodly sound. If that wasn’t horrible enough, I can feel every single one of its eyes always staring directly at me. It doesn’t matter where I’m at in this house I can always feel it staring. As if its gaze can pierce through the walls themselves. I don’t feel safe in my own home, most especially in my own bedroom. My hands are always shaky, my heartbeat is unsteady, my head feels fuzzy, it is taking a monumental amount of effort to focus on writing this. Am I going crazy?! Why is this happening to me?! Thank God I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. She must know a way out of this madness, right?

 

The sun set many hours ago. I have work tomorrow, but I can’t sleep. Even after taking my pills, I cannot fucking sleep. I can feel the monster gazing into my soul as it steadily breathes, like a hungry predator looking at its prey with glee, knowing it’ll be its next meal eventually. I’m so afraid.

 

I’m going to try sleeping on the couch. I can still feel the monster’s gaze here, but at least I can keep my distance from it. I’m so tired.

 



**July 29th, 2024**

I woke up in a cold sweat and a pounding headache. How many hours of sleep did I get? Three? Maybe four if I’m lucky. My God, how am I going to survive work today? I’m going to need all the coffee I can get.

 

I’m back home. I somehow made it through the day. My appointment came and went. I brought up the fact I've been feeling anxious and tired lately, but once again I avoided mentioning the source of those emotions. I am a coward. What if she doesn’t believe me? What if she makes a mockery of it? Or worse, what if she deems that I’m crazy and I’m sent to ward!? My job, my reputation, my life would be over! No, no, no no no, I cannot risk it. I cannot bring it up, there’s too much at stake! I have made a lot of progress with myself; I cannot let some stupid imaginary monster get in the way of that. God that horrid sound, its fucking breathing is getting on my nerves again! I just want it to shut up, to go away! I want this to END!

 

I started screaming my lungs out at the monster, letting out all my hate and frustration towards it. I knew it was fruitless, I don’t think the damn thing can even hear me, but I didn’t care. I continued yelling at it until I heard a knock from the door. My heart stopped for a moment, but then I heard a familiar voice. It was my neighbour, he came to check up on me. I opened the door to let him in. He asked if I was okay. I didn’t realise how loud I was being or what I was saying. I felt so embarrassed, I apologized and made a stupid excuse to explain my actions away. He was concerned, but he bought my excuse. He offered to hang out for a bit, so we did. I still felt very shaken up and unsafe but having someone by my side made it easier to deal with. I was observing him closely during his stay, curious to see if he felt the monster’s presence too. Aside for his concern for me, however, he didn’t seem to detect that anything else was wrong. My heart sank, because I knew that the monster was my tormentor and mine alone. Time passed in a flash and before I knew it, my neighbour had to head back to his apartment. I wanted to ask him to stay a little longer, just a little bit, but that would be too selfish to ask for without a proper explanation. We said our goodbyes and he left. I feel a little relieved, I had something else to think about other than the monster outside my balcony window. I will go to sleep while I’m still feeling somewhat alright. Goodnight.

 



**July 30th, 2024**

I did a lot of thinking at work today and I think I am on my way to figuring something out. I realised that when I’m around people, the dreadful feeling of the monster’s presence gets weaker. Now that I think about it, the only place that thing seems to have any effect on me is when I am at home. Eureka, that’s it! I’ll just be at home less and around other people more! It was so simple all along, how did I not think of this earlier? I am laughing at myself now, I cannot believe how much I overcomplicate things when I get stressed out! The solution may not be foolproof, as I’ll always have to return home eventually, but I’ll just make sure that I am out and about as much as possible! Maybe the monster will get tired of waiting for me and go fuck off to bother someone else! This realisation has rejuvenated me! I will stop writing now and I shall seize the day to the best of my ability!

 



**August 10th, 2024**

My plan is working out better than I expected! I have been going out, being around people more than ever! It’s been keeping me productive, happy and more importantly, my mind distracted from that monster. I can feel its grip letting go of my heart. I don’t think I even feel afraid of it anymore. The nightmare must be close to over, at last!

 

 

**August 14th, 2024**

I feel overjoyed! The monster hasn’t showed up to bother me in a good while. I didn’t need to confront it, just getting away from it did the trick! I don’t believe I’ll be needing to write much here anymore. I haven’t felt the need to ever since that thing left me alone. I’ll be going out now.

 



**August 22nd, 2024**

Something feels… odd, again. That sinking feeling of dread has returned. I have this unshakeable urge that something really bad is going to happen. No, no it is not. I cannot let my emotions take hold of me again, I have made such good progress after all! There is nothing wrong. Nothing bad is going to happen. I will simply push against them, as hard as I can! I will not let them win. I cannot let them win. I will be meeting with my friends tomorrow. I need to keep my head straight.

 

I swear I can see its silhouette moving around in the dark corners of my bedroom. No, it can’t be. I am overreacting again, I need to rest and calm down. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.",1,1729115113.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I no longer had the intense pain while peeing but I had very uncomfortable tingling after I peed, feeling like I had to pee all the time, bladder pain, bloating and flank pain. I told myself for the next month it was in my head. Until my symptoms got worse. I figured the uti never went away completely. My test came back negative for a uti but I was told maybe I had a kidney infection so I was put back on antibiotics. Then my urine culture came back, and strep B was detected so I was put on a different antibotic.
It is now mid October. I'm in pain every day. Lower abdominal pain and pressure mild cramping and flank pain painful tingling after I pee or itching. I don't have frequency but because of the pressure on my bladder I feel like I have to pee a LOT. I saw a urologist and he said I don't have IC and put me on Hiprex. I'm still not feeling better and today is really bad. I've cut out coffee, soda, alcohol and drink tons of water. I take a cranberry supplement and D-Mannese
Fish oil and D3. Use a heating pad. I tested negative for yeast infection and bv. All my blood and urine tests have come back looking like I'm the picture of health.
I feel like I probably have IC and I'm so scared. I've only been dealing with this for 3 months and I'm going crazy, super depressed. I feel like my life has been ruined by 1 uti.

1g5av25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g5av25/hands_suddenly_seizing_upballing_up_forcefully/,"Hands suddenly seizing up/balling up forcefully after drinking coffee, & some previous possibly related concerns","Heya, good evening, this may be a stupid question & I may delete later but i'm quite curious if anyone might know what i'm dealing with here/has experienced this because google is kind of failing me here. The first little bit is context/background info from the past couple weeks because I feel it's relevant, my actual current concern is a bit further down:

I \[21, AFAB\] somewhat recently tried getting into drinking coffee on occasion \[Roughly 2-3 times per week, whenever i'd go to the store\], it's pretty cheap and likely bad quality instant cold coffee, a latte espresso specifically, at first this was completely fine, i had maybe some stomach complaints but i figured that was because its made of like 80% milk and i have some suspicion that im lactose intolerant, it didn't bother me too much though, then very slowly i started feeling gradually worse: headaches, worse stomach aches, never anything bad enough for me to consider it out of the ordinary, until one day about a month ago when i felt like i couldn't breathe very well all of the sudden, like my throat and/or lungs were like? smaller than usual? it's really hard to describe, basically i felt i couldn't breathe as well as the days before and it caused some pretty significant distress

It faded after about 2-3 days, i dealt with some of the aftermaths for a couple weeks (general breathlessness but never as bad as the first day, the first week i had to sit outside for about an hour to get proper fresh air before i felt comfortable sleeping), it has basically fully faded id say around the beginning of this week, im all good now I think, on that front anyways

I never visited any medical professional for this (even though I likely should have), my dad simply believed and reassured me it was psychological or hyperventilation or claustrophobia or something similar, so we didnt pay it much mind after it mostly went away.

We figured it was either an allergy to something in my room (I'm cleaning pretty heavily because i'm moving atm), like my bird cage, old dried cockatiel droppings maybe, or dust or something, i did consider coffee as the Big Issue at this time but i wasn't super certain and i feel it could've still been quite a few different factors, that said i dont believe i just imagined it or that it was a psychological thing because i have noticed a pretty significant improvement over the last few weeks

Anywho, since I felt better this week, now a month after the last big health issue, i decided to buy some coffee again, and specifically today I happen to run into the next issue which is my current main concern:

I was cleaning out a house (to move into) all day today, and while driving home around an hour ago my ribcage area kind of started tingling (hard to describe but like.. under the breasts but above the stomach, only around the front of my body, my back was fine) and then very very suddenly my arms and hands started tingling too, and then my hands started basically seizing up, they like forcefully balled up/closed, I had to physically pry them open (or get someone to pry open my hands) because i just simply could not do it, my dad ended up stopping at the roadside and i had a quick drink of fanta and rested for a few minutes and it went away on its own after about like.. \~10 minutes i'd say? but it was still somewhat worrying! Not nearly as distressing to me as the previous breathing stuff, and i was overall pretty calm and chill and didnt feel any anxiety or hyperventilation or anything of the sort, although objectively speaking losing control over motion in my hands is probably more concerning than what i had before even if it didnt feel quite as horrible

And i can't really find much info about this online which is why I came here!

I'm perfectly fine now (although as im writing this my body is tingling a slight bit, nothing worrying, i'm probably just sleepy rn) and i have regained all movement in my body, but id really like to know if anyone knows exactly what's going on? I'm no expert but id say with some amount of certainty its the coffee (or this is a really horrible coincidence) so i'm most definetly gonna stop drinking that, not like it did anything to keep me any more awake anyways, but is it like.. an allergy? intolerance? something else?

To throw out some additional bits of information that may be relevant: I was not hyperventilating, my breathing was fine, my pulse felt completely normal, i did not feel like any nerves or something were pinched, my speech may have been slightly slurred but that could have been just my imaginaton, no sweating or other stuff with my body, just my hands being weird

For general info: I drink a lot more sugary soda than I should, i dont excercise very frequently (although that is changing soon) and i have been doing a whole lore more of physically tiring stuff the past 3 days with cleaning this house, I do not take any medication, no drinking, no smoking, no drugs of any kind, no diagnosed illnesses, I do have an undiagnosed eating disorder that im very certain I have, so malnutrition (or something similar, lack of certain parts of nutrition or something) might play a part, i did eat a liitle bit this morning a few hours before the coffee (small sandwich) so i did not drink it entirely on an empty stomach, if thats maybe important info? i also do not weigh a lot, i'm 4'11/1,50m ish and just barely under healthy weight according to the first bmi calc i could find (which isnt always reliable but, you know) i don't know my exact weight off the top of my head but i'd be happy to weigh myself tomorrow if this is info someone needs

I will say its entirely possible that the lack of being generally healthy has caught up to me but i do feel like the coffee is the absolute least a factor in this

Was just wondering if this might be something specific? Is this something that an allergy might be able to cause? Is it maybe like.. heart rate issues? blood pressure maybe? that maybe was already bad due to being unhealthy and made worse by the coffee? I dont really know, i plan on doing an allergy test anyways and ill likely try to visit some professionals who might be able to do some tests once i have the opportunity, but maybe people here could point me towards the right direction to start or anything else I should do (besides being generally healthier lol)

If anyone reads all that and takes the time to respond, thank you very much in advance! I tried to cover everything I could think of here (hence the wall of text) but if anyone has any other questions i'd be happy to answer!

  
Small Update: After posting this my hands have now kiind of started tingling a slight bit again and theyre kind of stiff  (like when typing on my phone it feels a little weird), nothing too concerning to me rn and i kind of expect to be dealikng with this until the coffee is fully out of my system, just worth mentioning imo",1,1729114735.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1g5atgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5atgp,Completed 1st leg of USA Rail Pass ,"We just started our epic journey around the country using the rail pass. Our first segment was the Sunset Limited from San Antonio to Los Angeles. Just thought I’d share a little trip report. I learned so much from reading this sub in preparation for my trip. Almost everything was fantastic and I am so excited for the rest of my trip. I travelled with my husband and daughter and we actually travelled from overseas to make this journey so if anyone has any specific questions about making this trip as a foreigner, I’ll be happy to share anything I can. 

The train leaves San Antonio at such an awful time. 2:45am, and even though the train is there for a few hours, we were not able to board until 2:30am. Those with a room were able to board earlier. You really won’t get much sleep the first night on this train, and the second night, not so much either because it arrives in LA at 5am. However, for me, even in a coach seat, I was able to so easily doze off throughout the day. The lovely rocking of the train was perfect for sleeping, at least for me. 

Sleeping in a coach seat: while the seat itself was comfortable, sleeping all night in this seat is tolerable at best. I am a middle age person with back problems and I was still able to make it work. And I would do it again in a heartbeat and will in fact be doing it many more times in the next month. Just saying that it was not the most comfortable experience. I brought a neck pillow, blanket, and eye mask. It gets cold at night. 

Juanita the burrito lady was in El Paso! She was so nice. As we were waiting to get off the train, some passengers were saying the burritos were hit and miss, but for me, that bean and cheese burrito was absolutely delicious. They cost $3 each and it was very filling. She also sells $3 drinks. Speaking of food: 

We brought a cooler bag filled with crackers, cheese, apples, peanut butter and etc. We did this to save money as we are on a budget. This brings me to a slightly controversial decision I made: we brought a very small electric kettle that looks like a thermos. I was extremely careful with it and held it the entire time it was plugged in. We brought instant coffee (common where we live so we are used to the taste, lol.) The kettle is very slow and honestly, this may have been more trouble than it was worth but we were also able to make instant cup noodles with this. I read about someone doing this online and it works pretty well. Just be careful. Haha. 

This is getting long so I will end here. I will try to update again with other legs of my journey if anyone is interested. And I have to add, for those who know, we actually met Miles and Jackson from the Miles in Transit YouTube channel on this train and they are just as super nice in person. That was crazy and I still can’t believe it happened. 😂

I’ve been looking forward to this trip and planning it for a year and I can’t believe it’s actually happening. It’s like a dream. If you are considering it, you MUST do it! 

Just a last thought: I have read a lot of complaints about Amtrak-the staff, the dirty restrooms, rude passengers, etc. I’m not saying this trip was perfect, but it was pretty amazing and maybe my expectations were realistic going in. But the journey was so smooth and fun. I brought all kinds of ebooks, magazines, downloaded videos, and I barely looked at any of it because it was so incredible just watching the world go by from my window. 💕",6,1729114615.0,Amtrak,2,1.0,False

1g5aqye,https://www.reddit.com/r/clubfoorest/comments/1g5aqye/how_to_make_friends_learnings_from_building/,How to Make Friends - Learnings from Building Foorest,"Hey Reddit friends! 👋

Over the past few months, I’ve had the privilege of talking to hundreds of adults in NYC about how they make (or struggle to make) friends. As part of building *Foorest*—a community to help adults form connections—I’ve been learning firsthand what works, what doesn’t, and why making friends as an adult can feel so challenging.

Through these conversations, I created a course to summarize all the insights I gathered on how to build meaningful friendships, especially in a big, busy city. Today, I’m sharing a “light” version of that course with you! Below are the key takeaways and strategies I’ve found most effective, based on real conversations with people navigating adult friendships.

# Part 1: Preparing to Make Friends

Before you start trying to meet new people, it’s essential to lay a foundation within yourself. Why? Because if you don’t understand what *you* need in a friendship or where you might struggle, it’s hard to build genuine connections with others.

1. **Build Self-Awareness**
   * Ask yourself: What do you value in relationships? Do you seek loyalty, humor, or shared interests? What kind of friend are *you*? Reflecting on what you bring to the table is important because when you know yourself, you can align with others who match your values and vibe.
   * **Why it matters**: This is the first step because friendships are more likely to last when there’s mutual understanding. When you’re clear on your own personality and needs, you’ll be drawn to the right people—those who complement and support you.
2. **Improve Your Confidence**
   * Confidence is magnetic. People are naturally drawn to those who seem comfortable in their own skin. But if you struggle with self-confidence (most of us do sometimes), the good news is you can build it.
   * Start by working on your inner dialogue. Instead of thinking, ""I'm not interesting enough,"" try saying, ""I have qualities that others will appreciate."" Also, immerse yourself in hobbies or activities you enjoy—being good at something builds confidence, which will help when you meet new people.
   * **Why it matters**: Feeling confident helps reduce social anxiety. When you walk into a room believing you’re worthy of connection, you’re more likely to attract people who see that worth too.
3. **Cultivate Openness**
   * Being open to new experiences and friendships is key. Sometimes, we unconsciously limit ourselves, only seeking out people who are just like us. But often, the most meaningful friendships come from the least expected places—like the person who seems totally different from you but shares your core values.
   * **Why it matters**: Friendships require vulnerability. Openness allows you to push through awkwardness, navigate potential rejection, and ultimately form deeper bonds. By being open, you allow space for new, potentially life-changing connections to grow.

# Part 2: Places to Go to Make Friends

Once you’re feeling more prepared internally, it’s time to go out and meet people. But where do you start? One of the biggest challenges in adult friendships is simply *finding* the right environment to meet people. You want to put yourself in situations that encourage interaction and shared experiences.

1. **Be a Regular in Your Community**
   * Ever noticed how the barista at your local coffee shop starts chatting with you once you’re a familiar face? The same goes for regulars at a local park or gym. Becoming a fixture in a community space means you’ll start seeing the same people, and that regular interaction often leads to casual conversations that can spark friendships.
   * **Why it matters**: Familiarity breeds comfort. The more you show up in the same places, the more likely you are to form connections without forcing it. It’s like watering a plant regularly—the friendship starts to grow naturally.
2. **Attend Social Events**
   * Meetup groups, community events, or volunteer opportunities are golden. These spaces are designed for interaction—whether you're bonding over a shared cause, learning something new together, or just having fun, these settings naturally spark conversations.
   * **Why it matters**: You’re meeting people who are *also* looking for connection. Attending a yoga class or volunteering for a charity project isn’t just about the activity; it’s about forming bonds with others who enjoy the same things.
3. **Take Advantage of Digital Spaces**
   * Don’t underestimate the power of the internet! Online spaces like Discord, Reddit, or hobby-specific forums are full of people looking for the same kind of connection you are. These spaces can lead to real-life friendships or provide supportive, long-distance ones.
   * **Why it matters**: Digital friendships may seem less personal at first, but they can grow into something just as meaningful as IRL ones. Plus, it’s a great way to connect with people who share niche interests or hobbies you might not find locally.

# Part 3: How to Speak with Potential Friends

OK, so you’ve put yourself out there. Now comes the part that makes a lot of people nervous—*talking* to potential friends! But don’t worry, there are ways to make it less intimidating and more fun.

1. **Start Simple**
   * You don’t need a perfect icebreaker to start a conversation. A simple, “Hi, how’s your day going?” or “I love your shirt—where did you get it?” works wonders. You can also ask about the event or space you’re in—“How long have you been coming to this yoga class?” It’s low-pressure and shows genuine curiosity.
   * **Why it matters**: Breaking the ice with a friendly comment helps ease into a conversation. The goal is to make the other person feel comfortable too, and simple, non-intrusive questions are a great way to do that.
2. **Active Listening**
   * Once the conversation starts, be present. Ask open-ended questions that let the other person share more about themselves. Instead of asking, “Do you like it here?” ask, “What made you decide to come to this event?” And when they answer, listen—nod, give small verbal cues like “I see” or “That’s awesome.”
   * **Why it matters**: People love to feel heard. Active listening builds rapport quickly because it shows you’re genuinely interested in what they’re saying, not just waiting for your turn to talk.
3. **Be Authentic**
   * You don’t have to overshare, but being a little vulnerable goes a long way. Talk about your own experiences, share a funny story, or let them know you’re new to this too. Authenticity is magnetic—it lets the other person see you as a real human being and encourages them to open up as well.
   * **Why it matters**: Authentic connections are built on trust. When you’re real with people, it creates a deeper, more meaningful bond, which can lead to lasting friendships.

# Part 4: Nurturing Friendship After an Initial Meeting

So you’ve met someone you click with—now what? Building a friendship takes consistent effort. It doesn’t have to be overwhelming, but following up after that first meeting is crucial.

1. **Follow Up**
   * Don’t be afraid to send a casual message a few days after meeting someone. Something simple like, “Hey, it was great meeting you at the event! Would you want to grab coffee sometime?” shows that you’re interested in continuing the connection without making it too formal.
   * **Why it matters**: Friendships need momentum. Following up soon after you meet someone keeps the connection fresh and signals your interest in building something beyond that initial meeting.
2. **Consistency is Key**
   * Maintaining regular contact—even if it’s just sharing a funny meme or a quick “Hey, thinking of you!” text—helps friendships grow. If you’re not ready for one-on-one hangouts, invite them to group activities, which feel lower-pressure and more relaxed.
   * **Why it matters**: Consistency shows that you’re invested in the friendship. Over time, these small moments add up and solidify the bond.
3. **Respect Boundaries**
   * Not everyone has the same social bandwidth. Some people may not be able to hang out as often as you’d like, and that’s OK. Respecting their time and space is crucial for a healthy friendship. If someone is busy or can’t make it, don’t take it personally!
   * **Why it matters**: Friendships grow at their own pace. Being patient and understanding builds trust and shows that you’re a considerate friend.

# Part 5: Navigating Challenges and Strengthening Bonds

Friendship isn’t always smooth sailing. Whether it’s handling rejection, managing expectations, or deepening connections with existing friends, this section focuses on how to navigate challenges.

1. **Handle Rejection Gracefully**
   * Sometimes people just aren’t in a place where they can form new friendships. Maybe their life is full, or they’re dealing with personal issues. If someone doesn’t reciprocate your efforts to connect, it’s important not to take it personally.
   * **Why it matters**: Rejection is a normal part of the process. It’s about timing—what doesn’t work now might work in the future, and keeping an open, positive mindset will help you stay resilient.
2. **Manage Expectations**
   * Not every friendship will become your new “best friend” scenario, and that’s totally fine. Some connections remain casual, while others deepen over time. Learning to appreciate each friendship for what it is without putting too much pressure on it is key.
   * **Why it matters**: Different friendships serve different purposes, and that’s OK. Flexibility in your expectations allows you to enjoy each connection for what it is.
3. **Deepen Existing Friendships**
   * Don’t forget about the friends you already have! As you build new connections, continue nurturing the friendships that mean the most to you. Engage in meaningful conversations, plan fun activities, or take trips together to strengthen those bonds.
   * **Why it matters**: Long-term friendships need care too. Deepening existing relationships adds value to your life and provides the emotional support we all need.

My therapist suggested I start writing my thoughts down in a journal, saying it will supposedly help me understand and process my emotions, and I’ll get to know myself better as a result. I am sceptical, but what the hell, I’ll give it a shot! I have never kept a journal before, so I have no clue how to start… Uhm, hello, I guess. I’m me and I’m writing this to myself… Do I introduce myself now? To whom? I already know myself, and I highly doubt anyone else is ever going to read this, except my therapist maybe. I’m just rambling about nothing to a bunch of pages now, I can’t really think of anything interesting to say, so I’ll just end this entry here.

 



**June 18th, 2024**

Am I supposed to do this journaling thing daily, or what? My therapist simply told me to do it in whatever way feels right for me, but I haven’t figured that out yet. If I try to do it daily, I’ll just get annoyed and give up. On the other hand, if I wait too long, I’ll forget about it altogether. I should be able to figure it out eventually. Anyways, not much to talk about today. It’s a weekday so it’s the same old eat, work, sleep routine like usual. I will be hanging out with some friends later this week, so that’s something exciting to look forward to, I guess! I am happy to have my friends, they have been super supportive and understanding through this whole mess, I don’t really know where I would be without them. Look at me, rambling about random things again! I suppose this is par for the course when it comes to doing this whole journaling business? I don’t have anything else to write about, I’ll leave this entry where it’s at and head to bed.

 



**June 23rd, 2024**

Haven’t written anything for a couple of days, but it feels like it’s high time for another entry, so here goes! The weekend was fun, my friends and I had a fun time at the karaoke bar we went to. I think I drank a bit too much, though, because for the first time ever, my friends actually managed to convince me to try singing karaoke. Let’s just say, my mediocre singing voice paired with the effects of the alcohol in my system, made for a barely audible mess of a performance. One of my friends took a video and showed it to me the next morning. I was as red as a tomato from embarrassment, but looking back, I find it more amusing than something to be shy about! We all got a good chuckle out of it, so it is not too bad. That is everything of note, I believe. This journal is supposed to be about cataloguing my thoughts and all, but my mind isn’t filled with anything particularly exciting or interesting nowadays. I’ll keep trying to maintain this, but is there much of a point if it’s just me talking about the same stuff over and over? I will a have discussion about this with my therapist on my next appointment tomorrow, surely, she’ll be able to explain it to me better. I’m exhausted and will be needing my energy for work tomorrow, so I’ll stop writing for now.

 



**June 24th, 2024**

Brought up the topic I wrote about yesterday at today’s appointment. My therapist asked to see my journal. I showed it to her, and she seemed happy with what I’ve written so far. She told me that I am doing a good job with these entries, that doing this is another small but important step that will help with my healing process. Personally, I don’t really see any progress, but she knows more about this than I do, so I trust her. What happened today that I can talk about? Uhm, work was alright, I guess? Oh! It was my co-worker’s birthday today, we got to celebrate it on lunchtime. The cake he brought was surprisingly delicious! He baked it at home with the help of his wife, apparently. It is a nice change of pace from cheap pre-made crap my other co-workers bring to celebrate these occasions. Not like I am not guilty of doing the same thing, but listen, I am not able to cook even if my life depended on it. I’d much rather bring something mediocre than an inedible mess that could poison somebody! I am rambling again, damn. I was not expecting to enjoy journaling so much. My therapist is definitely onto something. I am feeling quite peckish honestly, could really use another slice of that cake, right about now! I have nothing else in mind that I want to write down, so I believe this is the end of today’s entry.

 

Well never mind, something really fucking weird just happened that I need to write about. While washing the dishes, I was absentmindedly staring at the view of the kitchen window. That’s when I saw… something. I can’t really describe what, because my mind has blocked out that part of my memory for some reason. I can only recall that I thought it looked like some sort of shadow, but much more… Tangible? I think that’s the word. Whatever it was, the brief glimpse I got of it was enough to make me stop what I was doing. My ears started to ring, my vision blurred. Then I remember hearing the dish I was washing falling into the sink and shattering into pieces. I regained some control of my senses, but I was still pretty shaken up, so I sat down to try to compose myself. I thankfully managed to do so quite quickly, but now I stand here bewildered. What the fuck was that? Why did I have such a strange reaction to merely glancing at it? Was it even real? I’m thinking I just had a panic attack, but I have never had one that’s felt as strange as this. I’m a little shaken and exhausted from that experience. Time to get some rest.





**June 25th, 2024**

When I woke up this morning, I couldn’t remember the events of last night, so I went back to my previous entry to refresh my memory. I can’t help but feel perplexed. Just what did I see that caused me to feel such a primal sense of panic? Why can I not remember anything? I can’t make heads or tails out of any of this! I would’ve thought it all to be a bad dream I wrote about or something, but the shards of the plate I broke yesterday that are in my trash can are irrefutable proof of the contrary. Oh whatever, I am just making mountains out of molehills, I freaked out over nothing, like usual! My mood has been soured, so I will end this entry and start getting ready for work now. Hopefully, the next time I write, it won’t be about something like this.

 



**June 28th, 2024**

Ever since that weird incident a couple of days ago, I haven’t been feeling like myself. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything; I just feel… off. Yeah, that’s the best way to describe it, off, like something just is not quite right. I cannot get the events of that night out of my head and cannot stop wondering about what the hell I saw. I have been trying to pretend that it is not a big deal, that it was just my mind playing tricks on me and I simply had a weird reaction to it. But I just can’t shake this sinking feeling that there’s more to it; something that I can’t quite put my finger on. I am going on with my life as I usually do, but the eerie undertone of oddness follows me everywhere. I have an appointment with my therapist soon, I will definitely be bringing this up to her. It’ll all be okay, I’m sure of it. Writing about this did make me feel a little better, so I guess there’s that. That’s all for now.

 

I am scared. I have a bad feeling that something terrible is going to happen. I am home, but I can’t help but feel like I am prey to a lurking predator, that’s ready to ambush me at any moment. I have checked and re-checked any possible hiding spots in my house, but there is nothing there. Of course there’s nothing there, what did I expect to find in the first place? I can feel my heartbeat racing. I will go to sleep early before I get any more worked up.

 



**June 29th, 2024**

I woke up feeling exhausted despite getting the proper amount of sleep. Why is this? Are my sleeping pills losing their effect? I hope not. I was supposed to hang out with my friends today, but I barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning, so I cancelled on them. I feel bad, but they were understanding thankfully. I have been feeling like a zombie, my head is pounding, and this damn feeling just won’t let up for Christ’s sake! I think this may be the depression making its return after all. Next appointment is in 2 days. I will be bringing this up to my therapist. She will know what to do.

 



**July 1st, 2024**

I did not write yesterday as it was more of the same, but I am happy to say that I got good news for today! I brought up my concerns to my therapist. We talked everything over and I feel relieved now. It was just a sudden panic attack, it caught me off guard so I overreacted to it. What I am feeling is just my mind processing it still. These feelings should go away soon, and I will feel better. I just need to be patient with it. I also mentioned to her that journaling has been surprisingly helpful for me, and I thanked her for encouraging me to try it out. My therapist smiled warmly at that, she said she was happy to be of help. She followed up by asking me if I wanted to show her what I’ve written thus far. I wanted to say yes, but something stopped me. A weird dread washed over me, that made me change my mind at the last second. That feeling, that dread, it still lingers over me. I just, didn’t want her to see my writings about what I saw outside my window that night. Now that I think about it, I avoided mentioning it at all, despite it being the cause of my panic attack in the first place. Why did I do that? Was it deliberate? Why am I so afraid of talking about it outside of this journal? I fear that the mere mention of its existence is going to make it worse, somehow. Worse in what way? I don’t understand. I am afraid.

 

I’m just being ridiculous again. I cannot believe that I am letting such a small thing get under my skin so much! I just need some rest, that’s all.

 



**July 5th, 2024**

I’ve been very busy this week. Work has been a handful, but it’s been keeping my mind busy. I think I needed that. I still feel the dread sometimes, but it’s been much more manageable to deal with thankfully. I have a full schedule on the weekend too. I will be visiting family and seeing my friends again. I will do my best to focus on having a good time.





**July 7th, 2024**

That was a lovely weekend! I feel great, like a totally different person. I’m refreshed and ready to take on work first thing in the morning! I don’t even really remember what I was so worked up about! I feel at peace. I am exhausted from so much socializing, so I’ll keep this entry nice and short.

 



**July 16th, 2024**

Been a while but I haven’t had much to talk about. Life has been fine. No weird occurrences, no bad dreams, no bad thoughts, just a smooth ride all around. It feels nice. Life’s good, I’m happy!

 



**July 26th, 2024**

I have been going out a lot lately and I’ve started getting burnt out from it. That’s okay though, it’ll pass, I just need to spend some time with myself to recharge! I purposely planned nothing for this weekend so I can have some nice quality me time. I don’t believe I’ll write about anything else today, but it certainly felt nice to do so after so long.

 

I was watching a movie when I started to hear a barely audible sound coming from somewhere outside. I can’t quite make out what it is, but the best comparison I can think of is a low growl mixed with some choking noises. Strange, but it’s probably my mind playing tricks on me again. It will go away soon.

 

The sound has been persisting for a while and it’s getting on my nerves. I’m dressing up to go check it out. I’ll update this entry if I find anything of note.

 

HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK!!!

 

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT WHAT THE FUCK!?

 

I am shaking like crazy, but I think this is as composed as I can be now. If I do not write about what happened, I will probably lose my god damn mind. I went out to investigate the noise, like I said I would. The thought crossed my mind of how strange it was that none of my neighbours went to check out the noise themselves. It had been going on for over an hour at that point, so surely someone else must’ve heard something, right? Right!? I looked around the apartment complex for the source of the sound. I started to think that maybe, it was a wounded animal crying for help or something, so I started to worry. After a lot of searching, in a very isolated corner of the apartment complex, I found it. I found the source. I found the source of that god awful sound. Oh dear God, what I found was no wounded animal. It was… It was… How can I even describe such a thing? It is the embodiment of fear, of pain, of everything that hurts and is bad in this world. Even thinking about it is making me want to vomit. I can’t breathe, I need a break.

 

My heart and stomach ache still, but I have managed to stabilize my breathing at least. I’ll do my best to describe what I saw. What I saw is definitely not of this world, it just doesn’t belong here. It’s a stretch to call it a ghost or a demon, it feels like something far crueller and more terrifying than that. It was like a shadow, but if it took a physical form. Its body was huge, its proportions nonsensical and it had eyes. So many eyes. On its hands, legs, body, it was covered in fucking eyes. Looking at them hurt. Trying to remember this thing hurts. Everything about this thing screams HURT, in every conceivable way possible. And the face? I cannot even begin describing the face. Even trying to piece it together in my head makes it feel like it’s swimming in a puddle of TV static. When I saw the thing, I froze. My whole body shut down as my brain was desperately trying to fight back for control again. I could only look at it as I realised where the noise was coming from. That noise, that sickly, disgusting noise was its fucking breathing. For whatever reason, of all the details, that one stood out to me the most. I felt stuck. I simply sat there frozen, for what felt like hours, listening to that thing breathing. It didn’t seem like it had noticed me somehow, but I just couldn’t get myself to move away from it. I struggled and I struggled, and I struggled, until finally, I managed to gain some control of my legs. I started to slowly back away from it. I was making some decent distance between us, but I wouldn’t be so lucky to escape so easily. I bumped into something and lost my balance. I hit my head on the floor and my vision went black for a moment. When I opened my eyes again, that thing had changed its position. All its eyes were looking straight at me now. I only remember fragments of what happened next. I screamed I think, then ran, ran like my damn life depended on it. I heard it chasing me, maybe, I don’t know. I hope not. Before I knew it, I was at my apartment. I ran inside and slammed the door shut, making sure all the locks were secured, then collapsed. My head hurts so much, I think there’s blood. I need another break.

 

I am shivering uncontrollably. This thing can’t be real, right? Surely not! It must be a figment of my fucked-up imagination, a beast from the depths of my subconsciousness that has come to torment me specifically! There’s no other explanation! No thing can exist and be that! Look like that! Breathe like that! Breathe…. Like…

 

I passed out. I don’t remember what I wanted to say. Everything hurts, I can’t even describe all the sensations I’m feeling right now. Is that thing staring at me from outside my bedroom’s balcony window? I need sleep.

 



**July 27th, 2024**

I woke up on the floor with a sharp pain on my head. I can feel a bump forming, but I don’t think it’s anything serious like a concussion. What even happened last night? I can only remember scattered fragments. I can feel my heartbeat elevating as I try to piece it all together. Whatever it was, it must’ve been one hell of an experience, because I have used up a lot more pages than I did with the previous entries. Should I read through it? This pain in my head makes it hard to think, read or write. I should give it a rest first.

 

After contemplating it a bit, I’ve decided not to look back on yesterday’s entry. It probably is just more of my ridiculous paranoid ramblings anyway. I’m going to take a painkiller for my head injury and move on with my day. I just need to calm down. Everything is alright.

 



**July 28th, 2024**

Everything is not fine. It is not fine in the fucking slightest!!! Last night that thing, the monster, has made my bedroom’s balcony its own personal residence! It went away after the sun came up, but now that it’s night again, it is fucking back! I have tried to think of anything to make it go away, but I have failed to come up with anything that doesn’t involve either opening that damn window, or calling the police, and I for shit sure don’t want to do either of those. I’ve resorted to always keeping that window locked and the curtains drawn. Even during the day, I just, I don’t trust it. What if it can somehow get in during the day, how can I be sure? My “solution”, if you can call it that, doesn’t seem to make the monster go away, but at least I don’t have to look at it. I keep trying to ignore it, but that horrid sound it makes… the “breathing” is always audible. No matter what I’ve tried to do to shut it out, I can never block out that ungodly sound. If that wasn’t horrible enough, I can feel every single one of its eyes always staring directly at me. It doesn’t matter where I’m at in this house I can always feel it staring. As if its gaze can pierce through the walls themselves. I don’t feel safe in my own home, most especially in my own bedroom. My hands are always shaky, my heartbeat is unsteady, my head feels fuzzy, it is taking a monumental amount of effort to focus on writing this. Am I going crazy?! Why is this happening to me?! Thank God I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. She must know a way out of this madness, right?

 

The sun set many hours ago. I have work tomorrow, but I can’t sleep. Even after taking my pills, I cannot fucking sleep. I can feel the monster gazing into my soul as it steadily breathes, like a hungry predator looking at its prey with glee, knowing it’ll be its next meal eventually. I’m so afraid.

 

I’m going to try sleeping on the couch. I can still feel the monster’s gaze here, but at least I can keep my distance from it. I’m so tired.

 



**July 29th, 2024**

I woke up in a cold sweat and a pounding headache. How many hours of sleep did I get? Three? Maybe four if I’m lucky. My God, how am I going to survive work today? I’m going to need all the coffee I can get.

 

I’m back home. I somehow made it through the day. My appointment came and went. I brought up the fact I've been feeling anxious and tired lately, but once again I avoided mentioning the source of those emotions. I am a coward. What if she doesn’t believe me? What if she makes a mockery of it? Or worse, what if she deems that I’m crazy and I’m sent to ward!? My job, my reputation, my life would be over! No, no, no no no, I cannot risk it. I cannot bring it up, there’s too much at stake! I have made a lot of progress with myself; I cannot let some stupid imaginary monster get in the way of that. God that horrid sound, its fucking breathing is getting on my nerves again! I just want it to shut up, to go away! I want this to END!

 

I started screaming my lungs out at the monster, letting out all my hate and frustration towards it. I knew it was fruitless, I don’t think the damn thing can even hear me, but I didn’t care. I continued yelling at it until I heard a knock from the door. My heart stopped for a moment, but then I heard a familiar voice. It was my neighbour, he came to check up on me. I opened the door to let him in. He asked if I was okay. I didn’t realise how loud I was being or what I was saying. I felt so embarrassed, I apologized and made a stupid excuse to explain my actions away. He was concerned, but he bought my excuse. He offered to hang out for a bit, so we did. I still felt very shaken up and unsafe but having someone by my side made it easier to deal with. I was observing him closely during his stay, curious to see if he felt the monster’s presence too. Aside for his concern for me, however, he didn’t seem to detect that anything else was wrong. My heart sank, because I knew that the monster was my tormentor and mine alone. Time passed in a flash and before I knew it, my neighbour had to head back to his apartment. I wanted to ask him to stay a little longer, just a little bit, but that would be too selfish to ask for without a proper explanation. We said our goodbyes and he left. I feel a little relieved, I had something else to think about other than the monster outside my balcony window. I will go to sleep while I’m still feeling somewhat alright. Goodnight.

 



**July 30th, 2024**

I did a lot of thinking at work today and I think I am on my way to figuring something out. I realised that when I’m around people, the dreadful feeling of the monster’s presence gets weaker. Now that I think about it, the only place that thing seems to have any effect on me is when I am at home. Eureka, that’s it! I’ll just be at home less and around other people more! It was so simple all along, how did I not think of this earlier? I am laughing at myself now, I cannot believe how much I overcomplicate things when I get stressed out! The solution may not be foolproof, as I’ll always have to return home eventually, but I’ll just make sure that I am out and about as much as possible! Maybe the monster will get tired of waiting for me and go fuck off to bother someone else! This realisation has rejuvenated me! I will stop writing now and I shall seize the day to the best of my ability!

 



**August 10th, 2024**

My plan is working out better than I expected! I have been going out, being around people more than ever! It’s been keeping me productive, happy and more importantly, my mind distracted from that monster. I can feel its grip letting go of my heart. I don’t think I even feel afraid of it anymore. The nightmare must be close to over, at last!

 

 

**August 14th, 2024**

I feel overjoyed! The monster hasn’t showed up to bother me in a good while. I didn’t need to confront it, just getting away from it did the trick! I don’t believe I’ll be needing to write much here anymore. I haven’t felt the need to ever since that thing left me alone. I’ll be going out now.",1,1729114386.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Both my friend ""Sue"" and I have  had miscarriages and I have lost a full term baby so know losing a baby whether 10 weeks pregnant or born is devastating. The thing is Sue's sister ""Tammy""  (f32) not only has had 3 abortions but told us both after all our miscarriages that we were overreacting because they are not even babies until 20some weeks. So was over at Sue's having coffee when Tammy came over crying. She was crying and she said ""I lost our baby, Mark is going to leave me"". I told her to sit down. I also asked how far along. She said they guessed 10-12 weeks. I told her I was sorry and that we had both been there. 
All of a sudden Sue replied ""weren't you always telling us that they weren't babies until 20 some weeks and that people were overreating when they lost babies even at 18 weeks, not to mention you had no bad feelings of aborting your other 3? She didn't say it harshly . I didn't say anything at first( trying to stay out of it if possible). Tammy looks at me and say "" are you going to respond to the terrible stuff she just said?"" Again just stayed quiet. Remember this is just the sister of a friend. Tammy then asked me if Sue had a right to say those things. I then said ""although I really feel for you and am sorry, your sister made some valid points. You didn't care about her or anyone else's pain. Do you expect her to to just forget that now?"" The two started up again and I left.  Later Tammy called me to tell me I was as uncaring as her sister for not defending her against her sister and leaving. I told her again I was sorry for her loss but her sister's loss was still fresh too and she had a right to say what she felt.

Sadly baby’s father is not in the picture right now (legal stuff, long story). Basically, my husband and I were more or less reassured his legal battle would end favorably for us after years of fighting it, and it didn’t. It’s gutting, and we are both extremely sad and upset he can’t help raise our baby for the foreseeable future. He and I lived with his family for a few years and it was mostly harmonious. Since my husband’s incarceration, my parents (late 60s) had pressured me to move back in with them so they can help take care of the baby. They told me my in-laws aren’t my real family, and won’t take care of me or baby as well as they could. I felt guilty and pressured, and immediately PP I did move back with them for a time because my PPD/A was terrible and I was struggling a lot. Here’s the catch: my dad is a narcissist, my mom is an enabler, and they have very particular, controlling, and transactional way of being. My husband always took took issue with the fact they never treated their adult children like adults. My parents don’t respond well to criticism, love talking shit about everyone in their lives, and are just generally negative people. But they love my baby and I am very appreciative of their help.
Lately my parents have been scaring me because they’ve been forgetful of a lot of things (how to make their coffee in the morning, forgetting things  I just said, or entire conversations we had less than 2 weeks ago). When they do something I don’t like, they attack me and are extremely defensive. My dad raises his voice / swears at me (has done this to me while he was holding my baby), my mom has laughed at me while trying to convey my concerns and rolls her eyes, and dismisses my concerns and tells me I should really look at how I contribute to ‘problems.’ My husband was my rock and helped me set healthy boundaries with them in the past, so coming back to live with them has been extremely hard. I never wanted to live with them again. My parents reduced me to tears on my baby shower because I was still with my in-laws at the time, telling me they were disgusted they had to travel to see me, and my choices were wrong. It was horrible. But my in-laws don’t have as much time to help me out when I go back to work soon, and daycare costs in my area or living on my own while also paying legal fees isn’t doable. 
Most recently my dad left something out that my baby could have accidentally choked on. I was extremely upset and worried something could have happened to him and told them as much. My mom raged at me, accusing me of thinking they were incompetent and negligent when they ‘raised 2 kids.’ ‘nothing happened,’ and ‘it’s not like we did this on purpose.’ I tried to calmly explain my baby could have choked and died, and they were angry I used such ‘strong language.’ I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m being gaslit, and totally dismissed. If I move back to my in-laws
I will have a little more peace, but know that my parents will go absolutely nuclear if I leave after all they’ve done for me, even though they offered. I don’t know when my husband will be back. He was worried this dynamic would emerge and is concerned for my emotional well-being and our baby’s safety. I just feel so lost and stuck. So Reddit, WIBTA if I left my parents to go back to my in-laws? I love my parents, but I just struggle living with them, and I don’t think they’ll see it as anything other than me picking my ‘fake family’ over them. ",1,1729114013.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,1.0,False

My therapist suggested I start writing my thoughts down in a journal, saying it will supposedly help me understand and process my emotions, and I’ll get to know myself better as a result. I am sceptical, but what the hell, I’ll give it a shot! I have never kept a journal before, so I have no clue how to start… Uhm, hello, I guess. I’m me and I’m writing this to myself… Do I introduce myself now? To whom? I already know myself, and I highly doubt anyone else is ever going to read this, except my therapist maybe. I’m just rambling about nothing to a bunch of pages now, I can’t really think of anything interesting to say, so I’ll just end this entry here.

 



June 18th, 2024

Am I supposed to do this journaling thing daily, or what? My therapist simply told me to do it in whatever way feels right for me, but I haven’t figured that out yet. If I try to do it daily, I’ll just get annoyed and give up. On the other hand, if I wait too long, I’ll forget about it altogether. I should be able to figure it out eventually. Anyways, not much to talk about today. It’s a weekday so it’s the same old eat, work, sleep routine like usual. I will be hanging out with some friends later this week, so that’s something exciting to look forward to, I guess! I am happy to have my friends, they have been super supportive and understanding through this whole mess, I don’t really know where I would be without them. Look at me, rambling about random things again! I suppose this is par for the course when it comes to doing this whole journaling business? I don’t have anything else to write about, I’ll leave this entry where it’s at and head to bed.

 



June 23rd, 2024

Haven’t written anything for a couple of days, but it feels like it’s high time for another entry, so here goes! The weekend was fun, my friends and I had a fun time at the karaoke bar we went to. I think I drank a bit too much, though, because for the first time ever, my friends actually managed to convince me to try singing karaoke. Let’s just say, my mediocre singing voice paired with the effects of the alcohol in my system, made for a barely audible mess of a performance. One of my friends took a video and showed it to me the next morning. I was as red as a tomato from embarrassment, but looking back, I find it more amusing than something to be shy about! We all got a good chuckle out of it, so it is not too bad. That is everything of note, I believe. This journal is supposed to be about cataloguing my thoughts and all, but my mind isn’t filled with anything particularly exciting or interesting nowadays. I’ll keep trying to maintain this, but is there much of a point if it’s just me talking about the same stuff over and over? I will a have discussion about this with my therapist on my next appointment tomorrow, surely, she’ll be able to explain it to me better. I’m exhausted and will be needing my energy for work tomorrow, so I’ll stop writing for now.

 



June 24th, 2024

Brought up the topic I wrote about yesterday at today’s appointment. My therapist asked to see my journal. I showed it to her, and she seemed happy with what I’ve written so far. She told me that I am doing a good job with these entries, that doing this is another small but important step that will help with my healing process. Personally, I don’t really see any progress, but she knows more about this than I do, so I trust her. What happened today that I can talk about? Uhm, work was alright, I guess? Oh! It was my co-worker’s birthday today, we got to celebrate it on lunchtime. The cake he brought was surprisingly delicious! He baked it at home with the help of his wife, apparently. It is a nice change of pace from cheap pre-made crap my other co-workers bring to celebrate these occasions. Not like I am not guilty of doing the same thing, but listen, I am not able to cook even if my life depended on it. I’d much rather bring something mediocre than an inedible mess that could poison somebody! I am rambling again, damn. I was not expecting to enjoy journaling so much. My therapist is definitely onto something. I am feeling quite peckish honestly, could really use another slice of that cake, right about now! I have nothing else in mind that I want to write down, so I believe this is the end of today’s entry.

 

Well never mind, something really fucking weird just happened that I need to write about. While washing the dishes, I was absentmindedly staring at the view of the kitchen window. That’s when I saw… something. I can’t really describe what, because my mind has blocked out that part of my memory for some reason. I can only recall that I thought it looked like some sort of shadow, but much more… Tangible? I think that’s the word. Whatever it was, the brief glimpse I got of it was enough to make me stop what I was doing. My ears started to ring, my vision blurred. Then I remember hearing the dish I was washing falling into the sink and shattering into pieces. I regained some control of my senses, but I was still pretty shaken up, so I sat down to try to compose myself. I thankfully managed to do so quite quickly, but now I stand here bewildered. What the fuck was that? Why did I have such a strange reaction to merely glancing at it? Was it even real? I’m thinking I just had a panic attack, but I have never had one that’s felt as strange as this. I’m a little shaken and exhausted from that experience. Time to get some rest.





June 25th, 2024

When I woke up this morning, I couldn’t remember the events of last night, so I went back to my previous entry to refresh my memory. I can’t help but feel perplexed. Just what did I see that caused me to feel such a primal sense of panic? Why can I not remember anything? I can’t make heads or tails out of any of this! I would’ve thought it all to be a bad dream I wrote about or something, but the shards of the plate I broke yesterday that are in my trash can are irrefutable proof of the contrary. Oh whatever, I am just making mountains out of molehills, I freaked out over nothing, like usual! My mood has been soured, so I will end this entry and start getting ready for work now. Hopefully, the next time I write, it won’t be about something like this.

 



June 28th, 2024

Ever since that weird incident a couple of days ago, I haven’t been feeling like myself. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything; I just feel… off. Yeah, that’s the best way to describe it, off, like something just is not quite right. I cannot get the events of that night out of my head and cannot stop wondering about what the hell I saw. I have been trying to pretend that it is not a big deal, that it was just my mind playing tricks on me and I simply had a weird reaction to it. But I just can’t shake this sinking feeling that there’s more to it; something that I can’t quite put my finger on. I am going on with my life as I usually do, but the eerie undertone of oddness follows me everywhere. I have an appointment with my therapist soon, I will definitely be bringing this up to her. It’ll all be okay, I’m sure of it. Writing about this did make me feel a little better, so I guess there’s that. That’s all for now.

 

I am scared. I have a bad feeling that something terrible is going to happen. I am home, but I can’t help but feel like I am prey to a lurking predator, that’s ready to ambush me at any moment. I have checked and re-checked any possible hiding spots in my house, but there is nothing there. Of course there’s nothing there, what did I expect to find in the first place? I can feel my heartbeat racing. I will go to sleep early before I get any more worked up.

 



June 29th, 2024

I woke up feeling exhausted despite getting the proper amount of sleep. Why is this? Are my sleeping pills losing their effect? I hope not. I was supposed to hang out with my friends today, but I barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning, so I cancelled on them. I feel bad, but they were understanding thankfully. I have been feeling like a zombie, my head is pounding, and this damn feeling just won’t let up for Christ’s sake! I think this may be the depression making its return after all. Next appointment is in 2 days. I will be bringing this up to my therapist. She will know what to do.

 



July 1st, 2024

I did not write yesterday as it was more of the same, but I am happy to say that I got good news for today! I brought up my concerns to my therapist. We talked everything over and I feel relieved now. It was just a sudden panic attack, it caught me off guard so I overreacted to it. What I am feeling is just my mind processing it still. These feelings should go away soon, and I will feel better. I just need to be patient with it. I also mentioned to her that journaling has been surprisingly helpful for me, and I thanked her for encouraging me to try it out. My therapist smiled warmly at that, she said she was happy to be of help. She followed up by asking me if I wanted to show her what I’ve written thus far. I wanted to say yes, but something stopped me. A weird dread washed over me, that made me change my mind at the last second. That feeling, that dread, it still lingers over me. I just, didn’t want her to see my writings about what I saw outside my window that night. Now that I think about it, I avoided mentioning it at all, despite it being the cause of my panic attack in the first place. Why did I do that? Was it deliberate? Why am I so afraid of talking about it outside of this journal? I fear that the mere mention of its existence is going to make it worse, somehow. Worse in what way? I don’t understand. I am afraid.

 

I’m just being ridiculous again. I cannot believe that I am letting such a small thing get under my skin so much! I just need some rest, that’s all.

 



July 5th, 2024

I’ve been very busy this week. Work has been a handful, but it’s been keeping my mind busy. I think I needed that. I still feel the dread sometimes, but it’s been much more manageable to deal with thankfully. I have a full schedule on the weekend too. I will be visiting family and seeing my friends again. I will do my best to focus on having a good time.





July 7th, 2024

That was a lovely weekend! I feel great, like a totally different person. I’m refreshed and ready to take on work first thing in the morning! I don’t even really remember what I was so worked up about! I feel at peace. I am exhausted from so much socializing, so I’ll keep this entry nice and short.

 



July 16th, 2024

Been a while but I haven’t had much to talk about. Life has been fine. No weird occurrences, no bad dreams, no bad thoughts, just a smooth ride all around. It feels nice. Life’s good, I’m happy!

 



July 26th, 2024

I have been going out a lot lately and I’ve started getting burnt out from it. That’s okay though, it’ll pass, I just need to spend some time with myself to recharge! I purposely planned nothing for this weekend so I can have some nice quality me time. I don’t believe I’ll write about anything else today, but it certainly felt nice to do so after so long.

 

I was watching a movie when I started to hear a barely audible sound coming from somewhere outside. I can’t quite make out what it is, but the best comparison I can think of is a low growl mixed with some choking noises. Strange, but it’s probably my mind playing tricks on me again. It will go away soon.

 

The sound has been persisting for a while and it’s getting on my nerves. I’m dressing up to go check it out. I’ll update this entry if I find anything of note.

 

HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK!!!

 

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT WHAT THE FUCK!?

 

I am shaking like crazy, but I think this is as composed as I can be now. If I do not write about what happened, I will probably lose my god damn mind. I went out to investigate the noise, like I said I would. The thought crossed my mind of how strange it was that none of my neighbours went to check out the noise themselves. It had been going on for over an hour at that point, so surely someone else must’ve heard something, right? Right!? I looked around the apartment complex for the source of the sound. I started to think that maybe, it was a wounded animal crying for help or something, so I started to worry. After a lot of searching, in a very isolated corner of the apartment complex, I found it. I found the source. I found the source of that god awful sound. Oh dear God, what I found was no wounded animal. It was… It was… How can I even describe such a thing? It is the embodiment of fear, of pain, of everything that hurts and is bad in this world. Even thinking about it is making me want to vomit. I can’t breathe, I need a break.

 

My heart and stomach ache still, but I have managed to stabilize my breathing at least. I’ll do my best to describe what I saw. What I saw is definitely not of this world, it just doesn’t belong here. It’s a stretch to call it a ghost or a demon, it feels like something far crueller and more terrifying than that. It was like a shadow, but if it took a physical form. Its body was huge, its proportions nonsensical and it had eyes. So many eyes. On its hands, legs, body, it was covered in fucking eyes. Looking at them hurt. Trying to remember this thing hurts. Everything about this thing screams HURT, in every conceivable way possible. And the face? I cannot even begin describing the face. Even trying to piece it together in my head makes it feel like it’s swimming in a puddle of TV static. When I saw the thing, I froze. My whole body shut down as my brain was desperately trying to fight back for control again. I could only look at it as I realised where the noise was coming from. That noise, that sickly, disgusting noise was its fucking breathing. For whatever reason, of all the details, that one stood out to me the most. I felt stuck. I simply sat there frozen, for what felt like hours, listening to that thing breathing. It didn’t seem like it had noticed me somehow, but I just couldn’t get myself to move away from it. I struggled and I struggled, and I struggled, until finally, I managed to gain some control of my legs. I started to slowly back away from it. I was making some decent distance between us, but I wouldn’t be so lucky to escape so easily. I bumped into something and lost my balance. I hit my head on the floor and my vision went black for a moment. When I opened my eyes again, that thing had changed its position. All its eyes were looking straight at me now. I only remember fragments of what happened next. I screamed I think, then ran, ran like my damn life depended on it. I heard it chasing me, maybe, I don’t know. I hope not. Before I knew it, I was at my apartment. I ran inside and slammed the door shut, making sure all the locks were secured, then collapsed. My head hurts so much, I think there’s blood. I need another break.

 

I am shivering uncontrollably. This thing can’t be real, right? Surely not! It must be a figment of my fucked-up imagination, a beast from the depths of my subconsciousness that has come to torment me specifically! There’s no other explanation! No thing can exist and be that! Look like that! Breathe like that! Breathe…. Like…

 

I passed out. I don’t remember what I wanted to say. Everything hurts, I can’t even describe all the sensations I’m feeling right now. Is that thing staring at me from outside my bedroom’s balcony window? I need sleep.

 



July 27th, 2024

I woke up on the floor with a sharp pain on my head. I can feel a bump forming, but I don’t think it’s anything serious like a concussion. What even happened last night? I can only remember scattered fragments. I can feel my heartbeat elevating as I try to piece it all together. Whatever it was, it must’ve been one hell of an experience, because I have used up a lot more pages than I did with the previous entries. Should I read through it? This pain in my head makes it hard to think, read or write. I should give it a rest first.

 

After contemplating it a bit, I’ve decided not to look back on yesterday’s entry. It probably is just more of my ridiculous paranoid ramblings anyway. I’m going to take a painkiller for my head injury and move on with my day. I just need to calm down. Everything is alright.

 



July 28th, 2024

Everything is not fine. It is not fine in the fucking slightest!!! Last night that thing, the monster, has made my bedroom’s balcony its own personal residence! It went away after the sun came up, but now that it’s night again, it is fucking back! I have tried to think of anything to make it go away, but I have failed to come up with anything that doesn’t involve either opening that damn window, or calling the police, and I for shit sure don’t want to do either of those. I’ve resorted to always keeping that window locked and the curtains drawn. Even during the day, I just, I don’t trust it. What if it can somehow get in during the day, how can I be sure? My “solution”, if you can call it that, doesn’t seem to make the monster go away, but at least I don’t have to look at it. I keep trying to ignore it, but that horrid sound it makes… the “breathing” is always audible. No matter what I’ve tried to do to shut it out, I can never block out that ungodly sound. If that wasn’t horrible enough, I can feel every single one of its eyes always staring directly at me. It doesn’t matter where I’m at in this house I can always feel it staring. As if its gaze can pierce through the walls themselves. I don’t feel safe in my own home, most especially in my own bedroom. My hands are always shaky, my heartbeat is unsteady, my head feels fuzzy, it is taking a monumental amount of effort to focus on writing this. Am I going crazy?! Why is this happening to me?! Thank God I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. She must know a way out of this madness, right?

 

The sun set many hours ago. I have work tomorrow, but I can’t sleep. Even after taking my pills, I cannot fucking sleep. I can feel the monster gazing into my soul as it steadily breathes, like a hungry predator looking at its prey with glee, knowing it’ll be its next meal eventually. I’m so afraid.

 

I’m going to try sleeping on the couch. I can still feel the monster’s gaze here, but at least I can keep my distance from it. I’m so tired.

 



July 29th, 2024

I woke up in a cold sweat and a pounding headache. How many hours of sleep did I get? Three? Maybe four if I’m lucky. My God, how am I going to survive work today? I’m going to need all the coffee I can get.

 

I’m back home. I somehow made it through the day. My appointment came and went. I brought up the fact I've been feeling anxious and tired lately, but once again I avoided mentioning the source of those emotions. I am a coward. What if she doesn’t believe me? What if she makes a mockery of it? Or worse, what if she deems that I’m crazy and I’m sent to ward!? My job, my reputation, my life would be over! No, no, no no no, I cannot risk it. I cannot bring it up, there’s too much at stake! I have made a lot of progress with myself; I cannot let some stupid imaginary monster get in the way of that. God that horrid sound, its fucking breathing is getting on my nerves again! I just want it to shut up, to go away! I want this to END!

 

I started screaming my lungs out at the monster, letting out all my hate and frustration towards it. I knew it was fruitless, I don’t think the damn thing can even hear me, but I didn’t care. I continued yelling at it until I heard a knock from the door. My heart stopped for a moment, but then I heard a familiar voice. It was my neighbour, he came to check up on me. I opened the door to let him in. He asked if I was okay. I didn’t realise how loud I was being or what I was saying. I felt so embarrassed, I apologized and made a stupid excuse to explain my actions away. He was concerned, but he bought my excuse. He offered to hang out for a bit, so we did. I still felt very shaken up and unsafe but having someone by my side made it easier to deal with. I was observing him closely during his stay, curious to see if he felt the monster’s presence too. Aside for his concern for me, however, he didn’t seem to detect that anything else was wrong. My heart sank, because I knew that the monster was my tormentor and mine alone. Time passed in a flash and before I knew it, my neighbour had to head back to his apartment. I wanted to ask him to stay a little longer, just a little bit, but that would be too selfish to ask for without a proper explanation. We said our goodbyes and he left. I feel a little relieved, I had something else to think about other than the monster outside my balcony window. I will go to sleep while I’m still feeling somewhat alright. Goodnight.

 



July 30th, 2024

I did a lot of thinking at work today and I think I am on my way to figuring something out. I realised that when I’m around people, the dreadful feeling of the monster’s presence gets weaker. Now that I think about it, the only place that thing seems to have any effect on me is when I am at home. Eureka, that’s it! I’ll just be at home less and around other people more! It was so simple all along, how did I not think of this earlier? I am laughing at myself now, I cannot believe how much I overcomplicate things when I get stressed out! The solution may not be foolproof, as I’ll always have to return home eventually, but I’ll just make sure that I am out and about as much as possible! Maybe the monster will get tired of waiting for me and go fuck off to bother someone else! This realisation has rejuvenated me! I will stop writing now and I shall seize the day to the best of my ability!

 



August 10th, 2024

My plan is working out better than I expected! I have been going out, being around people more than ever! It’s been keeping me productive, happy and more importantly, my mind distracted from that monster. I can feel its grip letting go of my heart. I don’t think I even feel afraid of it anymore. The nightmare must be close to over, at last!

 

 

August 14th, 2024

1g5ahal,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5ahal,Need some help with furniture and adding color to my first apartment (Read Desc),"Hi, I’m living on my own for the first time and have been working on my apartment for the last month or so. The vibe I’ve been wanting to go with is a comfy modern vibe. I’ve got a couple of questions that I could use some advice on. 

First, I still need a coffee table, some lighting, some artwork, and a side table for the Eames. If you were in my position, what would you buy for those items? Looking to get some inspiration on what other people would do and I don’t mind spending a bit more to get a higher quality product. Same goes for artwork, whatever you would do for my space, I don’t have too much preference, just looking for inspiration and something to add more color to the space.

Second, in the third photo, I have this part of the wall that is set in. I’m not sure what to do with it. The shelves sadly do not fit (I didn’t measure properly, off by an inch or so) which was the original plan so now it’s an awkward empty space. 

Any other general advice for the space would also be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!

I’m not sure if I’m just incredibly lucky… but I recently got out of a 6 year relationship, moved back to my home state, and just wasn’t ready to enter the workforce yet. I decided I’d make a profile on SA and see what happens. Within 20 minutes I received a message from an SD offering xxx on the higher end just to grab coffee and see if we connect. I was a little bit suspicious, but again, it’s not like I’m doing anything else with my time. I show up, we talked for an hour, and at the end he says he had other M&Gs later in the week but if I liked him and was interested, he was prepared to cancel everyone else and start a relationship with me. I said yes and he said fantastic and slid me xxxx. He asked if I was able to get an STD panel that day or the next day and I said yes. We’ve now been seeing each other for about a month and it’s been really great honestly. I ended up getting a cosmetic surgery 3 weeks ago and he was totally fine with not having sex (4 weeks downtime before sex or working out is allowed) and still giving me $$ every time we hung out plus xxxx every 2 weeks. We’ve just been hanging out 2-3 times a week for a few hours and having fu n/deep/random conversations for a few hours and getting to know each other. He also brings me flowers, did my dishes when I stepped out to grab our food once, pays for my apartment, and is just overall one of the best men I’ve ever met, truly. And on top of it all I’m receiving xxxxx every month and finally able to pay off my debt and save as well. The downside on it all is that I’m a pretty religious person as well as extremely introverted. I have to take 3-4 shots before I see him every time so I can relax and not think about the fact that I’m kissing a nearly 60 year old. Don’t get me wrong, he’s attractive and muscular for his age. But I grew up as a white collar private school strict religious parents, and this whole thing is pretty tough on me; plus I haven’t told anybody I’m doing this. He doesn’t notice that I’m always drunk (I’m good at making it just seem like I’m very outgoing) but it definitely affects my mental health in a negative way. I’m not really sure what the point of my post was. It wasn’t to brag, and it wasn’t to receive feedback about my vices to be able to do this. I think it’s more of a journal entry type of thing. I do welcome feedback/advice/opinions though if you have any. I just kind of feel like I’m living a different life than I expected for myself and I don’t have anybody to tell or talk to about this and it kinda sucks. I was about a month away from being engaged, starting a family, and really just living the life the I had always imagined for myself. And now I’m starting over and this is a good way to secure my finances while I’m healing from my past relationship. 

Btw-I’m not narcissistic about it but I would probably classify myself as a 10/10 in body and face. I understand these $$$ aren’t easily achieved, so I don’t want to drive up expectations. I work very hard to look as good as I do, and I refused to accept anything less than what I felt was worth doing all of this to destroy my mental health. It’s not easy on me and I think this sub really downplays how hard of a toll it can take on you if you’re not used to this type of work. I think it would be beneficial if there was more of a discussion about it/how to cope with this line of work. On the other hand I’m making suchhhh a ludicrous amount of money. He does have rules: I’m not allowed to have a daytime job, I need to be available 24/7 and ready in 10 minutes, I’m not allowed to date or see any other SDs, and we need to text/call at least once a day so it feels more relationship like and less transactional. All pretty easy rules to follow for me because of my situation in life right now. But regardless, it really is hard on my mental health doing this and I’d like to open a discussion about this topic if anybody else is struggling with this.",3,1729113410.0,sugarlifestyleforum,10,0.8,False

1g5a6ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g5a6ax/please_help_noisy_neighbours/,PLEASE HELP! Noisy neighbours ,"Hey all ! I’m looking for a bit of an advice here so for some context before I get right into it. Next door moved in just under a year ago they also have 2 children a 2 year old and few month old baby. I myself have a 2 year old and I’m a 23 female. Both the guy and girl are also in their 20s however he’s older. I also smoke acouple of joint most nights and go to my shed to do so. 

When they moved in it was clear the house needed a lot of work and they were banging and drilling and often past 9pm for a few weeks( this had been disturbing my toddler but I just was dealing with it )  before the first  incident happened. The night of the first incident occurred it was about 7:30 and the guy was drilling in the loft, it was insanely loud inside my house and my son was SCREAMING the house down. He was already shattered as his sleep had been fractured for weeks before that. Luckily my dad was in so I got him to soothe my son while I went to speak to the couple and make them aware of the situation inside my home and see if the could stop working for the evening. I was calm and respectful and acknowledged that they did need to get the work done but if they could do louder things during the day. Personally I didn’t think this was an unreasonable request but it was not received the best way but it did stop so I just left it at that. 

The second incident happened about a week after the first. I put my son to bed at about 7 and the house hade been quiet all day. At about 8:30 I hear drilling noise and my son erupts through the monitor  I go up and attempt to comfort him but it was fighting a losing battle because WHO COULD SLEEP WITH THAT RACKET !!! . Anyway about 40 minutes goes by and my son is getting more and more agitated and upset ( he’s a bit noise sensitive anyway). I’m overwhelmed at this point and the only thing I can think to do is bang on the wall with a metal bottle, I’m honestly not proud of it and it felt childish right after but I was gonna lose my head. About 2 minutes after I banged on the main joining wall I get the loudest knock at my door. Opens the door to find the guy standing there he doesn’t even give me a second before going “did you bang back at me on purpose” in a dead snippy tone. Let me paint a little picture quick. I’m standing at my door looking visibly stressed with my clearly upset still crying baby.  I just go aye mate how could that not have been on purpose I asked you last week not to start drilling and banging at this time of night yet here we are again and you have the cheek to come to my door and take that tone. He said I will stop it for the night but this is a piss take when the fuck else I’m I ment to do it. I just shut the door in his face more or less at that point..

 I have heard him in the home not speaking to his children and partner not very kindly however this isn’t something I can prove but one other person has heard it. So I reached out to his partner and just introduced myself and we met for a coffee at the local cafe with her toddler. We were just speaking and i feel we got on pretty and we met up one more time just at my house and again i feel like it went pretty well. i never properly heard from her after that and just decided to leave it. 

Since this point the banging has never really stopped. Some nights are worse than others but it’s basically every single night. Not only that but 3 separate occasions i have heard his front door open (has got a stupid ding dong sound) be open for a bit then close again. Then he’s came to the other side of the house complaining his “whole house” is stinking of weed. The previous owner never hade this issue and I have stood there a lot more then 3 times and it’s not been an issue any other time. Anyway i didn’t argue and just moved because at the end of the day weed is still illegal where i live. 

Im just really wondering about what i can do about the noise! I’m genuinely considering moving house at this point! I’m not a bad person but I feel like I’m getting walked all over and intimidated because I asked him to not drill and hammer on the walls at ridiculous times !!!  ",1,1729112916.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: KATHA, ORDINARY VENLIL IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

TIME: YES

When I awoke, there was a little typewritten note in front of me saying, and I quote, “WE’RE SORRY WE SCARED YOU! :("" (complete with human emoticon) and a steaming hot cup of...is that hot chocolate? From Earth?

I took a sip...and then couldn’t stop drinking it until the cup was empty.

Gods, it was delicious.

There was a whistle from the engine up front, and the train started to slow. The conductor’s voice echoed over the PA, and said, as if by rote:

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are pulling into our final destination. All off for the Black City!”

The train gradually ground to a halt in a grand station that seemed...mostly abandoned. As I exited the train, I gawked shamelessly. The ceiling high above my head was painted with frescoes of Shadestalkers, Nixas, and Skalgans being struck down by silver-suited Exterminators, fleeing in terror to Nightside, bowing down in front of a tower topped with a purple eye like how the Church Of Solgalick always depicted the evil god Malos, and being rewarded with piles of meat.

I’m...going to move right on past that.

Strangely enough, the station’s architecture looks almost human. More specifically, almost Gothic, if that e-book I checked out from the humans’ Internet Archive is accurate. The proportions are a little bit off, though. I wonder how human architecture managed to make it to Darkside on Skalga...Wait, that’s right, I’m dreaming. ~~I sure hope I am at least.~~

There were only two other people in the station within sight. One was a large quadruped with some kind of brass cybernetic apparatus to help them sweep the floor. They’re quite large...*oh speh that’s a Nixa, no thank you, even though they’re wearing a little hat and humming as they sweep and it’s kinda cute, they’re still a massive carnivore...*and a sleeping Skalgan with an emerald green uniform sitting at an information booth that I immediately made a beeline for.

There was an ornate brass bell on the desk. I rang it. The Skalgan jolted awake, and cheerfully exclaimed, “Oh! Welcome to the Black City! We don’t get a lot of visitors these days…”

The Skalgan smiled like a human, revealing his...fangs?

*Fangs.*

Thankfully, I didn’t faint this time. Would have been rather embarassing.

“W-why do you have fangs? I didn’t think Skalgans had them…”, I managed to say without stuttering too badly.

“Hm? Oh, I’m not technically a Skalgan. I’m a Snaglak. We’re a carnivorous offshoot of the Skalgans.”

I paled.

Speaking quickly, as if to reassure me, he said “Don’t worry! Like the humans, we don’t eat people!”

I took a few deep breaths to calm down.

He smiled sheepishly. “Now, how can I-”

*BRINNNNG*

A small printout device on the other side and of the booth rang and spat out a small card. This...Snaglak? Turned in his chair, picked it up, and read it.

“Ah, looks like Her Majesty Karza and...Wow, Molech himself!...Have sent a car for you! Excellent! The pick up zone is down that hallway and first on your left!”

“Uh...thank you!”

He smiled again. “Have a wonderful day, and take care now!” and picked up a very old-fashioned looking book bound in...I *really* hope that’s not leather…

On that somewhat morbid thought, I exited the station through a revolving door and into an automotive pick-up/drop off zone. There was, indeed, a car waiting for me, but it was somewhat...unsettling in design.

The front end superficially resembled any one of a number of Earth cars from the 1930s (Internet Archive, again), including the Mercedes Benz 540K and the Jaguar SS, and shared those cars’ long, low hoods and flowing separate fenders, but had some unusual features found on neither of them. There was a strange angled shade over the oversized headlights, resembling angry human eyebrows. The vertical grille almost looked like teeth, gritted in anger.

There was also an oversized hood ornament of a Shadestalker mid-leap, claws out as if to assault an unwary jaywalker. There was a looping, curling silver tube fastened to one side, as with the horn of some antique cars, but instead of a flared bell there was a small sculpture of the gaping maw of a Nixa with a speaker embedded into it. The rear of the car resembled something grafted from a human stagecoach, a really upmarket one from the Victorian era. The whole car was painted jet black with silver trim, and gleamed like a dark gem.

The car was clearly custom made, to an exacting quality but to an overall unsettling effect.

Did I really want to go?

~~Did I have a choice at this point?~~

The driver’s side window rolled down, and a Shadestalker peered out. Thankfully, this time I wasn't jump-scared by four of them. This particular Shadestalker was wearing a souvenir hat from Anyvalley, VP. Wait, wasn’t that the place where a Shadestalker stole a human’s car?

The Shadestalker growled and barked, and the translator device around its...*His* neck translated into perfect Venlil.

“Good evening. Are you Katha?”

“Yes, I am.”

“Oh good! Her Majesty awaits you!”

He pressed a button on the dashboard and the car door opened. I got inside, buckled up, and tried not to think about potential flesh sources for the leather seats. The interior was scaled for Snaglaks, and my feet didn’t even touch the floor of the car. I felt an odd mixture of comfort and discomfort, my sensibilities against the material warring against how comfortable the seats were.

Starting to see why rich humans love leather seats.

I looked out the window to see the tower from the frescoes in the station, purple eye and all. It was staring *right at me.*

*I can feel the Eye* *watching me*.

*Why did I drink that ancient alcohol? This dream is scary!*

A sense of merry amusement radiated from the Eye. A rumbling sound came from the tower, but I understood what was being said. I understood. What. It. Said. My translator didn’t even activate and yet I knew in my deepest subconscious that the Eye was speaking to me.

“***D̷̮̫̮͖͖͂̄̄̈̈̔̀̀̈́͋̄̚ͅƠ̷̢̬̲̺̱̺̣͉̮̮̱̥̬̐ͅN̸̡̹̞̗͍͓̮̠̠̰̫̮͈̘̰͉̏͊̒̆̿̋̔’̸̢̳̥͕͇̟͉̱̖̱͔̉̀̌̋͑̚ͅT̷̨̧̹̺̝̱͚̻̜̖̦͖̣̈̈́ͅ ̴̳̘͖̞̗͔͎̩̀̅̂̍̅̓̈́ͅW̶̮̟̿̒͋͛̏͛̄O̷̡̼͉̹͚̦̜̗̗͎̙̮̪̹̓̕͝Ŗ̵̢̨̟͕̫͈̖̤̩̀͆͆̚R̴̛̠̻̠̩̳̾͆̔͌Ȳ̷͓͍̜̟̐̿͒̕.̸͚̻̘̼̞̼͑͛̈́̋̐́̏̿͆̊̐̌͒̕͝ ̵̢̨̧̧̛̰͚̠̮̺̺͔͙̗̲̼̼̀̂̅͛͗́̃̃̀̐͝͠Ý̷̢̲̪͇͚̫̣̥̣̪͆͆͋̓̾͒̿͋̏̔̋͜O̵̡̧̙͙̱̤͇̙̭̦̯͓̘̩͍͔̓̏̈́͘̚͜Ů̴̢̨̯̘̰͉̺̤̹̤͙͚̖̺̆̅̐̌̊͌̓̐̒̒̍̕͠ͅ’̴̧̯̳̰̫̯͉̘͚̥̝͖̪͛́̈̍͐̑̊͋̄͝L̶͕̹̲̟̞̲̞͐́̍̏̐́̽͋̅͑̃̓͆̚͠L̸͍͔̍̈́ ̴̢͉͕͚̺̣̬̜̬̟̤̤̑̈́̑̒̚͜͝B̷͓͖͉͈̮̺̏̃͐̏̏́̊̀͌̓̚E̷̛̤͓̫͓̬̤͍̫͚̳͍̼͚̟̭̓̈̈́̈́͊̈̂̅̀͂̈͛ ̴̰̮̬̜̜̰̀̈́͒͐́͌͘̚F̷̨̢̨̣̤̫̫͚̬̱͍͉̲̩͐̋̈́̑͌̈́̄͊̇͌͜͜͠Į̶͓̼͚͉͍͍̲̼͙̗̺͉̯́̎̈́̎̉̔̔̑͆̔͝ͅǸ̶̳̭͇͕̦͉̀̃̍̈́̉͊̕͘͜È̸͇͈̺͍̪̰̠̯̟̲̟͕̠͚̬̯̈́͐̀.̵͚̖͇̩̫̈́͆̇̇̋̋̅̆̒̊͆̈̑͝ ̷̜̯͕͚̰͎̉̓̊̐̽͋̕:̸̨̢̲̣̞͈̖̖̼̬̯̜̘̦͖́̿͛̀͑̋̽͐͒̈́̄͋̀́̚͜͠)̵̠̟͕̝͎͉̬̟̣̮̜̙̻͂̾̀̓̄͋̋͂̎̚͝ͅ”***

That wasn’t a word at the end, that was just a strange noise...wait…

Why am I thinking of the human smiley face emoticon? *What the speh?*

*Have I gone crazy?*

*This has to be a dream, right?*

*Right?*

*But...what if it isn’t?*

*This isn’t a dream.*

***This isn’t a dream.***

I started to hypervenlilate, before remembering that breathing trick Jack taught me to calm down.

In for five seconds, hold, out for seven.

In for five seconds, hold, out for seven.

OK.

*OK.*

Let’s think about this rationally. Everyone but that conductor has been fairly nice to me so far, and Jack and the human species in general is proof enough that predators can be nice. Plus, apparently I’m being invited to meet the monarchy of...whatever this place is, so I’m not in danger, right?

Probably, as long as that Snaglak was telling the truth and I’m off the menu.

I’ll be fine, towering cosmic horror aside.

I’ll be fine.

Heh...You know, The strangest thing is...some part of me, deep inside, beneath the preylike panic coming from what’s left of my Fedbrain, is soothed by this place. It feels...not familiar, but nostalgic. Even though I’ve never been here, somehow, this place just sort of resonates on a level I can’t explain.

1g5a5yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g5a5yp/sf_blue/,[SF] Blue,"It was mid-August, but the early morning and thick overcast provided a prominent chill this Thursday.  Dave Compensated with a long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and windbreaker combo; his wife would not let him leave the house with anything less. The semi-hot coffee in his Styrofoam cup slowly steamed into the crisp morning air as he leaned against his Ford pick-up waiting for the busy line of crabbers to launch their boats.  He peered into the coffee he had picked up from the local convenience store, ""Delilah’s"" just 10 minutes earlier. Although the store advertised the brewed coffee as “Best coffee in town! Freshly Brewed!” the coffee seemed to have a burnt taste, indicating it had been sitting out on the burner for at least a few hours. Nothing cream and sugar couldn’t fix, even though he preferred it black. Nevertheless, he savored the taste as he pulled another sip from the thick Styrofoam cup.  Dave felt a thin layer of coffee cling to his mustache as he drew the cup away, one of the few issues that came with such a fashion choice, but having a mustache, or “stache” as his son’s referred to it, really suited his aging face. 

He looked into the crooked side view mirror to help guide his windbreaker sleeve and rub off any excess coffee. As he wiped the remnants of coffee away, Dave admired the remaining spackle of black hair not only in his now fully grey head but also in his mustache. *Christ*, he was not only feeling old but also looking the part.  It was at least better than his friend and neighbor Bill Hatchers who lived across the street from him.  Bill was around the same age as Dave but had lost what was left of his hair about 8 years ago. *Ain’t that a bitch*, Dave had thought at the time.  

A squeal of old brakes pulled his attention up from the mirror. A truck and trailer was pulling out from the launch and Dave was now next in line to go. He popped the Styrofoam cup’s plastic lid back on and pulled himself inside the truck onto an old patchy bench seat. The launch of the boat had not gone as smoothly as he would have hoped, but isn’t that what everyone thought when pulling such a maneuver?  The awkward sharp curve in the boat launch approach did not provide any favors either when pulling around to back in, but Dave managed to pull it off as he had done many times before.  After successfully launching his boat, he parked the pickup in one of the many elongated parking spots nearby in the adjacent gravel lot - if you can call spray paint on loose gravel a “parking spot”. He didn’t bother locking his old pick-up next to other empty trucks in the lot, as neither did anyone else that morning and started his way down to the dock. 

The thick rubber brown boots he was wearing crunched on the gravel as he walked toward the dock, and then moved to a soft thud as he transitioned onto the dock’s surface where the boat was tied onto one of the many silver cleats. Dave had bought the 18-foot aluminum boat from a friend of a friend down in Seattle about 10 years ago.  On his way back from the purchase he had also bought the Yamaha outboard engine, from somewhere more local, when he got back into town the following day. The boat itself had a single bench seat closer to the bow and a single swivel chair sticking out near the stern closest to the motor, for easier steering.  This left a decent amount of room in the middle of the boat for gear, a cooler - and in the case of this morning - crab pots.  Although the boat had no name painted on the side of the aluminum shell, Dave had referred to his tiny vessel as “Radar”, after his childhood German Shepard that accompanied him as a boy. Dave liked this name not only due to it being his late dog’s name but also thought the name suited the boat great for occasions such as this one.  The name itself gave good luck when looking for *just* the right spot to drop crab pots. 

He swung his leg over the side of the boat, being careful not to clip his boot on the crab pots stacked neatly between the bench seat and the swivel chair. He wouldn’t dare be seen falling into the boat or even worse, out of the boat, in front of the audience that was amassed at the top of the boat launch waiting their turn this morning. Dave swung his other leg into the safety of the boat and settled onto the cracked leather chair, placing his coffee in a crudely made cup holder attached to the rim of the boat. He then turned to pull back on the old, frayed rip cord on the face of the Yamaha engine.  With the first few attempts, the old engine sputtered, came to life, then died. The outboard motor could definitely use replacing. *Next year*, Dave Thought. Although he had been saying that now for the past two. 

The squawk of seagulls was starting to become louder and more evident as the morning started to warm even with the gloomy overcast. He yanked again on the rip cord, and this time the engine sprang to life, drowning out the above seagulls. Looking up, Dave threw up a wave to the old man patiently waiting to back in. With little effort, Dave swung the boat outward facing toward open ocean, then slowly putted Radar out of the launch area. 

Brimmer Bay, or “Brim” as locals in the area call it, is one of the last places in Washington to open for Dungeness; and due to this, Dave never wasted a season.  This was his 33rd year as an active participant in the recreational crabbing season and he always made time for opening day, even in choppy conditions like this.  As he slowly moved out of the vicinity of the boat launch, the wind slightly picked up, as he pulled away from shore. Along with the wind, tiny swells and white caps were slapping the boat and kicking up sea spray which stung his already cold red face. 10 minutes later, farther out now, the waves seemed to die down a bit, giving Dave the go-ahead to throttle the 50-horsepower engine for some speed. The 50-horsepower engine was not necessarily “overkill” for a boat this size, but it definitely had some get-up-and-go when met with the right conditions. 


After 30 minutes or so, Dave’s field of view started to fill with a collection of red, white, orange, and yellow buoys which floated lamely along the top of the dark murky water, marking the first of the crab pots that early morning risers had set out before he had arrived. He began to throttle down as the cluster of buoys began to thin. The speed of the boat slowed as he passed the final remaining markers. 
Red, yellow, red again, and then nothing.  
He continued on for another five minutes until he could barely see the last red buoy he had passed.  “What do you think, Radar?” Dave said aloud addressing the boat as he would his childhood dog. But Dave knew - this was **the** spot. 

He killed the sputtering engine and almost complete silence replaced the noise in his eardrums outside of the faint sound of seagulls in the distance and the small waves against the aluminum hull. This quiet could only be found when one was far enough from civilization. Dave relished it immensely; he even made the point of leaving his cell phone in the cab of his truck as to not distract him while he was out that morning. Dave took a swig of the now lukewarm coffee and placed it back into the crude cupholder.  He did not know, but that was the last he would be sipping the coffee this morning as what lay in a bucket in front of him would kill his appetite. He pulled over a sealed orange five-gallon bucket that read “Home Depot”  and broke open the seal of the lid. The smell from what was piled in the bucket almost knocked him back.  
The refrigeration from the past two days should have dampened some of the smell, but the salmon carcasses smelled as if they were never frozen at all, and in fact, were in the later stages of rot. 
Now that Dave thought about it, had he even plugged the garage freezer in?  It had sat mostly empty this summer as he had otherwise no use for it.  He had unplugged it in July in an effort to be more “green” but in reality was just an effort to save some pennies on the power bill he probably wouldn’t have missed anyway. Cursing his past self, he began to flex his hands into his Gore-Tex gloves. 

As he reached into the now open bucket to start filling the bait box of the first pot of the day, something caught his eye off to the starboard side of the boat (or in other words, his right) about 10 feet away. A thin stream of small bubbles was streaming up through the ocean depths and breaking on the surface of the water. This was not unusual to see out in the bay like this, as it can happen from a lot of different factors, but what was peculiar about this was that it was not a continuous stream in one spot, but a few different streams coming up in different lengths sporadically in an area about three feet wide. Dave allowed himself a 10- or 15-second gaze at the phenomenon before he started back on his work. As he again started cramming the bait box with the remnants of what used to be salmon, he began to hear what sounded like a small dribble coming from the same direction as the bubbles. The sound reminded him of a faucet that was ever so slightly turned on leaking into a sink or bathtub, a steady dribble. He stared up again from the bait box. 

What was there now was more than a few thin lines of bubbles. It had now graduated into a growing number of bubbles coming up in a larger area, these slightly bigger than what he had seen before. 

“What in the world...” he muttered standing up from the bucket. Dave was not what you would call a tall man, but the new vantage point and angle allowed him to see better through the reflection of grey clouds on the dark ocean water. Standing up he had noticed now that the area in which he saw the bubbles was occurring in a much larger radius than he initially had thought.  The area had to have been at least 8 feet in diameter and growing. Not only that, but was the slow dribbling noise getting *louder*? Dave craned his neck without moving his feet to not rock the boat and lose his balance. Behind him, a newly discovered crop of bubbles was quickly forming just a few feet away from the other side of the boat. The look on Dave’s face had now changed from curiosity to dumbfounded, not yet scared but damn well nervous. With that, it only took Dave a second or two to decide that maybe this was not **the** spot after all.  

He sat back down on the cracked leather swivel chair, removed the Gore-Tex gloves from his hands, and felt back for the rip cord, unable to take his eyes off the collection of bubbles slowly growing around him. The area of disruption was starting to overlap where his boat stayed floating on the water. As the bubbles hit the bottom of the hull of the aluminum boat, the sound that was a slow dribble was beginning to grow so loud that it was all he could hear, the faint squawk of the seagulls and small waves he could no longer hear. His hand found the rip cord and tugged on it meekly to find tension in the line. Dave then took his eyes away from the unveiling scene around him, looked back at the engine, placed his other hand atop it to use as balance, and then yanked back. The engine came to life with a small sputter, which he could not hear, but feel with his hand on the engine, and due to the small line of cooling water jetting from the exhaust port indicating it was on. The noise from whatever was happening around him was now so loud that it reminded Dave of buzzing cicadas that he had heard as a kid when visiting his aunt Laurel in Arizona.  The cicada buzz used to be so loud that it would drown out the cheap Mexican landscaping that his aunt would hire during the heat of the summer. 

He looked up from the engine toward the shoreline that seemed so distant and tiny. *Why had he come out so far?* He thought regretfully. The distance from civilization no longer comforting Dave in the slightest. 

With that thought, he faced forward and throttled the engine. The initial sudden lurch forward knocked the coffee out of his cupholder onto the floor of the boat, and almost nearly spilled the still-open bucket of bait just at his feet. Dave did not seem to notice. 

As quickly as the boat lurched forward, it had immediately stopped. The Yamaha engine had almost certainly died. “SON OF A BITCH!” Dave shouted. 

The noise grew impossibly louder still and the amount of bubbles hitting the aluminum hull began to vibrate the boat. The water around Radar now looked like it was coming to a boil. The vibration gave gooseflesh down Dave’s bundled-up arms and legs. 

Dave was no longer messing around. With fierce determination, he spun around toward the engine, snatched up the rip cord in his right hand and jerked **hard** like his life depended on it. This time no stream of cooling water shot out of the exhaust port, indicating it was on, but Dave wasn’t looking for the stream of water from the exhaust port, he was distracted with what was now sitting in his hand. The frayed line that was the ripcord had snapped away from the Yamaha engine and dangled dumbly out of Dave’s hand that clutched the knob. Dave stood unmoving with a look of cold disbelief.  

It took a moment for his brain to kick back on. Snapping back into reality, Dave began looking around wildly in all directions for **any** indication of life. Looking for a boat to wave at frantically for help. But he did not see any boats. 
*Where was everyone?* 
He knew it was early, but this was opening day!  There had to be others out on the bay.  
Although there were others out that day, Dave did not know that soon after departing the boat launch, the older gentleman whom he had waved to, backed his large trailer and boat directly into the dock with such force that it dislodged the dock for any other would-be crabbers that morning. Later, the old man would blame the curve that led down to the boat ramp, saying “That it should not be so sharp!”. This reasoning would not ultimately save him from the fact he would be paying to repair the dock, but others did agree with his statement. That singular boat launch was the most popular not only due to its convenience but also because it was the *only* one serving the general public in the area.  You would have to drive 45 miles out of Brimmer Bay to the adjacent harbor of Awhauktoo Bay to launch, which many folks ended up doing that day.  One individual even remarked Dave was “one lucky fuck” as they watched the sole crabber drone out into the bay that morning, disappearing to a dot as they made plans to drive to the adjacent harbor.   

Dave patted down for a lump in his faded jeans, feeling for what he already knew wasn’t there, his cell phone. Radar was not equipped with a radio, it wasn’t used enough to garner such a thing, but Dave could not help thinking about how stupid he was to not bring anything except his fucking wallet and crabbing license. The mounting frustration came out as a loud “FUCK” almost involuntarily from Daves's mouth.  He was stranded. 

The now completely enveloped boat was jostling back and forth, making it impossible to stand without the chance of falling overboard.  Dave could imagine a fasten seatbelt sign popping up above him as he sat back down, a captain coming over the intercom, “Sorry folks, we are going to be hitting unexpected turbulence.  Please fasten your seatbelts for your safety until we turn off the light”. Dave braced himself on the engine and rim of the boat, waiting for whatever was to come next. 

The vibration and hum chattered his teeth. Dave clamped down hard trying to prevent his jaw from moving. Off to the right of Dave, a dim blue-gray glow could now be seen emanating from where the original batch of bubbles had sprung up earlier. At first, it was about the size of a small dinner plate, but as it grew brighter it also started expanding. The water slowly stopped bubbling and was now steadily churning as the surface tension of the water kept breaking repeatedly as if a submarine were rising from the depths. The noise from the bubbles was replaced with a low-toned hum that resonated with both the boat and Dave’s tense body. The slow-growing blue light was now the size of a large transit van, the hum so loud it began to blur Dave’s vision, making his eyes water.  With morbid curiosity and fear, Dave leaned over the side of the beat. Squinting hard Dave had a hard time discerning what was now only 10-15 feet below the water’s surface. The confusion was not only due to his blurring vision but also because what he saw made no sense. 

Large Interlaced silver rings spun below the boat. Multiple rings rotated counterclockwise and clockwise independently at a slow gentle speed. Inside of the rings appeared to be a cube-- no, a sphere *within* a cube, that was glowing with a bright blue light. Dave could not tell, but the rings seemed to have something etched along the outside of the bands, something not in any language he knew.  The low-toned hum seemed to be emitting directly from this object that lay below the boat. 

At the outer edges of the blue light that emanated from the sphere, Dave saw what had to be a large fish moving in and out of the edges of the light. Dave leaned in further, his face catching licks of the roiling water, and tried to focus his vision as best he could. A large silhouette was cast in the glow of the object. The shape of the dark silhouette looked more humanoid than fish-like, although it had tendencies of both. Its elongated appendices jutting out from its unmoving body, bobbed in and out of the glow as they moved with the current. Dave could swear whatever this thing was, it could see him. He saw no eyes or face, but he **knew** it could see him. This was not a fish moving in and out of the light, but a person with impossibly long arms and legs. The head of the being did not look like a single head but something larger, the silhouette was dark, but he could swear the large oval-shaped head was staring directly at him.  Dave was frozen, staring at the creature in horror and amazement.  He tried pulling his head away, but his body was no longer obeying his mind.  A new noise had popped up, something coming from what seemed to be the creature. A loud moan was being broadcasted directly into his head, along with the hum from the object. The moan pitched up and down continuously sounding ancient and guttural. The moan seemed undecipherable, but in Dave's mind, a small phrase began to repeat. 
“WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME”
Dave could not move his fixated gaze but could open his mouth to scream. His eyes now streaming with blood as he was forced to stare at the horror below.  

Without notice, a beam of light shot up from the rings and hit the left half of his face. An intense burning sensation took back over Dave’s senses, the left side of his vision now gone. This turn of events seemed to give Dave his freedom of movement back. Quickly standing and reeling from the scene below him, his hands came up to his face reflexively.  Stepping back to catch his balance from standing so suddenly, he caught his brown boot on the stacked crab pots and immediately lost balance, falling back over the side of the boat. Dave careened towards the dark murky ocean water. Looking out from his one good eye he was able to have one last look at the blood that now covered his hands and a set of glowing eyes from the silhouette that grew closer to him as he hit the water.",1,1729112892.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

• I now have bowel movements only once a day, in the mornings, triggered by coffee. I used to have 2-3. I am still on a whole-food, high-fiber diet. I feel like I could go again, but alas, I cannot. 

• I feel a throbbing pain that comes and goes in the area. Just sitting at my desk hurts. It also hurts when cycling and running. Hurts when I lay down in certain positions. 

•slight nausea at times

Pelvic CT scan with contrast is planned in a week. The GI doctor ordered this. I messaged her about the symptoms I mentioned above, and she said to skip the wait and call a general surgeon. I did.

Well, a general surgeon consult is scheduled about six weeks out. Geesh! I'm in Chicago seeing folks at North Western Medicine.

How long have you all waited, from consults to having the surgery?

**Summary:** Musing as usual in the bookshop, a certain little Scrivener Angel discovers a few empty pages in a book. As they ask a certain old demon what it means, they'll learn that, sometimes, the biggest emotions one can have are not always written nor speakable.
Entry for ChillOmenstober day 16: ""Bookshop""


**Excerpt:** 

“Please, Mister Crowley, what do the empty pages in a book mean? Is it a printing error of some sort?

Muriel didn’t receive any answer, but it didn’t alarm them too much. If they had to take offense to every single question left unanswered — whether it came from Crowley, Nina, Maggie or any other shopkeeper in the neighbourhood — Muriel wouldn’t see the end of it. But they liked asking their questions out loud. Sometimes, it felt like this helped put their ideas in order. And often, it gave them a sense of company. It all came from the time they had served in Heaven, when they used to fill the relative silence of those long white corridors with their own thoughts.

Shuffling steps rose nearby, the smell of coffee growing stronger.

“Printers use booklets with a preset number of pages. Depending on how long the manuscript is, the printed text doesn’t always fill the entire thing completely, and some pages stay empty at the end. Sometimes at the beginning too.’’

Muriel nodded vigorously, leaned over the book in their hands. Crowley was already leaving when they asked again.

“Noted. And what if the empty pages are neither at the end nor the beginning?’’

The fading steps stopped, and came back closer, right behind Muriel now. They heard a mug being put down on a shelf nearby. Feeling Crowley’s gaze above their shoulder, they opened the book for him, browsing through the pages before and after the empty space.

“Here, see? Nothing’s here, for at least a few pages. And then, the story starts again, but it resumes months later, and the subject has nothing to do with what was related before.’’

It's hard for me to condense three years, and my emotions, but please bear with me"" 💚💚

NBTA Political Debate - October 2024

You can watch the whole video if you like, it has a lot of information about our education system and various issues. I was more interested in one specific question and the answer from Bill Hogan (PC party), who is also the Minister of Education for NB.

Question #5 - Absenteeism is at an all-time high in the school system and anxiety has spiked. What plans do you have to address the growing mental health emergency in New Brunswick schools? Hogan's answer (in quotes)...

""we have a new cellphone policy and we've tried to remove that distraction from the classrooms... and through that we hope to eliminate that bullying that takes place 24/7 for a lot of our students.""

""We've got ISD teams that work - some work really well, some don't work that well and we need to improve that.""

""We have school counselors, guidance counselors that are trained and they are trained, professional counselors that work with our children every day.""

""You know, we're dealing with societal issues that come into our school from outside... financial insecurity, housing insecurity, family issues... and that stuff lands on your doorstep. We must do everything we can to help with that.""

""Also, we need to look at absenteeism and what we're doing to our kids and whether or not moving them forward after they've missed a hundred days is a benefit to them.""

Read the question and again and really read the answers (if you want to call them that). If you're confused, it's probably because he didn't give any definitive answers, he just skirted around the question. Hogan used his time to highlight the resources they already have in place, even though by his own words, they don't always work (like ISD teams). In true political form, he evaded the answer and took his time to self-promote what they are already doing, hence justifying that the status quo is what they are going to continue doing. That's because they don't have any plans for mental health on their platform (besides policy 713 and that is a long post all of it's own).

A cellphone ban is great and much needed, but not having your cellphone in class helps maintain order and attention, it doesn't stop bullying. What about all the other issues connected to mental health? Not everything relating to mental health is societal, like Hogan likes to elude to. There are so many factors and layers to mental health and it sounds like our government leaders needs more education on that.

ISD, guidance counselors, school psychologists - all great resources, but our schools are already overcrowded, inadequately staffed and begging for more resources. We've all seen how the schools have handled mental health problems in the past four years, especially since Covid. We are talking about a mental health emergency in NB. What this current government is doing is NOT working and our children are dying. We need MORE resources, not just the current ones.

In July, Greg and I had a meeting with Hogan and some other members of the education department. After three long years, I faced my own bullies and we read them a very damning letter about all the lack of mental health resources and guidance in the school after Carson passed. We gave them examples of why a mental health/suicide prevention policy is greatly needed in our schools. We gave them examples and damning proof of what we were saying. Hogan's answer? ""Sometimes it takes a tragedy for us to learn and make changes."" He patted me on the head (figuratively, not literally) and told us the Department of Education would commit to writing a mental health/suicide prevention policy and implement it in all the districts across the province.

THAT is what is missing from his answers and that gives me a lot of mixed feelings... anger, sadness, anxiety and a sense of dread. I've been waiting to hear this announcement since he told us in July, and I stupidly and naively (again) believed that they were going to do the right thing and make an effort to fix things in our schools. But they clearly don't give a damn. Our family has been through hell and back since June of 2021. We've been ignored, bullied, gaslit and insulted by these same people who are in charge of our children's school, who is employed there, and what resources are allocated to our students. The abuse started right from the very top with Hogan and Higgs and it was passed down the through their employees and beyond. We have a network of people in Fredericton and in our district who worked very hard to shame and embarrass our family. They made Carson's name and picture out to be a public safety hazard. So much so that they evaded me until he almost didn't get to appear in his own yearbook. When all we wanted was a picture in his yearbook, we were met with ignorance, judgement and conviction.

The icing on the cake? About a month ago, Faytene Grasseschi, who is running to be our local PC candidate, visited during her political campaigning. We talked about the lack of policy and all the stuff that was done under the authority of her political party. Her answer? She offered Greg and I each a few sessions of pastoral counselling to help with our souls. She said it would be much more beneficial than a doctor who ""just wants to pop us full of pills"". Oh, you mean the same pills I've been on since I was in my twenties for Major Depressive Disorder & Generalized Anxiety Disorder? What an insult!! I'm not ashamed of my mental illness nor the fact that I need this medicine. Clearly the PC party is ashamed enough for me. As for my soul, that's between me and God, not me and the government and a clearly apponted tv Christian evangelist. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY gets to tell me what is and isn't good for my soul. Unless you've walked the journey of child loss, you don't get a say on how I handle or walk it. Period.

Please don't vote for these people of you care about the future of our schools. Please don't vote for this party if you care about the mental health of our children and students. Please don't vote for this party, because, they did not care about Carson, his family, friends or community. 

It's okay not to be okay.

It's okay to ask for help.

Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. It's not something that should be ever be silenced or swept under the rug.

We need to do better.

1g59vi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g59vi3/the_time_i_got_stuck_in_an_elevator/,The Time I Got Stuck in an Elevator,"So, I’ve got to share this wild experience from a few months ago that I still can’t believe happened to me. I was at work, and it was one of those crazy busy days where everything seemed to go wrong. To escape the chaos, I decided to take a quick break and get some fresh air. I hopped into the elevator in my office building, excited to grab a coffee.

As the doors closed, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. But then, just as the elevator started moving, it suddenly jolted to a stop between floors. The lights flickered, and I realized I was stuck. Panic set in. I pressed the button for the lobby, but nothing happened. I tried pressing every button, thinking maybe I could jolt it back to life, but nope—no luck.

I took a deep breath and decided to call for help. I pulled out my phone, only to find there was no signal. Fantastic, right? I was feeling pretty claustrophobic and started to mentally prepare myself for a long wait. Just then, I remembered the emergency button. I pressed it, and after a few moments of silence, I heard a voice crackle through the speaker.

“Hello? Are you okay?”

I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I explained my situation. The operator said help was on the way, but it might take a bit. I settled in for what I thought could be a long wait. But then, I realized I had a good 15 minutes to kill, and I was starving.

I rummaged through my bag, hoping to find a snack. Of course, I only had a pack of gum. I figured I might as well make the best of it, so I chewed away while trying to distract myself. That’s when I noticed a little girl’s drawing taped to the wall of the elevator. It was a crayon drawing of a unicorn, with “You are magical!” written underneath it.

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation. Here I was, stuck in an elevator, and yet this little drawing reminded me that life can be pretty ridiculous sometimes. I took a picture of it to remember the moment.

After what felt like an eternity but was probably only about 20 minutes, the doors finally opened. I stepped out to a crowd of my coworkers who had gathered, concerned and slightly amused at my elevator adventure. They greeted me with jokes and laughter, and I couldn’t help but join in.

In a weird way, being stuck in that elevator turned out to be a bonding experience for my team. We all shared a laugh about it, and it made for a great story at our next office meeting.

So, if you ever find yourself in a weird situation, just remember: you can always find a way to make it a little more entertaining!",2,1729112135.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1g59tte,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacySentinel/comments/1g59tte/10_shocking_benefits_of_using_a_vpn_you_didnt/,10 Shocking Benefits of Using a VPN You Didn’t Know About!,"# Why You Absolutely Need a VPN

Let’s face it, online security is a real concern.  
From shady ads tracking your every move to hackers lurking on public Wi-Fi, we’ve all heard horror stories about stolen data.  
But here’s the question: **Are you doing anything about it?**

That's where a VPN (Virtual Private Network) comes in.  
I’m talking **real protection** — not just against hackers but also shielding your privacy from ISPs and advertisers. If you’ve never used a VPN before, you’re missing out on a lot more than you think. Especially if you're someone who values their **privacy** and **freedom** online.

Let’s break down the **10 shocking benefits of using a VPN**, and trust me, you’ll want to pay attention to these.

# Benefit #1: Hide Your IP Address and Location

Ever wondered how those creepy ads seem to know where you are?  
That's because websites, apps, and advertisers are tracking your **IP address** — which gives away your location.  
With a VPN, you can easily mask your real IP address, making it look like you're somewhere else entirely. Imagine being in New York but appearing to be in Paris.

**Why does this matter?**

* No more personalized ads based on your browsing history.
* Websites can’t track your real location.
* ISPs and data brokers won’t be able to sell your browsing data.

Pretty cool, right? Especially if you don’t want your location shared all over the internet.

# Benefit #2: Encrypt Your Data

Ever connected to public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport?  
Yeah, me too — and that’s one of the riskiest moves you can make. **Why?** Because public Wi-Fi is often a hacker’s playground. They can intercept your data, stealing your passwords, credit card info, and more.  
A VPN uses **military-grade encryption** (AES-256) to lock down your internet traffic, making it impossible for anyone to snoop on you.

# What does this mean for you?

* Secure online banking on public Wi-Fi.
* Protect sensitive emails and messages.
* Peace of mind when you’re online anywhere outside your home.

|**Fact**|**Why it matters**|
|:-|:-|
|**AES-256 Encryption**|Used by government agencies and top cybersecurity firms, it’s virtually unbreakable.|

# Benefit #3: Access Geo-blocked Content

Ever tried to watch Netflix while traveling, only to find your favorite show is **blocked**?  
Or maybe you're trying to access news or YouTube videos that are unavailable in your country. With a VPN, you can sidestep these frustrating restrictions.

**How does this work?**  
A VPN routes your traffic through a server in a different country. So, if you want to access US Netflix from abroad, you just connect to a US server. Boom — problem solved.

* Watch shows and movies exclusive to certain regions.
* Access sports events and content from anywhere in the world.
* No more restrictions, just pure, unrestricted access.

# Benefit #4: Protect Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

We all love free Wi-Fi, right? Especially in airports, cafés, or hotels.  
But do you know what you’re really connecting to? Public Wi-Fi is notoriously unsafe. Hackers can easily set up “fake” Wi-Fi networks that look legitimate but are designed to steal your data.

**VPN to the rescue:**

* When connected to a VPN, all your data is encrypted. Hackers might still intercept it, but they won’t be able to read it.
* Protects your passwords, browsing history, and any personal info.

**Scenario:**  
Ever been at a café, scrolling through Instagram or doing online shopping? Without a VPN, that’s a risk. With a VPN, you’re safe. It’s that simple.

# Benefit #5: Avoid Bandwidth Throttling

Your internet service provider (ISP) might be **slowing down your connection** — especially if you’re streaming videos or downloading large files. This is called **bandwidth throttling**, and it’s a sneaky trick ISPs use to save money.

Here’s the kicker: When you use a VPN, your ISP can’t see what you’re doing online. All they know is that you’re connected to a VPN, so they have no reason to throttle your speed.

# What can you expect?

* **Faster streaming** on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube.
* **Smooth online gaming** without lag.
* **Consistent download speeds** for large files.

No more buffering or sudden slowdowns — a VPN lets you enjoy your internet at full speed.

|**Streaming with a VPN**|**Without a VPN**|
|:-|:-|
|No throttling from ISP|Slowed speeds|
|Access content worldwide|Region locked|
|Secure, private connection|Vulnerable|

The Difference a VPN Makes for Streaming

# Benefit #6: Improve Online Gaming Experience

Let’s be real — gaming online is frustrating when you’re dealing with high ping or lag.  
And nothing’s worse than getting hit by a **DDoS attack** (where a hacker floods your network with traffic, crashing your game). This is where a VPN comes in clutch.

* **Reduce latency**: Connect to a server closer to the game’s server to improve your ping.
* **Avoid DDoS attacks**: If someone tries to attack you, they’ll hit the VPN server instead of your real IP.
* **Access different game servers**: Play with friends in other countries without any regional restrictions.

# Example:

Let’s say you’re playing a competitive game like *Fortnite*. Using a VPN not only keeps your connection stable but also makes sure you don’t get booted out mid-game because of a DDoS attack.

**Extra bonus:**  
If a game’s blocked in your region, a VPN lets you access it like nothing ever happened.

# Benefit #7: Secure Your Online Shopping

Think about it — how often do you shop online?  
With all those sensitive details flying around, like your credit card numbers and addresses, it's easy to see why online shopping without a VPN is risky.

When you use a VPN, you’re securing your data.  
That means your transactions are encrypted, protecting you from fraudsters.  
Plus, you can shop from different countries, often finding better deals or products that aren't available locally.

# Quick Tips for Safer Online Shopping:

* Always connect to your VPN before entering payment details.
* Look for sites that start with ""HTTPS"" for extra security.
* Use strong, unique passwords for each site.

# Benefit #8: Bypass Government Censorship

In some places, the internet is heavily censored.  
You might find that you can’t access certain news websites, social media platforms, or even search engines.  
This is where a VPN shines — it lets you bypass these restrictions by changing your virtual location.

**Imagine being able to:**

* Access social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook in countries where they're blocked.
* Read the news freely without government interference.
* Explore the web as if you were in a different country.

|**Country**|**Censorship Level**|**VPN Usefulness**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|China|Very High|Essential for access to most global websites|
|Russia|High|Bypass restrictions on news sites|
|Iran|High|Access social media and news freely|

# Benefit #9: Protect Against Malware

While a VPN isn’t a complete antivirus solution, it can **add an extra layer of security**.  
Some VPN services come with built-in malware protection. This means they can warn you if you’re trying to access a site known for hosting malware or phishing schemes.

**Here’s what you get:**

* A safer browsing experience.
* Protection from malicious websites.
* Enhanced security for your devices.

# Benefit #10: Affordable and Cost-effective

Many people think that using a VPN is an expensive luxury.  
But that’s far from the truth.  
With many providers offering plans as low as £2-3 a month, a VPN is more affordable than you might think.

**When you weigh the benefits against the cost:**

* Secure online activities without worrying about hackers.
* Access to region-locked content.
* Improved browsing speeds and privacy.

So, can you really put a price on peace of mind?

# FAQs

**Can I use a free VPN service?**  
While free VPNs exist, they often come with limitations like data caps, slower speeds, and a lack of security features. It’s generally best to go for a reputable paid service like Surfshark VPN.

**Will a VPN slow down my internet speed?**  
Using a VPN may slightly reduce your speed due to encryption, but with a high-quality VPN, like Surfshark, the impact is often minimal, and you can actually experience faster speeds due to bypassing throttling.

 **Is it legal to use a VPN?**  
In most countries, using a VPN is perfectly legal. However, it’s crucial to check your local laws, especially if you’re in a country with strict internet regulations.

**Can I use a VPN on my smartphone?**  
Absolutely! Most VPNs offer apps for smartphones and tablets, allowing you to stay secure on the go.",1,1729112012.0,PrivacySentinel,0,1.0,False

Might be controversial but I enjoyed all of Destiny more then the second half of Seed that I did end up liking. I will recognize that Destiny is built on what Seed started obviously. There was just something about Destiny I enjoyed more.

 I enjoyed Shinn's character, a pretty tragic story. Dude lost his parents and sister, then a year/year-half(?) later, Stellar, the first woman he's probably loved gets taken out by the same MS he blames things for.

It's no wonder he snaps, especially with people around him that he's supposed to admired and respect, giving him the tools to enact his revenge.

Neo was an alright Char clone, pretty sweet mask, ngl. I was not expecting the twist of him actually being Mu La Flaga, I was figuring Neo and Rey La Burrel where the clones. I figured the accual Rey twist out pretty quickly after.

Glad the Hawke sister got a happy ending. I was cheering for them.

 Good to Murrue and Mu get and ending but man, poor Waltfield. Man gets his first wife killed by Kira, ending up fighting alongside Kira, kinda having a thing for Murrue only for her dead boyfriend to end up coming back. At least he has his coffee I guess.

The mobile suit designs are okay, pretty much UC suits updated with modern designs and those bulky looking flight units for the grunt suits.

The overall story of Destiny was alright, it kept my attention more then Seed did. The flipping of who's the bad guy was fun to witness though out the series.

I’m reaching out for some advice because I’ve hit a bit of a rough patch. I quit smoking two weeks ago, and while I’m proud of that achievement, I find myself constantly thinking about it. It feels like my brain has a mind of its own, replaying old habits and cravings, and it’s really testing my resolve.

A little background: I’ve been smoking for about five years, and I finally decided to quit after realizing how it was affecting my health and my wallet. The first week was tough, but I was motivated and determined. I kept myself busy with work, exercise, and spending time with friends who support my decision. I even found some great substitutes like gum and mints to keep my mouth busy.

However, as the novelty of quitting has worn off, those persistent thoughts are creeping back in. It’s like I have a little voice in my head reminding me of the “good times” and how relaxing it felt. I often find myself in situations where I used to smoke—like during my morning coffee or after meals—and those triggers can be overwhelming.

I’m trying to stay strong, but I’m worried about the long-term. How do I keep my mind off smoking? Are there any strategies you’ve used that helped you stay focused and avoid cravings? Any tips on how to change my mindset and create new, healthier habits would be greatly appreciated.

How do I turn him down?,"Hey! This post might end up being a little long, but I promise that the context is important, so please bear with me.

The fall semester at my college started at the end of August. I am currently enrolled in a beginner's Japanese course (foreign language requirement) that meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This is where I met J, who is a 21 year old man.

J and I only really started talking about two weeks ago, on Friday. I got to class early that day and decided to study for our exam while I was waiting. J was sitting near me. He asked me if I was ready for the test, and we ended up having a conversation about our majors and what we wanted to do with our lives. I honestly thought he was really fun to talk to.

Then, last Friday, we had another conversation before class began, and ended up continuing it after class. We talked for hours about anything and everything- our hobbies and interests, philosophy, science, you name it. He isn't my usual type physically, but he was so sweet and dorky and fun to talk to that I was interested anyway. At the end of our conversation, I asked for his number, and we ended up planning a date for that Saturday.

On Saturday, we met at a local coffee shop that we both love, and then ended up talking for so long that we also got lunch together. I was having a ton of fun talking to him and was looking forward to going on a second date. During our conversation, we talked about what we might be looking for in a relationship. We established a few things pretty early on:

1. We both wanted to take any potential relationship slowly.
2. Any kind of major physical intimacy would take a few months to build up to.
3. Neither of us are fans of PDA.

This is where things start to get a little... weird.

He walked me to my car at the end of the date and leaned down to kiss me. Okay, no big deal. But then he reached down and grabbed my ass in full view of the entire parking lot and the public park right next to it. A very popular public park full of families and their small children. Then, he fully lifted me up into the air like a small child. I don't know if he thought we might have this romantic movie-scene moment where I wrap my legs around him and we dramatically make out, but I was wearing a skirt and didn't want to flash anyone in this very public park, so I kind of just hung there limply like a ragdoll. I was so stunned that I just said ""Whoa, oh my god! I was not expecting that"". The date ended pretty awkwardly, lmao.

I was really confused. I thought that we had both agreed to take it slow, and also that neither of us like PDA. I texted him an hour or so after the date ended and told him that if we were going to keep going on dates, we needed to take things wayyyy slower. He apologised profusely and told me that he felt bad about going too fast. He seemed sincere, so I told him it was alright and that we could just tone things down. He said he felt much better about the whole thing and was looking forward to going on a second date. At this point, I was still excited to go on a second date too.

On Monday, we saw each other during class, and he walked me to my next class afterward. He apologized again for taking things too fast, and said that he was ""worrying about it all weekend"". I thought we had already worked things out, but hey, maybe it's different talking over text vs. in person. I told him again that it was fine and that we would just take things slower in the future. He told me again that he felt much better about the situation.

Not even half an hour after he dropped me off at my next class, he texted me AGAIN about how bad he felt, and said that he was worried that I would ""hate him"". I was starting to feel like this was less about reassuring me that he would respect my boundaries and more about him trying to get sympathy from me. I told him for the third time that it was fine, but I was honestly starting to feel a little weird about the whole thing. He seemed to be going through these mood swings where he would feel anxious and insecure, ask me for reassurance, tell me about how much better he felt and how happy he was, and then turn around the next day and repeat the cycle. The escalating language was also really concerning, and honestly a little manipulative. It very much made it seem like he was trying to make me feel bad and get sympathy from me.

Between last Friday and this Monday, he also asked me three separate times if I would hang out with him during the week. The first time, I told him that I was busy with midterms and that I would be leaving Thursday morning to go on a family trip, so I didn't have any time. The second time, he told me that it would be a ""nice change of pace"" to see me during test week (even though we have class together three days a week and had just gone on a date) and asked me to hang out with him again. I reminded him that I was busy. The third time, he framed it as a study session, and I was honestly starting to get a little annoyed. I told him that I really did mean it the first two times I told him that I was busy, and that my answer still hadn't changed. He apologized to me for ""misunderstanding"". I'm not sure how you misunderstand the words ""I'm too busy to hang out with you this week"".

Today (Wednesday), I got to class and saw that he was sitting in the seat directly next to mine. We usually sit on complete opposite sides of the room, and he had to ask the guy who usually sits next to me to switch seats with him in order to sit that close, so I was a little surprised. I didn't even realize he knew where I sat well enough to find a chair next to mine when I wasn't even in class yet. 

During class, we had an activity where our professor asked us if we did something specific over the weekend in Japanese, and we would raise our hand and describe it if we did. She asked if anybody had taken a photo at a restaurant, and he said yes. She said ""Oh, what did you take a photo of?"" and he said ""My date"".

I did not give him permission to take a photo of me. I didn't even see him do it. This is when I started to realize that the situation might be a little more dire than I originally thought.

He waited for me after class so that he could walk me to my next one. When we were about halfway there, he asked me if ""we were okay"". To clarify, we are NOT dating. There is no ""we"". We've only known each other for a few weeks and have been on exactly one date, during which I specifically told him that we would need to go on a few dates before I considered us to actually be dating (and he agreed). I was so surprised that I just said something along the lines of ""Uhhh, yeah, everything's fine"", and then I hightailed it out of there.

I'm not sure if he genuinely thinks we're dating, or if he was hoping that if he pretends we are, I'll go along with it. Either way, he seems incredibly emotionally invested in me and our ""relationship"" after only a few days. 

To recap, here's what's concerning me:

* He regularly ""misunderstands"" clear statements and boundaries, then tries to guilt-trip me when I talk to him about it
* He has incredibly fast mood swings; one moment he'll tell me about how gorgeous I am and how much he loves talking to me, and the next he'll say that he's worried I might ""hate him""
* Despite asking him multiple times to take things slowly and him agreeing, he regularly does things that imply a level of emotional investment that is incredibly concerning for having only known each other a few days
* He has apparently taken photos of me without my permission and did not tell me about it
* He seems to be under the impression that we're in a relationship, despite me telling him that we are not

I'm not sure what to do at this point. My original plan was to send him a text when I leave Thursday morning so that he has time to process over the weekend, saying something vague about not being ready for a relationship or not thinking we're compatible. Now I'm worried that a vague message might not be firm enough to get the point across. I'm also worried that the weekend won't be long enough and that he might do something drastic. This has escalated to the point that he seems to be developing a genuine obsession. I do NOT think a second date is in any way a good idea.

How do I tell him that we won't be going on a second date without hurting his feelings, but also firmly enough that he'll actually leave me alone?",1,1729111455.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Edit#2: I would also appreciate any critiques to my website too! Still needs work, but I tried to make it as user friendly as possible.

I'm 24 years old, and I have a remodeling business but I'm struggling to get decent jobs or any work worth doing for the most part.

Outside of mechanicals, I self perform all of the work and even do my own designs. I have virtually no overhead so Im able to charge less which is also a plus.

I don't care much for bragging, but I'm I'm pretty damn good at what I do, and I mean really good. I can come up with unique cost effective solutions for a lot of problems because of the amount of control I have. I'm also a perfectionist and just love the work I do. But the only jobs I come across are usually from people that would be better off hiring a handyman or getting some prefab stuff. I don't by any means charge a lot especially considering I virtually have no overhead, but the way I'm set up is better suited for bigger, complex, niche, or custom jobs like sunrooms, additions, decks, siding, tile, restoration work, or built-ins. 

Essentially I can designs cabinets, build them, spray them, transport and install them. So this logic applies to everything else I do to any scale. Full on Additions, restoring old historic homes, remodeling bathrooms and kitchens, down to something as small as making a dresser or coffee table, and I do it all alone, one job at a time.

Only problem is I'm not generating enough leads. Last decent job was in late 2023 to early 2024 in Bexley. I know networking takes time, but there has to be a way to speed it up through the Internet somehow, but I've already done everything except paid advertising. I have a very professional website, business cards, social media accounts, tried cold calling businesses, etc, so I'm not sure what else to do.

I wouldn't even mind going back to working for someone but there are no real carpenter positions online within a 50 mile radius, just drywaller/carpenter steel stud carpenter, or laborer/carpenter positions for $20/hr. I don't even see lead carpenter or remodeler positions anymore either. Most jobs I see now are white collar focused positions like project manager but I'm not interested in that chaos. Idk if companies have given up on hiring skilled carpenters or what.

I have the option to go work with my uncle in the concrete union as a form carpenter or laborer. It pays well, and has great benefits, but honestly seems boring lol, and the skills and knowledge I have now should technically allow me to get paid more, and I'd rather utilize what I have learned, built and invested in over these years than throw in the towel, but I'm not too sure what exactly I need to do next and I don't have much time left before I have to decide.

I could honestly really use some help or advice.

I'm even willing to offer my services at a discount or even free for some decent advice or assistance. I have the skills, knowledge, tools, professionalism, ability, everything, I just can't find the people that are looking for someone like me lol.",9,1729111418.0,Columbus,44,0.76,False

He had it coming","I (13 at the time) and him (15 at the time) really had it out for each other. From the first moment I met him, I knew I wouldn't like him for the rest of my life. And it was like a month or two after I met him at some dumb meeting- I knew I had to do something about his smug attitude. I was laughing at some funny thing this guy said, and Sol (my enemy) told me to be quiet and pay attention. I WAS paying attention... Anyways, being the good person I was, I didn't argue back or anything. I was just like 'whatever,' and 'some people will be people,' that kind of thing.

The meeting was over soon, which, honestly I was grateful for, because it was beginning to get boring. My parents made me come, and I thought it would be more fun, but it wasn't. Something absurd happened next... he used the last of the coffee machine and DIDN'T REFILL THE POT! I was going to get some- and I KNOW it was him, since a few minutes prior, he left the room and came back with a cup of coffee. It had to be him.

Anyways, I flipped out, and yelled at him. (I know I shouldn't have, since he's 'Future Prime Minister' and all, but I couldn't handle it.) And you know what he told me?

""I'm sorry.""

Ever since, I made it my priority to annoy him. Once, he 'borrowed' my freaking chair without asking and said he thinks it's his 'lucky charm'! The audacity! Anyways, back to the point- me and my friends (Krow and Eric) came up with a great idea- we'd prank Sol by organizing a fake funeral for him. I wasn't sure how many people were actually going to show up, but I managed to convince quite a few. It was near the end of December that year, maybe the 27th? I had an excuse because a week prior to this, he got this REALLY bad haircut, and it was the only excuse I could use to get people to come and 'pay their respects.'

I'd do anything to go back in time and capture that priceless look on his face.

He busted the party near the end, since he actually didn't come (even though I invited him quite clearly) until his friend of his, some girl, texted him.",1,1729111405.0,u_Minute_Ad_903,0,0.99,False

I've been meditating for about 11 years, really consistently for about 6. I joined a meditation center in 2018 (which was a little culty so I left) because I was just looking for a place that wasn't my house to quietly meditate. There were a few days when I got up to 6hrs there. Around then I started to feel a bit of a warm, pulling sensation in my head. It felt really good and I wanted to keep doing it. 

A few years later while meditating I started hearing clicking in the middle of my nose, a short phase where I wanted to clench my teeth together to kind of, push them deeper into my gums? Now thoughout the day when sitting I experience a lot of this warm pushing/pulling sensation in the middle of my head, near the center of my nasal cavity, (it feels a little bit like when your tooth is loose and still attached to the gums) that makes me move my jaw around, a buttery liquid that drips down my tongue overpowering flavors in my mouth (like my morning coffee) and very loud clicking that other people can hear. You can see the uvula in the back of my throat popping up and down while this is happening, and the three different primary care doctors I have asked about it told me not to worry about it/they haven't heard of it/keep googling/and keep the video I have (I have many)

The closest I've found is the suggestion of ""amrita""- but it's kind of annoying because it kind of just starts happening without much of a trigger and I want do it for a while (and it feels good and I don't like to stop it) but it cuts my productivity down a lot. I can ""stop it"" easily enough but then it starts happening again.

Imagine your child zooming around the yard, safely mastering the art of driving with a vehicle that lets them choose their own speed. Sounds fun, right? But here’s the question: Would you let your 3-year-old go as fast as 5 mph? Some parents swear by it—saying it builds confidence and independence. Others argue it's too risky. Where do you stand? Comment below with your thoughts!

Now, think about this: most kids’ ride-on cars max out at around 3 mph. But this one? It cranks it up to 5 mph—perfect for that fearless 8-year-old who’s ready to race. Or, for the cautious kiddo, you can dial it down to 0 mph for a slow, safe cruise.

How Long Can It Keep Your Child Entertained?

What’s better than 20 minutes of peace while your child is distracted? Try 3 hours of uninterrupted fun on a single battery charge. That’s a whole afternoon of quiet coffee time, while your kid enjoys some adventure. Would you rather have a break, or constantly recharge their ride-on? Let’s debate in the comments!

Real World Example: Is It More Than Just a Toy?

Take Sarah, a busy mom of two, who uses this for both fun and function. The built-in mop attachment lets her 6-year-old “clean” the floors while driving. No joke—this car has turned chores into a game! Would you try something like that with your kids, or is it just a gimmick?

Would Adults Try It?

Here’s the twist—it supports up to 180 lbs! Meaning, it’s not just for kids. Could this be a fun way for you to engage with your kids, or even sneak a joyride when no one's watching? What’s the wildest thing you’d do with a product like this?

I wear ear plugs at night, but the noise isn't bad at all. Occasionally a car goes by with the music too loud or I hear people talking to their dogs, but this stuff doesn't really bother me. I love living in a walkable area and being able to walk to bars, restaurants, coffee shops. I know city living is not typically ""HSP friendly"", but I absolutely love it.

**Important**:  If you're within your ten days or so of sobriety, you should see a doctor right away. You may be in acute withdrawal. For heavy drinkers, this can even be fatal, but a doctor can manage it safely.

Beyond that period, one question that comes up often among newcomers to sobriety is something along the lines of, ""I've been sober for [some time period -- usually in the first few months], and I feel awful!""  You may be feeling some combination of the following grab-bag of yuck:

* Depression
* Feeling distracted and unfocused, or ""dissociated.""
* Anger and irritability
* Fatigue (with or without insomnia)
* Anxiety or panic attacks

You may feel awful, but you're not alone!  This problem is so common that it has a name, [Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome) (PAWS).

If you follow that link, you'll learn more about it.  Of course, outside of knowing you're not alone, you probably posted the question because it feels rotten, and you're wondering what you can or should do about it.  What follows is a checklist of things to do if you haven't already tried them.  


* If you haven't seen a doctor since getting sober, it's prudent to do so for a general health evaluation and to rule out any unrelated medical condition.
* Get active in AA.  Go to meetings.  Find one you like and get a home group.  Pitch in for service work, which can be as simple as greeting folks when they come, setting up chairs, or making coffee.
* Get a sponsor and work with them.
* Work the Twelve Steps, either the [traditional version](https://www.aa.org/twelve-steps-twelve-traditions) or a secular version (see the [resources page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AASecular/comments/1g3dufc/staying_sober_without_religion_a_collection_of/), depending on your preference.  Work on these with your sponsor.
* Read the tips in AA's [Living Sober](https://www.aa.org/twelve-steps-twelve-traditions) Book. This book is full of practical suggestions for early sobriety and beyond.
* *Give it time.* Of course, the other items on the checklist are designed to give you some relief and speed the process along, but many of these symptoms may resolve themselves in time on their own.  Remember that you didn't get sick from drinking overnight -- getting better will take some time, too.  A common saying in AA is ""This too shall pass.""  
* Above all, ***don't drink over it!***  Yes, be patient, but however long it takes you to start feeling better, remember: if you don't drink over it, you'll never have to go through this process again.


Good luck to you in your sobriety journey.  May you feel better soon!

I am a 60 year old Louisianian that's going to retire in 6 or 7 years and have decided to retire up to Cheyenne Wyoming.  There are many reasons that I've come up with for this route, and I've decided to come her and ask those that live there what they would say, positive or negative.

  
Reasons to:   

Climate; I am tired of 1.3 seasons per year. I am tired of 100 degree summers.  I LOVE the winter.  I lived in Indiana for a year back in the late 90's and was QUITE happy with cold weather and seasonal changes.

People; The South has a national identity of being ""polite and social"", only it isn't anymore. Not in general at least.  Don't know about Yankees though. :)

Cost of living;  Seems to be pretty much a wash between here and there.  Not much different from what I can tell.

Plans:  Sell the house, sell the Mustang (I don't see ANY Mustangs for sale up there... Weird...), buy a trailer or something up there (normal houses are HELLA expensive up North) and a local ""from there"" pickup truck.  

Truck my remaining furniture up there and outfit my new home.  I should be able to afford everything without having to go back to work (which is the ENTIRE goal) and that'll be that.  Hopefully. :)

(Side note: One reason I chose Cheyenne because of the AFB up there, and figured that if things were ever to REALLY go to pot, and Putin did 'the thing', I would have a front row seat to live stream the whole shebang from my front porch with a cup of coffee.  I mean, if it's all gonna end, why run from it?)

  
Does anyone have any tips, tricks, warnings, anything to persuade or dissuade?

I reached out when I felt I was over it and I wanted her as a friend in my life.

Anyway, I asked her if we could meet up and drink a coffee or something and just catch up. She responded and said she would be happy about that. I replied and asked when would be the best time for her. I was very polite and thanked her for responding.
Then - radio silence. I did not send another message. A few weeks later it was her birthday and I congratulated her. Again - no response. After that I did not send anything else. She never reached out to me again despite her message to my first text that she would be happy to meet. 

I don't understand and it is driving me mad. Like I was over this, but now I am asking myself what I did wrong, why did she not tell me if she has no interest in meeting me again? I would have understood. Why is she telling me she would be happy to meet up only to then ghost me?

Is this typical behaviour of an avoidant? Did I do something wrong? I feel heartbroken like we just broke up and I can't move on since I have no answers. Thank you for your advice. I appreciate this sub and all of you <3",1,1729110238.0,ExNoContact,5,1.0,False

I first found out I have an elevated LDL of 130 in Dec of 2022. I was young and did not take it seriously as I enjoyed exercising & did not eat horribly. In August 2024, I decided to get an annual blood test and was shocked when my LDL was 152. I immediately signed up for a gym membership to attend 3-4 X/week and changed my diet aggresively.

This is what I did:

* HIGH soluble fiber diet
* LOW saturated fat (less than 10g per day)
* NO red meat. No cow. No pig. No turkey. No chicken legs/wings/thighs. ONLY chicken breast (in limited amounts) & fish (salmon, tilapia).
* No cheese
* No egg yolks, no butter, no fatty  oils
* Limit on using extra virgin olive oil & avocado oil
* Light seasoning when cooking & no eating out
* No animal product dairy EXCEPT small spoons of non fat plain Greek yogurt & plain kefir for probiotics to support gut health only when needed
* Oatmeal with plain water most days of the week & daily chia seed pudding with no adding sugar
* Heavy snacking on grapes, apples with skin, golden kiwi, organic spinach, & any greens
* Chugged psyllium husk mixed with water daily
* Replaced instant coffee with 177 mL of organic apple juice with no added sugar 1 time per week
* Added boiled beans to my diet
* No snacking junk. No wrapped/packaged/processed snacks. No chips, no crackers, no protein bars, no fruit snacks, no ice cream, no candy.
* No cakes, no cookies, no pastries, 
* Only ""healthy"" bread/tortilla (Limiting one slice per week at most)
* Ate small amount of nuts & half of an avocado on some days

Nearly 8 weeks later, LDL dropped to 64!!! And as a bonus, my triglycerides dropped too! The diet changes were incredibly hard for me as I love cheese & enjoy cupcakes, but I now have better energy, better toliet habits, and better skin.

Começo a achar demasiado quando tenho dificuldade em encontrar um café onde possa pedir um galão e não um ""latte"", ou apenas comer petiscos e não ""tapas"" e é este o problema! Está a ocorrer uma substituição e não uma adição ao que já existia, o que decorre diretamente de a própria população portuguesa estar a ser substituída.

I'm very new to Hellenism/Hellenistic Polytheism. I've been interested for a very long time and finally found the time and energy to actually throw into it and other Wiccan-like practices (I'm still learning!)

Yesterday I kinda dived headfirst into this beginning with my worship of Apollo. As someone who used to be a very avid artist I've felt a connection with the sun god for a while, and I'm hoping that my worship of him will help me reignite that spark. Yesterday I compiled lists of things to buy for his alter (which I plan to put on the top shelf of my bookshelf) and I think he liked it because I kept feeling the urge to cry for seemingly no reason? I also started taking dedicated walks during the day for him and twice when I mentioned how cloudy it was yesterday the sky very quickly cleared up. Then this morning I read somewhere that he enjoys offerings of coffee so I took a dedicated walk and poured out a little of my morning coffee on the ground for him, after which an orange butterfly almost immediately crossed my path. I could be wrong but these feel like signs to me? Feel free to let me know if I'm misinterpreting.

 Anyways, I'm looking to do more research and was hoping people here might have some resources. I'm willing to do the reading but finding good resources is hell on my adhd. Right now I'm mostly looking for things about Apollo himself (i.e. the difference between Apollo and Apollon, rituals and prayers I can do, things he enjoys, stories about him, etc.). From the little I've read about Hellenism itself I've pretty much decided to try to do things my own way in whatever feels right until I can teach myself more about actual divination (articles on that would also be super helpful!!). I've pretty much gone into this mostly blind aside from my deep seeded love of Greek mythology and the constant stream of Hellenistic tiktoks that grace my fyp lol so any resource helps!

I feel selfish for thinking of two men and dont want to think of either as an option but this kind of happened all at once. 

Well, me and my coworker had a cutesy and friendly thing going. I always notice him and he always notices me. We always smile talking to one another and i found myself looking for him everyday. I realized he came around a lot when i went on my breaks and while i did notice it i didn’t think TOO much of it.

I was very flattered once he asked for my number which i gave to him, but mentioned in that moment i met someone in a different country. Ended up going on a casual coffee date and he followed up with a proposal for dinner and i clarified saying dating doesn’t align with me and id like to remain friends. 

I said this because i still believe it’s wrong to pursue two relationships at once, because feelings can get involved and i value those feelings for all parties involved.

I believe if the long distance gentleman wasnt coming so soon to visit i wouldve accepted the dinner date invitation but i cant imagine going and then turning around and spending time with the other guy thats visiting.

Its been one week since i was honest with my coworker, about being conflicted and valuing his feelings so i didnt think it was right to see two people at once. Through text he was appreciative of the honesty and consideration of his feelings. Now he doesnt come around as much, rightfully so, he said he was hurt.

But i actually miss my coworker.

1g58u0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1g58u0u/how_do_i_lose_weight_legitimately/,How do I lose weight? Legitimately. ,"Okay. i’m 22. I have been big my whole life, but not as big as I am now. in 2016 my whole life changed (parents divorced, neglected to my nana) and i was like 160, I gained up to 270lbs. I then began to slowly lose weight by not eating much. I lost 110lbs. I then got pregnant and gained 70lbs, and then i had 3 back to back pregnancies and now i’m back to 270. I’ve ALWAYS had such a rough time losing weight. I was a very active kid, attended the gym with my parents, i was in sports, always outside, my parents rotated things like rice & fish, chicken, and the occasional turkey burger, a homemade pizza, we hardly ate out. i think my whole childhood i had mcdonald’s like 5 times honestly. I just gained weight rapidly and the most i would lose is like 5-6lbs. For like half a year i was working out and weighing food and watching what i eat. I lost like 5lbs lol. I did cardio & weight lifting for exercise. treadmill for 30 minutes- an hour, and then an hour of weight lifting. My dad’s side of the family are bigger people. most use wegovy or get surgeries to lose the weight after fighting obesity for years and trying to lose it on their own. 

I’m SCARED to get surgery. I don’t want it. it’s a complete life change & i already have issues with absorbing iron. 

Idk what to do. Idk what to change. I’m 5’0. height wise i’m small but im big weight wise. Idk what to do. 


WHAT I EAT IN A DAY: 

Breakfast: I either skip breakfast or eat a medium bowl of cereal 

LUNCH: This depends. I either eat leftover dinner (which could range from chicken, soups, spaghetti, etc) I’ll skip lunch if i can’t find anything, or eat a snack for lunch like a bit of chips, or something to keep my “full” or half full until dinner 

Dinner: this ranges. Spaghetti, kielbasa soup, lasagna soup, BBQ chicken, regular chicken, parm chicken, homemade hibachi, we eat a lot of chicken though. sides are usually corn, green beans, mashed potatoes, or ill opt for mac n cheese for my kids lol. 

Snacks: idk, we don’t usually keep a lot of snacks unless it’s for my kids. sometimes we have chips, otherwise nothing. if we have fruit i’ll eat a cutie (orange) but yeah. 

SWEETS: We sometimes get cookies to bake, i sometimes will buy Reese’s or some chocolate. 

drinks: sprite & water. i don’t drink caffeine like coffee or tea anymore after i had an issue with daily panic attacks.

1g58sax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1g58sax/sudden_constipation/,Sudden constipation?,"Until the last 4 months or so, I always counted myself lucky to have the best, no-problems digestive system ever. A friend joked thatI could live on weeds and roadkill, lol. Every morning I would drink 1-2 cups of black coffee, then have a complete and perfect poop. Usually another one later in the day.

But 10 months ago, I (61F) made some positive changes in my life. I unexpectedly met someone, fell in love, and moved 600 miles away to live with him-- all in the space of three months. I had previously been physically very active, but overweight. I started intermittent fasting (16:8), became vegetarian, and lost 40 pounds in 7 months. As before, I eat lots of fiber, drink water all day, don't drink alcohol except maybe 1 beer a month.

Then out of the blue, I started getting weirdly shaped poop--like thin ribbons, or (bizarrely) squared-off rectangles. And would go 3-4 days with nothing at all. I had no pain or discomfort--but a thin, ribbon poop made me fear the worst (colon cancer?!) and I scheduled a colonoscopy.

No colon cancer, thank goodness--just constipation. At the doctor's suggestion, I take psyllium, a stool softener, and magnesium citrate. This *sort of* helps, but barely. I feel like it's just being pushed along, rather than moving naturally, if that makes sense, and never feels complete.

Why would this happen just when I'm happier, healthier, and eating better than ever? Surely neither being vegetarian or eating only within an 8 hour window would cause this? Yes, I'm 61, but otherwise healthy.

Have others experienced this sudden onset constipation? ",1,1729109424.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False
