A couple of days ago I finished “The Book Thief” and I was really captivated by the story, the characters and the world. 

I’m at the moment a bit lost on what to read next, searching for something that captives you into the story too but no idea what to read. I wonder if anyone here could recommend something.

My recent reads;

-	The Book Thief.
-	The Art Thief.

1l3cqzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1l3cqzd/review_9_supergirl_season_4/,Review 9: Supergirl Season 4,"Season 4 opens with Kara flying throughout the world, fulfills her day-to-day role as Supergirl. Kara has stayed busy in her heroic duties working with the D.E.O., and as a reporter at CatCo proving she can multitask. In one instance she catches a Balloon for little girl, goes to Kaznia and stops a runaway train in another. Kara flies back in time for a press conference than President Marsdin is givng. Kara gives Lena a bottle of Kaznian Vodka. Things seem to be peaceful overall......I said seem. Otis (played by Robert Baker) and Mercy Graves (played by Rhona Mitra) attack an alien named Dr. Vose and steal an EMP device from his lab. J'onn believes this to be a hate crime, with the rise of anti-alien hatred in the country (Season 3 planted the seeds for said hatred). Kara disagrees with J'onn, citing the Alien Amnesty Act and the equal rights in the World. Kara sees hatred closely and realizes J'onn is right and apologizes, asking for his help in dealing with the hate crimes. J'onn declines, saying he's committed to being a man of peace (J'onn left the DEO at the end of Season 3 to help alien citizens and find peaceful solutions). 

At the DEO, Alex adjusts to having Brainy on the team, he's proving to be a challenge. He's doing everything too literally, even trying to be like Winn (Who left at the end of Season 3 to go the Future with the Legion). Alex tries to be Patient with Brainy, eventually he figures it out a balance. A new employee joins CatCo, Nia Nal had worked in DC for Press Secretary Cat Grant in the Marsdin Administration. Nal has a degree in international relations from Georgetown University. She's sent to CatCo so that Kara could take Nia under her wing. When Kara first meets Nia, the latter drops coffee all over the floor. Kara says to her ""Oh my god, you're me"".

Olivia Marsdin (played by Lynda Carter) is forced to resign as President of The United States due to being exposed as an alien. Vice President Phil Baker (played by Bruce Boxleitner) became the next President of the US. Paranoid against more alien crises and his dropping ratings in the polls, Baker turned around the country's policy on anti-alien movements, putting him at odds with the D.E.O[.](https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/D.E.O.) and Supergirl.  Tensions rise, and anti-alien sentiment increases more and more. Later, A new leader steps in to relieve Director Alex Danvers on the orders of Baker, Colonel Lauren Haley (played by April Parker Jones). 

Haley is determined to find out Supergirl's identity, despite the fact that the D.E.O. keeps her off the books. Haley finds out that Supergirl is Kara Danvers, forcing the latter and Alex to seek J'onn's help. They want him to wipe the Colonel's mind of Kara's Identity. They realize that J'onn views it as a form of rape and that he swore not to do it again (he wiped someone's mind back in season one of the memory of he seeing J'onn). J'onn agrees to do it since Kara and Alex are family, but he cannot erase Haley's intent. At least this buys some time until they figure out what to do next. The next day, the colonel comes in with truth seekers, creatures that bring the truth out of someone, or kill a liar. 

Now comes a new plan, J'onn now has to wipe the memories of the D.E.O of their knowledge of Supergirl's secret Identity. Alex offers to leave the D.E.O, Kara tells her ""You need to stay and fight Haley from within"". Reluctantly Alex agrees to the mind wipe, but not before she and Kara cry together on the couch as they both know what it means. Alex wouldn't remember that Kara is an alien, let alone Supergirl. This is a big chunk of their sisterhood taken away, thereby creating a half relationship. With Alex's memory wiped, even fewer people know the truth about Kara.

Over the course of this season, we see the Children of Liberty, led by Ben Lockwood/Agent Liberty (played by Sam Witwer) a terrorist group determined to get rid of aliens. Lockwood is the former host of The Lockdown and a Former history professor at National City University. Lockwood's dad George died months prior in Reign's terraforming. Lydia died at the hands of an Alien, whose husband was wrongfully arrested by Children of Liberty.

We also meet Manchester Black (played by David Ajala) this season, a pro-alien human from England and football hooligan turned vigilante. Manchester's fiancé was an empathic alien, Fiona Byrne therapy sessions for aliens at Al's Dive[ ](https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Al%27s_Dive_Bar_(Earth-38))Bar, which J'onn attended. Fiona was later captured by Agent Liberty, who sought to use her psychic powers for the Children of Liberty's anti-alien agenda. When the plan failed, Fiona was killed. You can imagine Manchester would be very angered and hurt that. Manchester sets out to kill the Children of Liberty, including their leader, and anyone who gets in his way. Manchester is killed by J'onn using the Staff of H'ronmeer (also known as the Staff of Kolar) in vengeance as his believes Manchester shot James Olsen.

Towards the End we meet Lex Luthor (played by Jon Cryer) and see the entirety of his plans. He set in motion many of the events in this season. The President and Ben Lockwood are in cahoots with Lex. Eve Tessmacher had been secretly working for Lex for years. Kara's duplicate from the end of season 3 now named ""Red Daughter"" is residing in Kaznia and has been fed Propaganda and lies so that she'd do Lex's dirty work. He plans to use Red Daughter as a weapon against the US, to discredit Supergirl, and make himself a hero. Lex had exposed himself to radiation, then had Lena create a cure for him made from Harun-El (Black Kryptonite). Lockwood gave himself injections of Harun-El to make himself stronger. Once Supergirl defeats Lex Luthor, Lena removes the Harun-El from his system and shoots him. Lex has the last laugh; he had recorded evidence the Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

Also, this season, we get the Elseworlds crossover, which begins with The Flash 5X08, Continues with Arrow 7X08, and ends with Supergirl 4X08. Elseworlds sets the scene for Crisis on Infinite Earths next season. Mar Novu appears twice this season of Supergirl, he's in Elsewords Part 3, and The Quest for Peace. 

Casting: Our main cast led by Melissa Benoist returns this season, with some changes. Jeremy Jordan left at the end of Season 3, with Winn joining the Legion in the 31st Century. Jesse Rath joins the main cast as Querl Dox/Brainiac 5. Rath does a terrific job as the Coluan 12th level intellect. History is made this season with the introduction of Nia Nal, played by Nicole Maines. Maines, a transgender performer herself, plays the Arrowverse's first Transgender character, and DC's first TG superhero. Maines played Nia beautifully. Bruce Boxleitner plays President Phil Baker and does a great job too. Boxleitner famously portrayed Captain John Sheridan in Babylon 5. Interestingly enough, Baker had been cast with Brent Spiner in the role, the latter had to back out due to other commitments. David Ajala (Manchester Black) would go on to do Star Trek: Discovery as Cleveland Booker. Jon Cryer makes his debut as Lex Luthor. Cryer was perfectly cast as Lex and held his own as an antagonist against Melissa's Supergirl. The whole cast was terrific. 5/5

Writing: One of the four best seasons of my favorite series. Jessica Queller likely did her best work as showrunner here. Lots of high stake's action and drama, yet we still have plenty of humor and heart. Alex and Kara's relationship is literally split in half this season. On one hand you have the family dynamic of the Danvers sisters that's held strong for the previous 15 years, On the other, there's a piece of that dynamic missing due to Alex having her mind wiped to protect Kara. This leads to the other half of the relationship, Boss and subordinate, Supergirl and Director Danvers. Not the sister duo that kicked ass, had game nights, and fought over potstickers. Something does reverse the mind wipe, a blood memory, back when they were kids, Kara saved Alex's life. 

When Kara was getting beaten to death by red daughter, Alex's memories of Kara come back. She sees Kara laying on the ground bloody and runs to her. With her sister's love and help, Kara regains her strength through the solar energy in the plants. Other highlights include Nia's story, where she and Kara go visit the former's family. Nia has a dream of her mom dying and passes the dream powers over to Nia. Maeve Nal was angered by the fact that Nia became the Dreamer and not her. She's Nia as not being a real woman and that she should have gotten the powers. On the way out of town, Kara pulls the car over and comes out as Supergirl to Nia as a way of telling her she understands. 

The Children of Liberty storyline was well done, Manchester Black was a great villain, and Lex Luthor was the best villain of the season. Lex was as a great an antagonist for Kara as Manchester was for J'onn. J'onn has a story where he comes to terms with the fact that he is not a man of peace despite trying to uphold his people's traditions and make his dad proud. 5/5

Special Effects: Visually amazing. 5/5

Sound Effects: 5/5

Entertainment Value: Highly entertaining. 5/5

Replay Value: I would most certainly rewatch. 5/5

25/25: (Season Score)

35/35: (Overall Score)

Final Thoughts: Beautifully Done season, you had plenty of mini arcs in this, tied into a main storyline is that compelling. You have the Danvers sisters who are always fun to watch. One of my favorite scenes with them is after the mind wipe when Alex and Kara are talking about movies, specifically Terminator 2. Alex calls Kara a Goober and throws popcorn at her. Another favorite Danvers scene is when Alex's memories return, and she runs over to Kara and apologizes. Elseworld's part 3 is one of my favorite episodes in this season. J'onn fighting Manchester for the last time is awesome, and even him tracking him down is intense. Lex was a hell of a great villain in this season; Cryer plays an evil bastard well. Will Season 5 be just as good, or worse? We'll see. The Final Season review of Superman & Lois will drop Saturday.

Notes: Carl Lumbly, who first played Myrnn last season, was the voice of J;onn in the DCAU. The Quest for Peace is a reference to Superman IV, which had Jon Cryer as Lenny Luthor. Helen Slater, who had been playing Eliza Danvers since season 1, was Kara Zor-El/Supergirl in the 1984 movie of the same name. Red Daughter's disguise at the bar includes a nametag that say ""Linda Lee"", that's a reference to the '84 Supergirl's earth name.",1,1749060825.0,ArrowVDisscussions,0,1.0,False

1l3cm28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1l3cm28/distract_your_brain/,Distract Your Brain,"4 months and 6 days after my last drink - it's been a WILD journey.  

I read as many posts every day in this sub that I can as it's a stark reminder of how dire my situation was.  Like many I never had a rock bottom moment; I was just being dragged along the ocean floor for what felt like years.  I drank every day, and towards the end I knew I was in trouble.  I was sipping on tequila in coffee mugs during Zoom calls just to feel normal.  In the moment it felt liberating, but I now know that I was in a self-induced purgatory.

The long list of benefits I have realized since being stone sober mirror most of the posts here:  dramatically improved sleep.  Dramatically reduced anxiety.  Better (but not perfect) relationship with my wife & children - that alone is reason enough; but I wanted to drive home a point for everyone here who is just beginning:  physical movement / lifting heavy / and your power to replace the annoying chatter from your brain to keep drinking alcohol.

I worked out hungover for 5 years and was able to 'outwork' my abusive drinking habits.  It was a way of punishing myself for over drinking and attempting to maintain healthy habits.  It was a hangover cure and kept me honest.  At a high-level it was the only thing that kept me from careening completely out of control.

Fast forward to 4+months of sobriety and the benefits of lifting heavy/running/challenging my limits has opened a whole new arena of bliss and contentment that I thought was reserved for the bottom of the bottle.

I’m a 28-year-old guy who recently moved to a new city for work, and I’ve been having a much harder time making friends than I expected. I’m not necessarily shy, but I find it difficult to go beyond surface-level conversations and actually form real connections.

**Background:**  
I work full-time in a relatively quiet office, and most of my coworkers are either significantly older or already have their social circles. I’ve tried apps like Bumble BFF and even gone to a few Meetup events, but nothing has really stuck. People are friendly, but it doesn’t seem to go anywhere beyond small talk or occasional meetups.

**What I’ve Tried So Far:**

* Attended Meetup hiking and board game groups
* Tried chatting with people at the gym (awkward...)
* Downloaded Bumble BFF (some matches, few conversations)
* Volunteered at a local event, which was fun but felt like a one-off

**The Challenge:**  
I guess my main issue is that I don’t know how to take those early interactions and turn them into actual friendships. Like, how do I go from “we chatted for 10 minutes” to “we’re grabbing coffee and hanging out regularly”? It all feels very formal or forced sometimes.

**My Question:**  
How do you make genuine friends as an adult without it feeling like you’re forcing it or being weirdly intense? And how do you know when to follow up or suggest hanging out again?

After that (and when I have some decent spare budget), I will buy all the accessories needed, like a bottomless portafilter, puck screens, a better tamper, etc (a grinder as well at some point).

I am thinking of starting with some pre-ground coffee, like Lavazza, for easy practice, some freshly ground specialty coffee from my local shop and maybe coffee pods, just for convenience and comparison.

I did keto for three months four years ago and lost 30lbs and kept it off for about two years. Had a relationship recently where our favorite thing to do was go to our pizza spot and have a pitcher of beer. Gained 20+ lbs in a year doing that, but it was fun. 

I’m back on Keto in three weeks being super strict and not seeing much movement, although it does feel like my waist is getting smaller. 

I lift weights 4-6 days per week. I sauna at least 20 minutes after lifting. The few days I don’t lift, I’ll sauna and cold plunge cycle for an hour. Steps are 8-12k/day. 

None of my supplements have carbs, mostly soft gels or capsules. 

Supplement / Food Stack
- Colostrum in the AM 30 mins before food and coffee, with collagen, creatine, and sometimes electrolytes. Vitamin C powder for collagen absorption. 
- Keto Coffee with Ghee, salt, MCT
- Multi vitamin (Ritual), fish oil, CoQ10. 

Go lift and sauna. Go to work. 

- Low carb protein shake
- Lunch, usually a salad with primal dressing and protein and cheese (everything weighed and put into LoseIt app)
- Magnesium Citrate (for digestion), Vitamin K2, liver support. 
Walk steps after lunch. 

Home and bone broth + collagen + ghee again at night. Sometimes canned salmon and primal dressing or I just fast. 
- Magnesium glycinate and biotin before bed.  

Lots of water throughout the day. More electrolytes if it’s a big sauna day. 

Sometimes keto bread and grass fed butter if I’m feeling snacky (Orowheat). 

I’m wearing an Oura ring and just into biohacking at the moment. But I’m not seeing much scale movement, but maybe it’s because I’m working out more and building more muscle? What should I adjust? Any red flags here? I’d love to get back down to 150 but three lbs in three weeks of strict keto is discouraging, although it has made my brain super sharp so I’ll keep up with it.

Which camp are you in?","When starting out, I fell in love with the ooey gooey crema espresso porn, and I trained myself to accept the sharp intensity of concentrated coffee that is inherent in espresso.  I soon discovered that stirring in the crema before imbibing produces a more balanced cup with smoother mouthfeel.  Doing so enabled my palate to be more accepting and accustomed to the drink, allowing me to enjoy a more full bodied shot, instead the classic layered experience (which I think many purists prefer). 

Crema is an emulsion of flavonoids, solids, fats and carbonation that floats to the surface and when left alone just disappears. The carbonation dissipates, and the solids and fats are returned to the body of the drink, but it is has cooled.  So when I discovered the practice of skimming off the crema was 'a thing'. For the purist, this was a blasphemous act. Nonetheless I tried it, and the difference was quite remarkable. Greater clarity and sweetness, less bitterness and cleaner mouthfeel.  This is not to suggest I hate crema. I just find shots are better without it. So instead of mixing it in, now I flip my spoon upside down and gently lift the crema off. It goes straight into my mouth lol and indeed it's very oily and bitter. The subsequent experience that follows is a rather pleasant contrast.

I’ve tried tapering off by having just a cup of espresso in the morning, or even avoiding it altogether. Still, many days I start feeling sleepy around 11:00, or again at 15:00 or 16:00.

I don’t take any coffee with me from home, hoping I won’t consume any, but once the drowsiness kicks in, I end up going out to buy one just to stay awake. It's getting expensive, and it is not helping me reach my goal of quitting coffee.

I also bought some caffeine pills for these emergencies. They are 200 mg each, and I cut them into quarters. I take one quarter when the sleepiness hits. It wakes me up a little, but it also gives me the shakes, almost like hypoglycemia, and I need to eat something to feel normal again. To be clear, I don't consume both the pill and the coffee. It is either the coffee or the pill.

1l3cdo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3cdo6,⚠️DON'T DO THIS FELLOW 2026/2027tards,"SO HEY GUYS — I AM SUCCESSFULLY A FAILED DROPPER NOW.
Ask Me Anything.

What are those photos above?

That’s the amount of ink, pages, and hope I burned in the last few years trying to revive my JEE.

The number of strategies I’ve watched…

Andrew Huberman podcasts.

Study techniques.

Focus techniques.

Brain hacks.

Copium.

Self-loathing.

Self-abuse.


Whatever you’re planning to watch or try for JEE — I’ve already done it.
Then why didn’t I get a happy ending?

Because I didn’t do what actually matters.
And it took me 3 full years to figure that out.

So here it is — everything I’ve learned the hard, painful, brain-rotting way.


---

1. Don’t be stagnant.

That state where you’re doing nothing, lying on your bed, planning, thinking, scrolling —
That’s the breeding ground of anxiety, overthinking, depression, low confidence.
It feels harmless but it destroys you.

Do the stupidest, smallest thing to move.

One pushup.

Open the book.

Write one line.

Sit at your table.


That’s momentum. It’s not about discipline. It’s about movement.

Methods that help:

Do 5 pushups.

Clean the room.

5 minute rule.

5...4...3...2...1 → just start.



---

2. Fix your sleep-wake cycle.

No debate here. Fixing sleep fixes 50% of your shit.

Tip: Tell a girl you’ll send her a good morning text at 6:30 AM.
Evolution will do the rest.

Use Alarmy:
Loud alarm + math puzzle + disable app permissions.
You’ll wake up. And so will your building.


---

3. Use Yeolpumta or Track Everything.

If you're using your phone to study, use Yeolpumta. If not, then track manually.
Track your hours. Track your patterns.

Tip:
Set an alarm for every hour. Name it “Fill the Sheet.”
Make an Excel sheet and write down what you did each hour.
You’ll be shocked how much time goes in doing “nothing.”


---

4. Rebuild your focus (you’ve already ruined it).

Your brain can’t hold 10 seconds of attention — thanks to Reels and Shorts.

Fix it like this:

1. Stop watching reels.
No theory. Just stop.
Use ScreenZen, BlockHero, NoScroll. Or uninstall the damn app.


2. Sit idle without doing anything.
Your brain needs to get bored before it can focus.


3. Pick a spot on the wall and stare at it.
2–3 minutes. Build raw focus.


4. Start studying.
You won’t be able to concentrate at first — it’s normal. Extend your time slowly.


5. Pomodoro with a physical timer.
Decide what you’ll do in each session. Don’t go in blind.



Extra Tips:

Sit at the same place daily.
(If ADHD, change environment weekly.)

Don’t masturbate. Please.

Use black coffee + cold showers for boosting intensity.



---

5. Start your day with movement.

Even just walking, stretching, or 10 pushups.

Or set a brutal pushup goal that sets a standard.
It rewires your brain into action mode for the day.


---

6. End your day with a win.

Even if the whole day went to shit, don’t sleep like a loser.

Just do 10 pushups, or write 5 lines in your journal. Something. Anything.

Write:

Where did I screw up?

What should I have done instead?


Then write your To-Do list for tomorrow.

This breaks the pattern of self-hate. You don’t end the day like a victim.


---

Track Everything.

Sleep time.
Wake time.
Study hours.
Wasted hours.
Mood.
Distractions.
Overthinking.

All of it.
Tracking = Awareness = Control.


---

What I learnt after 3 years of rotting in the same loop:

1. Your ability to suffer and sit with discomfort defines your life.
Your mind gives up way before your body does.


2. Keep your commitments.
Especially to yourself.
That’s how you build self-respect.


3. Be relentless.
Don’t ‘study’. Attack the work.
Kill it. Crush it. Take its soul.
Be a savage. Be obsessed. Be a beast.


4. Have grit.
You don’t need motivation. You need endurance.


5. Listen to the whisper that says: “Get up MF, you're nobody yet.”
That’s your conscience. That’s your soul. That’s God talking.


6. Don’t let circumstances control you.
If it’s broken: Face it, fix it, move on.


7. Repetition is the G-code.
Don’t look for hacks. Repeat the basics.


8. Don’t think. Do.
Your brain will try to delay, distract, sleep, scroll, escape.
Don’t negotiate.
Just walk. Just start.
The path will meet your legs.




---

Inaction = stress, anxiety, depression, shame.
Action = peace, pride, confidence.


---

Final thought:

End your day with a hook.
A small habit that you do no matter what.

Even if everything goes to hell, do that one small thing:

10 pushups.

A short walk.

1 page of reading.

Watering a plant.

Calling your mom.


If you do it — it’s not a bad day anymore.


---

That’s it.

3 years of rot.
1 post.

[**https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi)

Hey there! I’m David Dekel, and today I want to share with you how I managed to generate over $3,200 in just one morning using a simple, beginner-friendly system. If you’re interested in building a steady, residual income without spending endless hours on the computer, this post is for you. In fact, this system is so effective that it’s helped me transition from working long, exhausting days to earning substantial income with just a couple of hours of work daily.

One of the key components that makes this system accessible and scalable is its integration with tools like [Kids Book Ai](https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi), an innovative resource helping creators and marketers alike. Throughout this article, I’ll explain how the system works, why it’s beginner-friendly, and how Kids Book Ai fits into this picture to help you create content and build your business.

# The Morning That Changed Everything: $3,200 in Passive Income

Picture this: I woke up this morning with a pink eye—not the best way to start the day, but it didn’t stop me from doing what I love. I headed to my favourite coffee shop, grabbed my morning espresso, and checked my stats. To my surprise, the dashboard showed a total of $3,193 earned just this morning. That’s right—over three grand before noon!

But the story gets better. These earnings weren’t just one-off commissions; a significant portion came from residual income, a steady stream of monthly payments that continue to grow over time. For example, my primary opportunity, Got Backup, had already generated $89 in residuals today, with $127 yesterday. These aren’t just my numbers; my entire team is seeing similar results, and the Facebook group is buzzing with bonus requests and sales confirmations.

# What Is Got Backup? Why It’s Perfect for Beginners

Got Backup is a cloud backup service, similar to Dropbox or Google Drive, but with a twist—it’s designed to be extremely affordable and easy to promote. The service costs under $10 a month, making it an easy sell to customers who already understand the importance of backing up their data.

Here’s why Got Backup stands out as a fantastic opportunity for beginners:

* **Subscription-based residual income:** Customers pay monthly, so your earnings continue to grow each month.
* **Essential service:** Everyone needs backup for their photos, documents, and files. It’s not something people cancel.
* **Low price point:** At under $10 a month, it’s affordable and easy to promote.
* **Proven conversion:** Because it’s a service people already want and use, you don’t have to convince anyone to buy from scratch.

This combination makes Got Backup an ideal foundation for building a sustainable online business, especially if you’re just getting started.

# How the System Works: Minimal Effort, Maximum Results

The best part of this system is that it doesn’t require you to be glued to your computer all day or spend hours convincing people on the phone. Instead, I use a proven system that automates most of the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works:

1. **Drive traffic to the system:** I advertise and attract interested people to a streamlined funnel.
2. **The system handles the rest:** Once people enter the funnel, the system educates, nurtures, and converts them into customers.
3. **Earn commissions and residuals:** As customers sign up, you earn one-time commissions and monthly recurring income.

Because I’ve built up a dedicated audience over time, I can spend as little as two hours a day managing this business, sometimes even less. And thanks to tools like [Kids Book Ai](https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi), I can create engaging content quickly that helps attract and educate my audience.

# Using Kids Book Ai to Accelerate Your Business Growth

One of the challenges many beginners face is content creation. That’s where Kids Book Ai comes into play. It’s an AI-powered tool that helps you create high-quality, engaging content tailored to your niche. Whether you’re crafting blog posts, social media updates, or email sequences, Kids Book Ai simplifies the process and saves you tons of time.

Here’s how I incorporate Kids Book Ai into my system:

* **Content creation:** Generate blog articles, video scripts, and promotional materials effortlessly.
* **Audience engagement:** Produce content that resonates with your audience, increasing trust and conversions.
* **Scaling:** Quickly test different content angles and formats without spending hours writing.

With Kids Book Ai, you don’t need to be a professional writer or marketer to produce compelling content that drives sales. This tool is a game-changer for anyone starting out or looking to scale their online business.

# Exploring Multiple Income Streams Within the System

While Got Backup is the cornerstone of this system, it’s not the only way to make money. The program I use includes eight different income streams, all designed to complement each other and provide multiple avenues for earning.

These additional streams include:

* Various tools and software I personally use to run my business.
* Training programs that help members improve their marketing skills.
* Resources that support different niches and marketing strategies.

Not every member chooses to participate in all eight streams, and that’s perfectly fine. Some prefer to focus solely on Got Backup, while others diversify their income by leveraging multiple products and services. The flexibility of the system means you can tailor your approach according to your preferences and goals.

# Why Consistency and Audience Building Matter

One of the key reasons I can generate thousands in a morning with minimal effort is because I’ve invested time in building an audience. This audience trusts me and values the content I provide, which makes promoting these services much easier.

Building an audience takes time, but it’s the foundation of any sustainable online business. Here’s what I recommend:

* **Create valuable content regularly:** Use tools like Kids Book Ai to maintain a consistent publishing schedule.
* **Engage authentically:** Respond to comments, answer questions, and build relationships.
* **Promote smartly:** Use targeted advertising and funnels to attract the right prospects.

Once you have a loyal audience, your promotional efforts will convert much better, and your income can grow exponentially.

# Getting Started: Your Next Steps to Success

If you’re ready to explore this system and start building your own residual income, here’s how to get started:

1. **Visit the system’s website:** Head over to [SuperAffiliateFunnel.com](https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi) to learn more.
2. **Watch the introductory video:** This short video explains exactly how the system works, what you’re promoting, and how to get started.
3. **Sign up:** Join the program and gain access to all the training, tools, and resources.
4. **Start promoting:** Use the proven funnels and content templates to begin driving traffic and making sales.
5. **Leverage Kids Book Ai:** Create content quickly and effectively to engage your audience and scale your business.

Remember, the key is to take consistent action, stay patient, and keep learning. The system is designed to support you every step of the way.

# Final Thoughts: Why This System Works for Everyone

Whether you’re a complete beginner or someone with some marketing experience, this system offers a straightforward path to building a profitable online business. Here’s why it works:

* **Low barrier to entry:** Affordable products that are easy to promote.
* **Automated funnels:** Systems that do the selling for you.
* **Multiple income streams:** Diversify your earnings and reduce risk.
* **Support and training:** Access to resources that help you grow.
* **Time efficiency:** Spend just a few hours a day for significant results.

And with tools like Kids Book Ai, creating the content you need to attract and convert customers has never been easier. This combination of automation, proven products, and smart content creation is what allowed me to earn over $3,200 in a single morning—and it can do the same for you.

If you’re ready to take the next step and explore this opportunity, visit [SuperAffiliateFunnel.com](https://imsuccessconnection.com/KidsBookAi) today. I’m confident you’ll find the tools and support you need to succeed.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to seeing you thrive in this exciting online business journey!

Models with built-in safety features such as safety chains, reinforced edges, or non-slip surfaces are preferable for families with children.

1l3c9ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/1l3c9ai/privileges_of_rank_in_a_lower_decks_campaign_and/,Privileges of rank in a Lower Decks campaign - and not saying no,"How do everyday privileges of rank accrue for Starfleet officers as they rise in rank and position?

Short version: Is there an STA sourcebook or is there any canon source material that outlines what various ranks, ensigns especially, are typically entitled to on board a Federation starship? Ranging from meal quality and mess hall replicators to recreational holodeck time/programs, to shore leave, personal items and quarters assignments.

Longer version:

I'm running a Lower Decks campaign and we're all having a blast. My players are all casually acquainted with the broader Star Trek setting, but not really up to speed on Lower Decks tropes. They know all about replicators and holodecks, for example, and even the Federation's post-scarcity economy, but they weren't expecting to bunk in a corridor or swab out the holodeck. And on a few occasions they have assumed they'd be able to do things that, if we're sticking to what we've seen in the shows, they probably shouldn't be ""allowed"" to do yet, purely by virtue of being ensigns.

Some examples are: expecting to be allowed to wear non-regulation clothing on duty, replicating fancy meals, reporting for duty on day 1 with a pet cat in tow, and wanting to pimp out one of the shuttles. Flavour things, rather than anything directly affecting the story, as such.

I do not want to spoil their fun and outright forbid anything, so the approach I've taken is to explain what standard protocol, regulations and general norms would likely be. Then I might let them attempt a related task at a high enough difficulty that it would mean sacrificing momentum just to have a shot at getting their way (eg hacking a replicator to dispense a raktajino instead of instant coffee).

Or I might even make it the focus of a B-plot (persuading the counsellor that pets are a kind of symbiant and if the Trill can keep theirs why can't they? And then convincing a more senior officer, to agree to look after it in their personal quarters.)

All of which has really been a ton of fun to play out, and led to some quality slice-of-life episodes of play.

It's also suggested a little homebrew minigame of sorts: expanding the spirit of the 2e Core Rulebook's reputation system to include not just the earning of medals, status and rank... but on a much more mundane level the earning of everyday privileges.

But it's led to some tricky-to-answer questions about what the privileges of rank typically tend to be in Starfleet. There's surprisingly little out there, at least that I've been able to find. Little bit in ST:LD on personal quarters, and some asides about senior officer replicators, but nothing much besides.

So I was wondering anyone could point me to an STA sourcebook that goes into this in any depth and detail, or any other Trek resource that explores the subject of rank or earned privileges? Or even just if anyone has any thoughts on what quality coffee an ensign should be able to get from a replicator without going on a personal quest to earn raktajino privileges?

Thank you for contemplating this high-concept existential science fictional conundrum with me.",0,1749059673.0,startrekadventures,0,0.33,False

1l3c74g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1l3c74g/buckwheat_crepes_gallettes/,Buckwheat crepes (gallettes),"In a [video by Ethan Chlebowski](https://youtu.be/74RWIg_I_-c?si=BVpUAiuyzg0goB28) he is making French buckwheat crepes. He uses *Farine de blé noir de Bretagne* by *Reflets de France* and says that his package had 2 recipes on its side: one from Upper Brittany ""which is literally 1 part buckwheat flour, 2 parts water and salt"", second from Lower Brittany which is the same plus an egg, oil, black pepper and 5-10% white four. He proceeds to make both with reasonable success on a nonstick skillet. 

I was surprised that a batter made out of just flour and water would work - it seemingly had nothing to hold the crepe together, like gluten or egg proteins. So I made an experiment. I didn't have flour on hand, but I did have buckwheat groats (roasted) which I ground into a coarse flour in a coffee/spice mill. I mixed it with water 1:2 by volume, obtaining thin crepe-like batter. But after it stood for a couple hours it thickened to the consistency of rather thick sour cream. So I diluted it back to the crepe batter consistency. It did *not* hold together on the pan at all.

Clearly I did *something* wrong, but what?",1,1749059534.0,AskCulinary,4,1.0,False
1l3c72u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1l3c72u/death_and_betrayal/,Death and Betrayal,"Here we were 2 people madly in love. (Or so I thought) Many people would always point it out. You two are such a cute couple! #couplegoals. I can tell how much you two love each other. Blah blah blah... yes, look at us so sappy and showing just how much we're into each other. With posted selfies of us on cheesy little dates with plenty of pda. (#soulmate #soinlove #oneimgonnamarry #loveofmylife #alwaysandforever) -- massive eyeroll now, like so much that you see the white of my eyes. 

So, this is how it started--- we were both 13 years old sitting in a freezing cold science room for our freshmen orientation night. I was a very outgoing, bubbly, happy person. Them they were dark, mysterious and kept to themselves and hated everyone. I was sitting towards the front of the room by the windows and there 
she sat at the back of the room with her screaming little brothers and her mother standing behind her telling her off in Spanish. She caught the flash of my pearly whites and responded with a middle finger and a ""What the hell are you looking at, b****?"". Our first interaction was one for the books for sure. For the next few years her and I got closer and became close friends. We had classes together and would even hangout after school at their house. That was until I got a boyfriend. That stuck a huge wedge between us for some reason. At the time I didn't realize that she liked me just as much as I liked her. She was always telling me all about her boyfriend and showed me pictures of him. But, I had never met him or saw him in person. So, I never tried to cross any boundaries. I assumed she was boo'd up and I had a boyfriend too so... anyways that's only part of the problem at that point in time.

Later my boyfriend, who was much older than me at the time was telling me just how much my friend was really into him. She apparently tried to make a move on him while he dropped her off one night. He showed me missed calls from her number. This infuriated me, why would she be calling him and how could she be trying to sleep with my boyfriend? The next day at school I saw her walking towards me. She was dressed up and had makeup on. She had a huge grin on her face and was holding flowers. When she finally got close enough to me I let her have it with the I can't believe you! You knew he's my boyfriend and you go and do what you did!? I want nothing to do with you!! We are not friends! Her huge smile dropped from a cheesy grin to heartbroken with tears in her eyes. She dropped the flowers and stormed off. After that I saw her maybe 3 more times. She would give me the meanest looks and would flip me off. Then it was like she fell off the face of the earth. People said she dropped out. 

Fast forward about 10 years.. I'm casually scrolling through facebook when I notice I've got a friends request from her. I've got so many thoughts going through my head. I took to messenger.. what's your story? Is what came to mind and was sent. It took her a week to respond. Out of all things to txt after ten years and a really bad fall out. Her birthday was coming and there was a party she text back and wanted me to attend. I declined. I couldn't help but to think this was a setup for humiliating her in high school. Her and I had been chatting. Caught up some. She was married at this time. Me, single as a Pringle and was mingling with many. That day came up. She asked me what I meant by you know what you did. I explained to her that my bf told me that she tried to bone him that night he brought her home from my place and that there were missed calls from her phone number. She explained that night that he took her home she was talking to him about how she dumped her boyfriend and that she had a huge crush on this girl at school and wanted to ask her out. He told her that she just needed a real man and tried to force himself on her. She explained that the missed calls were from her mom because he had called before a few times looking for me and her mom wanted to know what older man needed to be calling their house. He apparently would just keep calling and calling until someone picked up and would never leave a message on their answering machine. She also added that the girl she was gonna ask out was me. That cheesy grin she had, those flowers, makeup and all dressed up was to ask me out! She said she couldn't return to school after awhile because it hurt to much to see me around. But, she's married now and her husband is great. I couldn't help but to feel like such an idiot. I did confess my crush like feelings for her back then too and we both laughed about it.

Now, let's fast forward another 8 years. A lot has changed in our lives. She's now married to me, we have a daughter, house, dog. The whole cliché love story. I always texted her good morning and would go on a spew about just how much I loved her, you know setting the tone for the day. But, this day I didn't. My alarm didn't go off and I was running late for work. I threw clothes on and didn't even get to make her coffee or breakfast. I didn't even get to set her clothes out.. nothing was right about this morning. The night before her and I were arguing. She was in her office all night this night. On her phone late. I always waited to eat with her to make sure she ate. It was my love language. Anyways, she had just gotten home from a work trip that afternoon. We picked her up from the airport. She was extremely distant. Didn't even kiss our daughter. We made plans to have lunch as a family but, she just wanted to pick up something and go home. Understandable considering the long plane ride back home. Once we got home she was locked away in her office. We could hear her yelling and carrying on on her phone. It went on til the late hours of the night. I attempted to knock, sent her texts to come have some lazy love with me. Relax and watch a show and have some dinner. She finally responded with ""You're such a b****! Can't you tell I'm on the phone I don't want them to hear you: it's my job!"". I decided I was just going to attempt to go to sleep when she came storming into our room. She was pacing the room and carrying on about how I don't understand how everything she does is going to split our family. I tried to get her to explain what she meant but she refused to explain and gifted me my birthday gifts. My birthday wasn't for another few months but she insisted. They were crystals. She told me I needed them because the next few months were going to be the worst for me. She then sent me a text of a food order she wanted and told me to go get food. When I got back she seemed fine. We had the tv on and chowing down on late night junk food in bed. It got later and she rolled herself over and stole all the covers for the last time. No kiss. No goodnight. No, I love you. 

I stumbled into our house after a long day of it being off. I had sent her many text. Wondered why she hadn't responded. Many missed calls from me. It felt off the whole day. But, usually after her work trips she would always be far and few with text and calls because she said she was catching up on work. Which never made a lot of since if she was gone out of town for work. But, hey I was a trusting spouse. The house was quiet at first. Then I hear our daughter in her room. Came down the hallway and there my wife was on the floor unresponsive.

She died 3 days later. They pronounced her brain dead from a stroke that lead to a brain hemorrhage. I needed her phone to contact her work to let them know what happened. Her first contact when clicking into her numbers was ""Babe"". Babe!? I'm babe.. it got much worse. Those trips were get aways for her to see her other fiancés. I found videos, pictures, texts. Going through her things I found letters, rings. Some of these people had been in our house. Pictures of some of these people with our baby. She had multiple relationships with other people and she used our daughter to make these people think she was a single mom to get them to send her things and pay for trips. Many different email addresses, social medias, had many apps to use different numbers. She used to always ask me to let her take our daughter on her trips and I always refused. I dug deeper and found that she was planning on taking our daughter and leaving the states but she couldn't because she was legally married to me. The day after she died her sister called me and told me she was so sorry for all that her sister did to me but she always told her I was the good one and to love me right. I was like what!? Then she continued to tell me that I was family either way no matter what her sister did. Confused af, I began to realize her whole family knew she was seeing other people and they all kept it from me. They all had met some of these people she was seeing. There were pictures of them all at family functions that she left me home for. Her funeral was interesting to say the least. Her whole family came. A lot of people I had never seen before. A few exs. Some of which came to me to tell me she loved me most that she would never shake me. I went up to speak at her wake and told our love story and promised to take care of our daughter. I was too embarrassed to say what I really wanted to say. How she was a liar and a cheater. How I hated her so much for putting me in this situation. But, I didn't. I stood before her body and her family and lovers and told them how much we loved each other.

The whole time she was in the hospital I had to suck it up and make decisions that was best for her being even though she hurt me the deepest anyone could ever hurt anyone. I had to plan her funeral with her and her family and our daughter in mind. They wanted to see her one last time. They wanted a place to come see her. The funeral home even offered me a space to be buried with her once I passed years from now to be with my loved one in death. The betrayal is real. It's been a few years since she's died and I still have her affairs haunting me. They call, they text, they find me on social media demanding to see our daughter. For my daughter I show her pictures of her mom. Tell her how much she loved her. I keep her memory alive for her. But, honestly I wish I could just forget her and it all.

1l3c71g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l3c71g/alibaba_grinder_buying_experience_us1000/,Alibaba grinder buying experience [<US$1000],"Last time I posted here, I got some great advice, especially when it comes to switching to a naked portafilter and changing the basket. I just ordered an MHW-3BOMBER deep extraction basket and a naked portafilter (thanks u/brandaman4200, the Weber Unibasket can wait until I grow our shop).

That said, looks like there's no going around a new grinder. 

For context: I currently use the free 60mm programmable grinder that came with my machine. It's decent, but I know we could do better and we can't kit it with new burrs like SSP ones. Unfortunately, looks like buying a new grinder is inevitable. 

Anyway, so I was looking at Alibaba when I found these:

* [""Eureka Helios 75""](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Eureka-Firenze-75-85-Helios-H65_1601258981432.html) for only US$520 (no reviews)
* [""Eureka Firenze 75""](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Espresso-Grinder-Commercial-Coffee-Grinder-Eureka_1601117683079.html) for only US$478 (5 reviews from across the globe, same supplier as the ""Helios 75"") 
* [""Eureka Mignon Specialita""](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Best-Seller-Eureka-Mignon-Specialita-Black_1600606063938.html) for only US$440 (no reviews, but distributor seems legit since they're an Italian company with 17 years of experience)

These prices are too good to be true, but the ""Firenze"" has good reviews, so I'm kinda leaning towards that. But I also have other non-branded prospects like the following, all seemingly compatible with SSP burrs:

* [ZF64W](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wholesale-Commercial-Electric-Coffee-Grinder-Machine_1601397666596.html) \- $549 (grind-by-weight grinder, wired scale, supposedly the same company that makes all DF64 grinders, also it being a 64mm grinder makes it very appealing considering the wealth of aftermarket burrs available) 
* [ZF83](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Commercial-Professional-Espresso-Electric-Coffee-Grinder_1601433703835.html) \- $540 (same manufacturer as ZF64W and DF64, but only a beefier grinder; unfortunately it's grind-by-time compared to the one above)
* [ITOP CG-64C](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/New-Style-Promotional-Flat-Burr-Coffee_1601235955195.html) \- $325 (I've been seeing ITOP in the Chinese coffee equipment for a while now, this one's a 64mm grind-by-weight grinder with a wireless scale)

I know that platforms like Alibaba have buyer protection, but the question is this: should I risk one of the ""Eureka"" grinders and file a complaint when I get shafted? Or should I shoot for one of the Chinese grinders from below?

More importantly, does anyone else have any experience buying grinders from Alibaba, particularly Chinese grinders? And do you have suggestions? My original plan is to buy a DF64E locally and kit them with SSP High Uniformity. But these are really enticing options.

The reason why I'm considering Alibaba is that even with shipping factored in, it's still cheaper to buy there directly than from a local distributor. Also, we can card it, so it's easier on our monthly budget. Otherwise, we could've got the secondhand Anfim Scody II available in my area for $1000. But alas, I don't have that cash right now.

I, Ana W23, will tell my story. On a night when the sky was dark, I decided to seek shelter in a small roadside inn. The storm was raging as if it wanted to swallow the world, and my only option was to go through the door of that cozy place, even without planning. The smell of wet wood and freshly brewed coffee enveloped me as soon as I entered. 

In the living room, fires crackled in fireplaces and, around me, some people were sheltering from the storm. It was there that I saw him for the first time: Rafael. He was sitting in a corner, lost in a book, but when our eyes met, something inside me awakened. A growing curiosity led me to him. The conversation flowed naturally; we talked about our fears, our dreams and, of course, about the storm that was unfolding outside. Laughter and words intertwined, creating an instant connection. 

We spent hours talking, as if we had known each other from other lives. He was fascinating, with a smile that lit up the dark room.  Time seemed to fly by, and before we knew it, the storm had become a mere backdrop to what was unfolding between us. The warmth of the fireplace reflected the flame of something I didn’t know I was searching for. By nightfall, we were more than strangers; we were two hearts recognizing each other. 

But at dawn, a shadow dimmed that happiness. As we drank coffee, with the sun filtering through the windows, my eyes fell on a photo on the bookshelf: a familiar smile shone. My heart stopped for a moment when I realized it wasn’t a stranger, but my neighbor, Rafael, who had disappeared years ago. That same boy who played on our streets was now the man I loved. 

The pieces of the puzzle began to fit together. He had lived a secret life, away from the spotlight, and as memories of the past crowded my mind, the fear of losing everything we had built began to envelop me. A mix of feelings overwhelmed me: love, betrayal, fear.  Why had he gone into hiding? What else did I not know about him?

Confronting him was like opening a door that I thought was blocked. Rafael looked me in the eye and explained his absence with sincerity. The circumstances that led to his disappearance were not mere trivialities; they were deep roots that connected him to my past and my family in ways I had never imagined. The revelation was overwhelming, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but feel that there was a second chance for us.

We discussed it at length, each of us listening and, ultimately, finding a way to connect our stories. What could have been a huge obstacle became a bridge, full of opportunity to understand each other and rebuild not only our lives, but the connection that existed before the storm.

Today, when I look at Rafael, I see not only my lost neighbor, but a renewed love that was born under the rain. We faced the winds of the storm together and managed to find the rainbow that followed.  Life is full of secrets, but with love and courage, we can turn any storm into a new opportunity for happiness.",1,1749058914.0,romance,0,1.0,False

I’ve got a potential venue — a pub in Hope with a decent-sized car park that would be ideal and would look great for photos.

The only catch is that they won’t start serving coffee until around 11:30, and by that point they’d probably want the car park cleared for regular customers, so there wouldn’t be anything available in terms of food or drink during the meet itself.

I’ve never organised anything like this before, and I’m 16, so I’m aware there might be a few complications. It’d be a free event — mainly just to see what interesting stuff turns up, nothing over the top.

I had a few questions:

Would something like this require public liability insurance, or is that more for large or ticketed events?

Do I need to do a risk assessment, even for a small casual meet like this?

Has anyone had experience running meets at pubs or similar venues — anything I should be aware of?

Any advice appreciated.

1l3bstt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1l3bstt/f4m_roleplay_plots/,[F4M] Roleplay Plots~!,"Hello all! I am looking for a roleplay partner, and before I get to the plot ideas, please read through some of my rules to see if you'll be a fit for them!

* Must be experienced and literate, and be able to write more than just 2-3 sentences and at most multiple paragraphs (2-3)
* Looking to play as 24+ age, it's just a preference for me to be roleplaying with people closer to my age
* Willing to set up the plot further and actually talk about it to make it both a plot we would like
* Mostly just not leave for days on end with no notice of why, I get it, we all have lives and things happen, just a small heads up would be nice. I will do the same if I were to leave for a few days or have delayed replies

Now onto the plots! These can be worked around and tweaked as we would want; these are just rough descriptions and such

1. ***Royal Rumble***\- Two Kingdoms that have been enemies for decades finally decide to bury the hatchet and become friends with one another. The Kings and/or Queens are formal and become close friends, but the Prince and Princess do not. Being raised on the hatred their families had for one another, the two seem not to be over it. They are constantly at each other's throats, making fools of one another by embarrassing them at balls and gatherings, blaming the other for their own wrongdoings, or just plain verbally attacking one another. Will the two ever get along, or will they still keep the long-dead family feud alive?
2. ***The Knight and the Alchemist***\- Years of training as a knight have finally paid off, and you have officially been given the rank of Knight, which means you will soon be sent outside the castle walls on quests for your Kingdom. After your first few missions of simple vanquishing monsters and enemies that threatened the people, the King had called to you for a special mission, one of his generals has gone missing and was last heard weeks ago as he was tasked to conquer a rebels base, but no word has come back on the Generals werabouts, so you are tasked to go and find the General but you were to be aided by an Alchemist, to help heal you and aid you in your long and trecherous journey. It was always a drag being paired with others, but it was the King's orders, and you dared not disobey. So the two of you set off on your quest, and you hope this Alchemist won't drag you down.
3. ***Lattes and Love-*** Working day in and day out has become restless, and a pick-me-up is always needed to get through the day, but not just anything. Coffee is the main addiction and aid for long days and late-night work. At first, the small coffee shop was just an easy place to grab a quick cup or two, but after a while, you started to go for more than just the coffee. The cashier girl who worked there from open to close was always the best part, aside from the caffeine. In the first few months, you barely noticed her and only thought about how much she worked there to see her nearly every day at the same time. But the few days you went and she wasn't there, oddly, you made you miss her; it didn't feel the same without her there. Eventually, you started to spend as much time as you could there just to see her and maybe make the occasional small talk with her, but every time you had a minute alone with her, people rushed in, but today was the day you were gonna ask her out! Would she reject you, be embarrassed and weirded out, or not know who you are? Oh god it's your turn to order, quick, ask her out!
4. ***Old and New Hollywood-*** Years of being Hollywood's number one bachelor and actor have kept you at the top, and your standards have only risen as well. But in your newest film, you decided to branch out a bit and be in your first musical, singing was never your forte, but you don't wanna be a one-trick pony. But with this you were expecting another top of the line Hollywood star but instead, you are forced to work with the new girl in Hollywood, this was not to your liking, and you were not to be forced to work with her if she was to make this movie a disaster and tarnish your name. You tried to get out of this film or use your connections to get you a different co-star, but the studio wanted her and her alone to play the part. You found out she was a theater girl with little to no actor training; she was just a singing and dancing theater girl from Broadway who was picked to star in this role and finally take her first steps into Hollywood. Will you choose to make peace with the new girl on the Hollywood block, keep things only peaceful for the press and public, or will every day on set be hell on earth dealing with the untrained actor?
5. ***Fandom RPs-*** This is just a list of fandoms that I can RP, and with these, I will play as my OC, you can play as an OC or a Canon character.

So, I've been diving headfirst into this whole new world of learning guitar... and it's been both terrifying and thrilling. Right now, I'm kinda obsessed with trying to nail those tricky finger placements and every chord feels like a mini victory. 🎸

I'm curious... have you managed to stick with it? Have the calluses on your fingers become a badge of honor? I hope you're still strumming away, maybe even playing in front of that small coffee shop crowd like you always dreamed...

Learning something totally new has always felt so daunting, but I'm holding on to the hope that it's worth it... that the patience and practice pay off. Do you have any go-to songs that make you feel alive when you play them now? I really hope it's still bringing you joy.

Also, if you've found any new hobbies or interests, don't forget to let them light you up too! Always remember that it's okay to not have all the answers yet.

With love and perpetual curiosity,

Leslie had just turned twenty-two when she first felt a flutter of excitement in her chest at the mere thought of wearing a flowing, silky skirt. She sat on the edge of her neatly made bed, the late-afternoon sun warming the walls of her cozy apartment. Hmm, she thought, maybe it was time to admit how good that idea made her feel. She let out a shy giggle, one only she could hear, and brushed her fingertips along a folded blouse on her bedside table. The blouse was pale pink and smelled faintly of lavender fabric softener, and she couldn’t help but imagine how it would look paired with a matching skirt and a pair of kitten heels. For a moment, she almost said “omg” out loud, surprising even herself. ( For More [Crossdressing Story ](https://www.youtube.com/@crossdressing-story)Susbcribe To Our Youtube Channel)

She had moved back in with her mom, Marianne, a few months earlier after finishing a difficult internship in another city. Marianne had quickly sensed a shift in her grown child—a gentle transformation from the boyish persona Leslie had performed so well into someone more graceful and deliberate, as though she had grown tired of playing a role that didn’t spark joy. Marianne often shot Leslie curious, knowing looks. She was in her late forties, worked at a trendy art gallery, and was the sort of mother who wore statement necklaces on a random Tuesday just because they made her feel fabulous. She had a warm voice that could lull anyone into opening up. Yet Leslie, feeling both eager and afraid, had no clue where to begin.

When she finally mustered the nerve, Leslie fidgeted in the living room doorway one afternoon while Marianne was flipping through a decor magazine. Leslie wore a plain white T-shirt and jeans, and her freshly washed hair fell around her cheeks in soft waves. She coughed lightly to get her mom’s attention. Marianne, sensing her child’s hesitation, patted the seat next to her on the sofa and said, “Come sit, dear. I was starting to think you’d stand there all day.”

Leslie’s heart pounded as she settled onto the cushion. She cast a nervous glance toward a decorative mirror hanging above the mantel, as if checking for approval from her own reflection. At last, in a breathy whisper, she said, “Mom, I think...I think I want to dress differently sometimes.” Then, in a rush, she admitted, “I want to wear pretty outfits and makeup. I’m not sure if you’re going to think that’s weird, but it’s something I’ve dreamed about for a while.”

Marianne’s eyes softened. “Oh, honey,” she said quietly, reaching over to place a gentle hand over Leslie’s. “I had a feeling. I just never wanted to push or invade your space. Are you saying you want to cross-dress?”

Leslie felt heat rise in her cheeks, but nodded. “Yes, but not just cross-dress casually. I want to dress up in a way that feels...feminine. And I’m worried about how people might react, or if I’ll even look right.”

Marianne pulled Leslie into a warm hug. “You’ll look exactly how you need to look,” she said. “We’ll figure this out together.”

Leslie nodded against her mother’s shoulder, tears of relief forming at the corners of her eyes. This was the acceptance she had craved without really knowing it—someone she loved giving her permission to explore herself in a new way. She noticed Marianne’s floral perfume, the same one she’d worn for years, and the comforting scent only made her tears flow faster.

The next day, Leslie awoke feeling both eager and petrified. She padded barefoot across the hallway and found her mother in the kitchen making coffee. Two steaming mugs sat on the counter, and Marianne smiled as Leslie approached. “Morning, dear,” she said. “I was thinking maybe we could go into town today and do a little shopping. Doesn’t have to be much, just something to get you started. Only if you want to, of course.”

Leslie nearly hopped up and down at the suggestion. “Aha! I mean...yes, I’d love that,” she stammered, laughing self-consciously at how giddy she sounded. She spent the rest of breakfast trying to calm her racing heart at the idea of picking out her first “girly” clothes in public.

It was a drizzly afternoon when they arrived at a small boutique with pastel curtains in the windows. The shop smelled of rose potpourri, and rows of dresses and skirts gleamed under soft lighting. Leslie’s eyes went wide. She felt as if she’d entered a treasure trove. The store clerk was a chic young woman with short, glossy hair, wearing a denim jacket festooned with enamel pins. She greeted them kindly, and Marianne introduced Leslie: “This is my child, Leslie. We’re looking for a few outfits with a feminine touch.”

The clerk’s friendly grin never wavered. “We have lots of playful pieces,” she said, beckoning them further in. “Feel free to look around. Let me know if I can help you find any sizes.”

Leslie found a pale blush skirt, high-waisted with a soft sheen. She ran her fingers across the fabric, letting out a quiet hmm. The texture was silky, almost like water flowing over her skin. She imagined swirling in it, feeling the hem swish against her knees. She pictured herself pairing it with a lightweight sweater or a delicate cami. Her heart thudded with excitement and a hint of anxiety. At Marianne’s encouraging nod, she carried the skirt into the fitting room.

Slipping off her jeans, Leslie pulled the skirt over her hips. It felt so different from any clothing she’d worn before—there was a sense of lightness, a teasing brush of air along her legs. She caught sight of herself in the mirror. Despite her trembling hands, she let out a soft “omg” under her breath. She felt good, a little vulnerable but also oddly powerful, as if she’d just tapped into a hidden part of her identity she hadn’t known was yearning to be freed.

When she emerged from the dressing room, Marianne placed a hand over her mouth, eyes shining. “You look beautiful, dear!” she exclaimed. Leslie caught the store clerk smiling in approval. Her knees practically turned to jelly. She felt a little silly admitting it, but hearing that positive reaction meant everything.

They left the boutique an hour later, a small bag of new clothes in hand, including the silky skirt, two simple tops, and a pair of modest heels with ankle straps. Marianne insisted on buying them all. When they arrived home, Leslie rushed to her room with the bag as though it contained precious artifacts, and she spent the next half hour carefully arranging each item in her closet.

She didn’t wait long to test her new outfits. Two days later, she planned a quiet evening at home, slipping into the pink skirt and trying on the heels. She turned on some cheerful pop music in her bedroom. At first, she just stood there, so aware of her posture. Then she started swaying gently to the beat, letting her hips move in time with the music. She felt so alive. Her reflection in the mirror looked delicate yet joyful. She took a deep breath, suddenly longing to perfect the look with a touch of makeup. She tiptoed across the hall to Marianne’s bathroom, where she found her mother’s array of blushes, lipsticks, and eyeshadows meticulously organized.

Leslie’s hands shook as she picked out a pinkish-nude lipstick labeled “Peony.” She’d never used real lipstick on herself, only tinted lip balm. She pressed the creamy stick gently against her lips, then paused, lips parted, to admire the new color. It was subtle, but definitely noticeable, like a sweet secret. She mouthed “aha,” smiling at the mirror. She added a hint of mascara and carefully brushed it through her lashes. The effect made her eyes look larger, more inviting. She could almost forget the anxious flutter in her stomach as she floated back to her bedroom in a blur of pink skirt and gentle self-discovery.

She got braver as the days turned to weeks. One sunny afternoon, Marianne joked that they should have a “girls’ spa day” at home, painting their nails and chatting about everything under the sun. Leslie, cheeks warming, heart soared at the idea. She rummaged for a bright coral polish and carefully painted each nail, occasionally whispering “dear me” whenever she nearly smudged the wet enamel. Marianne joined in, painting her own nails a soft lilac. They ended up talking about Leslie’s favorite childhood memories, gossiping about new TV series, and sipping iced lemonade. Leslie felt more bonded with her mom than ever.

Yet, not everything was so easy. Marianne’s sister, Aunt Brenda, came by unexpectedly one afternoon, and Leslie found herself hurrying to remove the newly applied peach lipstick from her lips. Aunt Brenda was more old-fashioned, prone to critical commentary. Leslie wondered if it was better to keep it all hidden than risk a condescending stare or hurtful remarks. She felt her heart rate spike just from the unexpected knock on the door. Marianne sensed it, quickly telling Aunt Brenda that Leslie was “busy,” shielding her from any stressful confrontation for the time being. But Leslie knew she couldn’t avoid everyone forever. A stirring of doubt told her that acceptance by those outside her immediate bubble might not come so easily.

Still, she continued to gather little victories. One day, she ventured onto the back patio wearing a light sundress she’d bought on a whim—white cotton with a gentle ruffle across the neckline. The breeze tickled her legs. The soft hiss of the wind in the trees gave her confidence, like nature itself was applauding her gentle courage. She had begun using softer pronouns for herself in her private thoughts, though she didn’t share this with anyone yet. She realized her identity was a blossoming flower, not fully defined but certainly more than just one label.

In the meantime, Marianne watched her child’s transformation with the proud gaze of someone witnessing a quiet miracle. She’d occasionally suggest new outfit ideas or offer small makeup tips. “Stand tall in your heels, dear,” she said once, placing a firm hand on Leslie’s lower back. “Confidence is half the magic of any look.” Leslie blushed, giggled, and tried to keep her shoulders back while still teetering a bit in the unfamiliar footwear.

Gradually, Leslie tackled her biggest fear: leaving the house dressed in a way that fully expressed her feminine flair. It started with short walks to the mailbox, wearing a breezy skirt. Her heart hammered in her chest as she pictured neighbors peeking through windows. But each time she returned, no pitchforks awaited her, no mocking laughter rained down from the sky. After a few days, she ventured to an evening convenience store run, wearing soft leggings and a loose tunic top that looked very femme. The clerk barely glanced up from her phone. That was oddly empowering—her presence didn’t spark chaos or condemnation.

Nevertheless, anxiety still lay coiled within. One rainy afternoon, Leslie sat cross-legged on the living room carpet, rummaging through a box of old photographs. She stumbled upon a shot of herself at eighteen, in a stiff tuxedo at a cousin’s wedding, looking uncomfortable and overshadowed by the elaborate gowns around her. She couldn’t help but whisper, “oh dear,” shaking her head at the memory. She placed that photo aside and found a sense of peace in the realization that she never had to fit herself into that mold again.

Challenges soon rose from beyond the family, however. One day, a longtime friend, Jonah, dropped by. Leslie answered the door in casual jeans, a snug cardigan, and subtle lip gloss. Jonah paused, did a double take, and asked if she was trying out some new “style experiment.” Leslie hesitated, then told Jonah she was exploring her identity and finding happiness in cross-dressing. The conversation was awkward—Jonah scratched at his neck, uncertain what to say. Eventually, he simply said, “I guess as long as you’re happy,” and changed the subject, looking at the floor. Leslie felt a pang of sadness, sensing Jonah’s unease. But she also reminded herself that everyone needed time to adjust.

One night, Marianne decided to treat Leslie to a celebratory dinner downtown. “You’ve come so far, dear,” she said, hugging Leslie warmly in the hall. “Let’s show you off a bit, shall we?” Leslie laughed nervously but agreed. She spent a solid hour getting ready—gently styling her hair into soft waves, adding a rosy flush to her cheeks with blush, and choosing a silky sapphire-blue dress that clung at the waist and flared at the hips. She actually squealed when she put on a pair of silver flats Marianne had gifted her for the occasion.

The downtown restaurant was low-lit and serene, with classical music playing softly in the background. Leslie walked in beside her mother, feeling elegant and alive, but also fighting a hum of butterflies in her stomach. She half-expected whispers or pointed stares. Instead, the hostess greeted them with a polite smile, guiding them to a table by the window. Marianne clinked glasses with Leslie as they sipped chilled water. By the time they’d ordered dessert, Leslie realized with relief that not a single person had shown her any disrespect. Instead, a few people had actually smiled in her direction as they passed, and it felt so normal it was almost magical. She wanted to freeze the moment forever.

After dinner, strolling back to their car, Leslie looped her arm through Marianne’s. The streetlights lent a gentle glow to the wet pavement from a recent drizzle. “Mom,” she began, her voice thick with emotion, “thank you for helping me realize I could be...me. However that looks.”

Marianne leaned her head against Leslie’s shoulder. “Oh, darling, I’m just so proud. I see how happy you are, and that’s all that matters to me.”

They drove home in companionable silence, each reflecting on the unspoken bond that had deepened between them. Leslie fell asleep that night still in her sapphire dress, drifting off amid lingering traces of perfume and the quiet hum of triumph.

In the following days, Leslie felt emboldened to share her evolving identity more openly. She timidly updated her social media profile with a snapshot of her in a lacy blouse, hair styled just so. She braced herself for negative comments, but was surprised by a flood of supportive messages from acquaintances near and far. Some expressed gentle curiosity, others sent hearts and typed “gorgeous!” and “live your truth!” The relief was overwhelming. She texted a screenshot of the responses to Marianne, who replied with multiple heart emojis.

She also made the decision to meet her cousin, Lara, at a nearby café. Lara had always been the “fashion-forward” one in the family, and Leslie hoped she might be an ally. The moment Leslie stepped inside the café—wearing a soft olive-green cardigan and a pleated skirt—Lara squealed, “Girl, you look so adorable!” and enveloped her in a hug. They spent the next hour chatting about makeup brands, skirt lengths, and do-it-yourself hair highlights. They parted with a tight embrace, and Leslie felt almost breathless with happiness. She had a new friend in the family. It reminded her how acceptance often arrived from unexpected corners.

Gradually, each small step knitted together into a life that felt more authentic. She began taking strolls by herself, wearing outfits that expressed her femininity without apology. Occasionally, she’d feel the sting of an uncertain glance or overhear a whispered comment, but more often than not, people were indifferent or even kindly curious. Leslie took to journaling her experiences in a pretty notebook. She’d document everything from her daily outfits to how each made her feel. Some days she felt unstoppable; others, she worried she wasn’t “doing it right” or that she was straddling a fence between two worlds. But she kept going, scribbling notes like “Had so much fun in my lilac top today, dear diary, but wow, I need to practice walking in heels so I don’t wobble!” She’d laugh at herself, enjoying the process as much as the progress.

And somewhere along the way, she realized her cross-dressing wasn’t just about clothes. It was about acknowledging the feminine spirit she carried inside, about cherishing textures and shapes that gave her a small thrill, about unveiling a side of her personality that had been quietly growing from within for years. She noticed her confidence blossomed in all areas of life. Even her voice on work calls took on a steadier tone. She discovered she liked adding subtle touches of color to her daily routine, like wearing pastel hair ties or a playful ring that sparkled under office lights. Every such choice felt like a reaffirmation of the woman inside who had always been waiting for her chance to shine.

Eventually, Aunt Brenda did find out. She walked in on a casual family get-together and was taken aback to see Leslie in a polka-dot dress, sipping coffee at the kitchen table. A few beats of tense silence followed, but Marianne smoothly guided the conversation, and Leslie managed a polite smile. It wasn’t easy. Aunt Brenda’s uncertain gaze flickered, but Marianne’s calm acceptance spoke volumes. Leslie mustered a gentle greeting, “Hi, Aunt Brenda,” letting her see the real person behind the pretty dress. That day ended without any dramatic confrontation, though Aunt Brenda left somewhat abruptly. Yet, the sky didn’t fall. Leslie comforted herself with the knowledge that time often softened people’s reactions.

One weekend evening, Leslie found herself in front of her dresser mirror, once again lost in thought. She traced the outline of her reflection, noticing how much had changed. There was a new sparkle in her eyes—an assurance of belonging in her own skin. The reflection wore a floral blouse and a denim skirt. Her hair was styled in casual, feminine waves. She wore tinted lip gloss that shimmered softly. She touched the doorknob, paused, and took one deep breath. Then she stepped into the hallway, heading out to meet some friends for dinner. She felt no more need to hide behind baggy shirts. This was her life, and it was opening up before her like a flower in bloom.

The drive to the restaurant was filled with music—bubbly pop tunes that made her grin. She found herself singing along, letting out an excited squeal at a beloved chorus. When she arrived, a couple of her friends, including Jonah, were seated at a table by the window. Jonah’s eyebrows rose slightly, but a smile tugged at his mouth. Leslie braced herself for an awkward moment, but Jonah patted the seat next to him, saying with tentative warmth, “I saved you a seat. You look good tonight.” She blinked back gratitude, mouthing “thank you” as she slid into the chair. Small gestures like that were everything. The conversation flowed smoothly, jokes were exchanged, and Leslie realized she wasn’t the center of attention in a negative way—she was simply part of the group, a friend who had come to hang out. Everyone was more intrigued by the new pizza specials than by her outfit, and that normalcy brought her a rush of quiet joy.

Later, at home, she removed her makeup carefully, feeling the presence of her mother just outside the bathroom door. Marianne’s voice came floating in. “How did it go tonight, dear?” Leslie paused mid-swipe of a makeup remover pad, eyes locked on her reflection. “It went really well,” she called back. “I feel...wonderful.” She let out a little laugh, almost teary. When she stepped out, Marianne gave her a proud smile. Leslie realized in that moment she had discovered what it meant to be comfortable, inside and out.

She crawled into bed wearing a cotton nightgown she’d found on sale last week—soft, pastel, and oh-so-gentle against her skin. She flicked off the bedside lamp, darkness settling around her in a comforting hush. She felt all the events of the past months swirl through her mind: her first purchases, the swirl of that pink skirt around her thighs, the anxious excitement of stepping out in public, the relief at receiving acceptance from friends and family. She drifted off with a single word on her lips: “finally.”

In the days to come, there would be bigger milestones—perhaps exploring more expressive fashion, maybe even a new name or pronouns if she felt that calling. She had found a part-time job at the gallery with Marianne, helping organize events, wearing breezy dresses that she chose herself. She was forging a life that embraced her entire being. Challenges would continue, but so would her growth. Each morning she’d wake up, slide open her closet door, and smile at a variety of choices that felt like freedom. Gone were the days of hiding in shapeless outfits and uneasy self-doubt. She was stepping through life in heels (still wobbly at times, dear me!), humming a catchy tune, finding solace in the unconditional love of her mother, and discovering that true acceptance began in her own heart.

I buy and sell from garage sales and thrift stores, but I also never saw a free pile I didn't like. I used to have a pickup truck and now have a small hatchback but I can still fit a lot even if I have to strap it down in the back 

Sometimes on my way home I will drive on the side streets around my house. Always keeping an eye out. I've got a decent size lot and it's easy enough to just unload stuff. Obviously some of it needs to go outside or under a tarp. Some of it can be outside of course. 

Lawn mowers off and work with little gas or new spark plug or carb clean, or can be sold as is when I end up with too many. Patio furniture sells pretty well. Other furniture of course. I generally don't do couches or upholstered but once in a while. Plenty of people still don't mind buying. 

Various equipment, power tools, bicycles. Of course I make sure they aren't somebody's kids bike that has been left out front because they're kids. 

Gun safe, vintage foot treatle sewing machine, old Evinrude seized outboard motor I just sold for 50 bucks in 2 days, easily repairable furniture, good sets of tires, aluminum car wheel sets, commercial coffee grinder and coffee maker, four bags of expensive polymeric sand for sending pavers that I sold for 50 bucks each, you name it. Even an old car battery is good for 10 bucks credit down at O'Reilly's.

I have even picked up things like stripped bike frames for lawn mowers from abandoned homeless camps, or something dumped like an old rolling tool box after checking with the people by the nearest house, although usually just stuff set out on the road with a free sign. If there isn't a sign I usually knock on the door and ask. 

I figure I'm keeping it all out of the landfill and getting it off the streets.  Plus getting things into the hands of people that want them.  I'm not expecting a Nobel prize or anything but I think I'm contributing to society in my small way and certainly contributing to my pocketbook.  I generally don't go online looking for free things and definitely don't participate in buy nothing groups. Those people seem to want to have some kind of giver receiver connection and want things to go to someone who needs it so I just focus on things dumped on the side of the road.

I don't really keep track, but I've probably made 7 to 10,000 over the last few years from free stuff alone.  best so far was 450 for a '50s precision power saw table thing that was very high quality. Currently sitting not literally on a seafoam green toilet from the '50s I'm hoping to get 5 or 600 for. Most stuff is in the 20 to 100 range but it's easy enough to sell. 

Quick tip, I post on Facebook marketplace, cut and paste the title into the beginning of my description, then give further description, all using voice input to make it easy and quick.  Then I copy the entire description. Post on marketplace and 20 other buy sell groups, then go over to OfferUp and craigslist. Since I have copied the description with title, I can paste it into the title line thus leaving the title there, then I paste it into the description, allowing me to post in all three places in about 10 minutes. I have pretty good sales on all three platforms and I would be hard pressed to say which platform is best for what type of items. But all three are pretty useful.

Anyway, I'm sure there's profitable ways to use my time but I just can't resist free money and I like the hustle. Also, while there are a few annoyances and annoying people out there, for the most part I have met a lot of really nice people through online selling.

1l3bj2u,https://i.redd.it/bvj42lkb3y4f1.jpeg,Am I imagining the second line... at almost 49!!,"
Just an initial explanation - I simply felt a need to share my experience. I'm not looking for doctors on Reddit nor I would assume that would be possible, I am not asking if I am pregnant, God forbid searching for resources with free tests. I did a test, faint T line appeared along with the C line, I am waiting for a complete medical checkup. Just felt a bit lost and curious if anyone else resulted pregnant with such a faint T line, is there even 0.5% hope... I clearly explained how many gyn visits I've had only in past months and that I know it's essential, so I really don't get why I was treated badly in a different community, and my post was removed. I am a quite young looking 48 year old with hopefully the right to live my life the way I manage, I'm not unrealistic at all. Whatever.

So.... my story is kinda wild and complicated.... beginning in November last year when I painlessly passed what looked like a huge clot to some doctors, a tumor to others who threw it away?! instead of sending it to a lab, a miscarriage to others. My periods have ALWAYS been regular, I haven't missed a single one in my entire life as I don't have kids, and they still are. The exam in November showed thick endometrium 18 mm, presumably ovarian follicular cyst and I was prescribed Primolut, which caused horrific bleeding on day 3 after stopping it, but didn't mess my subsequent cycles in any way... boy I was glad to stop the med... but then on the very next exam, a doctor saw a polyp and scheduled MIS to remove it... the exam was like 5 seconds, here it is, procedure. That didn't sound right AT ALL. I simply paid a private practice visit... 3 times. NO POLYP. On the 3rd occasion, my doctor caught the folicule that was about to rupture. Needless to say, I've been flipping for quite a while with simply preserving my reproductive health... To cut the story short, fast forward to the beginning of May, candida was killing me, clotrimazole caused light weird bleeding... but at the same time I started feeling something I've never felt in my life. Smelling everything in the world... coffee tasting so obnoxious, bitter and sour... my breasts swelling and areolas becoming crazy huge... water tasting sweet... hairs growing very fast, suddenly strong and curly... bloating, burping as if on Primolut again, dizziness... extreme cold... but I got what looked like a period on May 8th. Tested afterwards, negative. Three times. I was ready to write it off but my breasts are reminding me that they are so sensitive... nausea comes and goes... peeing like crazy on and off... and my stomach feels weird, all sorts of sudden cramps, tightness... ok, I'll do the bloodwork in the next days and schedule a visit, but in the meantime I tested again. No digital tests over here, the standard one seems to show something... or nothing? 😩 I'm at a loss, kinda flipping as I am 48 and turning 49 in August! No IVFs, no trying for years, I really wasn't thinking that 0.5 chance is a chance even with IVF... I just need some friendly word till I'm waiting, another pair of line eyes, someone knowing someone who at my age had any success with becoming pregnant in such a straightforward way... ❤️ I don't have high hopes even though I'd love so much for this to be true and I swear I feel different than my usual self... and I am kinda scared what is going on if it's not pregnancy. Symptoms were just jumping out one after the other, I couldn't possibly immagine them, or make my belly or inner thigh hairs grow crazy lengths day after day 🤣🙏🍀 or sharp pulling all of a sudden if I twist, small left then right stabs... Thank you all... and good luck, I do wish I had better chances or smarter head when I was younger. Family is a true blessing, achievements can never fulfill that emptiness.... ❤️❤️❤️

Again, I just wanted a friendly word, really the same as when others share their concerns... and of course I will check with the doctor what's going on... I am simply really puzzled.  ",1,1749057973.0,lineporn,7,1.0,False

I found this sub fascinating. On one hand, the questions repeat themselves, and on the other hand it's a great resource where not to go if you want to avoid too crowded areas. 

Most of the people mention the same parts/towns of the island. Guess what? Theses places are packed, in particular in July and August. 

The thing is, there are plenty of beautiful places where you can still get a 1,5€ coffee, 2€ beer, breakfast incl coffee for around 5€, lunches incl a wine for less than 10€ etc etc. 

The best and easiest approach to find these places is rather simple. Planning to go to your destination? Check google maps what's on the way where you wouldn't have stopped. A small detour will give you a real local experience. 

Please be mindful that you will need to be able speak the basics of Spanish. And even then, locals might tell you the menu in Mallorqui, so you don't understand a word (a written menu won't be available many times, so the staff is just sharing 2-3 options that are available).

Ive been wanting an automatic grinder for a while, tired of hand grinding multiple coffees back to back, ended up splurging (for me) on the sculptor 064s, which arrived today. 


I am having a lot of trouble getting this machine calibrated/dialed in. Been trying grind settings anywhere from 2-3 but can’t find any consistency, and have yet to produce a shot similar to using my j max. Sometimes it’s channeling and gushing, sometimes nothing coming out for ages.  Another thing i noticed is the grounds don’t seem to settle in the basket as well as when hand grinding. The same dosage seems to rise past the top of my basket  a bit. 


Searching this sub I’ve seen others say the  burrs need to be seasoned but it seems crazy that i wouldn’t have a decent shot in a bag of beans.


Looking for any possible advice anyone may have on this machine- been really frustrating to spend so much money and have worse results than on my old setup. 



- bambino
- beans roasted 5/8 , vacuum sealed
- 17-18g in
- yield varies completely right now

- normcore tamper 
- mesh screen on top 
- purge the machine

- nothing about my workflow is any different other than this grinder

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

My background: 1 year as sysadmin (Linux, Windows Server, monitoring, automation), 2 years teaching cybersecurity at university level, currently freelancing doing ISMS implementations and ISO 27001 consulting. Master's in Cybersecurity. I can script, I know my way around networks, I've deployed everything from ELK stacks to Kubernetes clusters.

But apparently none of that matters because:

**""We need someone with 5+ years experience""** \- Dude, I have 4+ years in IT, just not all in the same role. Why does teaching cybersecurity to students not count as experience? Why does implementing security frameworks for actual paying clients not count?

**""You don't have experience with Palo Alto/Fortinet/SonicWall""** \- IT'S A FUCKING FIREWALL. Yes, each vendor has their own special snowflake syntax and GUI, but the concepts are the same. Port 443 is port 443 whether it's pfSense or a $50k Palo Alto. Give me a week with the documentation and I'll be configuring rules like I've been doing it for years.

**""We need someone who knows our exact stack""** \- Cool, so you want a unicorn who has experience with your specific combination of ancient VMware, that one obscure monitoring tool you bought in 2015, and whatever cloud mess you've accumulated over the years.

The worst part? Half these jobs get reposted every month because *surprise* \- that perfect candidate doesn't exist or doesn't want to work for your lowball salary.

**And another thing** \- why the fuck don't internships count as ""real experience""? I spent 3 years doing actual work during internships. Not fetching coffee or making copies - I was troubleshooting servers, implementing security policies, managing infrastructure. But apparently that's ""just internship experience"" and doesn't count toward their magical 5-year requirement.

Meanwhile, every goddamn article and report keeps screaming about the **""cybersecurity skills shortage""** and **""millions of unfilled IT positions.""** You know what would solve that? HIRING THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PROVE THEMSELVES.

Instead, companies want to poach already-established professionals from other companies, creating this stupid musical chairs game where everyone just shuffles around for higher salaries while entry-level candidates get locked out entirely. Then they act shocked when there's a ""talent shortage.""

I've had interviews where I walk them through actual projects I've completed, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, show them my homelab setup, and then get rejected because I haven't used their specific brand of the same damn technology I've been working with for years.

And don't get me started on cybersecurity roles. ""Entry level position, 5 years experience required."" The math doesn't fucking math. How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me to get experience?

I know some of you have been in similar situations. How did you break through this stupid cycle? I'm starting to think I should just lie on my resume about having used every vendor's gear and hope they don't quiz me on CLI commands during the interview.

/rant

**TL;DR:** Job market is stupid, vendors need to stop making the same technology with different commands, and HR departments need to learn the difference between ""nice to have"" and ""absolutely required.""",50,1749057652.0,cscareerquestions,35,0.87,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Is this totally a dumb idea?","33F. 4 years ago, I was unemployed and I was not getting called for an interview anywhere. I had to go back to my parents' place, where I was miserable (treated like a teenager, witnessing fights between my parents every day). I finally got called for a low pay office job in another city and I took the offer.

I moved to this new city and -this had never happened-, I wasn't able to build a community. I am from Spain, I have lived in different locations of the UK and France, and everywhere I moved to, I was eventually able to make friends and feel accepted. Here, in this city in Northern Spain 4 years later, I still haven't been able to. I've been told it's cultural, but people are extremely closed off and I've been told ""you're nice but I already have my group of friends, I don't want to bring anyone new in, sorry"". There is this mentality that if you didn't become a part of the group years ago, you're not becoming one now and risking breaking their dynamics. The point is that I've been alone all this time, but I am quite solitary anyway so I guess it's okay.

At my job, my salary was raised a tiny bit (I have a standard salary, maybe on the lower side). But I have a problem with the people I work with (or rather, they have a problem with me). When I joined the company, we were only 5 people at my office. They were close and some of them knew each other for years. On my very first day, they said they were going out for beers after work. I asked if I could join, they pretty much said no and left. They've been like that ever since. One of them was promoted and became my manager, and she is super mean to me. She's always mocking me, making condescending comments, and at times just insulting. She makes it very clear I'm not welcome with them and doesn't even like when they go on their coffee break and I go on my break too. It's eyerolls and snarky comments again and again.

Here in Spain we have a law that allows people working at a company for +1 year to take 1 month off, unpaid. I asked for this so that I can do a bucketlist trip to Australia that I have been planning to do in November, and they said no because 2 people at the office will be heavily pregnant by then so I can't be gone until they are back (4-5 month leave, after probably December), so this makes me have to stay in this city and job for about another full year. I desperately want to leave this city and job, and I also desperately want to go on this trip. I would use it not just for tourism but I'm going to see as well if I think I would be happy moving and working there. I know I could change jobs, BUT you can't get an unpaid month off if you've been at a company for less than 1 year, and you may not even be given that month (like it happened here). So getting this month in this job meant a lot to me.

I think the only solution for me would be to quit this job and travel, given that I hate it here, and that I want to go to maybe see if I could get a work visa in the future. Otherwise, I would quit and find a different job and try to get the month after working there for a year. But I would be older and I think the time is now.

TLDR: I don't like my job or city, I want to go on a potentially life changing trip but my PTO and unpaid time off requests were declined. Thinking of quitting everything and going and figure my life out when I'm back, or stay here and ask for this time off in over a year, or get another job and try to do it in the future. (I have savings to survive unemployed for about 6 months in case I quit).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Walking into the kitchen to fill his glass with some cold water for the night, he replayed the wonderful Sunday they had in his mind with serene enjoyment. 

Isla had woken him up around 9am with a fresh cup of Peruvian coffee they had acquired on their last big adventure, whisking him delightfully back to the sprawling Andes mountains. After a few sips he joined his wife on the back patio.  The patio was surrounded by luscious greenery and an assortment of beautiful flowers that were now being illuminated by the morning sun.  Isla had always been a light in his darkness, or the sunshine to his flowers, and even with pain in her past, she always awoke with a smile on her face. Sitting on a patio chair she wore a comfortable, loose-fitting, “sleep shirt” (as she had explained to him during one of the first times doing laundry together) that displayed a graphic of the Rocky Mountains that said “Estes Park, CO” in earth tone colors.  Isla had long brunette hair, lovely bright eyes, and a voluptuous chest on a slender but relaxed body that…tended to put a smile on Craig’s face as well.  After some morning musings the caffeine had taken its desired effect, they packed up the car, hoisted the kayaks onto the roof racks and made their way to the lake.  It was a perfect 78-degree day, with a slight breeze and kayaking made them feel free. Stopping at a lone beach for lunch in the middle of their day gave them enough energy to continue the paddle under the calming blue sky.  Eventually, they grew weary and loaded everything back into (onto) the car and began discussing what they thought sounded tasty for dinner. After much debate, a mutual agreement was met and they landed on Mexican food, as it did most of the time. This lovely Sunday continued at their favorite Mexican restaurant ‘Puebla con Amor’ and with a night cap of some TV drama, we now return to Craig at the sink topping off his glass of water.

Continuing his nightly routine, Craig arranged his items on his nightstand and slid into bed next to his wife, who, at the moment, was giggling at a video of a kitten screaming for its food on her phone.  Being that the weekend was winding down, only one thing could put a cherry on top of this pie before the dreaded work week. Craig snuggled in close to his wife, caressing her smooth arms and legs while he began softly kissing at the side of her neck. Accepting these loving advancements, Isla began to moan lightly while she slipped her hand gently down the front of her husband's boxers. Once both were satisfied after a round of sensual lovemaking, the sands of sleep began cascading into their eyelids and a perfect weekend had ended…or so they had hoped.

 Two hours after the feelings of ‘sex with a loved one’ lulled them into a deep sleep, a loud shatter of glass, accompanied by a massive thump like someone had dropped a bowling ball onto concrete, awoke them both violently.  Sitting up in a sleepy daze, with his heart racing like an Olympic runner, Craig slipped onto the floor and began desperately reaching for the green case he stored under his side of the bed.  “Honey, what the fuck is going on?” Isla screamed in a panic.  “I don’t know, fuck…fuck…stay in bed”, Craig bellowed with fright while he scrambled to pull the 9mm Beretta out of its case.  All the while the sound of his front door smashing in echoed through what was supposed to be the soothing sounds of their sleep machine. Finally, slamming the loaded magazine into the pistol, he gripped the black metallic handle with a tremor in his fingers. Craig was not what you would call a “gun person,” he had taken this one to the range a few times to get the hang of it, but the handgun was strictly for safety purposes only and he had hoped to never have to use it. Unfortunately, his wish was not granted. With one final splintering smash Craig heard the front door come crashing open with unintelligible shouting that he could not decipher in his adrenaline filled wake up call. 

With one last glance at his frightened wife, he built the final piece of courage to barrel his way out into the hallway, which had a direct line of sight to the front door. As he lunged out of his bedroom Craig saw two men, concealed in dark clothing, entering his home and without hesitation he began pulling the trigger of his pistol. The first bullet whistled past the first intruder's arm, shattering the large pane window facing outward onto the front lawn causing the glass to cascade down like an angry waterfall. As the second bullet exploded out of the pistol a coherent word had finally formed enough to enter his ear drum with excessive force, “POLICE!!”  In a moment that felt like decades, the electricity from his eardrum to his brain slammed into his synapse making him fully aware that he was opening fire on charging police officers. Within those 2 seconds, the next bullet ended up entering the front of the first intruder's throat causing his larynx to come splashing out the back of his neck to mingle with the shattered remains of the bay window.  As the police officer falling backwards Craig barrel-rolled into the kitchen, dropping his gun in the hallway first so it would remain in the sight of the pursuing police officers. “I’M DOWN. I TOSSED THE GUN”, Craig screamed. “I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE POLICE.”  Craig laid face down with his hands behind his head, praying to any god that might listen, he would not end up being executed in his kitchen. The other officer began hollering “Officer down! Put your hands on your fucking head!”  Craig cried with desperation, “MY HANDS OUR ON MY HEAD. PLEASE DON’T SHOOT, MY WIFE IS IN BED, the gun is in the hallway!”  The officer slowly moved into the hallway quickly snatching and moving the gun into the living room. Knowing his body cam was rolling, the remaining officer took a deep breath and told himself to use every restraint he had not to put two into the skull of the offender that lies ahead.  Swiftly, he moved into the kitchen with his gun leading the way and saw the immediate danger had dissipated. The officer saw Craig lying face down with his hands gripped so tightly around the back of his head that his hands were ghostly white.  For a split second the officers trigger finger twitched but with a last minute decision the officer slammed his knee into the small of Craig's back causing him to yelp in pain and began to cuff Craig as he relayed orders to the woman crying in bed. While the officer apprehended Craig and Isla, a third officer stormed into the house but was greeted by the body of one of his co-workers. The injured officer lay flat on his back on a multi-colored throw rug that was slowly being flooded by the crimson liquid pouring out of the back of his neck as the first officer took his final breath. “We have an officer down,” the entering officer shouted into his radio as he began applying pressure to the front of his fallen comrade’s throat.

Shooting a bit long but anyone at or around central want to meet? Wander around or get coffee? 

I know meeting strangers is 50/50 but I’ll explain the dumb thought that preceded this idea…

I feel as though, as much as I’ve got good friends and all, it’s like we grew up on opposing worlds, we’re from different places and occupy divergently differing worlds. For all our likes and commonalities, our fear is different, our pain is different, our worst and best moments, our concepts and common reference points all differ not by gradation but by extremity of degree.

It’s just I’m tired of noticing that lack of sameness, that slight of-kilter disharmony that underwrites every conversation, that’s so ever-present somewhere in my periphery.

I guess I just want normal. Normal conversation - with normal people - who scan and read as normal. And normal being relative and all, my normal is traumatised, my normal is hurt, my normal is struggling and fighting to survive, my normal is different from normal.

So that’s how I came up with the idea.

I’m 24 btw, feel like a hundred and four on the inside mind, but still.

No commitment or anything, I’m just bored and my ADHD likes novelty so feel free to DM me if u like :)

## Key Features Analysis

The best car cup holder inserts offer a combination of adaptability,stability,and durability.A deep dive into their features reveals the technologies and materials that differentiate the top contenders.

**Adjustable Base Diameter:** Many inserts feature an adjustable base that expands or contracts to fit snugly into the existing car cup holder.

This adjustability is crucial for compatibility across diffrent vehicle models, as cup holder sizes vary considerably. A well-designed adjustable base will utilize a robust mechanism, such as expandable rubber or rotating fins, to ensure a secure and vibration-free fit. Look for inserts that specify the range of base diameters they can accommodate, covering the common sizes found in different car models.

**Universal Compatibility:** The term ""universal compatibility"" can be misleading, but the best inserts strive to accommodate a wide range of drinkware sizes.

This involves not only the diameter of the beverage container but also its height and shape. Some inserts include flexible silicone petals or adjustable clamps that conform to the contours of the container, providing a secure grip.A truly universal insert should be able to hold everything from standard soda cans to large insulated mugs without tipping or wobbling.

**High-Quality Materials:** The durability and longevity of a car cup holder insert depend heavily on the materials used in its construction.

Look for inserts made from high-quality ABS plastic or stainless steel, which offer excellent resistance to heat, impacts, and wear and tear. Rubberized or silicone grips are also crucial for preventing slippage and protecting the finish of your drinkware.The materials should be non-toxic and odorless, especially in environments with high temperatures.

**Spill-Proof Design:** One of the primary purposes of a cup holder insert is to prevent spills, and the best models incorporate features that minimize this risk.

This may include a raised lip around the top edge to contain minor overflows, as well as a tapered or contoured design that centers the beverage container and minimizes the impact of sudden stops or turns. Some inserts also feature drainage holes to allow excess liquid to escape, preventing it from accumulating in the cup holder.

**Easy to Clean:** Car cup holder inserts are prone to accumulating dirt, dust, and spilled liquids, making them essential to clean regularly.

Inserts made from smooth, non-porous materials like ABS plastic or stainless steel are easier to wipe down and sanitize. Some models are even dishwasher-safe, providing the most convenient cleaning option. Look for inserts with minimal crevices or hard-to-reach areas, which can trap debris and make cleaning more challenging.

Key features of a good car cup holder insert:

* Adjustable base for universal fit
* Durable, heat-resistant materials
* Spill-proof design
* Easy to clean construction

## Core Benefits

Car cup holder inserts offer several practical benefits that significantly enhance the driving experience. These benefits go beyond simply holding a drink; they contribute to safety, convenience, and overall vehicle organization.

**enhanced Stability:** By securely holding beverage containers in place, car cup holder inserts prevent spills and distractions while driving.

This is particularly important when navigating sharp turns, sudden stops, or uneven road surfaces. A stable cup holder reduces the risk of hot liquids splashing onto the driver or the vehicle's interior, minimizing potential injuries and damage. the stability also prevents the container from rattling or clanking, reducing noise distractions that can impair focus.

**Increased Versatility:** Car cup holder inserts accommodate a wider range of drinkware sizes and shapes then standard cup holders.

This increased versatility allows drivers to use their favorite travel mugs, water bottles, and other beverage containers without worrying about them fitting properly. The inserts can also be used to hold other small items, such as smartphones, pens, or even snacks, providing a convenient and organized storage solution.

**Improved Vehicle Organization:** A well-designed cup holder insert helps to keep the vehicle's interior tidy and organized.By providing a designated space for drinks and other small items, the insert prevents clutter and reduces the risk of items rolling around the car. This not only improves the overall aesthetic of the vehicle but also makes it easier to find and access essential items while driving.

**Enhanced Safety:** By minimizing distractions and preventing spills, car cup holder inserts contribute to a safer driving environment.

A driver who is not constantly worried about their drink tipping over is better able to focus on the road and react quickly to potential hazards. This can be especially beneficial on long drives or in heavy traffic, where even a momentary lapse in attention can have serious consequences.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have specific questions regarding compatibility, installation ease, and warranty details. Addressing these concerns directly can build confidence in the product and encourage informed decision-making.

**Will this car cup holder insert fit in my car?**
Most adjustable car cup holder inserts are designed for universal fit, meaning they can adjust to a range of cup holder sizes. Measure the diameter of your car's current cup holder and compare it to the specified range of the insert you're considering.A good insert will clearly state the minimum and maximum diameters it can accommodate.

**Is the installation process complex?**
The installation process is generally straightforward. Most inserts simply slide into the existing cup holder. Adjustable models may require you to tighten or expand the base untill it fits snugly. The product usually has a simple twist or turn mechanism that secures the fit.

**What is the insert made of and is it durable?**
Quality inserts typically use ABS plastic, stainless steel, or a combination of both. ABS plastic is lightweight and resistant to impact and heat, making it a reliable choice for car environments.

I'm unmedicated in my mid forties. Not properly diagnosed, the psychiatrists where I went did a screening and said I'm showing traits of autism and Adhd, but because I have PTSD they said it'd be a long road to untangle. And honestly I can't with these sessions anymore. Been in therapy for a decade and now I'm at a place where I've found my ways to deal, so I don't have spoons for that. 

Anyway, my question is about coffee. I started drinking coffee in my early twenties. It had the most lovely effect for me so I immediately got addicted and I'm not proper human before the first cup in the morning. 

Before coffee it feels like my brain is one of those tunnels with echo in them - everything is so loud and fuzzy and clanking around I can hardly hear my inner narrator. I can't think, remember what I'm doing, it takes an effort to measure out the coffee correctly. Anyone even look at me I'm overstimulated and want to scream. Every sound is a thunder rattling my bones. 

Then, one sip of coffee and everything smoothes out. A couple more and I can think, string together sentences. The usual stuff in my brain falls into place, the song starts up somewhere in the back right, reminders in the back left, observing what I'm doing (often narrated) in the front, and some inner monologue sets off. Calm, peaceful by my standards. I'm normal again. 

I can drink coffee in the evening too, it makes me calm when I'm stressed after the day. It's like getting focus again, but relaxing, making it easier to sleep too. 

My question is: Does anyone else experience this? Is coffee some sort of self medication when you have Adhd?

I want to run some outlets, lights, a couple fans, and a water pump and feed them from the battery. There are kits easily under $1k. Panels are super cheap. The battery is the biggest expense. It would be nice to be able to run a coffee maker or microwave occasionally too. Ive always got the generator handy too which can run things and also charge the battery in a pinch.

  
So for example a coffee maker needs 800w. Does that mean I need an inverter that can produce at least that? And this kit with a 300w inverter wont cut it?

It was less than two weeks ago that we hit 600. Our growth rate has sped up and I'm not complaining.

Thank you all once again for being here! I love my transgender community and I'm dedicated to bringing you information, news, and the occasional smile. Admittedly, there is not a lot to smile about regarding the news, but I still try to find the silver among the dross.

And let me once again make my plea for more participation from YOU. I try to keep things moving along here by posting as much as possible, but I'd much prefer to here from the rest of you. This is a community, a small, marginalized, but tight community. We have many shared interests and concerns and I hope some of you will step up and share your perspectives and stories.

Since the nice weather is finally here in Michigan, I hope to start meeting up with some of you for coffee and lunch again. Since forming this sub in June 2024, I've met quite a few of you and made some lasting friendships.

Reach out to me via a DM if you'd like to meet sometime. I live in Ann Arbor, but I'm mobile--within reason.

In March 2020, India announced a nationwide lockdown starting March 25, 2020, for 21 days, though the user specifies March 20 for one month, which we’ll follow for the story’s fictional context ([COVID-19 Lockdown in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_India)). Neha, a modern, playful woman, and Ganesh, a shy, kind teenager, lived in a 1 BHK apartment in Kandivali, Mumbai, typically 400–600 sq ft with a living room, kitchenette, bedroom, and bathroom ([1 BHK Flats for Rent in Mumbai](https://www.magicbricks.com/1-bhk-flats-for-rent-in-mumbai-pppfr)). Their parents’ absence and mothers’ friendship led to their cohabitation, setting the stage for an evolving relationship.

# Evolution of Attraction

Initially, Neha saw Ganesh as a brother, but their close quarters during the lockdown sparked emotional and physical attraction. Neha’s teasing and Ganesh’s reserved responses built tension over 14 days, culminating in an intimate encounter on day 15. Their relationship then deepened into a passionate romance.

# Cultural Context

Living together as unmarried adults in India might raise eyebrows, but the lockdown’s unique circumstances and parental approval made it plausible. Mumbai’s apartment culture fosters close neighborly bonds, supporting their growing connection ([1 BHK Flats in Mumbai](https://www.squareyards.com/sale/1-bhk-for-sale-in-mumbai)).

# Day 1: The Arrival (600 words)

Neha Singh, a 25-year-old from Bihar, stood at the door of Ganesh’s 1 BHK apartment in Kandivali, Mumbai, on March 20, 2020, clutching a suitcase. The lockdown announcement had left them stranded—her parents in Bihar, his out of town. Their mothers, close friends, agreed Neha should stay with 18-year-old Ganesh for safety. The apartment, a cozy 500 sq ft with a small living room, kitchenette, bedroom, and bathroom, felt intimate as Neha stepped inside. “Thanks for having me, Ganesh,” she said, her voice warm. Ganesh, muscular and brown-skinned, smiled shyly. “No problem, Neha di. You take the bedroom; I’ll take the couch.”

They settled in, the hum of Mumbai’s usually bustling streets now eerily quiet. Neha, in a flowy kurti, unpacked while Ganesh tidied the living room. “Let’s cook dinner,” she suggested, her playful energy infectious. In the kitchenette, they prepared dal and rice, the aroma filling the space. Neha watched Ganesh chop onions with precision. “You’re quite the chef,” she teased, leaning close, her perfume subtle but intoxicating. “You look so handsome when you’re focused.” Ganesh blushed, his heart skipping. “Thanks, Neha di. Just something I learned from Ma.” Her lingering gaze made him wonder if her teasing held more than sisterly affection.

Over dinner, they sat on the couch, the TV droning lockdown news. “This is so weird,” Neha said, tucking her hair behind her ear. “No work, no going out. Just us.” Ganesh nodded, stealing glances at her. Her 5’6” frame, 35-26-34 curves, and modern vibe were hard to ignore, though he tried to see her as a sister. “What’ll we do for a month?” he asked. Neha grinned, her eyes sparkling. “Oh, we’ll make it fun. Games, movies, maybe I’ll teach you some Bihari recipes.” Her foot brushed his under the table, accidental yet electric. Ganesh shifted, unsure of the flutter in his chest.

As night fell, they talked about their lives. Neha shared stories of her childhood in Patna, her dreams of a Mumbai career. “I always wanted adventure,” she said, her voice soft. Ganesh opened up about his engineering aspirations, his shy nature around girls. “You’re easy to talk to,” he admitted, meeting her gaze. Neha’s smile was warm, almost suggestive. “Good. We’ve got plenty of time to get closer.” The word “closer” hung in the air, stirring something in Ganesh. They said goodnight, Neha’s silhouette disappearing into the bedroom. Lying on the couch, Ganesh couldn’t shake the image of her smile, the first spark of something new igniting in the quiet of the lockdown night.

# Day 2: Movie Night Sparks (600 words)

The second day dawned warm, Mumbai’s March heat seeping into the apartment. Neha emerged in a loose nightgown, its fabric clinging to her curves. “Morning, sleepyhead,” she teased, ruffling Ganesh’s hair as he woke on the couch. His cheeks flushed at her touch. “I made aloo paratha,” she said, setting plates on the small dining table. Over breakfast, they planned their day. “Let’s watch a movie tonight,” Neha suggested. “Something romantic to lighten the mood.” Ganesh agreed, his mind already wandering to her playful demeanor.

They spent the day tidying the flat, Neha’s clumsy moments—like dropping a spoon—prompting laughter. “You’re hopeless,” Ganesh chuckled, picking it up. “Only around cute guys,” she winked, making his heart race. That evening, they settled on the couch with *Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani*. Neha, in a tank top and shorts, snuggled under a blanket, her thigh brushing Ganesh’s. “This is cozy,” she murmured during a romantic scene, her head resting on his shoulder. Her perfume enveloped him, stirring unfamiliar warmth. “Yeah,” he managed, his voice tight.

As the movie’s leads kissed, Neha sighed, “I want a love like that.” Ganesh’s pulse quickened, her closeness overwhelming. “You’ll find it,” he said softly. She turned, her face inches from his. “Maybe I already have,” she whispered, her breath warm. Ganesh froze, torn between his brotherly view and the heat in her eyes. The moment passed, but the tension lingered. “You’re too sweet,” she said, squeezing his arm before heading to bed, leaving Ganesh restless, her touch etched in his mind.

# Day 3: Yoga on the Balcony (600 words)

Neha suggested morning yoga on the balcony to stay active. She wore tight leggings and a sports bra, her 35-26-34 figure accentuated. Ganesh, in a t-shirt and shorts, tried to focus on the poses. “Follow my lead,” Neha said, stretching gracefully. Her movements were fluid, and Ganesh couldn’t help but stare. “Eyes on your mat,” she teased, catching him. “Sorry,” he mumbled, blushing. Her playful smile made his stomach flip.

They moved through sun salutations, Neha guiding his posture. “Relax your shoulders,” she said, her hands adjusting his arms, her touch lingering. The balcony overlooked a quiet Kandivali street, birds chirping in the lockdown calm. “This is nice,” Neha said, her voice soft. “Just us, no distractions.” Ganesh nodded, her proximity making his heart pound. During a forward bend, her hip brushed his, sending a jolt through him. “Oops,” she giggled, her eyes mischievous. “You’re distracting me,” he admitted. “Good,” she replied, winking.

After yoga, they sipped chai, discussing the lockdown’s impact. “It’s scary, but I’m glad I’m here with you,” Neha said, her foot nudging his. Ganesh smiled, feeling a shift in their dynamic. Her teasing was no longer just playful—it carried a seductive edge, and he was starting to respond.

# Day 4: Shirt Seduction (600 words)

Neha spilled juice on her top while making breakfast. “Oops, gotta change,” she said, returning in Ganesh’s oversized t-shirt, her legs bare. “Hope you don’t mind,” she grinned, twirling. The shirt outlined her curves, and Ganesh’s jaw dropped. “It looks… good,” he stammered. “Better on me than you,” she teased, leaning close to pour coffee, her scent intoxicating. His body reacted, and he shifted to hide it.

They cleaned the flat, Neha bending to dust, the shirt riding up. Ganesh averted his eyes, but she caught him. “Like the view?” she asked, smirking. “Neha!” he protested, flustered. “Just checking,” she laughed, brushing his arm. The touch sent shivers down his spine. That evening, they cooked pav bhaji, Neha’s playful bumps against him deliberate. “You’re so serious,” she said, poking his side. “Loosen up.” Ganesh grabbed her hand, holding it a moment too long. “You’re trouble,” he said, his voice low. Her eyes sparkled. “The best kind.”

# Day 5: Truth or Dare (600 words)

Bored, Neha suggested truth or dare. “Dare,” Ganesh said, nervous but excited. “Kiss my cheek,” Neha challenged, her tone playful. Ganesh hesitated, then leaned in, his lips brushing her soft skin. “Nice,” she purred, her eyes locked on his. “My turn. Truth.” Ganesh asked, “Ever had a crush on someone you shouldn’t?” Neha smirked, “Maybe I do now.” His heart raced. “Your turn,” she said. “Dare.” She grinned, “Dance with me.”

They played “Tum Hi Ho,” Neha pulling him close. Her body pressed against his, her hands on his shoulders. “You’re not bad,” she whispered, her lips near his ear. Ganesh’s hands rested on her waist, the music fading as their eyes met. “You’re making this hard,” he said. “Good,” she replied, her voice sultry. They stopped short of a kiss, the tension palpable as they parted for the night.

# Day 6: Power Cut Intimacy (600 words)

A power cut plunged the flat into darkness. Neha, feigning fear, clung to Ganesh. “Hold me,” she whispered, her voice playful. He wrapped his arms around her, her warmth seeping through his shirt. They lit candles, sitting close on the couch. “Tell me a secret,” Neha said. Ganesh admitted, “I’m starting to see you differently.” Her eyes softened. “Good. I don’t feel like your sister anymore.” Her hand rested on his thigh, sending a jolt through him. They shared stories, her touch lingering, the darkness amplifying their connection.

# Day 7: Emotional Bond (600 words)

Over dinner, Neha opened up about her small-town insecurities. “I always felt out of place in Mumbai,” she said. Ganesh touched her hand. “You’re amazing, Neha.” She smiled, “You make me feel special.” He shared his fear of failing in engineering. “You’ll do great,” she encouraged, her foot brushing his. Their emotional connection deepened, her gaze holding a promise of more. “I’m glad we’re here together,” she said, squeezing his hand, the air heavy with unspoken desire.

# Day 8: Sensual Massage (600 words)

Ganesh complained of back pain from the couch. “Let me help,” Neha offered, her hands kneading his bare shoulders. “Such strong muscles,” she murmured, her fingers lingering. Ganesh’s skin tingled, his breath uneven. “You’re too good at this,” he said. She leaned close, her breath on his neck. “I can be good at other things,” she teased. The air crackled, their physical awareness undeniable, but they stopped short, both aware of the growing tension.

# Day 9: Intimate Dance (600 words)

They danced to a slow song, Neha’s hands roaming Ganesh’s back. “I like being this close,” she breathed, her body pressed against his. Ganesh held her tighter, his resolve weakening. “You’re trouble,” he whispered. “The best kind,” she replied, their faces inches apart. The urge to kiss was strong, but they pulled back, hearts pounding, knowing they were on the brink of something more.

# Day 10: Lap Incident (600 words)

Watching *Jab We Met*, Neha complained, “This couch is tiny.” Playfully, she sat on Ganesh’s lap. “Better?” she asked, wriggling. Ganesh’s body reacted, and she felt it. “Someone’s excited,” she whispered, pressing against him. “Neha, please,” he groaned, torn between embarrassment and desire. “I like it,” she said, her hand caressing his cheek. They kissed, soft at first, then passionate, stopping when the movie’s volume spiked, leaving them breathless and wanting more.

# Day 11: Caught in the Act (600 words)

Ganesh, restless after the lap incident, took a shower, his thoughts on Neha. Unable to resist, he began touching himself, eyes closed. Neha, needing the bathroom, knocked but heard no reply. She entered, freezing at the sight. “Oh,” she gasped, then smiled. “Thinking of me?” Ganesh, mortified, stammered, “I’m sorry.” She stepped closer, her dress wet from the spray. “Let me help,” she whispered, her hand replacing his. Ganesh gasped, her touch electric. “Neha,” he moaned, reaching his peak. They kissed, the shower steaming around them, stopping short of more.

# Day 12: Almost Kiss (600 words)

The next day, they were awkward but open. Over lunch, Neha said, “I liked yesterday.” Ganesh nodded, “Me too.” They spent the day touching more, her hand brushing his, his arm around her. That evening, they kissed passionately on the couch, hands exploring. “I want you,” Neha whispered. Before they could go further, Ganesh’s phone rang—his mother on video call. They scrambled to act normal, frustration mounting as they chatted, the interruption heightening their longing.

# Day 13: Confession (600 words)

They cooked a candlelit dinner, Neha in a red dress. “I’m falling for you,” she confessed. Ganesh took her hand, “I love you, Neha.” They kissed, hands roaming, but agreed to wait. “Tomorrow,” Neha promised, her eyes burning. They slept in the same bed, bodies pressed close, the anticipation unbearable, knowing day 15 would change everything.

# Day 14: Holding Back (600 words)

They spent the day cuddling, discussing their future. “I want us to be real,” Ganesh said. Neha nodded, “We will be.” Their touches were electric, kisses deeper. That night, in bed, they nearly gave in, but Neha whispered, “Let’s make tomorrow special.” They held each other, the tension at its peak, ready for their union.

# Day 15: The Culmination (700 words)

On day 15, the air was thick with desire. Neha wore a sundress, her curves irresistible. Over breakfast, their hands brushed, lingering. “You’re staring,” she teased. “Can’t help it,” Ganesh replied, his voice low. They lay on the bed, Neha’s head on his chest. “This feels too good,” she murmured. “Dangerously good,” he agreed, his arm tightening.

That evening, watching TV, Neha turned to him. “I can’t wait anymore,” she said, kissing him fiercely. Ganesh pulled her close, their kisses hungry. “I love you,” he gasped. “I love you too,” she replied, her hands tugging at his shirt. They stumbled to the bedroom, clothes falling away. Neha’s lacy lingerie made Ganesh’s breath catch. “You’re beautiful,” he whispered, kissing her neck. Her fingers traced his muscles, “So are you.”

They explored each other, tentative at first, then bold. Neha guided him, her moans encouraging. “Don’t stop,” she whispered as they moved together, their bodies syncing in a passionate rhythm. Their climax was intense, a release of weeks of longing. They collapsed, tangled in each other’s arms, breathless. “That was incredible,” Neha said, tracing his chest. “I want you forever,” Ganesh replied, kissing her forehead. They spent the day in bed, alternating between lovemaking and tender talks, their bond sealed.

# Post-Day 15: A Passionate Bond

Their relationship became a fiery romance. Mornings began with slow, sensual touches, escalating to passionate lovemaking. Showers turned steamy, water mingling with their gasps. Emotionally, they grew closer, sharing dreams and fears. Neha admitted her insecurities; Ganesh his career doubts. They cooked, danced, and gardened, their flat a haven of love. When the lockdown ended, their parents approved, delighted by their bond. What began as necessity became a lifelong romance.

**Ingredients:**

• 12 oz 1% milk

• 2 scoops vanilla protein powder (60g). I always use [Metabolic Drive](https://go.biotest.net/MDatAmazon). 

• 1-3 teaspoons of decaf instant coffee (to taste)

• 1 tablespoon half-and-half or coffee creamer

**Directions:**

1. Whisk everything together except the half-and-half or creamer. The instant coffee won't fully dissolve in cold milk, and it may separate before it freezes, but that's okay. The machine takes care of it later. Freeze overnight.

2. Spin on the lite setting.

3. Dig a little hole in the top of the ice cream (which will look a little grainy at this point – see pic in comments). Add your half-and-half or whatever coffee creamer you like. Also a good time to add cinnamon if that's your thing.

4. Re-spin and enjoy.

**Notes:**

• I went with decaf since I eat my ice cream at night, but you do you.

• Espresso powder works too.

• I added shaved 100% baking chocolate to the top for a bittersweet punch. (Dark chocolate is a great [mood booster](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1ktoziq/triple_chocolate_16oz_high_protein/).)

• Play around with the amount of instant coffee to get the flavor you like.

• You'll get about 56 grams of protein from this one (whole pint).

1. I am interested in the Drew Estate Java Mint Latte, but notice it has a darker color wrapper. I have seen mostly light Connecticut wrapped cigars recommended for new people. Would this cigar be too strong for me? I don't currently use any nicotine products.

2. I also hear the cigar is infused with coffee? Does smoking coffee in a cigar change the feeling it gives?

3. I don't eat sugar because of some reactive hypoglycemia. Do you think I should keep sugar on hand anyways incase of nic sickness? Or should this pre-diabetes reaction keep me from using nicotine in any form? 

4. I am mildly allergic to Chocolate. Are there any cigars I need to avoid? I know infused cigars exist, but didn't know if actual cocoa is used.

1l3as8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1l3as8p/increase_concentratio_shorter_ration_vs_finer/,Increase concentratio - shorter ration vs finer grind,"So my first two batches at 1:8, 25 grind on Shardor grinder, came out perfect for an 1:1 concentrate. Now I use the same ratio and it's less concentrated, good for 2 coffee:1 water/oatmilk dilution, which makes the batch go very quickly. Nothing measurable changed - I thought it was about changing from bottled water to boiled water but the problem persists with bottled water.

So I want to bring the 1:1 dilutable concentrate back and now I have two options: a shorter ratio (like 1:6) or a finer grind (like 23).

I would prefer to try a finer grind, because this saves coffee and lets me have more concentrate out from the batch (as more grinds would pull more water into the ""mud""). But this seems to go against what people normally do for cold brew. What are the pitfalls with a finer grind and/or the reasons to go for a shorter ratio instead?

(I still do it in a French press with paper filtering beacuse I like the clean taste. I now understand clogging is unavoidable, I ended up changing fillters mid-filtering then hust discarding the last 50-70 ml which never goes through the filter)

https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1kmodhr/minimalism_as_rebirth_letting_go_of_99_of_what_i/

And thought it was time for a little update.
Officially day 3 homeless, but on my way to the mountains to help a guy restore an old house from the 1800s and thus get some carpenter trainee knowledge for when I take over the new flat. The landlord has been very busy and hadn’t prepared a contract for me, but it also gave me time to think if I really want this, or if I want to travel etc.
My heart is telling me to go to Nepal this summer and meditate in a monastery in the mountains, and then hopefully after go to Thailand and do Thai boxing or BJJ training to get my body and mind in a different shape.

So everything I own now fits into a 3m² storage unit. I’ve been sleeping in the forest near a lake the last two days, which unfortunately have been cold and rainy, despite it being summer season in my country of origin. But while setting up the tent one night, I was visited by a mother duck and her babies looking for food, and it just blessed the fuck out of my heart and my soul.

But I’m happy to go to the mountains now and have a warm bed, food, and physical labor to attend to, and I get to snowboard in summer clothes and skateboard. Then I will travel around the rest of June and come back and take over the apartment from July and start working on it from scratch.

When I started decluttering I realized that this was like a purge. Something deep, deep down had to go. Letting go of projections and ideas and filters people had given me and tried to put on me, and versions of my self that I had tried to be to people please.

I don’t care if you think it’s woo-woo or not, but my experience is that everything has energy or a vibration. And if people give you something, there could be an energetic intention behind said object that could bring good luck or bad fortune into your life, etc.

Well, I got rid of so many objects from toxic friends and partners, and so many of them reached out when I had gotten rid of the belongings attached to them, almost as if they could sense their anchor was lost and desperately trying to reattach.

I also had a couple of rounds with myself giving away some of my old signature outfits, this was hard. So I would dress up and do some photos, but now I don’t actually miss them at all. I would dress in black clothes and a black bomber jacket and look like probably something straight outta Berlin. I kept only one T-shirt, two jeans, a thin wool sweater, and a huge big-ass fur coat that I slept in for a while since I got rid of my bed, my mattress, and only had a thin sleeping bag on the floor.

I also sold my electric guitar that I got when I was 16. I sold it to a father and his 14-year-old alternative daughter, so I was very happy to see it pass on to “someone like me,” and I could see the “shock/horror” in the dad’s eyes as he bought the guitar from a woman with a shaved head and a nose ring. Lol… “hope my daughter doesn’t turn into that”…

Also, the more I let go of stuff, the freer I felt and my dreams seemed to shift and become more and more conscious. Like the more I let go of, the more I was able to find myself again. My frequency, my identity, my taste and my flavour. I’m back baby!

I also lost my bank card in this period and could only survive on the cash from selling my stuff, looking back this was a blessing and a huge learning opportunity. And when I regained my card and suddenly had access to my bank account, something in me wanted to start shopping and spending again… hoarding. Wanting to have the ego clothes and look cool again etc etc. But I’m now extremely mindful of what I buy. If it’s meant to be, it will find me.

I had just sold my blender for $120 and something pulled me to go to this café and get a coffee, and leaving the café I passed this Carhartt store that I love to look at. They always have clothes on sale, but only men’s clothes, but this time there was a nice white and black plaid shirt in super quality. So I checked it out and it’s a women’s small on 50% off, so I got it, and it’s one of my new signature items. Things like this happen when I’m open. What I need finds me, not necessarily what looks cool and impressive and gives off this vibe I used to want to have… but it looks real, authentic and have a function. 

Also, there were a few mistakes made during the decluttering. I sold two paintings I should have kept. There was so much miscommunication and back and forth with the lady picking them up, and just something wrong energetically, and I realized when I gave them away that I should have sold them, and that they were still meant to be with me. It felt like I was getting sick everytime I tried to let go of something I was ment to keep.
I had a similar feeling and vibe almost selling my fur coat and a Belgian waffle iron, so I kept them, and the feeling faded immediately.

I also had this old teak cabinet that was from an era of living with an abusive guy and dating an abusive woman. And I realized I needed to just get it out without selling it, even tho it was worth a little cash money, i just had to get rid of it pronto. Just touching it gave me bad vibes…
And for some reason I knew it wasn’t going to be easy to get it out. So when I picked it up and carried it to the elevator, the elevator I had just taken it up and down 5 minutes earlier, was ofc stuck between two floors and needed service. I live on the fifth floor, so I was like okay, well I guess I’ll just have to carry it all the way down, and so I do. Then there is this huge container for flammable objects that is usually locked, but today it’s open, so I toss it in and felt this huge relief.

I also smashed a wooden guitar my ex gave me. Cathartic. (It was an $80 guitar.)

I also did a five-day water fast while decluttering my last items. And I went through 99% of my items and really felt and connected with them.
Does it bring me joy? Do I need it? Does it keep me stagnant? Etc.
I would usually get a thought like “hmm, should I get rid of this?” and that’s when I knew – it had to go. Lol.
Everything I was sure of, I never really questioned. But I ended up with things I never thought I’d end up with. They were like old movie stars fading in the back, replaced by new fancy young stars who looked fresh but didn’t really shine or do the movie justice. (Empty facades.)

So in decluttering, I have let go of clothes, objects, people, beliefs, identities etc.
And looking forward to live a more free-flowing life doing what I actually want to do, because life is short and precious.

tl;dr: we’ve been dating for two years, much of which she spent emotionally cheating on me with two people. she got on meds and is now better than ever but I am still reeling and I haven’t gotten over it, and it severely bothers me on a daily basis. can I cope or would it be best if I just leave?

My girlfriend [24F] did lots of bad things which I ended up trying to forgive because of her mental illness. We’ve been dating since June of 2023. 

Twice, she emotionally cheated on me. The first was with someone she used to fuck before we met, John, but who ghosted her and left her hurt. Her rationale for this was that she didn’t understand why he “came back.” It became an obsession that I just had to live with because no amount of protesting fixed it. She never met up with him but she’d go out of her way to flirt with him over text - and being a “witchy type” believed that he was stalking her. He streamed on Twitch. So naturally, she stalked him and drove to his house on a couple of occasions to see what car he drove. That ended after six months of begging because of particularly bad temper flare-up on my part. 

The second time, someone came into her job at Starbucks who worked at the adjacent barbershop. Moe is a married man who “had the ability to make her feel beautiful, even when she was at her worst” (covered in coffee at Starbucks. 

I found out about Moe while she joined me on vacation with my family. She was waiting for an important call while she showered and asked me to mind her cell phone. I did, and she got a text from him. Spare me the moral discussion and outrage of doing this, but I read the messages, and the entire night prior, and for days leading up to her joining my family on vacation, she was having very clear “getting to know someone you want to fuck” conversation with Moe, including telling him that she was going on vacation with *her* family, lying about being in a relationship (birds of a feather on that count). I sent her the 2.5 hrs home. Nothing physical happened in this instance either. It only came out he was married when his wife contacted her about 6 weeks later, when she found about his indiscretion. 

This was January - August of 24. In this time period, I was taking a gap year between grad school and law school, dealing with family bereavement stuff and working. Now I’m done with my first year. I basically spent all my free time with her. This was not a matter of neglect on my part. I enjoyed the good times, which there were, but these incidents existed as a horrible mental slog for me. It genuinely kept me up at night. To this day, being in her bedroom is a claustrophobic, anxiety inducing experience because of the things I had to grapple with - and the sleepless nights I had thinking about these things - within it. 

In the time between August 24 and today, a lot still has happened. We came to blows (mostly emotionally, but she got physical with me on one occasion) numerous times, basically starting in Oct/Nov and ending around March. The cheating stopped because, I assume, she realized being a homewrecker isn’t a good look. Her main justification, for both of them, was concern about reputation - she didn’t want to be deemed the “crazy girl” who can’t remain friends with guys - and my main counter to that was “so to preserve yourself, you let me walk around with the cuckold title!?” 

But basically, in March, something internally within her snapped and after some intervention from a family member of hers she got put on Zoloft. The fighting hasn’t ended but the severity of her anger - at least towards me - has decreased. We had many conversations where we were blunt about this. She apologized, renounced all of it, and blocked anyone she was previously contacting. She is loving and doting towards me and only me in the way I always wanted and I am too emotionally damaged by her actions now to want or accept it.

I am in therapy now because, on top of working almost constantly, whether it’s on my academics, or getting a job, or working the one I already have, I am still extremely angry about all of this. Almost daily, I have intrusive thoughts that bring me to a complete stop and make me irrationally angry. And yet, the person I’m mad at isn’t really the person that’s in front of me. I’m trying to get past these feelings but I don’t think that I can without ending the relationship or taking a break. I’ve discussed the lingering feelings with her - and her main stance is that she’s upset that the old saying that “time heals all wounds” hasn’t worked here. And her attitude towards our relationship is so positive and forward looking where mine is stuck on her past actions. The bottom line is that I would never spend my life with someone who so routinely and regularly betrayed me. But because she wasn’t betrayed, and those actions are in the past, she doesn’t see that. So I’m just kind of left to seethe on what are basically moot points. AIO

1l3agvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3agvw/the_things_i_learned_while_stuck_in_a_time_loop/,The Things I Learned While Stuck in a Time Loop,"Most of us have seen *Groundhog Day*. Bill Murray gets stuck repeating the same day over and over until he learns to be a better person, charming enough to win over Andie MacDowell’s character. Great movie. What the movie doesn’t really focus on, though, is just *how long* Murray is stuck in that loop. He learns French, piano, and ice sculpting. All of those would take decades to master. You’ve got to admire the dedication, but when you repeat the same day over and over, it’s not like you have anything *better* to do.

I wish I could remember the first few days. The early decades are just noise, static in the back of my skull. If there was a first day, it’s gone now. But I’ll do my best.


I wake up at 7:15 a.m. That was my start time for the next 215 years. I’m supposed to be at a “work” event by 8, about half an hour away, so I’m already rushing. The quickest I’ve ever managed to wake up, get dressed, eat something, and get out the door was 4 minutes and 23 seconds. My drive takes exactly 19 minutes and 50 seconds if I avoid the speeding cameras and cops. On the first day, I wasn’t so quick, took me 15 minutes just to find clean pants. I arrived late, panicked, set up, and started playing.

By “work event,” I mean I was hired to play music at a local weekend market. My income was a bastard mix of Centrelink, odd jobs, and whatever strangers tossed in my guitar case. It’s not like I was rolling in cash. I played shitty covers for three hours, just loud enough to compete with the blender from the smoothie stall across the path. Then I had lunch and a coffee break. I tried every single food stall in existence during the loops, and the only genuinely decent one was a little Mexican joint in the corner of the field. The coffee onsite was garbage, but I found a good café about a five-minute sprint away. By the hundredth loop or so, I’d mastered the timing—I could grab my lunch and a decent long black and be back before my 15-minute break was over.

After that, I played another two hours and packed up. Then the rest of the day was mine. I can’t even remember how I spent it that first time. Maybe I went to the pub, maybe I just went home and doomscrolled. Either way, I’d eventually fall asleep.

Then it reset.

The first time it repeated, I thought it was déjà vu. The second time, I figured I’d just dreamed the previous day. By the fifth loop, I gave up on the market and just… did whatever. There were no consequences. I drank. I stole cars. Broke into people’s homes just to see what they were like inside. I joyrode down highways, ran red lights, did all the things you’d never do unless you were *absolutely* sure you’d get away with it.

And for a while, it was the most fun I’d ever had.

But fun decays. The thrill softens. Eventually, even anarchy becomes routine. So I pivoted. I decided I’d work through every movie I could ever have wanted to. I think I spent 50 years just watching movies. Which is funny, considering I don’t even remember half of them now. It’s not like I could take notes. I tried doing the same with TV shows, music, and books. I binged, absorbed, forgot, and repeated. I tried games too, but that was a mistake. Can’t save your progress when the day resets.

 

Eventually, I started picking up skills. Painting, cooking, writing, anything I could do within a 24-hour timeframe. I got *really* good at latte art for a while, even won a few barista competitions, unofficially, of course. I taught myself to draw photo-realistic portraits. Learned origami. Memorised entire books and then rewrote them with new endings. It wasn’t about meaning. It was about motion. About numbing the clock. Keeping my hands busy so my thoughts didn’t crawl out of my ears.

There’s a lot I wish I could’ve done. Travel. See the world. But even if I could permanently leave the city, I only had about $400 to my name. I once tried walking until I collapsed from exhaustion. Slept on a stranger’s lawn. Woke up in my bed.

The weirdest part? You still get tired. Not physically. Not even mentally in the usual sense. But spiritually. Like your soul starts grinding its teeth. You decay in place. You forget who you are, not all at once, but by attrition. Like your mind is being sanded down by repetition.

I’ve lived so many lifetimes in the same 24 hours, and the one thing I learned above all else is this: time doesn’t heal anything if it doesn’t move forward. You stay stuck. You replay grief, shame, boredom, every unwanted emotion, forever. You can’t evolve. You can’t forget. You just endure. I became an endless, powerless God.

 

I tested the boundaries of the loop. I pulled all-nighters to see if staying awake would let the day progress. It didn’t. As soon as 7:15 a.m. hit, I’d blink and wake up in bed. Still, I made the most of it. Sometimes I’d watch the sunrise just for the hell of it.

I played with influence. Tried saying the right combination of things to the right people. I made it as far as a meeting with the Secretary of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That took—I don’t know—thousands of loops? I delivered rehearsed speeches, memorised policy briefs, and rehearsed my charisma like it was a performance. But it never changed anything. At the end of the day, reset.

 

Eventually, like Murray, I tried to kill myself. Repeatedly. Sometimes dramatically. Sometimes grotesquely. Maybe I’m just a worse person than he was, but I gave up on morality early on. I stepped off overpasses. Drank bleach. Set myself on fire in a church. I hung myself from a traffic light outside my old high school just to see if the janitor would notice.

One time, I walked into a preschool and gutted myself in front of the kids. I remember blacking out with my intestines in my hands, blood pooling around my boots, hearing the shrieks of children still too young to process it. I woke up laughing.

There was this one guy, a stranger, who was just being released from a mental health facility, traumatised from seeing someone die. I spent an entire week killing myself in front of him. Made it worse each time. He didn’t remember, of course. No one ever did. So it’s okay. None of it mattered. Nothing could kill me. Nothing could change the day.

I became a museum of horror curated by my own boredom and withering sense of reality.

 

I began seeing things. At first, it was subtle,  shadows where there should have been none, a flicker of movement at the corner of my eye that vanished the moment I looked directly. Hallways seemed to stretch longer than they should, doorways framing nothing but darkness. Sometimes, reflections in windows or mirrors didn’t quite match my movements, a delayed blink, a smile that lingered too long.

I became convinced that a man was watching me on one of the days. I could feel his gaze like a weight on my back, cold and unyielding. No matter where I went, he was just beyond reach, lurking behind crowds, slipping into shadows.

He never spoke, but his presence was a constant, a slow poison that seeped into my skin. At night, when everything was silent and the world outside my window grew still, I’d lie awake, waiting to see him step through the door. But the door never opened.

Sometimes, I swear the world itself warped around him. The sky darkened a shade too deep, the air thickened, and a low hum thrummed through the walls, like the loop was breathing, watching, waiting. When I slept, voices whispered secrets I couldn’t understand, secrets about time, identity, and consequence.

 

And then, one day, it ended.

Time moved forward.

I don’t know how. It’s not like I did the right things in the right order or became a better person. I didn’t have an epiphany or reach enlightenment. It just... happened.

I stared at those changing numbers on my phone like they were written in ancient script. I hadn’t seen that time in centuries. And it hit me hard. I had no idea who I was anymore. I’d been so many versions of myself, tried on so many personalities, lived so many fragmented lifetimes that I forgot how to be someone. Or at least the person I was before all of this.

I forgot my birthday. I forgot my friends’ names. I had to relearn how to hold a conversation without knowing what the other person would say. How to plan. How to *wait*. How to live when things don’t reset.

 

The final lesson I was given by the loop:  
It’s that you don’t need eternity to become someone better.

You just need time that *hurts*.  
Time that *moves*.

I don’t know who I am anymore. Maybe that’s something I have to find out.

For now, all I can do is wait.

And see what time decides to do next.

1l3aen3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1l3aen3/how_to_approach_new_doctor/,how to approach new doctor,"Hi! I have had hypothyroidism since birth, and for about 10 years I have been trying to get a doctor to tell me why I still have a number of severe symptoms despite ""normal range"" bloodwork. 

I have gained large amounts of weight, nap everywhere, hungry all the time, depressed for no reason, have a level of forgetfulness that causes everyone in my life to bear the burden of reminding me about important appointments or where my fucking stuff is, and one time it mixed with birth control hormones and I swore I had a light psychotic episode where I thought I might need to check myself into a hospital to protect me from myself. 

I wouldn't connect all of this to my thyroid diagnosis, except that I started dosing my own levothyroxine in 2020. I had been on 125mcg, started taking 1.5 pills most days. In a matter of days I suddenly changed completely. I honestly thought napping and being hungry more often than most people and being forgetful were personality quirks- they weren't. I shed 35 lbs in a matter of months and stopped being obese with no other lifestyle changes. I started to fidget occasionally where usually my body feels like a heavy stone that doesn't want to move. I suddenly was able to remember to grab my keys every day- I used to get locked out of my own house probably once a month, all my close friends had spare keys to my apartment for this. I started dosing myself most of the time from then on, except two months before bloodwork I will switch back to my prescribed dose. 

 I've just kind of never had a doctor listen to me instead of my bloodwork, so I always take my prescribed dose 8 weeks before an appointment and tell them I am experiencing severe symptoms again and they always ignore me because my bloodwork is good. My last doctor listened to me and we did a few sessions of incremental increases- I went from 125 to 137 to 150 mcg of levothyroxine, but the process was so brutal on me that I stopped for a while and went back to dosing myself. I was underperforming at work, and I couldn't actually handle the severe depression very well on my own. 48 hours after I took 4 pills I was fully just not depressed anymore and very functional. Fuck. 

I was completely fine and regular on ""1.5 pills most days"" at 150mcg (I weight 155 lbs). I know what hyperthyroid feels like because in the course of modulating my dose in the beginning I have overshot before. Did not have any of those experiences or symptoms on 1.5 pills most days, I truly was just a regular dude. 

Now I've been on 150 mcg daily exactly as prescribed since April 1, because I wanted to try again to get a dose raise and because I am between healthcare systems and have to get a new PCP. I have my first appointment tomorrow. Is there anything I can say to this one, or any bloodwork I should ask for? Any diagnosis I should chase? Any medication i should try? My last PCP doctor resisted referring me to an endo I suspect because the system disincentivized her from wanting to do it. Also I don't know why I have hypo no one has ever looked into the root cause yet. 

My mental state is not great lately- I have no energy, I can feel myself getting less capable (I'm a software engineer and I have a pretty good sense for what problems I can tackle and think about easily, and they are all becoming hard or impossible without help). and I've started losing things again. Every single day I typically cry 2-5 times a day. Also lol I've stopped pooping once a day on schedule. This morning I woke up sobbing and I couldn't tell you what I was sad about at all. I never typically cry when I am dosing myself and I am never sad for no identifiable reason but this has been a growing pattern for about 2 months. I am freaking out, and I don't know how to change this. Hoping someone can tell me what I can say or look into so I can never feel this way again. 

I don't know a ton about T3/T4 because I've just had this since birth and never thought to care about the actual numbers and just had a physician interpret them for me mostly. I want to change that. 


Btw I take it once a day every morning fully fasted, usually 1-2 hours before breakfast or coffee.

It's right by the window, which is perfect for a mix of people-watching and catching a bit of sunlight.

Later, I started to wonder why I got so possessive about a seat that, tbh, nobody actually assigned to me. Turns out, it's a pretty normal human thing. I think it's called the 'endowment effect'—where we start seeing value in stuff just because we use or choose them repeatedly. It's like our brains go, 'Hey, that's ours now!' even if it's not logically true. Might be my comfort zone getting a tad claustrophobic, but I guess it's just how we're wired to feel control over our personal little nooks. 🤷‍♀️",10,1749055078.0,brainBehaves,0,1.0,False

I then return back to Bangkok via Schipol airport on the return leg. For reference I’m a UK passport holder. 

I’ve only ever done this route via CDG once before and my experience wasn’t great. I landed at 8pm and then was told to go through security onto my next gate as my luggage was already being sent through to the next plane, due to take off at 9.20pm. Great, except none of the boards had my flight information on it, finding out where the hell I was even meant to be was a nightmare and a strike of security staff meant massive queues. I almost missed my flight and ended up lucking out only because a storm delayed the departure by 30min. Even then, I had to run. 

Now I’m flying again through CDG again and this time I’m landing at CDG at 7pm for a 9pm onward flight to Newcastle. I’m sort of dreading this part as due to my previous experience, I’m now wondering if this is going to be a repeat of the same thing again. Am I actually going to have enough time with 2hrs between flights? 

Also, on the return leg I fly out to Schipol and land at 8.30pm. My flight onwards isn’t until the next day, at 5.15pm so I’m wondering if it would be easier to simply wait it out in Schipol or if there’s anything worth doing in the late evening and for a single morning in Amsterdam itself before heading back to the airport for that flight in the early afternoon? I seem to recall there’s not a lot to do in Schipol itself that isn’t expensive but at the same time, I was hoping I could sneak in a little coffee shop trip or something.

(A [gallery link](https://postimg.cc/gallery/8THbLh6) because I don’t want a photo that isn’t mine showing up on mobile)

**3 May**: *arrival, Petit Palais, La Madeleine, Musée du Parfum*, *Galeries Lafayette, Palais Garnier Mystery Tour, Passage des Panoramas*

**4 May**: *Orsay Museum, Cluny Museum* (**free first Sunday**!), *Rue Montorgueil*

**5 May**: *Louvre, Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Montmartre*

**6 May**: *Vernon-Giverny (****Monet’s House****)*

Arrived in Vernon ≈ 11AM, and grabbed brunch at [Leo’s Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZHHTB6JdmWi314ncA?g_st=ic) (Mexican). Both the tourist tour “petit train” and the regular bus cost 10€ for a round trip (only price), and since we had so much time (2:30PM slot), we went on the petit train (**cash only**). Don’t forget to look at the return trip schedule!

Bought bad ice cream in the car park when we arrived in **Giverny**, then walked our slowest to **Monet’s Garden**. Took a wrong left (the one spot lacking very obvious Monet signs, as they figured only an imbecile would need it—if you go right you’d be right there) and accidentally went a real long way to where Monet’s buried and had to backtrack a kilometer. The queue was confusing, but they let us in early (14:17) and didn’t ask for proof for the student tickets (bring it, I’m just mentioning).

No water lilies at this time (plenty of gorgeous flowers, though!), and it was packed and only kept getting more crowded (left at 15:45). We would’ve taken even faster if we didn’t lounge on a bench for 15 minutes wondering if the line for the house would get any shorter—it didn’t, and I eventually managed to man up and get in line before said line stretched to epic proportions.

While waiting for the petit train, we went to [Gourmandises de Giverny](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sqBhwtPEAyvwKUqt7?g_st=ic) (good café). Once back in **Vernon**, we walked to [its cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CfRZ2mgZonRX7zJdA?g_st=ic), and I’m glad we did because I loved the stained glass there (sun was shining perfectly, that added to it), one of my favorites. Entered through a small side door that was a bit hidden.

**7 May**: *Sainte-Chapelle, Conciergerie, Bread Festival/Notre Dame exterior, Saint-Séverin Church, Panthéon, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont Church*

**8 May**: *Belgium (Ghent and Brussels)*

Rose early to get to Gare du Nord before 7 (train departed 7:23). It was perplexing getting to the right part of the station. Getting on the train was far simpler—just a ticket scan, no security check—and we were in Brussels 1hr20min from departure. We got waffles in the station (Bruxelles-MIDI, Brussels Zuid and Brussels South stations are all the same thing).

The train to Ghent changed platforms last minute, confusing a horde of tourists, us especially; I learned I should get the **SNCB app** so I could see Belgian train platforms in there (much easier).

We were in **Ghent** by 10AM! Went straight to **Gravensteen** (by Bolt), and despite backtracking because I mistakenly thought I missed something, spent 40 minutes there. Audio guide is free, and we took the non-comedy one (30 minutes, comedy is an hour). I feared I would find the comedy ”cringe” and wanted to save time. The non-comedy one was kinda cringey itself. Overall fun!

[The Candy Corner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FF4znxXVnDjHtKVA8) is close by, and we bought **cuberdons**. The historic city center looks amazing, and it doesn’t take long to see the famous views of the harbor. What *does* take long is [Frituur Tartaar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LJpCb2EHdsyGqPSg8) (super long line, one poor person behind the counter doing everything), which gives gargantuan portions. The four of us didn’t finish the “SMALL (1 BIG EATER)” size. Not my favorite fries.

My sister wanted to try soup here, and found [Soup'r](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RXpQT7YAsJt1hc1Z7) satisfactory. We visited **St. Bavo’s Cathedral** next (didn’t pay to see the altarpiece), and then chilled at [La Dolce Barista](https://dolcebarista.be/), where I got a huge speculoos-flavored pancake!

With the same tickets (time restriction is the **day**), we hopped on the first **Brussels** train I could find; it had loads of stops, and we went past Brussels South, on to Brussels Central Station. Visited Grand Place, oohed and ahhed at the Belgian brand chocolate shops, and chose Mary’s because it said *Since 1919* and had the prettiest packaging (plus an employee told us the history). We used Mannekin Pis, Jeanneke Pis and Het Zinneke as routes to see the city, as all the museums were now closed. Saw a great many smurfs / Tintins all over, to the delight of my father (he loves Tintin. There’s also a dedicated store).

Got drinks and snacks at [Be Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qxL9M569bMWdJ65x8?g_st=ic); the just barista didn’t let a cop skip the line, and so the cop burnt a clean hole through my skull with her stare. My speculoos milkshake was splendiferous!

Not until the trek all the way back to the south station to catch our 19:43 train back to Paris did I learn how Brussels earned its reputation as “dirty”. In the touristy section, I was thinking it cleaner than many. One of my favorite days of the whole trip!

**9 May**: *Fontainebleau*

**Fontainebleau-Avon station** is within Zone 5, so it’s cheap and simple(-ish…) to get there by metro. The station is ≈ **3km from the castle**, so we used Bolt again. Go past the restroom before you enter (I at first thought they were queuing for tickets!), and buy your tickets at a self-service machine. Read the *FINE, FRENCH PRINT*. I made everyone sad because I bought 4 adult tickets in my rush, assuming the part about < 26 year olds was for EU, but nope. **Spent 2-ish hours** in the château and its grounds. Cool, if crowded, and you’re not allowed to backtrack (and will get scolded if you backtracked by accident while lost—getting lost should not be possible by design, but never underestimate my inability to find a door).

To save, I convinced everyone to *walk* back to the station in the heat, finding us an oasis at [Le Club, Coffee Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DnJKysep3zKbbjaU9). Thank god it actually existed (it had 3 reviews on google maps).

**10 May**: *Pierrefonds, Chantilly, Eiffel Tower*

Architecturally non-historic, **Pierrefonds Castle** is my favorite. I just think it’s gorgeous, even if it’s very empty inside. We rented a car and drove there from CDG. Free parking around the castle (literally). Finished the interior in 1hr17min. Dawdled in its courtyard/around it for another 30 mins because I didn’t want to say goodbye, and 'cuz there were less people by 13:21.

[Crêperie D'Aumale](https://maps.app.goo.gl/48JUEX4vSao6nfKXA) (3km from Chantilly Castle) was expensive, but maybe not, considering these were the largest crêpes I had ever seen in my life, and maybe the tastiest. Got my father carbonara spaghetti, and that was also really good! I think it was at least (I was dealing with the parking meter so I didn’t order) 10€ for a crepe/galette, but our carambar crêpe (came with ice cream and the BEST chantilly cream) and saumon galette were gigantic and scrumptious.

We got inside **Chantilly Castle** by 16:30 and finished it in an hour. Very crowded. Going through the gate to get to the courtyard (that closes with the interior) requires a sideways walk up a ramp before you enter the castle itself, and the staff close it earlier. My mom wanted to try more crêpes and chantilly, so she insisted we get tourist trapped at the castle’s Le Capitainerie (small portions for the price, average). ***Tiny*** “no tip” button on the upper right of the screen. After eating, we hung around the grounds, and by the time we were leaving, all staff were gone and plenty of people were entering the gardens without a ticket (there’s a ticket for the gardens, a ticket for castle + gardens, but no ticket for just the castle, and more…).

**11 May**: *Carnavalet Museum, Victor Hugo House*

**12 May**: *Bouillon Julien, National Archives, Galerie Vivienne*

**|** ***ALSACE*** **|** (13-16 May): **Stayed in Colmar,** at *Le Jules* ([it's here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rVxYGdWnKDPE732UA); old (non-derogatory)—faucet broke, everything else was great, super nice owner), booked through booking dot com, **parked** at [Parking Saint-Josse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SToM3iM72zua3k1i7) (3€/day).

**13 May**: *Strasbourg, Ribeauvillé, Wine route, Colmar*

**Strasbourg** (arrived 11:54AM, journey took 1hr47min): got our rental car (all companies right next to the station), and wasted an hour in a parking lot near Petite France; broken machine, and the last out of four apps worked. I actually saw more homeless here than in Paris, and luckily none approached me there—we got approached by beggars a lot in 2-ish hours in Strasbourg (+saw others being approached nonstop). Was recommended [Pâtisserie Christian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8sY9wGK9vQfy3CLi9?g_st=ic), so we went there, right in front of the cathedral!

The cathedral has a dress code (no big backpacks allowed, and you can bring a scarf to cover up). The **astronomical clock** is a highlight, so don’t miss it! It moves a *lot* at 12:30, I assume, because it moved at 15:30, too…

There is an **unexpected elongated coin** machine for Strasbourg/Petite France in front of the cathedral! Also has bill patterns. DOES NOT ACCEPT CARD. I lacked the 2€ coins required so I bought a 4€ magnet from the cathedral gift shop just so I could use the penny press.

Would’ve liked to spend more time here, but parking was flattening my dad’s wallet, so we drove on to **Ribeauvillé**, where there is free parking if you try hard enough. We drove past **Riquewihr** on the wine route; very many tourists, and it was hot, so I didn’t feel like stopping. Only spent 15 minutes taking a gander at Ribeauvillé.

**Colmar**: everything was closing by the time we checked in, and my parents wanted to grocery shop, so we dragged ourselves to Carrefour—past the picturesque Colmar you see in pictures and in the regular city part of Colmar. On the way back, we got takeaway flammekueche/tarte flambée at [La Soï](https://g.co/kgs/oQ5Q6o3), which was fine, but 70% of the pommes streusel one was kinda too burnt to consume (the natural wasn’t burnt).

——

**14 May**: *Kaysersberg-Vignoble, Eguisheim, more Colmar*

We paid for an extra hour (1€) at **Kaysersberg-Vignoble**; my father refused to believe that [parking was free from 12-2PM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lpg6XF2jcD5aneV37?g_st=ic). Good thing we used up all that time admiring the town and going up **Château de Kaysersberg/Schlossberg**, a hot climb with many bugs and a few lizards. View isn’t life-changing, but I wanted to hike up one ruined castle and thought this was a good choice. The route I took was 7 minutes, and another 7 to the top of the tower, but I stopped to take photos so the latter’s probably more 3 mins. There’s also a nice cathedral in town, and a glassblowing workshop.

Decent amount of tourists, but I liked the liveliness. I tried **Fortwenger** here, which gave out delicious free samples every time I looked in one, but the gingerbread I bought was not to my liking and nowhere near as good as the sample. I also got a speculoos pretzel elsewhere (one of the few shops open), and it was very bland and didn’t have much taste at all, probably because these are open for tourists like me eating at odd hours. My lavender ice cream from this weird-smelling store (sold meat, cheese, and more, too) was excellent, though.

**Eguisheim**: fewer tourists, and I saw a grand total of two locals (selling coffee and offering cheese). From 16:35-17:18, we did a full circle around Eguisheim to see all the pretty houses. Feels like nobody real lives here—it’s like walking in a movie set with no signs of life (shops open late), yet very bright, fresh coats of paint. It’s a close tie, but I think Eguisheim is the most picturesque; I prefer Kaysersberg and Colmar because I thought it was a tiny bit eerie how movie-set-like Eguisheim was lol. It could be super lively at night, though, I’d never know; I’m usually indoors by sunset on holiday 'cuz I don’t like nightlife.

Both days we saw the main spots of **Colmar** in the evening (pretty empty then). I couldn’t decide on a museum/had museum fatigue now, I s’pose. All seemed decent, but none caught my eye/seemed too pricey for the size. **Ghibli** fans (and Disney’s *Beauty and the Beast*’s) will be familiar with the architecture of these Alsatian old towns, and if you want an *exact* copy of a building featured in *Howl’s Moving Castle*, don’t forget to stop by **Maison Pfister**.

——

**15 May**: *Basel (Switzerland), Breisach am Rhein (Germany)*

In **Colmar**, we bought a bretzel (apple and cinnamon), hansi (chocolate and cinnamon), kougelhopf and macarons at **Pâtisserie Gilg** down the street from where we had breakfast. Very affordable if you get the mini size (they’re normal-sized), and has everything.

**Basel**, **Switzerland**: In fear of accidentally getting on a Swiss highway, I directed us to Saint-Louis first, then to a Parkhaus City (Klingelbergstrasse), for a recent review said 1CHF/hr; the total ended up being 12CHF for 3-ish hours so I misunderstood badly along the way. From there, we strolled to the old town of Basel, passing through **Spalentor**—the real highlight for me was the **Town Hall**. On the way to the cathedral, I saw a Lindt shop, and they had an enticing ice cream poster. We sat on the bench in front of the store until we finished our ice cream (10/10), spotting Eurovision fans.

Basel as a whole was alive with Eurovision fervor, and right in front of **Basler Münster**, was a courtyard of painted Eurovision logos. The cathedral is worth a look, and the climb was fun for me, but perhaps not worth it because it’s not free so just my dad went up with me (6CHF for an adult, 4 for a student—you’ll need proof). Took 17 minutes (several were spent resting and admiring the view). Way easier and faster going down. There are stairs of every type, so do *not* go up if you aren’t confident in your ability to conquer the steepest, the narrowest, and more (not for the claustrophobic). You **aren’t allowed to purchase a single** ticket for the climb, you’ll need a friend.

Trudged all the way to the Papiermühle (Basel’s full of museums) only to balk at the price and Bolt away from there (nice walk down the Rhine, though, and I got free hardcover Brontë from a phone booth turned book exchange). I didn’t have enough time left in the day for more than a peek. Parking meter was wack, and a very nice old man tried to pay for our parking, though he eventually gave up, and I don’t remember how we figured it out.

**Breisach**: detoured here to step foot in Germany as it was 15km from our lodgings. The cathedral was closed by then so we could only look at the outside. We got ice cream from Eiscafé Eis Pavillon Incontro, which is in the free parking lot. Used an hour walking around peacefully despite there being nothing to do.

When we entered Basel, we were suddenly just in Switzerland, having passed no visible border—we saw a checkpoint on exit, though, and there were people manning the French-German border. Didn’t get stopped at either.

**16 May**: *Colmar* (*St Martin’s Church, Fleur de Sel*), *Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg*

**Colmar** was by far the busiest we’d ever seen it (Friday morning). Determined to try better tarte flambée, we killed time going to see the inside of **St Martin's Church**, which features (stationary) dolls acting out scenes from the Bible. Then we grabbed a nice lunch (with desserts) at [Fleur de Sel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZC2wbDvbc1E3zba57). They only had terrace seats—indoors was closed, much to our horror (we hate sun). Doesn’t accept reservations, which is why I chose to show up at opening (12:00). Reserving cramps my style.

**Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg**: It’s kind of like going to Disneyland, in that there’s not much history, and it’s all been redecorated as a tourist hotspot. Probably THE most decorated castle, and a very well thought-out linear path that ensures even I’ll never go the wrong way. I enjoyed my visit here very much, and I read almost everything (English available btw). Took from 14:31-15:56 and that was with the (tiny) gardens and buying a journal from the gift shop. It has a *great* bookstore (exclusively French). Ample parking (free) around the castle *at the time*.

Our train left Strasbourg at 18:19, and this time—despite booking direct—there was one short stop on the way back, but it didn’t change the time much anyway.

**17 May**: *Paris Catacombs, Saint Jean de Montmartre Church, departure*

Back in the capital for the last day (wanted time in case something went wrong on the journey back to Paris). My Paris adventures are **in the post I linked at the top**!

**Closing thoughts** (a surplus of those in my Paris post, some which may also apply here)

* Scorching sun everyday by the time we were in Alsace. Guess it’s luckier than rain.
* THE SOONER YOU BOOK **TRAIN TICKETS**, the CHEAPER (long distance ones; just show up for Vernon and Fontainebleau).
* Even if you’re not from the EU, a **lot** of train tickets give you great discounts if **you’re under 26**. *Check* ***everything***, not just trains, ***for reduced prices*** (***tarif réduit***) in case you qualify.
* If you’re not as crazy about it as me, they do all kinda look the same, so you won’t miss out picking only one between Colmar, Kaysersberg, Eguisheim and Ribeauvillé IMO.
* Oh, I guess Ribeauvillé was unmemorable; same as the rest yet less, and as many tourists (Eguisheim had by far the least). Either way, all four take little time to visit unless you plan on being serious about hikes and Colmar museums. Colmar does skew older, but mysteriously, all the tourists at the other three were at least 65.
* I can’t answer any questions regarding wine, we don’t really drink…I was fully here for the sights. The owner of our lodgings left us a bottle of Alsatian wine, though.
* Driving habits change the second you cross the German and Swiss borders (they will now stop for you at the crossing). Cyclists are also less deranged.
* Many parking meters don’t work, others only work with an app (and a few km away, you need a different app), some work for one golden boy before you but not for you and the guys behind you, etc. They’re not so universally broken that I’d discourage getting a car or anything like that, just prepare some time for the *possibility*.
* Wherever you rent a car from *should* have that country’s sticker requirements (for being in zones), but will probably not have other countries’, as, well, why would it.
* Google maps leads you to the wrong place for CDG car return; choose the terminal, not the specific car return.
* I had an awesome dream trip!! Ask me anything (and sorry for the post’s length)!",2,1749054709.0,travel,2,0.75,False

1l39zkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1l39zkn/god_in_the_halffilled_cup/,God in the Half-Filled Cup,"There is a quiet magic in the ordinary. Not the dramatic kind that cracks open the sky or rips a veil between worlds, but the kind that sits in the bones of everyday things. The clink of a spoon against ceramic. The hum of morning traffic. A cup of coffee filled just enough to feel like a ritual. I was raised to believe God lived in the details. Not just in the church, not just in the sacraments, but in the soft spaces in between. Folk Catholicism gave me that. It taught me to look for holiness in the corners of life. To trust signs and symbols. To speak to saints like relatives. To understand that the sacred doesn’t always knock—it just sits with you until you notice.

Tarot taught me the rest. It showed me how to pull the hidden thread through the visible world. How to sit with questions. How to hold space for a silence that says more than any speech ever could. When I pull cards for clients, I’m not trying to dazzle. I’m listening. Watching. Reading the space between their words and letting spirit fill in the blanks. Some days, I don’t need the cards at all. Some days, the message is in the coffee. Or the way someone sighs before they speak. Or the way the light falls over their shoulder when they talk about someone they miss.

I am sitting in the morning. Not in a temple. Not in a sanctuary. Just a kitchen. Or maybe it’s a diner. It doesn’t matter. The air is quiet. The cup is warm in my hands. There is a man behind the counter. He fills it halfway. He doesn’t ask if that’s enough. He knows it is. Because ritual doesn’t need to be full to be complete. I do not argue. I have learned not to argue with the moment. He is already looking out the window anyway, already focused on something coming toward us.

She walks in like the morning belongs to her. Not in a selfish way, but in the way of someone who has learned how to be greeted with love. They kiss. It is public and private all at once. I look away. Not because I disapprove, but because it is their ritual, not mine. And yet, in that small act, something is affirmed. The world is still turning. People still love each other. The umbrella still shakes out rain. And I am still here.

There’s a comfort in not being the main character of the room. In pouring the milk and pretending not to notice what is happening around you. But of course you notice. That’s the whole trick of it. Everyone does. We pretend we don’t see each other, but we are constantly watching. Constantly registering every small flicker of connection. Even the man behind the counter has his script. He says, “It is always nice to see you.” And it is. Even if no one says it to me, I feel it in the room.

I open the paper. Someone has died. An actor. I have never heard of him. But I feel something anyway. Maybe it is the way the story sits beside the horoscopes. One line for the dead. One line for the living. Both trying to make sense of what happens next. I turn to the horoscopes, not for truth, but for rhythm. I look for the funnies too. I always do. Not because they’re funny. Because they’re still there. Like a candle someone keeps lighting, even if the flame barely flickers.

And then I feel it. That slight shift. Someone watching me. Not threatening. Just present. Spirit does that sometimes. So do people. I raise my head.

There are moments in life that do not ask anything of us except presence. No grand choice. No crossroads. Just the invitation to witness something real. Most people miss them. They’re too distracted or too guarded. But those of us who’ve walked the quiet paths—who’ve read for the brokenhearted, who’ve lit candles for people who never came home, who’ve prayed novenas in silence while the house creaked around us—we know what to look for. We know when the moment arrives. And when it does, we do the only thing that matters.

We raise our heads.

He planned most of our outings brunches, coffee dates, even got us courtside tickets to see the Toronto Raptors. He made me feel seen. I responded with small things too: I made a birthday jar full of handwritten notes, got him a thoughtful gift, and planned a special day trip for his birthday.

Just a few days before his birthday, he suddenly told me he wasn’t ready for anything serious and “could only be exclusive to himself right now.” He said he still needed to heal from his divorce.

It hit me hard. Especially because he had brought up exclusivity early on, and constantly gave me the impression that this was something real. He'd say he missed me, that I was a positive force in his life, and that our time together was meaningful. But when things started to deepen, he shut down. On his birthday, I called him sad and emotional and he coldly said, “You have the whole summer to get over it.”

Later, he thanked me for the birthday gift and said, “The man who ends up with you is lucky.” But that honestly just stung more.

It’s been tough processing everything.

He didn't have many friends and he was extremely sheltered which caused him to fall to peer pressure which I think a lot of people can relate to. We also have to take into account that he was only 13 or 14 when spike got pregnant at first it's assumed that he was scared when he walked away from spike after she told him since they were in middle school probably didn't know anything about protection and Shane worried about what his parents thought especially since his father was a minister. He makes mistakes as all teenagers do such as not taking eggbert seriously and ends up dropping him spike had every right to be angry with him over that but we see him trying to make up for it he wants to be in the baby's life and eventually tells his parents which at the dinner he stands up for her. He can't really control what his parents when they sent him to summer camp. In season 3 he tells spike that his parents sent him to camp but he didn't want to go and wanted to be there for her and Emma but she shuts him out. At his point it's not his fault since it was his parents choice to send him I feel that spike should have understood since at the dinner Shane's father mentions he wanted to send Shane away to private school and recommended spike go to a home for teen moms. I feel if given the chance Shane could have grown up more and actually been a father to Emma because seeing his own flesh and blood could have awakened something in his mind. We also see him give spike child support for the baby which indicates that he does care and that he's willing to be there. However he could have tried harder to be there such as offering to watch Emma but we don't know if he did and spike said no since she was still mad at him. He had one chance to hold Emma during the Christmas season which seemed to make him really happy. He got to hold his baby for the first time even spike smiled a bit but she was reluctant at first. By the end of season 3 Shane uses the 20$ to go to the concert which if he gave to spike she would have used it to go to the concert also. While I don't Shane should have lied to Spike I believe he should have made a compromise with her such as giving her extra at a later time or helping out with Emma. At the concert he buys substances pressured by Luke which changes his life forever. At the end we see him in a Coma I wish the writers had spike visit him in the hospital or mention him in a good light but I don't blame her for worrying about child support and how she's going to take care of Emma. By the time Degrassi high he's seen one last time trying to talk to spike. He's clearly brain damaged and needs help walking around. At this point he can't control his outbursts and Spike shows her softer side by telling him they can get coffee at a later time if they ever hung out together is unknown but she at least takes Emma to see her once as seen in a flashback in Degrassi father figure pt 3. At his point he's much older and only remembers Emma as a baby. It's unknown if he ever got visitors or if any of his friends visit him but his story is truly tragic and spike had every right to be upset in some situations but others Shane could not control not control due to his parents being strict. In the end I believe he shouldn't get to much hate he was only 13-14 just like spike and he was allowed to make mistakes but it didn't have to cost him everything. I think spike should have told Emma Shane was in the hospital being treated instead of making her believe that he didn't want her. Because at the end of the day he truly did want to be there but he was just an immature kid who had alot of growing up to do. If he did have a chance to mature and learn from his mistakes he could have been a great dad to Emma and maybe spike would have given him a second chance.

I’m sorry if it’s long and I hope I don’t get hate for my thoughts and I’m open to replying to any comments and my next post will be about spike and then a part 3. ",6,1749054217.0,Degrassi,15,1.0,False
1l39w7o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l39w7o,"⚠️DON'T DO THIS, 2026/2025tards.","SO HEY GUYS — I AM SUCCESSFULLY A FAILED DROPPER NOW.
Ask Me Anything.

What are those photos above?

That’s the amount of ink, pages, and hope I burned in the last few years trying to revive my JEE.

The number of strategies I’ve watched…

Andrew Huberman podcasts.

Study techniques.

Focus techniques.

Brain hacks.

Copium.

Self-loathing.

Self-abuse.


Whatever you’re planning to watch or try for JEE — I’ve already done it.
Then why didn’t I get a happy ending?

Because I didn’t do what actually matters.
And it took me 3 full years to figure that out.

So here it is — everything I’ve learned the hard, painful, brain-rotting way.


---

1. Don’t be stagnant.

That state where you’re doing nothing, lying on your bed, planning, thinking, scrolling —
That’s the breeding ground of anxiety, overthinking, depression, low confidence.
It feels harmless but it destroys you.

Do the stupidest, smallest thing to move.

One pushup.

Open the book.

Write one line.

Sit at your table.


That’s momentum. It’s not about discipline. It’s about movement.

Methods that help:

Do 5 pushups.

Clean the room.

5 minute rule.

5...4...3...2...1 → just start.



---

2. Fix your sleep-wake cycle.

No debate here. Fixing sleep fixes 50% of your shit.

Tip: Tell a girl you’ll send her a good morning text at 6:30 AM.
Evolution will do the rest.

Use Alarmy:
Loud alarm + math puzzle + disable app permissions.
You’ll wake up. And so will your building.


---

3. Use Yeolpumta or Track Everything.

If you're using your phone to study, use Yeolpumta. If not, then track manually.
Track your hours. Track your patterns.

Tip:
Set an alarm for every hour. Name it “Fill the Sheet.”
Make an Excel sheet and write down what you did each hour.
You’ll be shocked how much time goes in doing “nothing.”


---

4. Rebuild your focus (you’ve already ruined it).

Your brain can’t hold 10 seconds of attention — thanks to Reels and Shorts.

Fix it like this:

1. Stop watching reels.
No theory. Just stop.
Use ScreenZen, BlockHero, NoScroll. Or uninstall the damn app.


2. Sit idle without doing anything.
Your brain needs to get bored before it can focus.


3. Pick a spot on the wall and stare at it.
2–3 minutes. Build raw focus.


4. Start studying.
You won’t be able to concentrate at first — it’s normal. Extend your time slowly.


5. Pomodoro with a physical timer.
Decide what you’ll do in each session. Don’t go in blind.



Extra Tips:

Sit at the same place daily.
(If ADHD, change environment weekly.)

Don’t masturbate. Please.

Use black coffee + cold showers for boosting intensity.



---

5. Start your day with movement.

Even just walking, stretching, or 10 pushups.

Or set a brutal pushup goal that sets a standard.
It rewires your brain into action mode for the day.


---

6. End your day with a win.

Even if the whole day went to shit, don’t sleep like a loser.

Just do 10 pushups, or write 5 lines in your journal. Something. Anything.

Write:

Where did I screw up?

What should I have done instead?


Then write your To-Do list for tomorrow.

This breaks the pattern of self-hate. You don’t end the day like a victim.


---

Track Everything.

Sleep time.
Wake time.
Study hours.
Wasted hours.
Mood.
Distractions.
Overthinking.

All of it.
Tracking = Awareness = Control.


---

What I learnt after 3 years of rotting in the same loop:

1. Your ability to suffer and sit with discomfort defines your life.
Your mind gives up way before your body does.


2. Keep your commitments.
Especially to yourself.
That’s how you build self-respect.


3. Be relentless.
Don’t ‘study’. Attack the work.
Kill it. Crush it. Take its soul.
Be a savage. Be obsessed. Be a beast.


4. Have grit.
You don’t need motivation. You need endurance.


5. Listen to the whisper that says: “Get up MF, you're nobody yet.”
That’s your conscience. That’s your soul. That’s God talking.


6. Don’t let circumstances control you.
If it’s broken: Face it, fix it, move on.


7. Repetition is the G-code.
Don’t look for hacks. Repeat the basics.


8. Don’t think. Do.
Your brain will try to delay, distract, sleep, scroll, escape.
Don’t negotiate.
Just walk. Just start.
The path will meet your legs.




---

Inaction = stress, anxiety, depression, shame.
Action = peace, pride, confidence.


---

Final thought:

End your day with a hook.
A small habit that you do no matter what.

Even if everything goes to hell, do that one small thing:

10 pushups.

A short walk.

1 page of reading.

Watering a plant.

Calling your mom.


If you do it — it’s not a bad day anymore.

That’s it.

1l39ute,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l39ute/how_taking_actual_breaks_saved_my_productivity/,How taking actual breaks saved my productivity,"Okay, so a few months back I was basically a mess when it came to getting stuff done. You know that feeling where you're sitting at your desk for what feels like forever, telling yourself you're being productive, but really you're just existing? Like, scrolling through the same three tabs, starting tasks but never finishing them, that whole deal. I also felt really busy at the time for some reason even though I wasn't.

I was getting so frustrated with myself (Granted, this might be due to my information diet). Here I am, trying to be this focused, productive person, and instead I'm just burning through hours like they're nothing. My brain felt like mush by 2 PM every day.

Then I came across this whole thing about taking breaks, but not the kind where you just randomly check your phone when you're bored. I'm talking about **actually scheduling** when to rest, like it's as important as the work itself. Sounds weird, right? But hear me out.

I started super simple:

* Work for 25 minutes (and I mean REALLY work, no Instagram, no ""quick"" YT videos)
* Take 5 minutes to do literally anything else,  stretch, make tea, look outside, whatever
* Do that four times, then take a proper 15-minute break where I'd walk around the block or something

And honestly? It felt like cheating at first. Like, how could working less make me better at... working?

But I shit you not within just one week, I noticed some pretty wild changes. My focus during those 25-minute chunks was insane compared to before. Like, I'd actually get into that flow state where time just disappears and you're completely locked in. That deep work time literally doubled (yeah, I tracked it because I'm a bit of a data nerd).

The craziest part though? I started finishing way more stuff. We're talking 30% more tasks actually getting done. Not because I was working longer hours, but because I wasn't spending half my ""work time"" fighting my own brain to pay attention.

And get this - my creativity went through the roof. All those moments when you're stuck on a problem and can't figure it out? Those solutions started hitting me during my breaks. While I was making coffee or taking a shower, not when I was staring at the screen getting more and more frustrated.

The secret sauce was treating those breaks like they were sacred. No negotiating with myself, no ""just five more minutes and then I'll take a break."" When the timer went off, I got up. Period. Turns out your brain is way more willing to focus hard when it knows relief is coming.

Now I've gotten fancy with it, sometimes I do longer work blocks for creative stuff, or I'll use little rituals like standing up and taking three deep breaths to reset between tasks. But the core thing that changed everything? Realizing that productivity isn't about grinding until you collapse. It's about finding your rhythm and actually respecting it.

If you're feeling stuck in that same cycle of being ""busy but not productive,"" maybe give this a shot. I can't promise it will work for you but it def worked for me.",2,1749054098.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

1l39rvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindHacksToday/comments/1l39rvf/can_journaling_improve_your_small_talk/,Can journaling improve your small talk?,"So, this might sound kinda random, but I've started using journaling prompts to get better at small talk during parties. Hear me out... When I'm just chilling at home with my cat and a cup of coffee, I jot down prompts in my journal like ""Write about the last conversation that felt natural"" or ""Describe a moment when you felt genuinely curious about something someone said."" This gets me thinking about what actually works in a convo and what doesn't.

Thinking through these situations has helped me remember lil' details about people and see connections I might've missed. Next time you're at a party, you can draw from those reflections—like, mention 'Oh, I remembered you love hiking!' if you noted that before. Plus, it helps me stay present and genuinely enjoy chats rather than overthinking. Might be a cool experiment to try, idk. Anyone else done something like this? 🤔",7,1749053901.0,mindHacksToday,0,0.9,False
1l39rpb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l39rpb,I received my first (and second) 5.0 star rating today!,"I honestly wasn't expecting this at all. I mean, these designs are decent, but not what I'd consider my best. Either way, I'm grateful to have gotten not one, but **_two_** 5.0 star ratings in one day! I've never gotten 5.0 stars on anything before this.

I was beginning to get discouraged, even considering uninstalling DH, but this gave my motivation a little boost! 😊👏",7,1749053890.0,DesignHomeGame,0,1.0,False
