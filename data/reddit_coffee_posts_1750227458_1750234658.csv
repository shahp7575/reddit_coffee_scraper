I found an affordable Mazzer Mini Timer Coffee Grinder on the second hand market.

How does that grinder perform today? Would it be worth it for ~200€ considering I’d Single Dose mod it?

Could that grinder even provide grounds coarse enough for my Bialetti Moka Pot? What is the grind range on that grinder?

1lebkyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lebkyx/whistlecreek_hollow_pt2/,Whistle-Creek Hollow (pt2),"The morning after the bells, everything felt wrong in a way I couldn’t explain.
Not dramatic—just… off. Like the village was holding its breath.

I walked into the village early, hoping the fresh air might clear the weight in my chest.
The streets were quiet. Too quiet, even for Whistle-Creek Hollow.
No birds. No wind. Not even the Miller twins arguing in front of the store like they usually did.

Then I saw her.

Lacey Miller was sitting alone on the post office steps, arms wrapped around her knees, eyes fixed on the church.

We hadn’t spoken in almost two years—not since she stopped talking to me after my sixteenth birthday.
No explanation. No fallout. Just gone.


“You heard them, didn’t you?” she asked, her voice flat.
“The bells.”

Of course I heard the bells.
The whole village would’ve heard them.
They rang out sharp and sudden, cutting through the night like they didn’t belong there.
But the way she said it—like it meant something more—put me on edge.

“Yeah, of course I heard them,” I said. I tried to keep my voice casual, but it didn’t come out that way.

Lacey didn’t say anything right away. She just kept staring at the church like she was waiting for it to do something.

“They’re not supposed to ring after midnight,” she said finally.
“Not unless…”

She stopped there. Bit her lip. Looked away.

“Unless what?” I asked.

She hesitated. Then shook her head like she regretted saying anything at all.

“Forget it,” she muttered, standing up. “It doesn’t matter.”

But it did. I could feel it.
And the way she wouldn’t meet my eyes told me she knew more than she was willing to say.

Before I could ask anything else, she was already walking away, her steps quick and uneven, like she couldn’t get away fast enough.

I watched her go, a hundred questions sitting in my mouth, none of them making it out.

And then I looked back at the church.

Still. Silent.
Just the way it always looked.
But somehow, it didn’t feel the same anymore.

I stayed there for a while after Lacey left, just watching the church like it might give me an answer.

It didn’t.

The breeze picked up slightly, carrying the smell of dew and old stone. I turned to leave, and that’s when I saw him walking up the road.

Pastor Whitlock.

He carried a to-go coffee in one hand, a worn leather-bound book in the other, and walked like someone who had nowhere to be but didn’t want to be late.
He smiled as soon as he saw me—one of those smiles that actually felt genuine.

“Morning, son,” he said, nodding. “You’re up early.”

“Could say the same for you,” I replied, trying to sound casual.

“Comes with the job,” he said with a soft chuckle, eyes crinkling kindly at the corners. “God waits for no man.”

He stopped beside me, glanced toward the bell tower.
For a moment, his expression changed—just a flicker, something unreadable—but it passed quickly.

“Strange night,” he said.

I hesitated.

“You heard them too, then? The bells?”

“Hard not to,” he said, gently. “Half the town must’ve been staring at their ceilings after that.”

He sipped his coffee, then looked back at the church like he was just noticing it for the first time that morning.

“Probably just a timing error. The mechanism’s old—temperamental, especially in the heat.”

I nodded slowly, but something about his tone felt… careful.

“Still,” he added, “I’ll have a look at it today. No need for folks to worry.”

Then he gave me a pat on the shoulder—warm, familiar—and continued up the steps toward the church.

Just before he opened the door, he paused.

“Try not to let your imagination get the better of you,” he said with a small smile. “Things like this—well, they have a way of growing bigger than they really are.”

And with that, he disappeared inside.

For a moment, I actually felt a little better. Pastor Whitlock always had a way of grounding things—like no matter how weird things got, he’d still be there Sunday morning with his sleeves rolled up and a kind word ready.

But as I walked back down the road, Lacey’s voice stuck in my head.

“They’re not supposed to ring after midnight.”

She’d looked scared.

And Whitlock… he hadn’t.
That was the part that bothered me.

I hadn’t even meant to stop by the church. I was headed into town for something—though by that point, I’d nearly forgotten what.

It came back to me halfway down Main Street: I’d promised my mom I’d pick up coffee and a few things from the store. Nothing dramatic. Just regular life—the kind that kept you tethered when everything around you started feeling slightly off.

The door to Miller’s Market gave its usual creak when I pushed it open. The lights buzzed overhead, a little too bright, and the place smelled like fresh bread and floor cleaner.

Mrs. Miller was behind the counter, flipping through a church bulletin and sipping from a thermos. She smiled when she saw me.

“Morning, sweetheart,” she said. “You’re up and about early.”

“Just running errands,” I said, grabbing a basket.

She nodded, but looked at me a little too long—like she was trying to decide whether or not to say something else.

I didn’t ask.

I wasn’t ready for more weirdness.

I didn’t linger. Just grabbed what I needed—coffee, bread, a few things from the shelf—and nodded politely on the way out.

“Tell your mother I said hello,” Mrs. Miller called after me.

“Will do.”

The walk home was quiet, except for the soft crunch of gravel under my boots and the distant hum of cicadas starting up with the heat. I passed a couple of neighbors pulling weeds from their front yards, nodding in that small-town way that says hello without words. No one mentioned the bells. Maybe they didn’t want to be the first to bring it up. 

When I got back to the house, Mom was at the kitchen table folding laundry. The radio was playing softly, some old country song humming beneath the steady rhythm of her hands.

She looked up as I came in and nodded toward the bag.

“You find everything?”

“Yeah,” I said, setting it on the counter. “Even got the kind of bread you like.”

“Appreciate it,” she said, giving me a small smile.

I poured her a cup of coffee and slid it across the table. She took it with a grateful nod, wrapping her hands around the mug like it was the only warm thing in the house.

“You sleep alright?” she asked, eyes on the coffee, not me.

“Not really.”

That was all I said. I could tell she wanted to ask more—maybe about the bells, maybe about something else—but she didn’t.

She just took a sip, looked out the window, and said:

“Sometimes things happen in this town you can’t explain. Best not to dwell too long.”

I didn’t respond.
I just stood there for a moment, drinking my own coffee, trying not to think about how carefully she’d chosen those words. 

We sat in silence for a while. The kind of quiet that feels like it has weight to it.

I didn’t plan to ask. The question just slipped out.

“Hey… do you remember Lucas Frye?”

Mom didn’t answer right away. She kept her eyes on the window, her fingers tightening just slightly around the mug.

“Why?” she asked.

“We were talking about him last night. Me, Josh, Mason, Elena… Nobody’s seen him in years.” 

She finally looked at me. Not angry, not startled—just… guarded.

“That was a long time ago.”

“Yeah, but… people don’t just disappear.”

She sighed, set her coffee down, and stood to take a dish towel from the counter. Started wiping down the already-clean table.

“Some families leave. That’s just how it is.”

“But his family didn’t say goodbye. There wasn’t a moving truck. Nothing. One day they were here, then they weren’t.”

Mom didn’t look at me. She just kept wiping the table in slow, even circles.

“I think you’ve had enough of ghost stories for one night,” she said softly.
“Don’t go digging into things that don’t need digging into.”

That last line sat between us like a boulder.

I didn’t say anything else.

The rest of the morning passed quietly. I did what I usually did—mowed the lawn, helped Mom move some boxes in the attic, even took a stab at fixing the loose screen door out back. It didn’t fix. It never did.

I tried not to think about Lucas. Or Lacey. Or the bells.

By noon, the sun had pushed most of the shade off the porch, and the heat settled in like a blanket you couldn’t kick off. I was about to lie down for a bit when the phone rang—landline, of course. Cell service in Whistle-Creek was a joke.

Mom called from the kitchen.

“It’s Josh.”

I wiped my hands on a dish towel and picked up the receiver in the hallway.
 

“What’s up?”

“Can you meet me?” he asked, no greeting. Just straight to it.

“Where?”

“The old bus lot. Behind the middle school.”

“Everything alright?”

There was a pause on the line. I could hear the wind cutting across the receiver, like he was already out there.

“I’m not sure,” he said. “Just… get here.”

He hung up before I could say anything else.

By the time I said “Yeah, okay”, the line was already dead.

I hung up, grabbed my boots, and headed out without saying a word.
Mom didn’t ask where I was going. Maybe she could tell I wouldn’t have answered anyway.

The sun was climbing high, and the heat pressed down harder with every step. I cut through the back field behind our house, crossed the old water tower path, and followed the cracked trail behind the middle school. The grass was high and dry, and the sound of cicadas buzzed like static in my ears.

The bus lot came into view—just a wide stretch of crumbling pavement and weeds pushing up through the cracks.
No buses had parked there in years. Just rusted shelters, old fences, and a leaning row of pines that never seemed to grow any taller. 

Josh was already there.

He sat on an overturned trash bin, elbows on his knees, head down like he’d been waiting a while.
When he looked up and saw me, he didn’t smile.

“Thanks for coming,” he said.

“What’s going on?”

He didn’t answer at first. Just stood, checked over his shoulder like he expected someone else to be nearby.

Then he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled something out, wrapped in what looked like an old piece of flannel.

“I found this out near the quarry this morning,” he said, voice low.
“I didn’t want to bring it home.”

He handed it to me—carefully, like it might bite.

“You need to see it for yourself.”

Josh handed me the bundle, his eyes locked on it like he half-expected it to move.

The flannel was damp, cold despite the heat. I hesitated, then slowly unwrapped it.

Inside was a small, carved wooden figure.
Roughly the shape of a person, but wrong—limbs too long, no face, just a smooth oval where the features should be. The wood was blackened, scorched around the edges, and something—sap maybe—had dried in streaks down its chest.

“What the hell is this?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” Josh said. “But it was half-buried behind the old quarry. Right near the spot we used to hang out.”

I turned it over in my hands. It felt heavier than it looked. Off-balance, like it had been broken and glued back together.

“You think it’s… old?”

Josh shook his head.

“No. That’s the thing. The ground around it was disturbed. Fresh. Like someone had just left it there.”

I stared at the faceless figure. There was something about it I didn’t like. Not just the way it looked—but the way it made me feel. Like I’d seen it before, but couldn’t remember where.

I started to say something else when Josh cut in.

“Have you heard from Mason today?”

I blinked.

“No. Why?”

Josh rubbed the back of his neck, suddenly looking much younger than he had a moment ago.

“I’ve been trying to call him since this morning. Nothing. No answer. No texts. I even stopped by his place on the way here—his car’s out front, but no one answered the door. It’s not like him.”

“Maybe he’s just sleeping in.”

“Maybe,” Josh said. But I could tell he didn’t believe it.

Neither did I.

I looked down at the wooden figure again, its smooth, blank face staring up at nothing.

“You think this has something to do with it?”

Josh didn’t answer.
He didn’t have to.

I kept my eyes on the figure, but my mind was spinning.

“What about Elena?” I asked. “Have you heard from her?”

Josh nodded.

“Yeah, she texted me earlier. Said she had errands with her mom. She’s fine.”

I let out a quiet breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. One friend accounted for, at least. But Mason… something didn’t feel right. 

“Alright,” I said, wrapping the figure back in the flannel. “Let’s go check on him. Just to be sure.”

Josh didn’t argue. We headed out together, cutting across the old field and back toward the street. The walk to Mason’s place wasn’t far—ten minutes at most—but it felt longer under the weight of that carved figure in my backpack and the silence sitting between us.

Mason lived with his dad in a house just off the main road, a little run-down but always full of life. Music, barking dogs, laughter. Today, though, it was quiet.

Too quiet.

Josh led the way up the porch steps and knocked on the screen door.

No answer.

He knocked again—louder this time.

Still nothing.

He turned to me.

“I told you. Car’s still here. Lights are off.”

I stepped over and tried the door. Locked.

Josh cupped his hands to the window and leaned in.

“I don’t see anyone.”

I felt a chill run through me despite the heat.
Something about the stillness of the place—the way the curtains hung too stiff, the way no music drifted from inside—set my teeth on edge.

“He wouldn’t just disappear,” I said.

Josh didn’t say anything.
Just stared at the door like it might open on its own.

We stood there on the porch for another few seconds, neither of us saying anything.
I kept waiting for something to move behind the curtains. A light to flick on. A voice to call out.

Nothing.

Josh turned away, muttering a curse under his breath.

I hesitated, then said,

“I saw Lacey this morning.”

Josh glanced at me, surprised.

“Really? Where?”

“Post office. She was just… sitting there. Watching the church.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“That’s weird. She hasn’t really talked to anyone since—”

“Yeah, I know,” I cut in. “But she spoke to me. Asked if I heard the bells.”

Josh’s face shifted slightly. Not fear, exactly—more like something turning over in his stomach.

“What’d she say about them?”

“Nothing, really. She clammed up pretty quick. Said they’re not supposed to ring after midnight, and then just left.”

He ran a hand through his hair and looked back toward Mason’s house.

“First Lacey’s acting weird, then those bells go off in the middle of the night… and now Mason’s not picking up? And we’re still pretending Lucas just moved away?”

We stood there a moment longer, both of us watching the door like it might suddenly open.

Then Josh nudged me with his elbow and nodded toward the street.

“Isn’t that Mrs. Delaney?”

Sure enough, the elderly woman from two houses down was out on her front steps, watering the same patch of flowers she’d been trying to keep alive for the past decade. Always wore a wide straw hat, always had a mug of sweet tea, even in weather like this.

We crossed the lawn and walked up to her gate.

“Morning, Mrs. Delaney,” Josh said, putting on that polite tone we all learned growing up.

She looked up and smiled, eyes squinting beneath the brim of her hat.

“Well now, you boys are up to no good, I can tell,” she teased.

“Just trying to track down Mason,” I said. “You seen him or his dad today?”

Her smile faded just a little—so quickly you might not notice if you weren’t looking for it.

“No,” she said, slowly. “Can’t say I have. Thought I saw Mason’s dad drive off early this morning, though. Real early. Before sunrise.”

“Mason wasn’t with him?”

She shook her head, adjusted the hose so the water wouldn’t flood her walkway.

“Didn’t see him. Then again, I wasn’t exactly keeping watch. Could’ve just missed him.”

She said it casually enough, but I could tell she was choosing her words.

“That car’s still out front,” Josh said. “And Mason’s not answering his phone.”

Mrs. Delaney gave a faint nod, then looked back at her flowers.

“Well… I’m sure it’s nothing,” she said.
“You know how kids are. Always disappearing for a while.”

She didn’t say it like a joke.
She said it like a fact.

We thanked her and walked back down the path, neither of us saying much.

When we reached the edge of Mason’s yard, Josh stopped and turned to me.

“Alright,” he said. “I know someone we can talk to.”

“About Mason?”

He shook his head.

“No. About that thing you’re carrying.”

I reached into my bag and pulled out the flannel-wrapped figure again. Just holding it made my fingers itch.

“Who would even know anything about this?”

“Old man Adler,” Josh said. “Used to teach history at the high school. Retired a few years back, but he’s still around. People used to say he collected weird stuff—books, artifacts, folklore. That kind of thing.”

“You think he’ll know what it is?”

“If anyone in this town does, it’s him.”

He looked over at the house again, then back at me.

“If that thing has anything to do with Mason going missing… I don’t want to sit around waiting to see who’s next.”

I nodded, but hesitated.

“We should let Elena know what’s going on. She deserves to be in the loop.”

Josh’s jaw tightened just slightly. He looked down at the ground, kicking at a loose patch of gravel with his boot.

“Yeah,” he said. “Good idea.”

There was something in his voice—too casual to be casual. I didn’t say anything, but I noticed.

He’d always looked out for her. More than the rest of us. Not that either of them ever admitted it.

“You want to call her, or should I?” I asked.

“I will,” he said quickly.

Faster than he needed to.

I didn’t push it.

Josh pulled out his phone and started texting as we headed back toward the main road.

“I’ll let her know to meet us after,” he said. “Figured it’s better if we see what this thing actually is before we start throwing theories around.”

“Fair,” I said, adjusting the weight of my backpack.

Neither of us said much after that.

The walk to Adler’s place wasn’t long, but it felt like the world had quieted down just for us. Fewer birds. Fewer cars. Even the cicadas seemed to have lost interest.

Whatever that thing was in my bag, it felt heavier with every step.

We cut through the back alley behind the bakery, following the narrow road that curved up toward the edge of town where the older houses sat—quiet, shaded, half-swallowed by ivy and time.

Josh walked a few paces ahead, focused, but I could tell his mind was going in circles.

“I asked my mom about Lucas this morning,” I said, breaking the silence.

Josh slowed, looked back at me.

“Yeah?”

“She didn’t say much. Just that some families leave, and it’s better not to go digging.”

He let out a short breath—something between a laugh and a sigh.

“Sounds about right.”

“It wasn’t what she said,” I added. “It was how fast she shut it down. Like I wasn’t supposed to bring it up. Like even asking the question was dangerous.”

Josh was quiet for a moment. Then he said,

“My dad used to tell me people in this town don’t talk about the past because they’re scared it might come back.”

I gave him a sideways look.

“You believe that?”

He shrugged.

“Starting to.”

Adler’s house sat on a slope just past the tree line at the edge of town—a squat, weathered place with ivy curling up one side and old wind chimes rattling gently on the porch. The paint was chipped, and the yard looked like it hadn’t seen a mower in a year, but something about it felt… alive.

Josh slowed as we reached the gate.

“You sure he still lives here?” I asked.

“Yeah,” Josh said. “He doesn’t go out much anymore, but he’s still around.”

We stepped up onto the porch. The wood creaked under our weight.

Josh knocked. Once, then again, louder.

A few seconds passed. Then we heard shuffling inside—slow, deliberate, like someone was moving carefully through a cluttered room. The door opened just a crack.

A pale, weathered face appeared in the gap—eyes sharp behind thick glasses, white beard trimmed short.

“Josh Carver,” the old man said. “Didn’t expect to see you alive and breathing.”

Josh gave him a crooked smile.

“Nice to see you too, Mr. Adler.”

The door opened wider.

“Who’s your friend?”

“This is—” Josh started.

“Doesn’t matter,” Adler cut in. His gaze landed on the backpack I was holding.
“What matters is what you’ve brought with you.”

That was the moment I realized: he already knew we were coming.

Adler stepped aside and waved us in with a motion that was more tired than welcoming.

Inside, the air was cool and stale, thick with the smell of old paper, dust, and something faintly metallic. Books were stacked in columns on nearly every surface—tables, chairs, even the floor. Some were leather-bound, others loose-leaf and yellowing. There were no lights on, just the filtered glow of daylight through dusty curtains.

“Don’t touch anything,” he muttered, disappearing into the next room.

We followed him through a narrow hallway lined with framed newspaper clippings and strange old photos—most too faded to make out clearly. One of them looked like a group of men standing in front of the church, holding lanterns. Another showed a bell tower with a dark shape at the top that might’ve just been a flaw in the print.

We found him in a room that might’ve once been a study—if studies came with cracked skulls, melted candles, and more books than furniture. He lowered himself into a sunken armchair with a groan and gestured for us to sit on two mismatched wooden chairs.

Josh unzipped the backpack and slowly pulled out the cloth-wrapped figure. He set it on the table between us and unwrapped it without a word.

Adler didn’t speak for a long time. Just stared at it. Not with surprise—more like recognition. 

Finally, he leaned in.

“Where did you find this?”

“Near the quarry,” Josh said. “Half-buried.”

Adler nodded, slow and deliberate.

“And you were smart enough not to leave it behind.”

He reached for the figure, but didn’t touch it. His hand hovered above it like he was waiting for something. Or asking permission.

“You two have any idea what this is?”

“No,” I said. “But we were hoping you did.”

He chuckled once. Dry. Almost bitter.

You know, the little heart, planet, tulip, or sad-looking duck that makes you go “aww” for no reason.

Problem is, I can’t find any nice ones online (Already have 2, but they're not exactly what want). They lack the charm of something made by actual human hands. There’s just something wildly romantic about someone putting tiny, adorable stitches into a shirt. It's giving... softcore Jane Austen.

Now, I don’t know embroidery. My female friends are more into memes than needles. My sister is also far away from such things. So, I’m turning to the good people of Reddit.

If you’re into embroidery and don’t mind turning my plain shirt into a wearable hug, I’d love to collaborate. I’ll buy you coffee. I’ll shower you with compliments like “Wow, this looks better than Gucci,”

I know this is a slightly weird ask. But hey, if someone’s idea of fun is stabbing a needle into fabric while sipping iced coffee and judging my shirt choices, I’m your guy. Help a guy out. Mods. please don't delete.

- Your face (fungal skincare serums)

Why do narcissists make everything dramatic? 

My nMom is like this and will literally make the most trivial and mundane inconveniences a complete tragedy. Say I left an empty cup on the coffee table without a coaster, though the cup is empty and not at all condensing, she will lecture/ throw a tantrum for at least 20 minutes that said cup will completely mark up or destroy the coffee table, and also threaten that I will never be able to use the coffee table again, and she does this with EVERYTHING. 

Say we’re driving somewhere and someone is going slow in front of her or they cut her off (not at all close, and they usually go about their way quickly) she has to throw an entire tantrum about it, again, for at least 20-30 mins. Like them doing that just completely ruined her ENTIRE day, it's so bad that most of the time I drive us or just drive by myself completely.

It’s little stuff like this that grates me throughout the day because she can never just be like oh well, whatever and move on from whatever it is (it’s always the most mundane inconveniences) like a grown adult, and instead she has to somehow turn it into the most exasperating situation on the planet.

99% sure I have ADHD and have been living with it for most of my life, I’m 30 now (Can’t get anything done without 4+ coffees a day, start 100 things at once and finish none of them, very excited but lose interest almost immediately after the thought, it’s starting to really annoy me and I can see it happening right after, can be extremely annoying for anyone else talking to me as the conversation jumps through 100 topics and can be hard to keep up with, always have grand plans of starting new things to help and end up forgetting about them almost immediately - all points on my initial forms lead me to believe I have some form of this and it’s taken a lot to finally book in, never saw the point in getting it sorted but it’s affecting my work, life and relationships) 

A little bit nervous about the appointment and the likelihood of being medicated after the appointment, in what type of cases is medication an option or majority of the time do they suggest other ways of dealing with ADHD first before medication?

Have you experienced the same from a stepdad?,"After my parents separated, I stayed with my dad for the first year. Then, six months in, he kicked me out without a reason, without a word of explanation. 

Just pure rejection, fueled by a narrative my aunt had planted. I never forgave him. Not for the abandonment, and not for the false attempts he later made to reconnect because even then, it was never truly about me or us. And honestly, nothing has changed since.

My mother, on the other hand, has always been kind and gentle. At 51, she carries the weight of her life with grace. She remarried at 35 quickly after the divorce, maybe out of fear, fear of being alone, fear of facing it all on her own. But the man she choses, my stepfather, now 62, was and remains a misfit in our lives.

He seems kind, understanding, mature and loving. He shows that most of the time. But BUT He did make our relationship difficult. Now and even then I see it as a deeply narcissistic man cloaked in religious piety, not out of spiritual depth, but out of emotional weakness. I told him that in his face once. And I got no response. Every time he felt powerless or small, instead of facing himself, or apologise and talk about the issue, he would grab the Qur’an and cry. As if faith were a costume, not a conviction. He tried to erase me, reshape everything I was: my thoughts, my clothes, my food, the beliefs I did not have. But I have a strong, grounded spirit. And I just was focusing on my studies and things got more difficult when I was in CPGE. As the studies are not for the faint of heart and the tension in the house will come in moments when you won’t expect it. And because he couldn't dominate it, he chose control through silence, through revenge and manipulation.

He wasn’t all bad. He can be kind, when it serves him. But now I see it clearly: the kindness is a performance, an image he wants to preserve. My mother confuses that performance with love—mistaking gestures like driving me to school and her to work for genuine affection. I tried to tell her that I don’t hate him. He’s the one who has hated me, silently and subtly. He couldn’t stand seeing me simply exist in peace. Not while watching a documentary, not during a conversation with her. He always had to interrupt, with absurd remarks or fake coughs, sometimes even faking illness for attention. (Something my aunts has also seen) And she never saw through it. Or rather, she chose not to.

The hardest part isn’t even him. It’s her denial.

Now that I’m a mother myself, I understand what it means to truly love a child. And I stopped blaming him, he is what he is. But I still visit my mom twice a year, and every single time, toward the end of the trip, he turns cold, distant, resentful. Our farewells are always bitter. Last time, he was turned silent after a disagreement we had calling me disrespectful to my mom while he was the one yelling at her few minutes ago. He turned cold, silent, mean 👀… my baby broke the handle of his little astra coffee mug. He didn’t even see it happen I simply told my mom, “I’m sorry.” A tiny accident. But I knew he’d find a way to retaliate like he always does. This time, he tore the button off my new jacket. I’m certain. It had been carefully placed in my suitcase, the thread was strong, untouched. It didn’t fall. I am an engineer who can detect fatigue on a thread. It was ripped. Just like that—petty vengeance wrapped in silence. My mom is finding all sort of excuses possible that it fell or it might got stuck in the corner of dressoir and while I picked it it ripped… it’s laughable. 

I’ve ignored so many of his childish behaviors in the past. I let them go because they ""didn’t matter."" But now, they do. They matter because they were never addressed. Because my mother continues to deny them, even as everyone else sees them clearly—her own family, her own mother.

No, suggesting I “just see her when he’s not around” is not a solution. It sends the message: you’re being dramatic, after all he’s done for you. But my mother worked just as hard as he did. She built that home. She cracked her nerves and sacrificed more than he ever could. What he did was make my life difficult. And now I ask myself—how do I make her see what she refuses to see?

I don’t want her to separate. I want her to set boundaries. For my sake. For her own. For the sake of everyone else who suffers quietly around this man. He’s even hurt my grandmother with his critiques of her cooking—despite being obsessed with food himself, almost worshiping it. He is a man who lives proudly at the base of Maslow’s pyramid, and calls that living.

Is it easier to cut ties for good? I honestly wonder. Because trying to keep a thread alive with someone who won’t even acknowledge that thread exists is exhausting.
Has anyone else lived with a stepfather who faked love, wore piety like a costume, and made a daughter feel like a stranger in her own home?

If so, I see you. And I believe you. Because love, when real, never hides behind silence or guilt. And if it’s not felt on both sides—then it never truly was.",1,1750233610.0,Morocco,1,1.0,False

Alright, friends! Let’s talk about a little secret that might just change your life: faceless growth mastery. Ever feel like you’re pouring your heart and soul into content creation, but struggling to see the return on investment? Yeah, me too. 😅 

I used to think that showing my face was the only way to connect with people online. But then I realized—I was totally wrong! Here are some juicy insights on how ditching the face can actually help you ""bank the cash!"" 

**Why Go Faceless? 🤔**

- **Less Pressure**: No need to worry about how you look on camera or what your hair is doing that day!
- **Focus on Value**: When you're faceless, people are more likely to focus on the content you offer, not on you.
- **Expand Your Reach**: Ever wondered why some channels blow up without anyone showing their mug? They’re mastering the art of faceless growth!

**How to Master Faceless Content Creation** 

1. **Leverage Voice Over**: Use engaging voice-over techniques with stock videos or animations. Seriously, you don’t have to be a podcast pro; just sound like you’re having a great conversation over coffee. 
   
2. **Text-Based Content**: Create awesome infographics or captions that tell a story without needing a face to back it up. Short, sweet, and visually appealing.
   
3. **Sourcing Graphics**: Websites like Canva or Unsplash are gold mines for visuals! Combine curated images and graphics that align with your message. 

4. **Utilize Social Media Tools**: Think TikTok or Instagram reels—perfect for short-form faceless content that grabs attention. 

5. **Educational Content**: Share knowledge through tutorials or how-tos without a face. Think of it as the friendly mentor you never see but always learn from. 

Sure, it may sound a bit out there, but hey—people are craving authenticity over perfection these days. We all want to feel connected, and sometimes that means removing the “personal brand” pressure. 

And listen, if you’re looking for a handy guide on this whole journey of embracing your faceless vibe, check out this amazing program [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals). Trust me, it’s a game-changer! 

So here’s the million-dollar question: what’s holding you back from ditching the face? Fear of being “out there”? Lack of direction? Or do you just have a barrier against **spilling your secrets**? We’re all in this together, and I'd love to hear your experiences or thoughts on how we can evolve in this faceless world! 

Let’s keep this discussion going. Who knows, maybe we’ll come up with the next big faceless growth hack together! 💪💡",1,1750233479.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

There is this guy at my university (M26-28) who started to flirt with me (F21) he was some kind of tutor one year ago for a short time. It took me a while to notice it, but at some point even others around me thought he liked me quite a lot. But everything was pretty distant. These ""signals"" (smiling at each other, talking kind of nervously [about academic stuff], flirting in general) went on for some months. I mirrored what he was doing so it was clear I'm interested too. We are both VERY introverted and not the best in social situations, I probably have aspergers and my guess is he has too. So nothing really developed.
Fast forward to a course (about 3 days) in which we both participated: This light flirting went on at first but just until I made a presentation. I really butchered the whole thing, I stuttered, made everything incomprehensible, one student even told me I sounded like I was going to cry. I don't know if thought this was unattractive or whatever... his signals were less frequent.
One thing that was particularly odd was that he didn't want to talk to me during the whole thing, even before my presentation. We were together in a hostel for 3 days with breakfast, dinner and everything. Other tutors and whatever talked to me (probably all but him at this point).
So I was pretty lost at this point what this whole thing was about... I scheduled a meeting with him about a professional topic (which I also wanted to discuss) but he didn't make anything clear. I took it as an ""Sorry, I've changed my mind, this won't work"". That he didn't even want to talk to me hurt and still hurts, but I couldn't do anything but move on so I did that and tried to forget everything.

After a few months I saw him with another one or two times who is pretty bland to be honest (I'm just trying to paint the whole picture here). But anyway, pretty clear this was over.

Fast forward to the next course, again 3 days. Of course I was pretty distant and cold towards him. I was still kind of salty that he didn't even knew anything about my, didn't want to talk to me etc. But. He was looking at me when he thought I wouldn't notice, laughed at my jokes a bit too hard, even if they weren't funny, tried to sneak into my conversation by talking to one of my mates there (which failed, she just started to infodump him).


Idk I'm just absolutely lost. There is no way to develop anything here IF there is still interest on his side. I just want to know what is happening and why it is so hard to ask for a god damn coffee or something.",1,1750233228.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I’ve been the voice in the dark for WXDN 108.3 FM for just over six years now; host of the late-night segment we call *Midnight Hour*. It’s not a flashy show, never made the top charts or got syndicated. We don’t get sponsors knocking on our door, and we sure as hell don’t trend online.

*But that’s never really been the point.*

*Midnight Hour* was built for the ones who live between days; you know the insomniacs, the long-haul truckers cruising through empty highways, the janitors polishing silent halls in empty buildings, the third-shifters who never quite adjusted to the rhythm of the sun. People who don’t belong to the daylight anymore, if they ever did.

They call in with the strangest stories. Some talk about lights in the sky, others about things they’ve seen at the edges of the woods or dreams that bled into waking. A few just want someone to talk to. *Anyone.* They all have that same tone in their voice; the quiet weariness of someone who’s been up too long with thoughts they can’t put down. I always let them talk. I figured that’s what the show was for. I never judged. Not even when someone swore their cat was speaking Latin in the middle of the night, or when one old woman insisted the moon was following her car. Ghost stories, conspiracies, confessions. it’s all welcome after midnight.

The thing about being a voice on the radio is… *no one really knows you*. They hear your tone, your cadence. But not your life. Not the parts that matter. And maybe that’s what I liked most about it. I could be whoever they needed me to be. A skeptic. A believer. A friend.

*But behind the mic… it’s just me.* And I’ve always been a solitary kind of man.

I didn’t plan on it. Life just curved in that direction, quiet and steady. One friend stopped calling. Then another. My father passed. My sister moved states away. The last woman I loved left a note on the kitchen counter and took the record player. The silence afterward stretched long, and I never quite found the edges of it. So, I gave it all to the radio. I gave my nights, my voice, and every inch of space I had inside me that was too hollow to fill with anything else.

Over time, the show became more than a job. It became the place I lived. My own private little orbit. I got used to the low hum of the equipment, the blinking red light on the phone panel, the comfort of my coffee going cold at 3 a.m. It was a kind of peace, the kind you make with yourself when there’s no one else around.

I always imagined that if anything were to happen to me, it’d happen right there in that booth. Not from anything dramatic or poetic. I wouldn’t choke mid-call or announce a haunting and drop dead. No headlines, no myths. Just a man going quietly into the dark, with his headphones on and the *on-air* sign still glowing.

*I’d be forgotten, eventually*. Another faint voice in the static.

And honestly… I thought I’d made peace with that.

But everything changed the night when *the static spoke my name*.

It was a Tuesday. 2:14 a.m. The kind of hour that doesn’t feel real. Time curls inward on itself, and everything starts to hum like an old fluorescent bulb on its last breath. The station lights flickered once, briefly, like even they were getting tired of me. I took another sip of my lukewarm coffee, grimaced, and set it down next to the soundboard with a gentle clink. The night had been dragging. Not in the peaceful, meditative way, but slow and sticky like wading through molasses with a full coat on.

I’d just hung up on a guy convinced the moon was hollow and that NASA had faked tides to cover it up. He sounded more tired than convinced, like he didn’t believe it either but needed someone to listen anyway. There was that familiar silence afterward; the kind that settles in the bones, stretches out its limbs in the absence of sound. I let it linger a second too long. Then the phone panel lit up.

*Line 3.*

That was odd. I rarely used Line 3. Usually kept it muted. It had a weird crackle in the signal. Engineering couldn’t ever fix it. I remember joking once that it sounded like ghosts lived in there. No one laughed though.

But tonight, it was blinking.

Steady. Patient.

I pressed the button, my finger hovering for just a beat too long before I spoke.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* Who’s this?”

Static. Not silence *just static*. Like something trying to claw through a wall of noise. At first, it was faint, barely audible. Then something came through it. Not words, not yet *just breathing*.

Raspy. Uneven. Like someone gasping through a pillow of snow. Then:

“…Ethan.”

I sat up straighter. I didn’t recognize the voice. It was soft, but strained. Young. Feminine. I cleared my throat.

“Uh… yeah. Who am I speaking to?”

A beat. Then the line shifted. A subtle pop in the frequency. And the next words came like a knife sliding through paper.

“Do you remember the pine tree behind your mother’s house?”

My stomach dropped.

I hadn’t spoken about my mother on-air. Not once. Not in six years. I keep that part of me behind the glass wall of the studio, behind the curated voice and the quiet late-night charm. I never even mentioned where I grew up. But that pine tree?

*It was real.*

Big, crooked thing, planted before I was born. It stood guard over our backyard like an old soldier. After my mother died; *car crash*, seven years old, too young to know how grief works there was a storm. Torrential rain, like the sky had cracked open. It tore down fences, power lines, even pulled a section of roof off the neighbor’s shed.

*But the pine tree never moved.*

It was the only thing that didn’t fall. I felt my mouth go dry. My pulse throbbed somewhere in my ears. I stared at the mic like it might offer me an answer. The air in the booth turned heavy, damp.

“Who is this?” I asked. A little sharper this time.

The line buzzed again. Not like interference more like a whisper trying to form but failing.

Then, faintly: “I’m cold.”

A sound barely more than a breath. But I heard it. I *felt* it. And then… nothing.

The line went dead. No click. No dial tone. Just the low, oppressive hush of the room pressing in from all sides. The kind of silence that leaves a ringing in your ears. I stared at the blinking panel for a long time. Five seconds. Ten. I don’t know. Just sat there, listening to my own breathing and the subtle tick of the second hand on the wall clock above the mixing board. My hands were still resting on the console, but they felt far away, like I wasn’t sure they belonged to me.

*That was weird*… I thought. But this kind of stuff happens. I merely chalked it up to a prank.

A weird one, sure, but not unheard of. Over the years, *Midnight Echo* had attracted its fair share of night-dwelling oddballs. People who wore tinfoil hats not ironically, who talked about reptilians and haunted interstates and government mind control through television static. I’d learned to expect the strange. It came with the time slot. But her voice… it lingered.

Even after I signed off for the night and stepped outside, even as the heavy studio door clunked shut behind me and the city buzzed in the distance, I felt her. Like she’d pressed her fingers not just on my skin but against the back of my eyes. She stayed with me in the silence between headlights, in the flicker of the hallway bulb outside my apartment. I told myself to forget. I didn’t.

The next night, 2:14 a.m. on the dot, Line 3 lit up again.

It blinked once. Then again. Steady as a heartbeat.

I stared at it longer this time. Something inside me twisted. I could’ve let it ring. I could’ve ignored it, blamed a glitch, filled the segment with reruns or ambient jazz until the hour slipped past.

But curiosity is a sick kind of hunger. And mine had teeth.

I reached for the switch, pressed it down slowly.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* You’ve reached Ellis.”

Static answered me. But this time, it was heavier more aggressive. Grainy, violent. Crackling like a thunderstorm had been caught in an old cassette tape and was now unraveling through the wires. My headphones hissed with it.

Then, her voice.

“Why did you stop playing piano?”

I went still. The kind of stillness that isn’t just physical, but emotional. Mental. Like something deep inside you locks up, refuses to go further. I hadn’t touched a piano in over ten years. Not since the accident anyway. Not since the blood on the asphalt, the shattered glass in my palm, the awful silence that followed where music used to live. I’d never spoken about it on air. Never let it leak through the polished persona, the late-night charm, the half-joking tone I used to deflect real memories. I didn’t even keep photos of those days anymore. No one knew about that night. No one should’ve known.

She spoke again, her voice warping now, pulled through some broken speaker on the edge of the world.

“You used to play her favorite song. Before the crash.”

My blood ran cold.

Her favorite song. Claire’s. I used to play it every Sunday afternoon on the baby grand in the den while she folded laundry in the next room, humming off-key, like it was just another ordinary day that would never end. But it did.

In one terrible moment, everything beautiful inside me collapsed.

I yanked off my headphones, breath ragged, fingers trembling like brittle leaves. The silence of the studio was suddenly unbearable, thick and full of ghosts. I reached for the switch, killed the line, the buzz, the sound everything.

“Who is this?”

Static came from the other end But I could still feel her raspy voice.

It didn’t echo in the room. It echoed in me. In my ribs. In the places I had long buried and forgotten, the ones I’d poured whiskey over for years just to keep quiet.

That night, I went home and prepared my meal mechanically; the flavors dull against the hollow ache inside me. After swallowing the last bite, I moved to my bed. The radio in the corner crackled to life, a low static hum filling the room. A voice, strained and trembling, began to speak through the haze.

“ — reports flooding in from all cities… unprecedented seismic activity… skies ablaze with an unnatural fire… authorities urging everyone to seek shelter… this is not a drill.”

“Honey, we need to go. Soon.”

“Mom, it’s fine. It’s the same bullshit as yesterday.”

“We can’t afford to take chances — not anymore.”

“Is Dad ready?”

“Yes, sweetheart. They’re all just waiting on you.”

“Alright… I’ll grab the bags. “

Meeting them at the front door, dad already had the truck running, headlights cutting through the mist. Mom clutched her coat a little tighter around her shoulders, and my sister looked at me with worried eyes.

“Got everything?” Dad asked, already reaching for the bags in my hands.

“I think” … Just as I was about to shut the door behind us, a small tug on my sleeve stopped me.

“Where’s Mr. Buttons?” Rachel’s voice was barely a whisper.

I turned. She looked up at me, her eyes wide and scared, clutching the hem of her coat. “I forgot him,” she said. “He’s on my bed.”

Mom frowned. “Sweetheart, we don’t have time — ”

“I know, I know. But she can’t sleep without it. I’ll be quick, I promise.” I backed toward the stairs. “Go on — I’ll meet you at the bunker.”

As they disappeared into the night, I turned and ran. The house groaned like it knew I shouldn’t be here. I always used to put others before me and have been doing it since I was born. I never objected to it either, I always accepted it. As I walked toward Zara’s room, I saw Mr. Buttons…..his fluffy bear arm pointed out to the balcony.

Outside the sky gloomed an orange glow. I walked towards the balcony of my old house and I stood frozen. The wood beneath my feet creaked faintly. The air around me felt thick, almost liquid. Time seemed to twist around me, slipping away like water through my fingers. Below, crowds of people were frozen in place, yet they moved backward in slow, disjointed motion, their faces etched with confusion and despair.

*Oh God. It’s happening.*

Suddenly, the sky shattered open in violent fire. The sound of trumpets blasted through the air deep, relentless, overwhelming. My mind scrambled to summon the prayers I had learned by heart since childhood. But the words dissolved before they reached my lips. My tongue felt swollen, heavy paralyzed by an unseen force. Silence filled the void where my prayers should have been.

*I’m not a good Christian. I’m not worthy.*

Then, like a storm of wrath, angels descended immense and terrifying, bringing destruction in their wake. Fear clenched my heart, tears threatening to spill, but beneath the fear was a quiet relief. My family was safe. At least they were safe. And deep down, I knew I had never been among God’s favorites. Not truly. I was indeed destined for hell.

*Then, just as the world crumbled around me, I woke.*

The dream I stopped having after a long time. Maybe it’s her. Maybe she’s stirring it all up. Pulling old ghosts into the light.

*“Get out of my fucking head.”* I whispered

The next morning, I sat at my desk for hours, sifting through years of broadcast logs old paper records, archived tapes, forgotten notes scribbled in the margins of segment rundowns. I even dusted off the crumpled schematics of the phone system we hadn’t used since they upgraded our equipment in 2013. The station had digitized everything but somehow left the analog tapes behind.

Line 3 hadn’t been wired for inbound calls for years. It was supposed to be dead cut off after the fire that gutted our northern relay tower in the winter of 2009. I still remember the headlines: *Local Station Tower Burns Overnight — Cause Unknown.* The fire was blamed on an electrical fault, though some old-timers talked about self-sabotage.

I’d forgotten about it until that night, when I found an old sticky note inside a technician’s manual:

“Line 3 still live. Bad feed. Don’t patch. Static’s too thick; feels wrong. Haunted as hell.”

I remembered the guy who left that note. Kevin something. He used to joke that Line 3 had a mind of its own. “Static’s not just interference,” he said once. “It’s memory with nowhere to go.” I thought he was full of it. A burnout with too many ghost stories in his back pocket.

I didn’t go back on air the next night. Couldn’t bring myself to. I made up some excuse, called in sick. Sat alone in the station’s control room with just the dull red glow of the “ON AIR” sign buzzing overhead like a dying heart monitor.

*But Line 3 lit up anyway.*

The sound came through without me even touching the receiver.

*“You’re leaving me here.”*

The voice was raw, frayed around the edges. Like it had been scraped against metal. Like the static itself was chewing on her.

I didn’t answer. My throat locked. My fingers hovered over the console, unsure whether to pick up or pull the plug.

“Please… the static is getting worse. I can’t hold on much longer.”

Her voice broke halfway through, glitching in and out like a warped tape spool unraveling. I could hear something behind her words too — an ambient pressure, almost like wind trapped inside an engine.

I stayed silent. Not because I didn’t want to answer. But because I couldn’t. I didn’t know *how* to speak to her without collapsing.

Then her tone shifted.

“Do you remember that night in your garage? You were sixteen. You almost did it. You had the bottle and the pills.”

The color drained from my face.

I gasped. *She was right.*

No one knew about that. I never said a word. Not to my family. Not to the few friends I had back then. Not even to a therapist. It was a memory buried so deep I thought I’d sealed it for good.

That night, I’d sat in the corner of the garage with the engine turned off, holding a bottle of my mother’s painkillers and a warm bottle of gin I’d stolen from the pantry. It was December. The light above me flickered. I remember the shadows it made — how the rafters looked like they were closing in.

And then… something stopped me. Not fear. Not guilt. Just… a whisper. Not even a voice, really. More like a feeling that curled around me, firm and invisible, like a hand on my shoulder saying *“Not yet.”*

The line screeched an inhuman, ear-splitting sound that cut through the console and into my skull like a blade. I winced, my hands flying to my ears.

Then, softer:

*“I stopped you.”*

My whole body went cold. I leaned into the mic and whispered, “Who are you?” But there was only static. Endless, trembling static like the sound of someone trying to scream underwater.

*Was I losing my mind? No…. This feels too real.* I started researching. Not casually, not out of curiosity but obsessively, like a man trying to outrun a noose tightening around his neck. Sleep became optional. Food was an afterthought. Every waking moment I wasn’t at the station, I spent in front of my laptop or buried in dusty boxes in the archives.

I dug through every audio archive from the station’s history. Recordings no one had touched in decades. Half-erased tapes, corrupted digital files, forgotten reels with scribbled labels like *“UNCONFIRMED”*, *“TOO MUCH STATIC”*, or simply *“DO NOT AIR.”*

Some were just white noise. Others… weren’t.

Here and there, I heard voices. Distorted, broken transmissions always in the dead air between segments, often just before the hourly station ID. They would rise like bubbles in boiling water. Quick phrases. Gasped names. Laughter that didn’t belong to anyone in the room.

Old DJs had a name for it: *“The space between frequencies.”*

A thin band of audio no one intentionally broadcasted to, but where *something* always seemed to live.

I tracked down every former staff member I could find most had long left the business, a few refused to speak to me. But there was one a former engineer named Ritchie Barnes. He agreed to meet, but only at a dive bar forty miles out of town, well past dark. He was already a few drinks in when I got there. His hands trembled. His eyes were bloodshot, glassy. He wore two wedding rings.

“Line 3?” he slurred, taking a long pull from his whiskey. “Yeah. I remember Line 3.”

I asked what he meant. He didn’t answer right away. Just stared at the melting ice in his glass before finally muttering:

“She called me. My wife. Two years after the funeral. She said she missed me. Said she was cold.”

I thought he was joking until I saw the tears start to fall. Slow, quiet, like something leaking from a cracked pipe.

“I unplugged every goddamn cable in that booth after that,” he said. “It still rang for weeks.”

I left the bar shaken, clutching the napkin he’d scribbled on a time, a date, and the words *“Check the logs. She’s louder on stormy nights.”*

I needed answers. Not speculation, not folklore. I needed *truth*. So, I did something I hadn’t done since my mother’s funeral. *I went back to the pine tree.*

It stood behind the house I grew up in, just beyond the property line, where the woods began. When I was a kid, I thought it was the tallest tree in the world majestic, indestructible. But now, it looked different. Older. Gaunt. The needles were sparse, bark peeling. It was gray and skeletal, but rooted. And at its base, half-buried in the damp earth and dead pine needles, I found something strange. A corner of plastic glinting under the faint light of my phone’s flashlight. I knelt, brushed the dirt away with trembling fingers, and pulled it out.

*A cassette tape*.

Wrapped in faded plastic. No case. No explanation. Just a label, worn but still legible:

*“For Ethan. From Her.”*

My stomach dropped. The handwriting was delicate curling, precise familiar. My mother used to label her recipe cards like that. But she’d been dead for over a decade.

I held the tape in my hand, and for the first time since this all began, I felt something deeper than fear.

*Recognition.*

I brought it to the station that night. I didn’t tell anyone not my producer, not the night manager, not even the security guard who always nodded half-asleep at the front desk. I waited until the building emptied, until even the humming vending machines felt too loud, too alive.

With shaking hands, I slid the cassette into the ancient broadcast deck we kept more for decoration than use. The deck creaked like it remembered things I didn’t. I hit play, bracing for silence.

At first, that’s exactly what I got. A suffocating stillness that filled the booth, thick enough to feel.

Then static low and distant, not like the usual kind. This felt like wind screaming through wires, like grief through teeth. And then…*Her voice*. Clearer than ever…..Almost human.

“I’m in between. Not alive, not gone. I held onto your grief, your voice, your sin. You kept me here. But I’m fading now, Ethan.”

My throat tightened. The booth, already cold, felt like it had sunk beneath ice. I stood there, paralyzed. Her words echoed through me, stirred something I’d buried deep. She sounded… tired.

I didn’t know what to say. So, I spoke from somewhere raw and bleeding, a place I hadn’t touched in years.

“Who are you?”

There was a pause. Long. Endless. A silence so thick I could hear my own pulse, slow and thunderous. I thought she might be gone. That I had lost her again whatever *she* was.

Then:

“I’m what’s left when no one says goodbye.”

And just like that, the room changed.

The air shifted, heavy with something ancient and sorrowful. My breath came out in little clouds. The booth’s lights dimmed to a faint flicker, and every monitor buzzed like angry bees.

Then on the glass wall of the studio, the one that separated me from the recording room…. *I saw her*.

Just a flash. A reflection that wasn’t mine.

She stood behind me long dark hair hanging like drapes around a pale, unblinking face. Eyes like mist. Lips moving, whispering words I couldn’t hear. Not yet.

Then everything went black.

The tape stopped. The lights died. The static swallowed the silence whole.

*And I was alone. Or maybe I never had been.*

They found me the next morning, collapsed in the booth with my head resting against the glass. The cassette deck had long since stopped, the tape spooled out like entrails across the console. I was cold to the touch, my lips cracked, my skin pale. I was dehydrated, disoriented, barely responsive. They said I talked in my sleep for hours muttering fragments of her voice: *pine trees, songs, static, sorrow.* Words that made no sense to anyone else, but felt like a language only I remembered.

They called it a breakdown. Stress. Sleep deprivation. Paranormal suggestion, if they were feeling poetic.

WXDN shut Line 3 down permanently. Or at least, they tried. Tore the wiring out, sealed the feed behind a wall panel like it was some old wound they were too afraid to examine.

But every few weeks, the red light returns. 2:14 a.m., exactly. Always 2:14. Just a soft, steady blink like a heart that refuses to stop beating.

I don’t answer anymore. I tell myself I won’t. But I’ve caught myself standing in the hallway outside the studio, hand hovering near the switch. Listening. Waiting.

Sometimes, buried in the white noise between late-night commercials, I hear her humming. Just a few notes. My mother’s lullaby the one she used to sing before the pills, before the sirens, before the quiet house. Before the silence became something alive.

*She said I never said goodbye.*

But how do you say goodbye to something that was never fully here to begin with? Something that grew inside the spaces you forgot to grieve between childhood and loss, memory and invention?

*I don’t know what’s real anymore. I don’t know if I ever did.*

Last week, I woke up with soil under my fingernails and pine needles in my bed. My front door was locked from the inside.

Yesterday, I found a second cassette on my kitchen counter. No label this time. Just my name, scrawled in handwriting I swear I haven’t seen since I was sixteen.

I haven’t played it yet.

But I keep hearing it in my dreams. A voice, just behind the static, whispering;

*“Let me in.*”

The worst part?

*I think I already did. This will be my final log. Line 3 is on again and I feel her standing behind me.*",2,1750233165.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

✦ How It Connects to Ancient Tile Design:

Historical Roots:
The 3D cube pattern, sometimes called ""tumbling blocks"" or “Q*bert” pattern in modern design, can be traced to classical Greek and Roman tessellations. It was later adopted in European encaustic tiles during the 19th century.

Symbolic Use:
In many cultures, the pattern represented depth, stability, and mathematical beauty, often used in architecture to show dimension without needing actual relief.

Craftsmanship Tradition:
Ancient tilemakers relied on high-precision geometry and hand-mixed glazes—just like we do at Blezz today. Our handmade production process keeps that tradition alive, blending timeless craftsmanship with contemporary branding.


By choosing this pattern, Amazon Café creates more than just a branded space—it tells a story that stretches across centuries, linking today’s customers to a heritage of design and detail that has stood the test of time.

Chapter 1: omega

 Olivia’s POV 

“Wake up, Olivia,” Mom’s voice echoed in my sleep.

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. “Five more minutes, Mom.”

“We don’t have any more minutes,” she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. “Get up now, or we’ll be late.”

 

“Mom,” I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

“Don’t tell me you still want to sleep,” she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. “Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?” Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. “I’m up, I’m up,” I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

“Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,” Mother announced, and my frown deepened. “Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?”

 

“Don’t start,” Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. “Get moving. There’s no time for complaining.”

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We’d grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack’s strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn’t comforted me, hadn’t spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta’s daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha’s sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid’s uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

“Olivia,” my mother called, “I know this isn’t easy, but… we’ve already lost so much. Don’t give them a reason to take more.”

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn’t understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 

“Here,” my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. “She asked for this.”

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

“I’ll find my mate, and all this will be over,” I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn’t ending.

 

Reaching Anita’s room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I’d fallen, and how far she’d risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

“Come in,” Anita’s voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. “Your coffee,” I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man’s voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

“Wait,” Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. “What is this?” she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

“It’s the coffee you requested,” I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

“This?” she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. “You call this coffee?”

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. “It was made in the way you like it,” I said.

 

Anita’s eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 

“Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I’ll dump it on your face.”

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

“I’m sorry if the coffee wasn’t to your liking,” I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. “I’ll remake it.”

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. “Don’t bother,” she said, waving a dismissive hand. “Just try to be less useless next time.”

 

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn’t even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

“You’re dismissed,” he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox’s personal guard. “There you are. Lennox calls for you,”

 

I frowned. “Did he say why?” I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. “Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.”

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox’s room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

I went to a near Starbucks to get some coffee and I thought the boys would be mature enough to be bythemselves but clearly not. When I came back I was approached by anangry mother saying that my kids told this autistic 11 year old boy to take of his clothes in the park,they then took a picture with him and evenwent as far as touching the boys private parts. The child was crying and my two boys were trying not to laugh. I almost started crying at the car while I was screaming at them. When we got to the house I called our driver to pick them up and bring them to their grandma's house. It has been two weeks and I don't know if I want them to come back to the house.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis & Data-Driven Bet: Costa Rica vs. Dominican Republic (CONCACAF Gold Cup)**  
*June 18, 2025 | AT&T Stadium | 80,000 fans ready to scream ""¡Vamos!""*

---

**The Setup:**  
Costa Rica (Los Ticos) vs. Dominican Republic (Los Quisqueyanos) is a clash of *opportunity* and *opportunity’s older, less-coordinated brother*. Costa Rica, fresh off a 4-3 comeback win over Suriname, is riding a 14-goal June tear. The Dominican Republic, meanwhile, lost 3-2 to Mexico but managed to score two goals—proof that even underdogs can occasionally find the back of the net.

**Key Stats & Context:**

* **Costa Rica**: 100% record in this fixture (per Sportskeeda). Their June 2025 games: 14 goals in three matches. Keylor Navas (goalkeeper) is the human version of a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign for opposing strikers.
* **Dominican Republic**: Scored two goals vs. Mexico but also conceded three. Xavier Valdez (goalkeeper) might need to start a support group for defenders.
* **Injuries**: None reported. Both teams’ lineups are as healthy as a vegan buffet at a steakhouse.

**Odds Breakdown (FanDuel):**

* **Costa Rica**: -248 (implied 71% chance)
* **Dominican Republic**: +550 (implied 15% chance)
* **Draw**: +330 (implied 29% chance)

**EV Calculations & Underdog Win Rates:**

* Soccer underdogs win **41%** of the time. The Dominican Republic’s implied 15% is *way* below that, creating a juicy EV gap.
* **Costa Rica’s EV**: If their actual win chance is \~80% (vs. implied 71%), EV = (0.8 \* 1.48) - (0.2 \* 1) = **+0.984**.
* **Dominican Republic’s EV**: If actual win chance is 41% (vs. implied 15%), EV = (0.41 \* 6.5) - (0.59 \* 1) = **+2.075**.

**The Spread & Totals:**

* **Costa Rica -1.0 (-110)**: They’ve outscored opponents by +1 goal in their last two games. Covering this spread feels like a math problem: 4-3 comeback vs. 2-3 loss = **-1.0 is a layup**.
* **Over 2.75 Goals (-110)**: Both teams have averaged 3.5 goals per game in this group. The Over is a **50/50 coin flip** at these odds, but with Costa Rica’s attack and Dominican’s leaky defense, it’s a safer play.

---

**The Verdict:**  
**Best Bet: Costa Rica -1.0 (-110)**

* **Why?** The spread forces Costa Rica to ""win by two,"" but their 4-3 comeback vs. Suriname and the Dominican Republic’s shaky defense make this a near-guarantee. The EV is solid here, and it’s less risky than backing a 15% underdog.
* **Second Bet: Over 2.75 Goals (-110)**
* **Why?** Both teams have combined for 7+ goals in their last two games. Even if the Dominican Republic survives, Costa Rica’s offense will likely keep the Over alive.

**Final Witty Take:**  
Costa Rica isn’t just the favorite—they’re the *mathematical inevitability*. The Dominican Republic’s best chance is to hope Keylor Navas yawns and lets a goal in. But if history’s any guide, that’ll be about as likely as a snowstorm in Texas.

**Prediction**: Costa Rica 3-1 Dominican Republic. Cover the spread. Over the goals.

*“Los Ticos: where the coffee’s strong, the goals are stronger, and the underdogs are just here for the vibes.”* ☕️⚽️

The rain hammered the grimy windows of the abandoned coffee shop like bullets against concrete, each drop carrying the weight of a city drowning in its own contradictions. Steam rose from the cracked asphalt outside, where neon signs flickered their promises of salvation through consumption—*Hero Energy Drinks*, *Villain's Den Gaming Lounge*, *PowerCheck Insurance: For When Your Neighbor Snaps*.

Hinata Shimizu sat across from her oldest friend in a booth that had seen better decades, her golden eyes reflecting the stuttering light of a broken streetlamp. The café had been closed for months, ever since the owner—a pyrokinetic with delusions of grandeur—had tried to hold up a government facility and gotten himself vapor-locked in a containment cell. Now it served as their sanctuary, a place where two powerless girls could speak truths that would get them disappeared in the daylight world.

""You're kidding yourself if you think the heroes are the good guys,"" Ava said, her voice cutting through the ambient noise of a city that never truly slept. She leaned forward, her dark eyes gleaming with the fervor of someone who'd spent too many nights reading leaked government documents and watching bootleg footage of ""heroic interventions"" gone wrong. ""They're just the government's lapdogs with better PR.""

Hinata absently twirled a strand of her blonde hair around her finger, a nervous habit she'd never quite shaken. At seventeen, she was old enough to understand the world's complexities but young enough to still hope for simple answers. The problem was that simple answers didn't exist in a world where twenty-six percent of the population could level city blocks with a thought.

""But they save people,"" Hinata said, though her voice lacked conviction. She'd seen the news footage, the carefully edited reels of heroes swooping in to stop disasters, rescue civilians, maintain order. But she'd also seen what the cameras didn't show—the collateral damage, the ""acceptable losses,"" the way heroes' eyes went cold when they thought no one was watching.

Ava snorted, pulling out her phone and swiping to a video that had been scrubbed from most platforms. ""Remember the Keter-class incident in Chicago last month? The one where Crimson Guard 'heroically' stopped that telekinetic from destroying downtown?""

The footage was grainy, obviously shot from someone's apartment window. Hinata watched as a figure in a red costume engaged with what looked like a terrified teenager floating fifty feet in the air, surrounded by a storm of debris. The official story said the villain had been neutralized with minimal casualties. The bootleg footage showed Crimson Guard crushing the kid's skull with his bare hands while the boy screamed for his mother.

""The kid was having a breakdown,"" Ava continued, her voice steady but her knuckles white where she gripped the phone. ""His powers manifested that morning. He was scared, confused, and instead of trying to talk him down, they executed him on live television and called it justice.""

Hinata felt something cold settle in her stomach. ""That's... that's not what the news said.""

""The news said what the Commission for Powered Individual Oversight told them to say."" Ava's laugh was bitter as old coffee. ""Twenty-four casualties from falling debris, all blamed on the 'villain.' Not a word about how many of those people died from Crimson Guard throwing cars around like confetti.""

The coffee shop felt smaller suddenly, the weight of the conversation pressing down like the storm clouds outside. Hinata had grown up in this world, where children took mandatory Power Manifestation classes alongside math and English, where families lived in fear of their children developing abilities that would mark them as either weapons or targets. She'd watched friends disappear into government ""academies"" or wind up on wanted posters, their only crime being born with the wrong kind of gift.

""So what, we should root for the villains?"" Hinata asked, though she already knew Ava's answer.

""I'm saying we should root for the truth."" Ava leaned back, her expression softening slightly. ""Look, most of the people they label as villains? They're just trying to survive in a system designed to use them up and spit them out. The heroes get government backing, legal immunity, public adoration. The villains get hunted down like animals for refusing to be controlled.""

Outside, a siren wailed past—another powered incident, another life about to be sorted into the neat categories of hero, villain, or casualty. Hinata watched the red and blue lights disappear into the urban maze, thinking about the twenty-six percent chance that someday, that siren might be coming for her.

""What if I manifest?"" she asked quietly. ""What if I wake up next week and I can... I don't know, read minds or turn invisible or level buildings? What then?""

Ava reached across the scarred table and squeezed her friend's hand. ""Then you'll have to choose. Join the system that turns you into a weapon, or fight against it and become their enemy. There's no middle ground anymore, Hinata. The gray areas died with the Powered Registration Act.""

The rain continued its relentless assault on the city, washing the blood from the streets but never quite cleaning the stains from the soul of a world where power meant everything and humanity meant nothing. In the flickering light of the dead café, two powerless girls sat at the crossroads of a revolution they might never live to see, discussing philosophies that could get them killed and futures that might never come to pass.

But in a world where ninety percent of the population could reshape reality with a thought, sometimes the most dangerous people were the ones who still believed in asking the right questions.

## Chapter 2: Winter's Edge

The fluorescent lights of Sakura High's cafeteria buzzed like dying insects, casting everything in that particular shade of institutional yellow that made even the most appetizing food look like cafeteria slop. Christmas decorations hung limply from the ceiling—plastic snowflakes and dollar-store tinsel that did nothing to hide the fact that they were still trapped in the same concrete box where they'd spent the last four months discussing the ethics of state-sanctioned murder.

Hinata picked at her lunch, her mind still processing the conversation from two nights ago. The bootleg footage Ava had shown her played on repeat behind her eyelids, and she found herself studying the faces of her classmates differently. Who among them would manifest powers? Who would become heroes? Who would end up in body bags?

""You're brooding again,"" Ava observed, sliding into the seat across from her. She was followed by her boyfriend Marcus—all six-foot-one of cocky swagger and basketball-honed confidence—and his younger brother Kenji, who moved with the effortless cool that seemed to come naturally to fifteen-year-olds who'd figured out that caring too much about anything was social suicide.

""I don't brood,"" Hinata protested, though the protest sounded weak even to her own ears.

""You absolutely brood,"" Marcus said, stealing a french fry from Ava's tray with the casual entitlement of someone who'd never questioned whether the world owed him anything. ""It's like your default setting. Brood, twirl hair, stare mysteriously into the distance.""

Kenji snorted. ""Leave her alone, Marcus. Not everyone can coast through life on height and a jump shot.""

""Hey, I have other talents,"" Marcus shot back, but his grin took the sting out of it. That was the thing about Marcus—he was arrogant, but he owned it so completely that it almost became charming. Almost.

""Speaking of talents,"" Ava said, pulling out her phone and navigating to a news article, ""did you guys see what Phantom Storm did in Seattle last week?""

The headline screamed across the screen: *KETER-CLASS INCIDENT CONTAINED: DEATH TOLL REACHES 847*. Below it, a grainy photo showed a figure wreathed in what looked like living darkness, standing in the center of what used to be downtown Seattle. The destruction stretched for miles in every direction—not just buildings collapsed, but reality itself seemed to have been twisted into impossible angles.

""Jesus,"" Marcus breathed, his usual cockiness faltering. ""That's... that's a whole city block.""

""Seven city blocks,"" Kenji corrected quietly. ""And they're saying the spatial distortions are permanent. The government's already declared the area a dead zone.""

Hinata stared at the image, something cold crawling up her spine. This wasn't like the footage Ava had shown her—this was raw, unfiltered destruction on a scale that made her brain struggle to process it. ""What was he trying to do?""

""That's the thing,"" Ava said, swiping to another article. ""Nobody knows. Phantom Storm just... appeared. No demands, no manifesto, no apparent motive. He spent six hours reshaping reality like it was clay, and then vanished. The Commission is calling it a 'reality breach incident,' but they won't say what that means.""

Marcus shook his head. ""This is why I'm glad I'm in the seventy-four percent. You know what the worst thing I can do is? Miss a free throw.""

""Don't jinx yourself,"" Kenji warned. ""Powers can manifest as late as twenty-five. You've got seven more years to potentially become a walking apocalypse.""

""Thanks for the pep talk, little brother.""

Hinata found herself studying the destruction in the photo again. There was something almost artistic about it—the way the buildings curved in on themselves, the streets that led to nowhere and everywhere at once. It was horrible, but there was an undeniable beauty in the chaos, a kind of freedom that made her chest feel tight.

""What about the heroes?"" she asked, trying to shake off the strange feeling. ""Where was Crimson Guard? Or Stellar? They're supposed to handle Keter-class threats.""

""Stellar was in New York dealing with that time-loop villain,"" Ava replied, scrolling through her phone. ""And Crimson Guard... well, according to this, he tried to engage Phantom Storm and got his ass handed to him. They're saying he's in critical condition.""

""Crimson Guard got taken down?"" Marcus looked genuinely shocked. ""Dude's supposed to be invincible.""

""Nobody's invincible when reality stops following the rules,"" Kenji said. ""That's what makes Keter-class so dangerous. Euclid-class powers work within the system—super strength, flight, energy projection, stuff like that. But Keter-class? They don't just break the rules, they rewrite them.""

Hinata rubbed her temples, feeling the beginnings of a headache. ""So what's the difference? Like, power-wise?""

""Think of it like this,"" Ava said, leaning forward with the enthusiasm she always got when explaining things. ""Euclid-class heroes and villains? They're still playing the same game as everyone else, just with better stats. Someone like Lightning Rod can throw around electricity that would fry a normal person, but it's still electricity. It follows physics. You can plan around it, counter it, understand it.""

""But Keter-class,"" Kenji continued, ""they're playing a completely different game. Phantom Storm doesn't just manipulate shadows or darkness—he manipulates the concept of space itself. There's no defending against that because the rules you'd use to defend don't apply anymore.""

Marcus frowned. ""So why don't they just, you know, nuke the Keter-class villains from orbit or something?""

""Because half the time, conventional weapons don't work on them,"" Ava explained. ""And the other half, you risk making the situation worse. Remember the Berlin Incident? They tried to take out Void Walker with a tactical nuke. Now there's a permanent black hole where Berlin used to be.""

The conversation was interrupted by a commotion at the next table over, where a group of senior boys were arguing about the upcoming Hero Academy draft. One of them—a kid named David who'd manifested super strength the previous year—was loudly declaring his intention to ""clean up the streets"" once he graduated.

""God, listen to him,"" Ava muttered. ""Six months of government conditioning and he already thinks he's better than everyone else.""

""Maybe he is,"" Hinata said quietly, then immediately regretted it when everyone turned to stare at her.

""Excuse me?"" Ava's voice was dangerously level.

""I mean..."" Hinata felt heat rise in her cheeks. ""Look, I get what you're saying about the system being corrupt and heroes being government weapons and all that. But what if some of them really are trying to help? What if David actually wants to protect people?""

""Then he's an idiot,"" Marcus said bluntly. ""The system will chew him up and spit him out, and he'll either become another government drone or end up dead in some alley because he tried to do the right thing.""

""But what's the alternative?"" Hinata's voice was getting louder, drawing attention from nearby tables. ""Let people like Phantom Storm destroy entire cities? Let the Keter-class villains reshape the world however they want?""

""Maybe the world needs reshaping,"" Ava said quietly.

The words hung in the air like a challenge. Around them, the cafeteria buzzed with the usual pre-winter break energy, but their table had gone deadly silent. Hinata felt something shift inside her chest, a strange pulling sensation that made her hands tremble.

""That's easy to say when you're not one of the 847 people who died in Seattle,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

""And it's easy to defend the system when you've never been crushed by it,"" Ava shot back.

Kenji cleared his throat. ""Guys, maybe we should—""

""No,"" Hinata interrupted, standing up so suddenly that her chair scraped against the floor. ""I'm tired of pretending this is all theoretical. I'm tired of sitting here debating philosophy while people are dying out there. If I had powers—if I manifested tomorrow—I don't know what I'd do. Maybe I'd try to be a hero. Maybe I'd say screw the system and go my own way. But I wouldn't sit here in the cafeteria talking about it like it's some kind of academic exercise.""

The pulling sensation in her chest intensified, and for a moment, the fluorescent lights seemed to flicker. Around her, conversations died as heads turned in their direction. Hinata realized she was breathing hard, her heart pounding like she'd just run a marathon.

""Hinata,"" Marcus said carefully, ""are you okay? You look—""

""I'm fine,"" she said, though she wasn't. The lights were definitely flickering now, and she could swear she felt electricity dancing along her skin. ""I just... I need some air.""

She grabbed her backpack and fled the cafeteria, leaving her friends staring after her in confused silence. As she pushed through the double doors, she didn't see the way the vending machine in the corner sparked and went dark, or how every electronic device within a twenty-foot radius of their table briefly displayed nothing but static.

But Kenji saw. And as he watched Hinata disappear down the hallway, he made a mental note to keep a very close eye on his brother's girlfriend's best friend. Because in a world where twenty-six percent of the population could reshape reality, the most dangerous moment was always right before someone's powers manifested.

Winter break was still two weeks away, but something told him that by the time they came back to school, everything would be different.

## Chapter 3: The Weight of Dreams

*The city burned around her in shades of electric blue and silver, skyscrapers twisted into impossible spirals that reached toward a sky that flickered between day and night with each heartbeat. Hinata stood in the center of it all, her hands crackling with energy that felt like liquid lightning, like the birth and death of stars contained in her fingertips.*

*She was screaming—had been screaming for what felt like hours—but no sound came out. The power coursed through her veins like molten metal, beautiful and terrible and completely beyond her control. Every pulse sent another wave of destruction rippling outward, reality bending and breaking under the weight of her fear.*

*Bodies littered the streets below. Hundreds of them. Thousands. People who had been going about their ordinary lives until she—*

*""Please,"" she whispered, though her voice was lost in the roar of collapsing dimensions. ""Please, I don't know how to stop.""*

*But the power didn't care about her pleas. It fed on her terror, growing stronger with each sob, each desperate attempt to contain what couldn't be contained. This was what a Keter-class incident looked like from the inside—not malice or ambition, but pure, overwhelming fear.*

*Then she saw him.*

*Crimson Guard lay at her feet, his invincible armor cracked like an eggshell, his perfect hero's face frozen in an expression of shock and agony. The man who had crushed a terrified teenager's skull without hesitation, who had stood as the government's golden symbol of order and control, reduced to nothing more than meat and bone and shattered dreams.*

*Something shifted inside her chest. The fear didn't disappear, but it... changed. Transformed into something else entirely. The power still raged through her, but now it felt different—not like a wild animal tearing her apart from the inside, but like an extension of herself. Like coming home.*

*She looked down at the broken hero and felt her lips curve into a smile that would have terrified her waking self.*

*""I'm not sorry,"" she whispered, and meant it.*

*The city continued to burn, but now the flames danced to her rhythm.*

---

Hinata jolted awake, her sheets soaked with sweat and her heart hammering against her ribs like a caged bird. The taste of copper filled her mouth—she'd bitten her tongue hard enough to draw blood. Around her, the digital clock flickered erratically, the numbers jumping between 6:47 AM and random sequences of symbols before settling back to normal.

She sat up slowly, her hands shaking as she pushed damp hair away from her face. The dream had felt so real she could still smell the ozone and smoke, could still feel the electric hum of power beneath her skin. But it was the smile that haunted her most—the way she'd looked down at Crimson Guard's broken body and felt nothing but satisfaction.

*What kind of person am I becoming?*

The question followed her through her morning routine, through breakfast with parents who didn't notice her pale complexion or the way electronics seemed to glitch whenever she got too close. By the time she stepped outside to meet Ava for their walk to school, she'd almost convinced herself it was just stress about winter break, about finals, about the conversation in the cafeteria two days ago.

Then she saw Marcus waiting by the corner, and she knew immediately that something was wrong.

""Where's Ava?"" she asked, noting the tense set of his shoulders, the way his usually perfect hair looked like he'd been running his hands through it.

""She's coming,"" he said, but his voice was flat, empty of its usual cockiness. ""We need to talk. All of us.""

Ava appeared a few minutes later, took one look at her boyfriend's face, and immediately went into crisis mode. ""What happened? Is someone hurt? Did your parents—""

""Kenji manifested,"" Marcus said quietly.

The words hung in the December air like smoke. Hinata felt something cold settle in her stomach that had nothing to do with the weather.

""When?"" Ava asked.

""Last night. Around three AM."" Marcus started walking, his hands shoved deep in his pockets. ""I heard him screaming and ran to his room. There was... fuck, there was so much light. Not regular light—something else. Something that made my eyes water just looking at it.""

""What's his classification?"" Hinata asked, though she already suspected the answer from the haunted look in Marcus's eyes.

""Three percent,"" he said. ""They're calling it 'photonic manipulation,' but that doesn't cover it. He doesn't just control light—he controls the *concept* of illumination. Visibility itself. The Commission rep who showed up this morning took one look at the readings and went white as a sheet.""

They walked in silence for a block, each lost in their own thoughts. Three percent meant Kenji was in that terrifying middle ground between Euclid and Keter—powerful enough to reshape local reality, but not quite at the level where governments considered you a walking apocalypse. It was almost worse in some ways. Keter-class villains got the full attention of the world's most powerful heroes. Three-percenters got caught in the crossfire.

""What's he going to do?"" Ava asked finally.

Marcus's laugh was bitter. ""That's the problem. He's talking about going hero—official Commission training, the whole thing. Says he wants to take down the 'real threats,' the Euclid-class villains who think they can terrorize normal people.""

""And you don't approve?"" Hinata guessed.

""I don't approve of him throwing his life away for a system that'll use him up and discard him the moment he becomes inconvenient."" Marcus stopped walking, turning to face them with an expression of raw frustration. ""You know what the life expectancy is for three-percent heroes? Eighteen months. Eighteen fucking months, because they're powerful enough to handle the dangerous missions but not powerful enough to guarantee they'll survive them.""

""So talk to him,"" Ava said.

""I tried. We had a fight this morning that..."" Marcus trailed off, shaking his head. ""I've never seen him angry like that. Really angry, not just teenage attitude. The whole house went dark for about ten seconds, and when the lights came back on, there were scorch marks on the walls where he'd been standing.""

Hinata thought about her dream, about the way power had felt coursing through her veins. ""Maybe he needs to make his own choice.""

Both of them stared at her.

""I mean,"" she continued, heat rising in her cheeks, ""maybe that's what being powerful means. Having to choose your own path, even if other people think it's wrong.""

""That's rich coming from someone who's never had to make that choice,"" Marcus snapped, then immediately looked guilty. ""Sorry, I didn't mean—""

""No, you're right,"" Hinata said quietly. ""I haven't had to make that choice. But maybe that's exactly why I can see it clearly. You're so afraid of losing your brother that you're trying to make his decisions for him.""

""And you're so desperate to find meaning in this fucked-up world that you're romanticizing the same system that crushes people like us,"" Marcus shot back.

The argument might have escalated, but they'd reached the school, and the sight of the familiar concrete building reminded them all that they were still just teenagers trying to navigate a world that had grown too complex for simple answers.

""This isn't over,"" Marcus said as they climbed the steps to the main entrance.

""No,"" Hinata agreed, watching a group of students practice their powers in the designated training area—a senior with super speed running laps that left trails of fire, a junior levitating textbooks while simultaneously solving equations in the air with energy constructs. ""I don't think it is.""

As they pushed through the doors into the familiar chaos of high school hallways, none of them noticed the way the electronic lock sparked and died the moment Hinata's hand touched the handle. But in a building full of teenagers with supernatural abilities, one more glitch in the system was easy to overlook.

The final football game before winter break was tomorrow night, and everyone knew that in a school where twenty-six percent of the student body could bend reality to their will, the real game was never played on the field. It was played in the spaces between power and restraint, between ambition and fear, between the heroes they were expected to become and the people they actually were.

And somewhere in that space, Hinata Shimizu was beginning to understand that her choice might not be between hero and villain at all.

It might be between control and chaos.

Between the person she'd always been and the person her dreams were telling her she could become.",1,1750232317.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Weight loss, hair doubling in thickness, clear skin, better mood.","I discovered the pro-metabolic ""diet/not diet"" in 2023. It had the Ray Peat flare. I incorporated milk for the first time in my life, red meat, and more protein than I ever had in my life. I believe I've always been under-nourished, I didn't make it to 100 pounds until 19 or so. I had *never* focused on my protein intake until the last couple years. 

Daily I eat: 2 eggs, spicykraut, rice, and chicken sausage for breakfast. My go-to snack is a bowl of bluebs and pumpkin seeds with cinnamon, highly anti-inflammatory. I eat popcorn almost nightly for the extra fiber and polyphenols. I also drink Olipops for some fiber in a fun way. I get extra protein through cottage cheese, Chomps beef sticks, and a collagen supplement in my morning coffee. 

Looking back, I'm amazed at my hair regrowth! I also attribute this to implementing vitamin d and iron as I was deficient in both. 

For a while I was taking reishi, chaga, and turkey tail hoping those would help with higher androgens. But I learned about the heavy metals and issues with long term use. I lost 10 pounds and have not gained it back since stopping those! My mom also concluded that her mushroom coffee has caused her to gain 15 lbs, within the last 3 years of use!

What I find most interesting is the benefit of adding milk & red meat. I was always hearing one should never consume those due to a plethora of reasons. Mainly the inflammation. But I could see how balancing it out with the berries, and other antioxidant-rich foods, would help.

I wanted to share some of journey, in hopes it encourages someone! Nourishment has served me *greatly* in every area of my life. 

One more thing if anyone is interested...chiropractic care was huge for releasing stuck emotions that were keeping my life stagnant. I moved and discovered flexibility where I never had it before. This prompted a profound mental shift as well, as my body was softening and releasing...my mind finally could. I started viewing my issues, without attaching myself to them. My main mantra has been, ""Just because it is like this today, doesn't mean tomorrow will be. We change, grow, and heal"".

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.

I didn't have enough pulls to get Escoffier on her first banner, so I preferred to get Skirk first.

Doomposters were adamant: without Escoffier she's 100% useless, sidegrade to Ayaka, etc. etc.

In my own calculations, with the gear and teams I've got, even without Escoffier she came out as my second best team (roughly 71k, instead of the 94k I would have got with Escoffier (R1 Finale though, lack of billets), only 24% lower, not the alleged 40%), so I said: fuck them, I'll pull her.

All I had before for the second half was a shoddily built C0R0 Ayaka. I gave her one try, I only got 33 stars, within 20s over the limit for each chamber. I didn't bother to retry and waited until I got Skirk. With artifacts on roughly the same level (Gladiator set(!), 210CV) and also C0R0 (as all my characters), I got 36 stars ON THE FIRST FUCKING TRY, even if I botched the rotations in the process.

Granted, this abyss is tailor made for her, but still, if that's without Escoffier, then with her she will be Mavuika level of broken. (and Mavuika indeed calcs at 94k too with the gear I've got)",2,1750231924.0,SkirkMains,3,0.58,False

Is it worth trying to pursue anything or am I just being delusional?,"Back to my throwaway account and this may be a stupid question after clarification and hopefully not the wrong sub (didn't seem to really fit a relationship so I didn't put it on the relationship advice subreddit).

I (24m) happened to be getting an oil change at the exact same time as this girl (maybe a few years older than me) and we were the only people there for maybe about 40 minutes. Pulled up at the same time, walked in at the same time, etc. Absolutely gorgeous, really well put together outfit, and I really enjoyed the conversation we ended up having. She just decided to start the conversation by making a note of Pawn Stars which was playing on the TV, and we just went from there. Not sure if it was out of boredom or other reason. Got to learn about her career, degrees, a little about her family and growing up, and we just got to talk about odd and random topics. 

I don't always do well in random conversations, but this one felt much more comfortable. Just felt like I clicked with her. She seemed to really enjoyed the conversation to, and felt like we actually made a good initial connection. Well the time when both our oil changes are finished rolls around and I just sort of ended the conversation, said it was nice meeting her, and was on my way. 

Did I want to ask her for her number and to get a coffee or something to get to know her more? Absolutely! To also clarify, no question of relationships came up so she could have been in one and I not know. But this leads me to my questions/advice:

1. Would this have been weird to ask in the situation? Should I have just gone for it? Sounds silly, but genuinely bad with this kind of stuff. Maybe it's the adult loneliness kicking in or I have other issues to deal with.

2. Would it be genuinely insane/crazy to think maybe finding her/meeting her again and asking then is out of the picture? Same small college town, fairly empty in the summer, both know each others first names, degrees, where each other works, etc. A couple of people I asked don't think so, but my internal monologue says ""creepy"" immediately and I'd like unbiased opinions. Guess this also boils down to a pursuant mentally or fate mentally question as well, or maybe I'm absolutely delusional!

Happy to answer clarifying questions, add in more details, and so on to the best of my abilities.

Chapter 1: Excitement and Exceeding Expectations,"The year is 20XX, and humanity continues its walk into the future side-by-side with robots. Once a fantastic idea yet seemingly impossible dream of the past, the current era of technology and robotics has borne fruit that no one could have predicted. Robots, fully functioning, articulate in movement, design, and even thought, now exist alongside their human creators, helping them build new wonders and learn more about the world and the greater universe. How did all this come about? One man and a dream. One man with an unrivaled love for his fellow man that poured over into his robotic creations. That man, Doctor Thomas Light, created a revolutionary piece of technology, the Integrated Circuit, that possessed the first ever 'cognitive circuit' and breathed life into robots. This technology, with all its unlimited capabilities, will push both humanity and robots towards the future, but whether it's bright or not will depend on whether there are still people who wish to carry on the love and hope Doctor Light held onto so deeply.

One such individual, or one who believed he felt the same, woke from a dreamless sleep one night to a soft glow pouring into his room through the cracks of his bedroom door. ""What the?"" He mumbled half-awake. ""Is she still working? I thought she turned in for the night…"" He got out of bed and slipped his feet into a pair of light-gray slippers. He ran his fingers through the bedhead mess of black hair on his head as he walked towards the door. He yawned as he opened the door and peeked into the hall. To his left and at the end of the hall was a closed door with more light pouring out from the cracks. ""I know we have a few projects due in a few weeks, but she doesn't need to push herself so hard…""

He walked down the hall and stopped at the door. He could hear the buzzing of computer monitors, the whirring of cooling fans, and the occasional ping of a pop-up. He shook his head and sighed. ""Workaholic."" He snickered a little. ""Wonder where she gets it from."" He remembered the moment he activated her, and she wrote her first words on her original monitor. He opened the door and walked in, standing at the top of a long, carpeted staircase. At the bottom, the source of light and sound continued away as if he weren't there. He walked slowly down, holding onto the polished wooden railing to his right. He reached the bottom and found himself in his underground workshop. To his left was a large table covered in parts of various shapes, sizes, and materials, with shelves full of similar parts behind it and lining the entire wall. To his right, a half-dozen black CPU towers taller and wider than him hummed along as four monitors further right displayed data, code, schematics, and some test videos, the soft glow of the monitors illuminating his middle-aged frame and mint green pajamas. A few more pop-ups appeared, and some closed as the seconds passed. ""Hey."" The man said.

**Doctor Nikola Cradle**

**Robotics Engineer**

**Robot Institute of Technology Graduate**

**PHD in Electrical Engineering and Robo-Psychology**

**Caffeine Addict**

""Is there a reason you're still up?"" Doctor Cradle asked. The data on the monitors froze.

""…Yes, Doctor. I'm having a hard time letting myself rest."" A voice, a woman's, spoke behind him. It was soft, but it carried a sense of confidence and sternness to it. ""Tomorrow is the big day, and I want to make a good impression.""

""It's too late for that. Most already know about you and the work we've done. How many Robots have we manufactured now?""

A pop-up appeared on the central monitor. ""As of last week, we've built thirty-four commissions deemed sufficient and successful Robot Masters. We have six more on the docket.""

""And we're far ahead of schedule. Get some rest.""

""I don't need rest.""

Doctor Cradle walked up to the monitor showing the data. ""Yes, you do. I did not build you to run twenty-four seven. If a Human doesn't do it, then a Robot, or more specifically, an AI like you, shouldn't have to do it either."" He looked to his right, checking another monitor. He sighed. ""Are those Gelid Man and Watt Man's diagnostics?""

""Affirmative. Tsubakuro Precision Machining and A.R.R.T. Industries both sent their appreciation for the continued service. I received the work orders and am currently verifying if the requests match industry standards and costs.""

""Hera."" Doctor Cradle smiled.

""Yes?""

""This can wait. I can either perform a manual shut-off to give you a break, or you can work for another,"" He looked up at an analog clock on the wall. 2:14. ""Fifteen minutes. Your choice.""

Doctor Cradle could hear the cooling fans in the CPU towers slow down a little. ""I think…I'll call it good, Doctor.""

""Thank you."" He stepped up to the monitor, barely a meter away from it. On top of the central monitor, a camera opened up and aimed down towards him. ""Hera, it's okay to be nervous.""

""Is it? We've only been at this for a few years. The Robot Masters we built still stand amongst the greatest innovations in the past two decades, but for how long? They perform their jobs well, they get along with their fellow robots and humans, and some even found new passions, but there's still something I cannot put my finger on that makes them feel…incomplete.""

Doctor Cradle stared into the camera, his gaze softening. *Is this a continuation of her original programming? Or is this something new? Many Robot Masters do begin forming personalities far outside of what is expected. I think I recall Mikhail building an Arctic exploration Robot Master that developed a passion for figure skating, or a fire safety Robot Master built by Tsubakuro learning martial arts. Could this be something similar?*

""I am scared people will see these imperfections and hate them. Doctor, is this normal?""

""Perfectly. It's no different than a parent worrying for his or her children. It's how I felt when you first woke up.""

""It is?""

""Afraid so. What's important to remember is that, as a parent, you can only do so much to prepare your children for the world. How they interact with it, how it interacts with them, and whether they succeed or fail, a part *does* rest with you. However, more important than that is trust. Not in the process, but in the kids themselves to hold their own. Trust them, Hera. Trust in their ability to respond and acclimate.""

The room went silent for a moment. The camera looked at the room behind Cradle, catching sight of a small metal desk with a black desktop and keyboard. To the left of the keyboard was a wooden-framed picture. The camera locked onto it for a few seconds, then looked back down at Cradle. ""It's difficult.""

""But necessary. I'm going to bed, Hera. Don't stay up.""

""I promise, Doctor."" Cradle nodded, turning from the monitor and walking back to the stairs. He climbed up them and left. All the pop-ups, windows, and tabs slowly vanished as Hera saved her work. *Doctor, tomorrow is far more important than you know.* She thought. *Tomorrow, I will finally meet him. The one who may hold what I need to help our Robots.* One new image appeared on her screen. A blue and cyan robot with the face of a young child, his green eyes full of determination, as the cannon on his arm fired a flash of energy towards a green shield-wielding robot with one red eye. *The key to our future lies in you, Mega Man.*

***The Next Day***

***Mega City***

***Robotics Expo***

Mega City, a city in the Northeastern Region of the United States, and the heart of all things robotics in recent decades. Home to the Robotics Institute of Technology and the growing giant Mecha-Chuchets Institute of Robology, it is one of the four sites in the annual rotation of the Robotics Expo and is held at the Bot-ston Convention and Exhibition Center. While on the surface, it is a chance for normal civilians to get a chance to see the newest, coolest, and exciting innovations in robotics, it is also a fierce battleground between robotics companies for future contracts. It was on this bright sunny spring day that several industries, ranging from the Military, entertainment, wildlife preservation and pollution control/reduction, construction, and transportation, sent their scouts to scope out potential business partners. All in all, it's a fun event acting as the veneer of a cut-throat competition.

Within this proverbial den of thieves is one man who long left that world behind him, much like his gray hair left behind the brunette of his youth. He was a man of short stature, barely reaching 165 centimeters despite the larger-than-life persona many had of him, with grayed hair and a thick mustache and beard, who today, like most days, wore his favorite white lab coat and lucky light-blue button shirt, blue tie with white polka dots, tan pants, and brown loafers.

He inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly. ""Ah…nothing like the Expo's first day!"" Doctor Light said, walking through the center's entrance. Next to him were a young boy and girl who, had they not known him, could have mistaken him for Santa Claus. The young boy had messy black hair and green eyes and wore a white shirt with blue sleeves, brown cargo shorts, and orange sneakers. On his shirt was a blue twenty-three. The girl to his right had blonde hair in a raised ponytail held in place by a green ribbon and eyes the same shade of blue as her father. Contrasting her brother's blue and white, she wore a red dress with short black sleeves with a small white collar and hood, her pointed shoes the same shade of red as her dress, and the shoes' ankles the same white as her hood. Had no one known who *they* were would be forgiven for not knowing they were robots.

""Doctor Light!"" Someone to the man's right called, with a slight hint of a Russian accent. Doctor Light looked, recognizing the voice as a young girl's and the accent from a few trips to St. Petersburg for other Expos, and saw a young girl with long blonde hair, green eyes in a sky-blue blouse, navy jeans, and white sneakers. She raced towards him and the two children with him. ""Rock! Roll!""

""Well, well!"" Doctor Light said, a big smile growing on his bushy face. ""If it isn't Kalinka!""

**Kalinka Mikhailovna Cossack**

**Daughter of Mikhail Cossack**

**Ballet Dancer & Pianist**

**Secretly wishes to become a princess**

""I thought you and your father were staying back in St. Petersburg this year!""

""We were, but Papa was asked by Tundra Man for a chance to show off his ice-skating."" She looked behind her and pointed to a small ice rink surrounded by a growing crowd of people. In it, a tall, slender Robot Master glided on the ice, performing an impromptu routine. Most of his body was a navy blue skin-tight suit covered in purple armor with ice crystals embedded on his shins, encircling wrists, and jutting out of his chest armor like an open vest. As he pirouetted, his long braided ponytail made of ice shards twirled around him as he spun effortlessly on his golden ice skates. His face was covered by a white mask, but his focused red eyes could still be seen as he made small glances towards the growing crowd.

**The Subzero Ice Skater**

**Tundra Man**

**DWN-085**

He lifted his left leg and leaned over, creating perfect balance as he performed a camel spin, his ice-crystal ponytail flowing behind him. He straightened back up and tucked his arms in, spinning faster. The air around his body began to shimmer with ice crystals as he picked up speed. He immediately stopped, letting the small tornado rise around him as he closed his eyes and bowed. The crowd clapped and cheered, some even whistled. Rock saw Tundra Man rise from his bow and stare at the crowd, the joy growing with each passing second. ""You're all so cool!"" He said. ""Feel freeze to take pictures!""

""He didn't have a chance to demonstrate his skills up in the Arctic, and I wanted to show Papa what he was working on,"" Kalinka continued. ""He's still no Evgeni Plushenko, but he practices constantly, and the results show.""

""What a marvelous routine!""

""He's so beautiful on the ice like that!"" Roll added.

""Yeah. Beats fighting him any day."" Rock commented. He recalled their battle, where Tundra Man blitzed around a museum with grace and agility while pummeling him with freezing blasts of cold air and skating techniques.

A figure broke through the crowd, a middle-aged man in a yellow button-up shirt, brown slacks, loafers, and a green tie. He had a scruffy brown beard, mustache, and messy hair, and his black-framed glasses framed his joyful green eyes. He smiled as he ran towards Doctor Light and the kids.

**Ballet Enthusiast**

""Well, Thomas? What'd you think?"" He asked, his pride showing.

""I think he was wonderful! I had no idea Tundra Man had been working so hard on such a passion."" Doctor Light answered. ""When did he start?""

""A few years back, after watching an ice-skating competition. I knew he was practicing, but it wasn't until I saw him perform that I knew he needed to be seen."" He turned back to watch Tundra Man taking photos with some of the crowd, camera phones clicking and occasionally flashing. ""Can you imagine the possibilities? He could be a coach, a choreographer, or even compete!""

""Robots competing with Humans?"" Rock asked.

""It's possible, but working out the kinks may take some time."" Doctor Light answered. ""Tundra Man is a rare type of Robot Master. Going beyond his original programmed assignment and learning figure skating is innovative, but there may be those who see a Robot capable of such a thing as an unfair advantage.""

""But he wasn't designed for it, right?"" Roll asked.

""True, and that gives leeway."" Light and Cossack both smiled at the idea. ""Ah! By the way, Mikhail, is Nikola here?""

""Cradle? Yeah,"" Doctor Cossack pointed his thumb at the back of the convention center. ""He's back there, already set up with H.E.R.A. Checking up on him?""

""He did send me the invitation. Would be rude not to go see him!""

Doctor Cossack nodded. ""Then I won't keep you. I'd go, but I need to keep Tundra Man from getting worked up."" He looked back and saw Tundra Man striking poses. ""Well, it seems I'm too late.""

""We'll meet back up later. See you then!""

""Rock! Roll! I'm performing one of my routines in a few weeks in Moscow. Please come watch!"" Kalinka said, her eyes shining at the two.

*She's…shining too brightly.* Rock thought.

*It's almost too much!* Roll thought.

Both sighed. ""We'll be there…""

Kalinka jumped and cheered. The two parties went their separate ways, and the Light family headed towards the back.

Their walk back was full of booths and stages for companies to display their newest mechanical feats. Construction robots, automated delivery vehicles, robot caretakers, the newest generation of prosthetics with kung-fu grip, and dexterity advanced enough to play the piano. Rock and Roll marveled at each booth they passed, while many of the people in those booths would call out Doctor Light, asking him to check out their work. He would politely decline each time, but the few moments Rock and Roll looked at him, they could see how happy he was.

""Doctor Light, why aren't you checking out the booths? Everyone seems excited to show you their cool stuff."" Roll asked.

""I used to do it a lot actually, but I found more often than not, I'd get so wrapped up with each one of them I'd spend entire days at these expos and only walk about thirty meters."" He scratched the back of his head, blushing slightly. ""Plus, I'm independent. Sometimes, those companies would try to hire me on the spot to get a leg up on the competition, and I just don't have it in me anymore to get involved in the old rat race."" Both kids looked up at him while they walked.

""Rat race?"" Rock asked.

""It means a very competitive work environment to collect power and wealth. I never got involved in all this for that. When I was young, it robbed me of my joy and passion, which is why I left it and started Light Labs. It gives me a chance to do the work I love at a pace I enjoy,"" He smiled at the two. ""with the people and robots I cherish. Plus,"" The three passed a booth for the newest farming Robot Masters, Dairy Man and Bacon Man, and reached their destination. ""I get to explore the Expo rather than work in it and meet all kinds of people and robots! Like that man right there."" Ahead of them, in a light-gray lab coat in a red button-up shirt, khaki pants, and black leather shoes, was Doctor Nikola Cradle at his booth. In front of him was a cloth-covered table with four different-shaped models labeled H.E.R.A. Ver 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, & 3.0 next to a sleek, gray laptop opened towards the crowd and displayed *H.E.R.A.* on the screen in bright cyan letters.

""Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the most recent success stories of Cradle Computers!"" Doctor Cradle waved his hand out behind him to four flat-screen TVs in front of a blue curtain, playing videos of several Robot Masters at work. One showed a red odd-shaped one with large hands transporting magma in his shoulder canisters. Another showed a gray canine-esque one sprinting down the Arctic. The third, an orange robot that looked like a football player throwing passes, then running down the field to catch them, and the fourth, a green robot jumping through trees and monitoring a large forest. He then waved his left hand to the left. ""And the Robot of the Hour!"" Next to him was a Robot Master in white armor over a black skin-tight suit. The heels of his black feet were rounded, and the white armor over his upper body had a pair of delta wings on the back and a tail fin nestled between the wings. His head was encased in a white helmet with a visor reminiscent of a space shuttle's nose, save for his blue eyes.

**The Space Cowboy**

**Shuttle Man**

**HMN-012**

**Space Exploration and Satellite Maintenance Robot**

**Enjoys stargazing, but is bad with crowds**

""Shuttle Man! He just returned a few days ago from an experimental space mission to repair the GOES-16 and succeeded with flying colors!""

""Another successful venture between Humankind and Robots!"" A woman's voice from the laptop said.

""One-hundred percent, H.E.R.A.!""

Shuttle Man slightly waved his right hand sheepishly to the crowd as the crowd stared at him in amazement. Several children ran to the front of the crowd, followed by their exasperated parents. Doctor Light, Roll, and Rock waited at the back, observing the presentation.

""He went into space?"" Rock asked.

""He most certainly did,"" Doctor Light answered. ""I followed the story for the few weeks he was up there. He took off from the space station and broke through the atmosphere all on his own, and reached the satellite within just two hours."" A smile grew on his face. ""He joined the crew up there, completed the repair within a few hours, and then returned to Earth in just a few hours. Some are considering him the new gold standard for space travel and research!""

""Really? Wow…"" Shuttle Man nervously scanned the crowd. ""He seems…kind of uncomfortable.""

""Oh dear, he is, isn't he? Guess he's the type more comfortable working!""

""Any questions about Shuttle Man and the other Robots can be directed towards me or H.E.R.A. here."" Doctor Cradle gestured to the laptop. He gently nudged Shuttle Man, and Shuttle Man nodded before stepping away. He looked one more time at the crowd and stopped. He saw something and started walking into the crowd as Doctor Cradle continued talking about his other Robots. Many in the crowd looked his way as he walked before looking back at the booth. He stopped just in front of the trio, towering over all three at nearly 220 centimeters.

""Holy cow, it's you guys!"" Shuttle Man said, his lively voice betraying his tall frame. ""I've only heard about you two in books and on TV!""

""Huh?"" Roll muttered.

""The Father of Robotics, and two of the first ever Robot Masters!"" He reached out his right hand. ""It's a pleasure to meet you all!""

Doctor Light reached out and grasped his hand, shaking it. ""The pleasure is ours, Shuttle Man! Seems like the limelight's a little much for you."" Light released his grip, and he extended his hand to Rock and Roll, both shaking it at their turn.

""It is…a lot more than I'm used to. My siblings Spell Man and Jest Woman are much better with crowds than me.""

""Understandable. By the way, which Robots are being showcased besides you? I don't recognize the ones on the TVs.""

""Oh! The red one is Paleo Man, the white is Gelid Man, the football player is Blitz Man, and the green one is Nock Woman. They each received accolades from the companies they work for, so Doctor Cradle wanted to show them off alongside H.E.R.A. and me.""

""H.E.R.A.?"" Roll asked.

Shuttle Man looked over to her. ""Yep. The Heuristic Evolutionary Robot-Master Assembler, or H.E.R.A. for short. She is the first-ever artificial intelligence designed to build Robot Masters, and she custom-makes the Robots for companies based on their needs and upcoming projects.""

""That's so cool!""

""Right?"" He leaned down. ""Hey, do you guys want to meet her?""

""Can we?""

""Why not? She's busy answering questions right now with Doc, but she'd be excited to meet you all!""

Behind Shuttle Man and at the front of the crowd, Doctor Cradle continued talking about the Robots. H.E.R.A., however, was focused on Shuttle Man and the trio, her camera aimed straight at Rock. Shuttle Man turned and gestured them towards the booth. He started walking with them in tow just as the demonstration ended and the crowd began to disperse. H.E.R.A. continued to focus on Rock while he stood there next to Roll and Shuttle Man.

""Nikola!"" Doctor Light said as he walked up to Doctor Cradle.

""Doctor Light?!"" A wide, child-like smile grew across his face.

""Nikola, I told you years ago to stop that. It's Thomas between colleagues and friends.""

""You know that's weird for me, but I'll try. I didn't know you were coming today!""

""I always try to make the first day. People are usually more on their game, and that shine in their eyes is still there."" He shook his head. ""I remember doing these and by the third or fourth day, I was living off of about two pots of coffee.""

""I…am already on two…"" Light burst out laughing and slapped Cradle on the back.

""I don't think I've ever seen Doctor Light so lively,"" Rock said.

""It's kind of nice!"" Roll added. ""He's usually kind of daydreaming or super-focused on something.""

""Your creator does that, too?"" Shuttle Man asked.

""All the time! But he's always super nice to everyone, even Auto, his assistant!""

*Why do I feel a little bad for this 'Auto?'* Shuttle Man thought.

""Also, why didn't you tell me about H.E.R.A.? She helped you build all these Robots?"" Light and Cradle both looked over to the laptop.

""Truth be told, she does a lot of it herself now. It was a partnership initially, but after Versions 2.5 and 3.0 were developed with an internal assembly system, she is now capable of creating Robot Masters as long as the parts are available. Right now, we're in Beta for 3.5.""

""What's next for 3.5?""

""I'll be able to assemble custom parts alongside assembling Robots,"" H.E.R.A. said from the laptop with a tinge of excitement in her voice. ""Normally, we have to outsource custom parts, but once done, I can build nearly anything…as long as I don't get struck with IP infringement."" She chuckled nervously.

""This is H.E.R.A.?""

""Her portable form, yes, buuuut there is something I wanted to show off tomorrow. Did not want to play my hand just yet, but for you…Thomas, I think a little spoiler won't hurt."" He crouched down and reached under the table. He pulled out a cardboard box, opened it up, and pulled out a headset with a tinted lens and ear-covering headphones. ""Voila! The H.E.R.A. interface! When worn, anyone can interact with H.E.R.A.'s library of blueprints and assemble a custom Robot Master for her to assemble.""

""That seems impressive, but why that way? Wouldn't it be easier to just use an application online?""

""We tried that, but every time we made a website and tried connecting it to H.E.R.A., it would crash and cause a power outage."" He winced. ""I never thought I would get *used to* seeing the blue screen of death.""

""My database right now is too complex and massive for a safe interface with the greater internet,"" H.E.R.A. added. ""But it does give us a chance to show off our work with a personal touch rather than just through screens.""

Doctor Light nodded. ""It's important we keep that human touch when it comes to Robots. It helps us remember these are not just tools, but fellow experts who help us solve the problems of the world.""

""You're too kind, Doctor,"" H.E.R.A. said. ""Would anyone like to try the interface? Rock?""

""Me?"" Rock asked, looking at the laptop screen.

""Sure. It's not just for human use. It was designed for Robots, too. Roll can try it after you as well.""

Roll turned to Light. ""Can we, please?""

Doctor Light looked over to Cradle, who shrugged and nodded. ""Sure, why not? Rock?""

""Sure!"" Rock walked over to Cradle, who slipped the interface on his head. He adjusted to fit Rock's head, then flicked a switch on the top.

""Rock, you ready?"" Cradle asked.

""Ready!""

""H.E.R.A., you're on!""

""On it!"" Rock heard a soft hum as the interface turned on. The expo center, darkened by the tinted lens, vanished as a light appeared in front of his eyes. The light enveloped everything in sight, turning everything white.

""Whoa…"" Rock whispered.

""It's normal for people to be a bit overwhelmed the first time they do it. I was,"" Cradle said to Light, smiling while crossing his arms.

""He's gone completely still,"" Doctor Light said. ""Is this normal?""

""I record myself doing this about thirty times and Shuttle Man about sixty times. When Robots do it, this happens because they're interfacing on a deeper level than we humans can.""

The light faded, and a vast, vaulted, circular room began to form. Rock found himself in the center, surrounded by large, towering bookshelves with a few pieces of ornate wooden furniture with dark-green cushions on them. Above him, multiple floors were lined with more bookshelves, but the center of each floor was open, leaving a clear sight from the first floor to the distant ceiling. Rock saw windows in between the bookshelves, noticing a blue sky with a few clouds. Some were open, and he could feel a gentle breeze blowing through the tower.

""Hello, Rock,"" A familiar voice said behind him. Rock turned and found the source. Sitting at a table with two chairs was a woman with soft, cyan eyes and long, curling black hair in a white gown that only exposed her hands and head. She looked over at Rock and smiled. ""And welcome to my library.""

""Huh? Library?""

""It's a lot to take in, I know. I designed this place with the intent that it would feel more…comfortable for Humans compared to a wall of screens and keyboards. I even added certain tactile sensations, such as that breeze you're feeling.""

Rock looked down at his right arm. ""That's what that is?""

""It is! What do you think?""

Rock quickly looked around, taking it all in. He tried to see the vaulted ceiling, even squinting his eyes, but failed. He walked over to the bookshelf and rubbed his hand on it, feeling the smooth, varnished wood in the palm of his hand. ""Wow…I've never felt this before.""

""You haven't? But you're a lab assistant.""

""Yeah, but this is different. When I touch something, my tactile system tells me what it is, but not really how it feels. I can tell when the wind is blowing, but it doesn't really make me feel chilly. This…this is different. I feel the cool breeze and can feel the smooth varnish.""

H.E.R.A. looked on, smiling. ""I hope you're enjoying it. This is a theoretical idea I am working on, intending it to be a tool or trait of future robots.""

""Why?""

""It's my purpose. To build, innovate, build again, innovate again, and so on. There's only so much Robots, even Robot Masters, can do. I want to take the dreams of those who built us and push them into the future and make them a reality in any way I can.""

""Doctor Cradle means a lot to you, huh?""

""He's my creator and friend. Maybe calling him my father would be more accurate.""

""That's how I feel about Doctor Light!"" H.E.R.A. snickered. ""Did I say something weird?""

""Not at all."" She waved her right hand to the chair opposite her at the table. ""Please sit, Rock."" Rock walked over to the chair and sat down. The cushion's support flowed through his body as he leaned back against the hard back of the chair. ""Rock, this may sound silly, but I have waited a long time to get to talk to you.""

""You have? Why?""

""You may not see yourself as anything special, that may be something of Doctor Light rubbing off on you, but you and your sister are revolutionary beings. Though you two are amongst the first Robot Masters, all later Robot Masters never reached the same level of…sapience as you two, or at least…you.""

""I'm not following. Sorry.""

""That's okay. It's hard to explain in simple terms, but I'll try."" H.E.R.A. leaned forward slightly. ""Rock, I want to get to know you. I think you are the key to the future of Robots. Would you be willing to talk with me for a moment?""

""What about Roll's turn?""

""All of this is happening in microseconds. She won't wait long, and I will do my best not to ask you hard or uncomfortable questions or pry. What do you say?""

""Will it help Doctor Light and Doctor Cradle?""

""I have no doubt.""

Rock looked down at the table for a moment before looking back up at H.E.R.A. ""Let's do it.""",1,1750231897.0,Megaman,1,1.0,False

I genuinely love their work so much. I blind bought Estella and Isolde as blind pre-orders here… the notes were pretty irresistible for me. Arcana does such gorgeous vanillas.

Relevant likes: gourmand-adjacent, cold/wet florals that aren’t *too* Big White Floral, chilly winter minty stuff, Arcana’s weird silk/cashmere thing, citrus of all kinds, and some musks and ambers. 

Relevant dislikes: gigantor white florals, incense flying solo, strong smoke notes, peach and sometimes berries. 

**Skadi**-  *”An icy opening of our hand-extracted peppermint unfolds into a blanket of snow, salt crystals, soft cashmere, water from melting icicles, white musks, ivory velvet, pale oakmoss, and crisp air.”* Puff of ice water initially, followed by the mint. The mint is quite light! It’s airy, gently sweet and I feel the mint reads as spearmint, not peppermint- you know how spearmint gum is the lighter, softer and more sweet one usually? So too with this mint. It doesn’t have the… weird addictive dark undercurrent thing I get from some Arcana scents (On the Wing, Frigga, Bifrost) which I had previously theorized was “cashmere”. But nope, this one has the cashmere note, and no darkness in this girl. Just an extremely user friendly chilly mint with some cold water. Has a better throw than I’d expect from such a soft scent, but is a touch short lived (when new at least). There is not even a hint of men’s aquatic cologne notes, which was a concern with the water/ice/oakmoss situation. It definitely has some aquatic qualities but they’re more literal than you’d get in a men’s aquatic cologne note. Love a good wintery icy mint perfume in the summer. 4.5/5. 

**Gullveig**- *“Opening with a thunderbolt of coffee amber (resins of labdanum and benzoin with Arabica coffee and Madagascan vanilla), Gullveig leads you to a heart of cold ice cream and a base of warm lambswool and soft dry spices.”* I have to admit I’m not a huge coffee scent aficionado. Love coffee; don’t like a straight up coffee perfume. Actually this reminds me somewhat of By Kilian Memento Mori, which is a huge love of mine. It has the same strong initial coffee hit, over a silky, spicy dark backdrop. I can’t peg the spices, but when wet they start off quite strong. The vanilla/wool/spice reads as what I always *want* caramel notes to smell like, but they never do lol. It smells like imaginary caramel, is what I’m saying. I definitely don’t get “cold ice cream”- this is a very warm and spicy vanilla on me. Very long lasting, fun evolution over dry down. 5/5

**Grimhildr**- *“almost a rose soliflore: a profusion of blood red roses with dark musks, forest mosses, black silk, luxurious amber, delicate woods, and our hand-extracted fir essential oil.”*
I do enjoy a good rose, TBH. They’re hard to find and tend to go soapy or sour- red, especially. This one, when wet anyway, is a bit tart but, happy to report it isn’t too sour! Or soapy! The other components don’t read as mossy or fir, exactly- more like a fresh green stemmy type note. It’s lovely, and reminds me of what I wanted from BPAL’s Rose Red. A bouquet of red roses with the stem, thorns and all. It does ooch closer to sourness in later dry down, and I am not entirely sure I will actually wear it that often, but I like it a lot. 5/5

**Estella** *”Ambre blanc, vanilla bean and cognac“* This one is allll about the cognac and vanilla. The cognac is instantly recognizable as a boozy note, even to folks who haven’t read the notes. The vanilla is a warmer, beanier one. Not a cool or silky vibe. It reminds me somewhat of Sorce’s underlying vanillaroma deal that is in many of their scents. The amber takes a back seat to the other two, IMO. Fresh from Arcana, it is on the shorter-lived side compared to most of their others. I like it very much, I’m glad I risked a pre-order… but I’m not gonna cry about only getting a 10ml and maybe never seeing it again. 4/5

**Isolde** *”White chocolate, pale almond milk, delicate vanilla, cream, and a touch of sheer musk”* Well, the chocolate note sure doesn’t smell like a  *white* chocolate on me. It definitely has a cocoa-y aspect. Which works fine in this scent! It’s not overwhelming. Initially all the notes are present and accounted for, but interestingly the cream note amps up, and up over the wear time. It starts with the chocolate/almond situation being the strongest, but the cream/vanilla aspect picks up steam on later dry down. No plastic vomity aspect to the lactonic phase, bless! Enjoyable, if a tiny little bit too “gourmand-only” for my taste. I adore some of Arcana’s musks and this one is one of them. Long lasting, has hella sillage too. 4/5

**Creamsicle** *”Mexican vanilla extract with sweet blood oranges, ripe tangerines, and cold ice cream.”* From their Sugar Spider purgatory zone. Literally a creamsicle. Once again a little too gourmand-only for me in most moods, but I am a total whore for citrus and vanilla together so I got a 10ml anyway. This definitely IS cold ice cream vanilla. 3/5 for my actual usage, 5/5 for being exactly a creamsicle.",3,1750231378.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False
1leawdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1leawdz/10_harsh_lessons_most_men_learn_way_too_late_wish/,10 harsh lessons most men learn way too late (wish someone told me this at 20),"I'm 32 and just figured out stuff I should have known at 22. Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think. Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

Good luck",38,1750231354.0,motivation,4,1.0,False

Since I moved here in 2023, I've always taken the smaller room and bathroom, and a couple took the primary bedroom, and primary bathroom - preference is for a couple to replace the outgoing couple. I am willing to split rent at $1,600/$1,971 for interested couples. The trade off would be that we share a similar split for utilities excluding parking. I will pay 100% of the garage parking monthly fee regardless of if you also want to garage park, I will share a similar split for costs over $100/month in case of the latter.

This is a 2-bedroom 2-bathroom apartment, and you would be taking over the primary bedroom and primary bathroom.

1leaq8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImperialRadch/comments/1leaq8n/tea_in_the_radch/,Tea in the Radch,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked up Translation State and absolutely loved it. It reminded me of Le Guin, Banks, Miéville, Butler, and so much other sci-fi that I love. After finishing it I went back and started the Ancillary Justice and am now reading through the series. Turns out to be really fun to do it that way actually, because Translation State stands alone well, introduces so many questions for the reader, and then you get the incredible richness of the backstory.

**But what has really gotten me is the tea!** 

I've always loved tea, tea making, tea types and traditions and practices, since I was little. And have a whole table dedicated to tea preparation in my kitchen. So it's been incredibly fun to have the constant presence of the tea throughout.

There are quite a few [tea posts on Ann Leckie's blog](https://annleckie.com/?s=tea) which are fun and answer a lot of questions, but I wondered how other readers imagined the specifics themselves. Especially the bowls and sets. What they look like to you.

The style of preparation and serving ware doesn't seem to have an exact equivalent in contemporary Earth culture, since it's clearly the product of a very long period of cultural mixtures, syncretism, combining practices, styles, and crafts from across all the ancient original human tea-cultures, as well as those that emerged since humanity left Earth.

That said, because of the descriptions of tea sets that are glass or enamel, and the fact that they are bowls without handles (whereas handles are noted as something non-Radch for a tea cup), I've been imagining them as coming from the original tea cultures: India, China, and Japan primarily, with influences from many others of course, but focused on those in my mind.

I'm imagining that the water is stored (in something like an insulated flask, like those zojirushi makes) and poured over the tea in order to brew it much like one does with Japanese or Chinese tea preparation traditions, rather than the more English or Euro-American practice of making a large pot of tea. So loose leaf, water added to brew, and poured into the drinking cup (bowl) soon after. Then perhaps brewed again with more water, as you can with many quality teas for additional bowls. But I don't know really. 

There's no mention in what I've read so far of brewing in something like a gaiwan, or of pouring through strainer that I can remember, or of there being leaves in a cup either - at least in what I've read so far. 

But I also absolutely loved the depiction of the tea plantation planet, because I've spent time on tea plantations in Indonesia, and even the sense of getting up early in that kind of environment was spot on - and of course the imperialism, colonialism, plantation culture and politics of it all...

Of course, I love coffee as well... but that's a whole other post.",7,1750230685.0,ImperialRadch,0,1.0,False

1leap0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1leap0t/ive_finally_figured_out_my_main_issue_with_the/,I've Finally Figured Out My Main Issue With The Veilguard Cast.,"This is not a VG hate post, really its not.

And no this isn't some anti-woke ""oh no nonbinary character!"" nonsense either. But I will add that the use of modern language and not something in world involving a NB character was immersion breaking and kinda lame. They already had a word for trans, they could've found something! But I digress.

No my true issue really comes from most of the cast's nonchalant attitude during arguably the worst crisis in the series.  

In DAO the world was in a blight, a regular one only worsened by a usurper to the current throne, and all the factions of Ferelden are aware of the problem but have their own issues that need solving before facing the true threat. You're nothing but a new recruit trying to save the world and convince others you can. The level of urgency is there and everyone behaves accordingly. 

In DA2 things are more self contained. The issues arising only either effect  the Hawke family or Kirkwall as a whole.  Your party being relaxed and less focused on the big picture makes sense since every problem up until the finale is about you and the city you live in. 

In DAI is especially where my issue with VG rears its head. DAI has a massive crisis, where the conclave is destroyed and the entire main religious power in the world is in ruin. The urgency is never understated and you are given allies and resources fitting to what you're up against.  But not without the political struggle of convincing more to your cause. You are revered almost as a demi-god despite not being one and amass the largest allied force in the series.

In DAVG you're Rook with seven randos turned besties who are infinitely more concerned with their own personal problems than the literal end of the world. So while DAI had a massive crisis, DAVG has an even bigger one. BioWare upped the ante but not the damn stakes. How is it that Harding is taking things seriously in Inquisition but not Veilguard? (And don't hit me with the you're her boss in DAI nonsense, you flirt, she's still professional. The most heinous character assassination after Morrigan.)

How and why do Emmerich and Harding have a picnic in Ferelden while its overrun by the super-blight?

The world is on fucking fire and we still have time to get coffee with Lucanis in a city occupied by ancient elven demon god loyalists.

Everyone speaks so lightly, like they have time, like they're the DA2 cast. And here lies my point. 

The cast lacks teeth. Even more than the DA2 cast but that's neither here nor there. Its not that they're bad but that they exist in the wrong story. This group and their dynamic is made for something self contained and personal, not something grand and world ending. Honestly if BioWare was smart, they would have jumped on the DREADWOLF train after they won game of the year. Made something solid and saved whatever dynamic this was for a spinoff.

# Chapter 1 Recap

I fidgeted in the stark white waiting area of Silvercrest Hospital, my fingers absently scrolling through my phone to distract myself. The sterile smell of disinfectant filled my nostrils as I waited for Dr. Mills to return with my test results.   
  
Three missed calls from my mother. I'd call her back soon.   
  
My thumb froze mid-scroll as Claire Watson's newest social media post appeared on my feed.   
  
She was my mate's Alpha Alexander's childhood sweetheart.   
  
My stomach tightened as I read her caption: ""Officially dissolving the mate bond with Beta David. Time for new beginnings! #FreshStart #MovingOn""   
  
The glossy photo showed her looking somber yet beautiful, as always. Comments flooded in with sympathy and support. Everyone loved Claire.   
  
""Mrs. Summers?"" Dr. Sarah Mills appeared in the doorway, her white coat pristine and her smile wide. ""I have your results.""   
  
I tucked my phone away and followed her into her office, my heart pounding against my ribs.   
  
Dr. Mills sat behind her desk, her blonde hair pulled back into a neat bun. ""I have wonderful news, Aria,"" she said, her blue eyes sparkling with genuine happiness. ""You're pregnant!""   
  
My hand flew to my mouth. ""Really? After trying for so long?""   
  
""Yes! About six weeks along. Everything looks perfect."" She handed me a folder of papers. ""Here's your prenatal vitamin schedule and first ultrasound appointment.""   
  
Tears blurred my vision. After a full year of disappointment, of watching Alexander's face fall each time I shook my head, we finally had our miracle.   
  
""Thank you, doctor."" My voice cracked with emotion.   
  
Dr. Mills squeezed my hand. ""You've been so patient throughout this process. I'm truly happy for you and Alpha Reed.""   
  
Alexander. I needed to tell him immediately.   
  
I practically floated out of the hospital, clutching the folder to my chest. Our pack would finally have its heir. My wolf, Ember, purred with contentment inside me, her presence warm and satisfied for the first time in months.   
  
""To the pack house, please,"" I told my driver, Robert, as I slid into the back seat of the black SUV.   
  
""Yes, Luna."" He nodded respectfully in the rearview mirror.   
  
As the car pulled away from the hospital, my phone rang. Mother's face appeared on the screen, her warm amber eyes crinkling at the corners from her smile in the photo.   
  
""Hi, Mother,"" I answered, unable to keep the excitement from my voice.   
  
""Little wolf,"" she said, using my childhood nickname. Her voice sounded weaker today, I noticed with a pang. ""How are you, sweetheart?""   
  
""I'm good. How are you feeling today?"" I asked, concerned about the fatigue in her tone.   
  
""Oh, the same."" She dismissed her condition like always. ""I was thinking about you and Alexander. Have you discussed the formal mating ceremony yet?""   
  
I bit my lip. The traditional ceremony should have happened shortly after our official mating, but Alexander's grandfather had fallen ill, and then there were always pack matters, business deals, territory negotiations...   
  
""We haven't set a date yet,"" I admitted.   
  
Mother's sigh was soft but filled with longing. ""I would love to see you both participate in the ceremony before I..."" She trailed off.   
  
""Don't talk like that,"" I said quickly. ""You'll be fine.""   
  
""Dear, we both know my condition isn't improving."" Her pragmatism was gentle but firm. ""It would mean everything to me to see my daughter properly celebrated as Luna before I pass.""   
  
My throat tightened. ""We're planning it, Mother. I promise.""   
  
""Good,"" she said, sounding relieved. ""I love you, dear.""   
  
""I love you too.""   
  
After hanging up, guilt gnawed at me. I hadn't exactly lied, but Alexander hadn't mentioned the ceremony in months. Now with the baby coming, though, surely he would want to make everything official.   
  
My phone rang again. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.   
  
""Alexander!"" I answered eagerly. ""I have amazing—""   
  
""Aria,"" he cut me off, his voice pitched low and professional. ""I'll be working late tonight. Don't wait up.""   
  
I frowned. ""But I have something important to tell you.""   
  
A feminine laugh sounded in the background. My spine stiffened.   
  
""Sorry, can't talk now. Important meeting. I'll see you tomorrow."" He hung up before I could respond.   
  
I stared at my phone in disbelief, then reopened social media. Claire had posted again just two minutes ago: ""Visiting the pack house"" with a photo of a man's back by a large window. The broad shoulders and golden-brown hair were unmistakable. Alexander.   
  
""Robert,"" I said, my voice harder than before. ""We're still going to the pack house.""   
  
He hesitated, eyes meeting mine in the mirror. ""Luna, perhaps we should—""   
  
""The pack house, Robert. Now.""   
  
He nodded, concern evident in his expression as he turned back to the road.   
  
Twenty minutes later, we pulled up to the imposing glass and stone building that served as the Storm Pack's headquarters. My chest tightened as I stepped out of the car, noticing the massive LED display on the building's facade.   
  
Claire's face beamed down at me, her perfect smile announcing her as ""Chief Healer of Storm Pack's New Healing Institution.""   
  
When had that happened? Alexander hadn't mentioned any new appointment.   
  
I marched through the lobby, ignoring the curious glances from pack members. As Alpha's mate, my presence wasn't unusual, but my obvious agitation was.   
  
""Luna Summers,"" the receptionist greeted me nervously. ""Alpha Reed is in a meeting—""   
  
""I know,"" I cut her off, striding toward the elevator.   
  
My heart hammered as the elevator climbed to the top floor. The pregnancy test results felt heavy in my hand. Would Alexander be happy? Would this change things between us?   
  
I pushed open his office door without knocking.   
  
Alexander stood by his desk, leaning over some documents. Claire sat comfortably on the leather couch, her legs tucked beneath her as if she belonged there. Both looked up at my entrance.   
  
""Aria,"" Alexander straightened, surprise flickering across his handsome face. ""I thought I told you I was working late.""   
  
""You did."" I stepped inside, closing the door behind me. ""But I needed to see you.""   
  
Claire's smile was honey-sweet as she stood. ""Aria! What a lovely surprise. Alexander and I were just discussing my new position.""   
  
I ignored her, focusing on Alexander. ""I need to speak with you. Alone.""   
  
Alexander frowned. ""Claire is our chief healer now. Whatever you need to say—""   
  
""Is private,"" I finished firmly.   
  
Claire placed a hand on Alexander's arm, the gesture casual yet possessive. ""Don't worry, I understand mate things."" She winked at me. ""Though you should know, Aria, there's no need to be territorial. Alexander and I have been friends since we were pups.""   
  
More than friends, I thought bitterly, but kept my expression neutral.   
  
Alexander stepped toward me, finally giving me his full attention. ""What is it? You look... different.""   
  
I felt a flutter of hope. Maybe he could sense the change in me already. I took a deep breath and reached for his hand.   
  
""Alexander, I—""   
  
A sharp crash interrupted me. Claire had knocked over her crystal water glass, sending shards scattering across the hardwood floor.   
  
""Oh!"" she cried out, bending to pick up the pieces. ""I'm so clumsy!""   
  
""Don't touch that!"" Alexander immediately released my hand and rushed to her side. ""You'll cut yourself.""   
  
Too late. A small gasp escaped Claire as blood welled from her index finger. The scent hit the air—sharp, tangy, distinctive.   
  
Alexander's protective instincts flared instantly. He crouched beside her, taking her hand in his with a gentleness that made my wolf whimper in confusion.   
  
""What were you thinking?"" he scolded, but his tone was soft with concern. ""Let me see.""   
  
I stood frozen, watching as my mate tended to another woman with care that should have been reserved for me alone. The scene felt surreal, like I was watching from outside my body.   
  
Claire looked up at me through her lashes. ""Sorry about that, Aria. Don't be jealous—Alexander's always been overprotective of me since we were little. It's just his nature.""   
  
I managed a strained smile, my heart fracturing along invisible fault lines.   
  
""I should get this cleaned properly,"" Claire said, making no move to withdraw her hand from Alexander's. She stood, and he rose with her, still holding her injured finger. ""You two continue your... show of affection. I'll see myself out.""   
  
The way she said ""show of affection"" carried a subtle challenge, as if she knew perfectly well there had been none to interrupt.   
  
As the door closed behind her, I was left alone with Alexander and the lingering scent of Claire's expensive perfume mixed with her blood. The combined smells suddenly hit me differently—my wolf's senses heightened by pregnancy.   
  
Nausea rolled through me in a violent wave. I clapped a hand over my mouth and bolted for the private bathroom connected to Alexander's office.   
  
I barely made it to the toilet before emptying my stomach. Alexander appeared in the doorway, watching with a frown as I retched miserably.   
  
When I finally straightened, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, his expression had shifted from confusion to dawning realization.   
  
""Aria, you..."" Alexander looked at me with a frown, ""You...are you pregnant?""

Riots and other disturbances can of course happen at any time of year, winter or summer (though heavy rain will apparently put a literal dampener on such activities).

Nevertheless, with the sun out and the weather hot, the pubs have thrown open their windows and doors and a lot of alcohol is being visibly consumed by people in large groups.

In my particular neighbourhood, I now come home from work almost every evening to the sight of mostly white British heritage men sinking pints of lager with their shirts open, while directly opposite on the other side of the street is a branch of a well-known coffee chain on whose tables sit groups of (I guess) East Mediterranean and/or Central Asian heritage men sipping coffee. 

Next to them are a huddle of fast food bike delivery men, exclusively South Asian heritage in this case and on both sides of the street, to either side of the pub on one side and the coffee outlet on the other, is a seemingly endless row of vape shops, 24-hour betting shops/slot places, and ethnic grocery stores and take-out places.

Looked at from one angle, this presents a calm and harmonious picture of a diverse community at work and leisure according to their various occupations and customs.

But school is almost out meaning scores of rowdies on e-Scooters zipping up and down and idle hands and all that ...

**Question / TL;DR**

A combination of hot weather, all day drinking, the football season in its fallow period, and schools out is a lot of metaphorical dry grass that can easily flare up into a conflagration at any moment.

So what with not only successive governments, but city councils, schools, the mainstream media loudly and repeatedly denying - *for decades* \- that group-based child sexual exploitation ('grooming gangs') were overwhelmingly formed by first generation and/or recent migrant men from South Asia, Pakistan in particular, as opposed to Bangladesh or India, why is Starmer choosing to turn up the heat on this now?

Politically, it would have been difficult at any time.

But - and especially after last summer's riots - it seems literal folly to turn up the volume on group-based child sexual exploitation ('grooming gangs') right now when the chances of a disturbance happening somewhere seems to be at its highest.

So: What political event, motive or strategy do you think has most likely driven Keir Starmer's complete shift on group-based child sexual exploitation ('grooming gangs') now, in the summer 'riot' months?

I'm genuinely asking as it seems pointless to have spent all those decades denying it's happening, then choose now to admit that it was happening all along.

Ashley and Dino Petrone’s ventures—Foxi Coffee and The Fox Mercantile—have garnered attention for their unique offerings and aesthetic. However, the sale of their building in Cortez, Florida, faces significant challenges that may hinder its success. ￼

⸻

🏚️ Key Challenges in Selling the Property
	1.	Unpermitted Structures: The property includes unpermitted structures, such as a pergola, which could deter potential buyers due to legal and financial uncertainties. ￼
	2.	Water Damage and Mold Issues: There are concerns about water damage and mold on the property. These issues not only affect the property’s value but also raise health and safety concerns for prospective buyers. ￼
	3.	Community Perception: Some community members have expressed negative opinions about the establishment, citing concerns over its impact on local culture and its alignment with community values.

⸻

📉 Likelihood of a Successful Sale

Given these challenges, the likelihood of a successful sale is diminished. Potential buyers may be hesitant to invest in a property with legal, structural, and reputational concerns. Without addressing these issues, the property may struggle to attract serious offers.

⸻

🛠️ Recommendations for Potential Buyers

For those considering purchasing the property, it’s crucial to:
	•	Conduct Thorough Inspections: Assess the condition of the property, including any unpermitted structures and potential water damage.
	•	Consult Legal Experts: Understand the implications of unpermitted structures and any necessary steps to bring the property into compliance.
	•	Evaluate Community Sentiment: Consider the local community’s perception of the property and its potential impact on future business operations.

⸻

In conclusion, while the property has unique features, the challenges associated with its sale may require significant effort to overcome. Prospective buyers should approach with caution and conduct due diligence to make informed decisions.

My baby is 5 months old, and I’ll be turning 41 in a couple of months. I’ve read everywhere that the majority opinion is to have kids early—but after my own experience, I genuinely believe I had my baby at exactly the right time for me.

I’d been there, done that. And nothing prepared me for just how completely life-changing it is to have a child. The days of lounging with a coffee and casually scrolling my phone or watching a movie on a lazy Sunday? Gone. I wouldn’t trade my baby for anything in the world, but I’m so thankful that I had the chance to live a full life on my own terms before stepping into this new chapter.

Now, it’s all about the baby—what the baby needs, the baby gets. My own needs aren’t really part of the equation anymore.

Sometimes I wonder how people manage to have kids so much earlier. Don’t you want time to truly find yourself first? To enjoy the quiet of life, the independence, the freedom to explore who you are before diving into something so consuming and transformative?

And no, I don’t think that makes me selfish. If anything, waiting has made me a better, more self-aware person—and I hope, a more mindful parent.

There is this guy at my university (M26-28) who started to flirt with me (F21) he was some kind of tutor one year ago for a short time. It took me a while to notice it, but at some point even others around me thought he liked me quite a lot. But everything was pretty distant I developed a HUGE crush nonetheless.
These ""signals"" (smiling at each other, talking kind of nervously [about academic stuff], flirting in general) went on for some months. I mirrored what he was doing so it was clear I'm interested too. We are both VERY introverted and not the best in social situations, I probably have aspergers and my guess is he has too. So nothing really developed.
Fast forward to a course (about 3 days) in which we both participated: This light flirting went on at first but just until I made a presentation. I really butchered the whole thing, I stuttered, made everything incomprehensible, one student even told me I sounded like I was going to cry. I don't know if thought this was unattractive or whatever... his signals were less frequent.
One thing that was particularly odd was that he didn't want to talk to me during the whole thing, even before my presentation. We were together in a hostel for 3 days with breakfast, dinner and everything. Other tutors and whatever talked to me (probably all but him at this point).
So I was pretty lost at this point what this whole thing was about... I scheduled a meeting with him about a professional topic (which I also wanted to discuss) but he didn't make anything clear. I took it as an ""Sorry, I've changed my mind, this won't work"". That he didn't even want to talk to me hurt and still hurts because I really saw something in him, but I couldn't do anything but move on so I did that and tried to forget him.

After a few months I saw him with another one or two times who is pretty bland to be honest (I'm just trying to paint the whole picture here). But anyway, pretty clear this was over.

Fast forward to the next course, again 3 days. Of course I was pretty distant and cold towards him. I was still kind of salty that he didn't even knew anything about my, didn't want to talk to me etc. But. He was looking at me when he thought I wouldn't notice, laughed at my jokes a bit too hard, even if they weren't funny, tried to sneak into my conversation by talking to one of my mates there (which failed, she just started to infodump him).


Idk I'm just absolutely lost. There is no way to develop anything here IF there is still interest on his side. I just want to know what is happening and why it is so hard to ask for a god damn coffee or something.",1,1750229590.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

we have 3 dogs and a lot of plants. I feed the dogs, take them out, walk them, and watch over them. My dad had the female dog breed and had 4 Litters of puppies, the first two he did most of the work, the last two were mostly me, and the last litter we had for almost a year. I constantly cleaned up shit and piss, they lived in my room so I had to keep everything up, I was about 13 then and was stressed to have people over. Because everything was a mess.

This year my dad has picked up gardening, which I was excited for i thought we'd have 3 to 5 plants we take care of, instead we have more then 10 that fully consume his ever thought, which is funny because I take care of them all, every morning I get up at 7, to bring them out side. I then go back to sleep until somewhere between 8 and 10:30 to get my dad up for work, making him coffee, and taking care of the dogs. I then have to check on the plants, and if my dad does not approve of their condition, then he implies I did something wrong. Sometimes he'll come out of his room and call me to help with some spontaneous plant thing (like moving them to new pots) which I always end up cleaning when he's done. Before we leave the house, he stands and stares at the plants, talking about them and what we need to look out for, or his next idea. No matter how late we are to where we're going.

I'm so sick of taking care of stuff I didn't ask for, and I know I'm being selfish but nothing in my life seems to be important except what I can do for my dad.

Recently, I dropped a pot on my hand because I fell. It landed perfectly on my thumb. it hurt really bad, was swollen, and permanently numb on my left side where my knuckle is. And all my dad seemed to care about was that I kill one of his flowers.

I want to throw all his plants on the ground, I want to get rid of them, I used to love gardening, but my dad has turned it into a competition for peace. I'm so angry, and I don't even know fully why. I think it's because I don't feel I have any control. I love my dad, but I resent him sometimes.

I hate doing favors for people because I'm afraid that it'd eventually become my full responsibility, i have things i like to do that i often have to skip out on. This year was really bad, a lot in my life went sideways. I'm exhausted, I'm so stressed all the time, making food feels like a lot of work, and I'm so angry all the time. I know that this is dramatic and very teenage of me, but it doesn't change the fact that I still feel like this. And I can't deal with other people's lives anymore.

I think kids should have work around the house, but I'm tired of taking care of 90% of everything. My dad has a chill job that he loves, and he relaxes a lot. He is going through his 5th divorce, but I'm losing empathy for him.

There was something deeply satisfying about it. That intense, bitter Robusta hit, poured over ice, dark as night and unapologetically strong. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable. You always knew what you were getting. Usually served in a thick glass with a trà đá on the side, sometimes perched on a little plastic stool watching the city move around you — it just worked. Sharp, smoky, no nonsense, and deeply grounding in its own way.

Since moving, I keep running into a different kind of ""coffee"" — often a mix of Arabica, corn, mung bean, soy, or something else entirely. It’s sweetish, thin, and not remotely satisfying. Which has left me wondering:

In places like Đà Lạt, often considered Vietnam’s coffee heartland, what does the everyday cup actually look like? Are people drinking pure Arabica? Is Robusta still common? Do locals go for these blends too, or is that more of a lowland or budget thing?

Curious to hear what others have come across in their coffee journeys around the country. Is Hanoi’s take on đen đá really something unique, or is this just a case of me being nostalgic?

TL;DR: Missing the strong, bitter Robusta đen đá from Hanoi — glass, ice, sometimes a plastic stool. Everywhere else I find odd blends with corn or beans. What’s the everyday coffee like in Đà Lạt and other regions — pure or mixed",3,1750229418.0,VietNam,2,1.0,False

Hey, fellow bag fanatics! 👋 Let's be real, we all adore our handbags. They're not just accessories; they're our mobile command centers, our secret stashes, our emotional support systems. But admit it, sometimes they're also… a bit of a nightmare. 😩

Ever found yourself digging through what feels like a black hole just to find your keys while juggling groceries and a phone call? Or maybe you've experienced the horror of a spilled coffee disaster turning your favorite liner into a modern art piece? And don't even get me started on the mystery of the vanishing lip balm!

Well, you're not alone! Today, we're tackling those everyday handbag woes head-on. Let's commiserate, but more importantly, let's *solve* them!

# Common Handbag Catastrophes & How to Conquer Them:

* **The Black Hole Effect (aka ""Where Did My Door KEYS Go?!"")**: This is perhaps the most universal handbag struggle. Everything goes in, nothing comes out easily.
   * **The Fix:** Pouches, glorious pouches! Small, clear, or color-coded pouches are your best friends. Dedicate one for makeup, one for tech chargers, one for ""emergency"" items (painkillers, hair ties, etc.). Also, consider bags with *actual* internal compartments or dividers. Revolutionary, right?
* **The Spillage Specter**: Whether it's a rogue water bottle or a leaky pen, spills can ruin your day and your bag.
   * **The Fix:** Invest in leak-proof containers for liquids. For pens, consider a dedicated pen holder or a bag with a specific pen loop. And a small, waterproof wet bag is a lifesaver for anything potentially leaky. Think of it as a tiny, stylish insurance policy!
* **The Weighty Burden (aka ""My Shoulder Hates Me"")**: Some bags, especially when full, feel like carrying a small boulder.
   * **The Fix:** Be ruthless with decluttering! Do you *really* need that third lipstick or those 17 receipts from last week? Also, consider the bag material itself – lighter materials can make a huge difference. And distribute weight evenly when packing.
* **The Scratched Phone/Keys Conundrum**: Toss your keys and phone in together, and you're inviting a scratch-fest.
   * **The Fix:** A dedicated phone pocket (many bags have them now!) or a soft sleeve for your phone. And for keys, a key leash or a small key pouch keeps them contained and away from delicate screens.
* **The ""Can't Find My Bag in My Bag"" Syndrome**: When your smaller items just disappear into the abyss.
   * **The Fix:** Brightly colored or patterned smaller items! If your wallet is neon green, it's a lot harder to lose than a black one in a black bag. Or attach a fun, noticeable charm to your key ring.

We all want a handbag that works *for* us, not against us. It's about finding that sweet spot between stylish and functional!

As the legendary Coco Chanel once said, *""Fashion passes, style remains.""* And I'd argue, a well-organized, problem-solving handbag is always in style!

I also thought about how the food noise significantly worsened after I started drinking coffee but it’s not recoverable if I stop coffee, especially during the school semester.

I am aware that people can develop tolerance but I am not too worried as I am taking 200mg and can bump it up to 400mg. 

One thing to note is that it can make you sleepy so I take it with coffee.

I pray for you. Not because you’re mine yet, but because I care already. I hope life is kind to you. I hope you’re surrounded by people who get you, who remind you that you matter. And if life’s been hard lately, I hope you’re holding on.

I don’t need us to rush. I want the real thing — the slow unfolding, the deep knowing. I want to learn how you take your coffee, what songs feel like home to you, what makes you light up. I want the ordinary moments, the quiet closeness.

# 🌿🔑 [Unlock the Power of Green: Start Designing! ](https://coderlift.com/services/)➡️



# Design Best Practices for Green Websites

# Color Balance and Contrast

* Avoid overwhelming users with too much green
* Ensure sufficient contrast for readability, especially with text
* Consider using complementary colors for visual balance

# Shade Selection

* **Soft, muted greens**: For calm, professional sites (finance, wellness)
* **Vibrant, bright greens**: For energetic, innovative brands (tech, startups)
* **Deep, forest greens**: For sophistication and reliability (luxury, established brands)

# Strategic Implementation

* Use green for important call-to-action buttons to increase conversions
* Consider green for animated elements to draw attention
* Test green elements against different backgrounds for optimal visibility

# Accessibility Considerations

* Ensure text maintains high contrast against green backgrounds
* Test your green palette with color blindness simulators
* Use texture and pattern with green elements to improve distinction

# Common Challenges and Solutions

# Challenge: Overuse of Green

**Solution**: Balance with neutral colors like white, black, or gray to prevent visual fatigue

# Challenge: Poor Readability

**Solution**: Test different green shades for sufficient contrast with text elements

# Challenge: Appearing Too ""Eco"" When That's Not Your Brand

**Solution**: Choose less obvious green shades (teal, mint, olive) that still provide the psychological benefits without the immediate environmental association

I’m just someone who probably spends more time watching people miss their trains than they do watching their lives unfold. But if I were that camera, I’d probably need therapy.

Every morning between 7:15 and 7:30 AM, two people cross paths like they’re in a meticulously choreographed Telugu rom-com. She’s clearly out of his league; he’s got the charm of a broken vending machine—persistent but questionable. Yet somehow, hope floats. Maybe it’s the humidity.

I've witnessed couples of every permutation—teenagers who mistake the metro platform for a dating app, newlyweds pretending like marriage didn’t just hit them with EMI schedules, and old couples trying to remember if they’re still fighting or if it was just gas. Sometimes it’s even two men or two women. If that sentence made you flinch, maybe spend some time figuring yourself out before judging theirs.

This one guy though… man’s running on vibes and sugar levels unknown to science. He's got the optimism of a morning RJ and the energy of someone who thinks “good vibes only” is a personality type. The girl? She’s probably just trying to catch her train in peace, but fate—or maybe TSRTC’s poor planning—keeps shoving this guy into her timeline.

Maybe it’s love. Maybe it’s just Hyderabad being extra on weekdays.

Either way, I'm not here to predict. I’m not an AI model trained on Shakespearean meet-cutes. I’m just another metro commuter with too much curiosity and too little coffee. But if there's one thing I've learned, it's this:

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?
* Do you have any pets?",1,1750227626.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,1.0,False

1le9xai,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1le9xai/the_mountain_woman/,The Mountain Woman,"I was probably no older than five or six when my mom told me about The Mountain Woman for the first time. Mom had many stories, but she would never tell them at bedtime, and never around a campfire. She would tell them during bath time as a kid, or sometimes while she made dinner and I pretended to help. 

When I outgrew those things, she would share her stories while we walked the dogs. We always had dogs, growing up. Still do; always old rescues from the shelter Mom worked at. Dogs knocking on death’s doorstep. Most didn’t live more than a couple years, but every night, we would walk the ones that still could. And most nights, Mom would fill the silence between our footsteps with The Firelight Serpent, Backtongue Child, or The Mountain Woman.

I’m not sure where they came from. My mom is pretty much your standard blend of American white lady. Dad’s never really been in the picture. He had a quick fling with my mom in the spring of ‘97, and then spent her pregnancy and my whole life in and out of tent cities and needle parks. I don’t know my paternal grandparents, but Mom’s parents had a lightness to them that told me they’d never heard the stories I was raised with. 

I should note here that they weren’t all scary, the stories. In fact, most weren’t. Different, maybe. Or dark. But not all scary. And there was something to them — some air of old tradition, of sanctity. A feeling that if you were told one, you ought to listen, you ought to be attentive, and you ought to let the story breathe. Hearing Mom’s stories was like listening to the gospel, except she never asked you to believe in them, and they never expected anything of you. But you sure as shit never disrespected them.

Now, I’m going to tell you about The Mountain Woman. The same way my mom told me. It gives me a lot of anxiety to put this on a page. It’s not scary, per se, but none of Mom’s stories feel like they should be anywhere but in the air hanging between teller and listener. You have to understand that under normal circumstances, I would never do this. All I ask is that you treat this story with respect. You treat The Mountain Woman with dignity. She is not a scary story to tell in the dark. She is not a ghost to summon in the bathroom mirror at a sleepover.

It goes like this.

*When the Woman died, she walked up the mountain. She did so smiling, though she had forgotten her shoes at the bottom with her bones, for the wild heather was blooming, and the mountain laurel, though flowerless, grew sweet along the weathered path she traveled. Where she stepped, the creatures of the ground writhed and rose to greet the gold of the dying sun, and the roots of the bushes she so admired shriveled in the darkness of the earth. For dead things should not walk the land. But walk, she did. On and on through early evening.*

Mom would pause here, always. She never forgot to let the story breathe. To let The Mountain Woman breathe. I don’t know why, but I know that it felt right.

*At dusk, mist crawled in with his cold hands and grasping fingers. The soft ground beneath her feet grew sharp with stone. Still, The Woman smiled. Still, The Woman walked.*

Sometimes, Mom would look up to the sky, here. Sometimes, she would stop walking, if only for a moment, her eyes closed. I would watch her. I would wait. Again — she had a way of speaking, when she told these stories. She commanded respect, patience. Or maybe the stories themselves did. So I would wait; at 6 years old or 16. And when she was ready, when the story was ready, she would continue.

*Dead things should not walk the land, but on The Woman walked— to the top of the mountain, trailing blood that wasn’t real blood from the soles of feet that weren’t real feet, shivering in skin that wasn’t real skin. And the trees bent from her, and the mist, he tried so hard with his pale, frigid fingers to hold her. Behind The Woman, her false blood stained the rocks red, stirred things best left undisturbed. Those things rose from the rocks; crude, ravenous imitations of shadows. As night fell deeper, they ate up the mist and all the wriggling creatures she drew from the earth farther down the mountain. Then, they moved upward into the air, and swallowed the last traces of day from the sky.*

Mom would stare straight ahead now, perfectly still. Maybe seeing something in her mind. Maybe really seeing something that I couldn’t. I’m less sure now. She would finish the story unmoving, as the dogs whined around our feet, and the halogen street lamps flickered on.

*The Woman reached the top of the mountain just as darkness fell in all its total hunger. There were no more laurels, no more heather, and no more stars in the vast, empty sky. Her shadows that were not shadows, born from her blood that was not blood, ate it all. Took it all. And in that starving darkness, The Woman stumbled, blind and reaching, smile eaten with all the light of the mountain, and she fell.*

At some point, as a teenager, I asked her what happened next — what became of The Mountain Woman. She cleared her throat and shrugged, started walking again. “I’m not sure. Maybe she got up and moved along. Maybe she fell into the night forever. Or maybe she woke up in the morning, at the bottom of the mountain, and walked back up again.”

My mom died last year. Early-onset dementia. It was a brutal disorder, and it took her from us long before it killed her. But I’m not here to get into seven years of ugliness and dread. I’m here to talk about what happened after. And some things from before.

I mentioned we had dogs. That’s important. They were important, in a way I didn’t understand before. After Mom got sick, I moved back home from college to help with everything, and I kept on the tradition. Kept taking in the dogs that were far too old for anyone else to want to adopt. Every couple years, I would cry, dig a new hole in the back yard, and go back to the shelter. 

I still have the same dog I had when she died. His name is Sparky. He’s a black and white shih tzu with a permanent ear infection, and bad joints. He’s half-blind, will walk up the steps, but never down, and I have to clean the gunk from his eyes every night with these special wipes. I love him. We never really had small dogs, but with Mom being sick and all, I figured it would be a little easier for me to manage. 

Besides — he doesn’t need to be big. He doesn’t have to fight. He just has to warn me.

The first time I ever heard Sparky growl was a week after Mom died. I was on leave from work, and while I should have spent that week planning a memorial, I spent it getting drunk all night, and sleeping all day. I wasn’t eating much, wasn’t brushing my teeth or showering. It was one of those drunken nights on the couch that the dog’s hackles rose, and he started growling. He looked ridiculous; tiny shih tzu staring at the door with his itty bitty teeth bared. I would have laughed, but I was struck with some cold, crawling fear, in that moment. A sudden paranoia crept and prickled along my skin like frost on glass. 

Maybe it was because I was home alone for the first time in years. Maybe it was because something was outside my door in the dark. 

I sat, frozen on the couch. I didn’t get up to look. I didn’t call Sparky over. I held my breath, and listened so hard I could feel my pulse in my ears. I heard nothing. Not even crickets. After maybe five minutes, the dog calmed down, padded back over and hopped up next to me. He lied down in my lap, but he kept his eyes on the door.

I stayed awake until the sun rose and I sobered up. I opened the curtains and looked outside. The neighbor across the street was sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette in her pajamas. Nobody was at my door. Nothing seemed out of place. I let Sparky out to do his business, and I went to bed. 

The same thing happened the next night. And the next. And the next after that. I stopped drinking and fixed my sleep schedule. I still woke up to the dog growling, staring at the bedroom door or the window. 

You know how when you see someone so often, you don’t notice that they’re growing— that their hair’s been getting thinner, or their skin’s been wrinkling with age? It took me a week to realize my lawn was dying. Or, patches of it were. It wasn’t just that crappy yellow it turns in the dead heat of summer, either. It was totally and completely limp. I tugged at it in different spots, and each time it came right out of the ground, like there were no roots holding it in place anymore. Like they’d just let go.

I looked over to my neighbors’ yards. Perfectly healthy. Vibrant and green and lush under mild spring weather. That prickly feeling reared its head, again, and something drove me to walk backwards, toward the sidewalk. With the entirety of the front lawn in view, dread landed in my stomach heavy and cold and hot all at once, like a thousand twisting, hungry snakes. The dead patches weren’t random. They weren’t even patches, really. They were footsteps. Stumbling, winding footsteps that traveled in a tight circle around the house. Off-shoots of clearly well-worn paths led to each of the windows, diverging from the chaotic, dizzying orbit that must have been walked hundreds of times. In the garden beds underneath the windows, the climbing ivy had peeled off the walls and grayed. The daffodils and hyacinths reduced to shriveled, wrinkled stems. And worms, mole crickets, millipedes by the dozens writhed on the ground, as if drawn up from the soil by a magnet.

I didn’t pack a bag. I don’t even remember if I locked the door on the way out. I grabbed my dog, my phone, my wallet, and got the fuck out. I drove in no particular direction for an hour. I probably cried. Mom’s stories played on an unending, burning loop in my head.

Eventually, I stopped at an indoor/outdoor cafe. I sat at a table on the deck with Sparky. I ordered some sort of sandwich. Didn’t eat it. Couldn’t. Fed most of it to the dog. I wracked my brain for anyone we could stay with, and came up short. I’d lost almost all of my friends when I moved home to take care of Mom. Fell out of touch with the rest over the course of the years. Even if someone would help, I couldn’t risk bringing death to their doorstep. 

I settled on an Airbnb. It was this kitschy, sunflower-covered nightmare. The kitchen, living area, and bed were all crammed into one open space, but it was far enough away from home that it felt moderately safe, and that’s what mattered.

There was no question about it, in my mind. Mom didn’t make up The Mountain Woman. Maybe none of her stories were made up. And something dead had been walking around my house at night. 

Now, I’m not stupid. I know it was her. I know it was Mom. And if I were half a degree less sure about what would follow the poisoned earth and carpets of bugs, I might have done something dumb like try to see her. But she didn’t raise me to be dumb.

That night, when I was finally able to sleep, I dreamt of The Mountain Woman. Of ravenous shadows with sharp claws and wide mouths. I dreamt of falling forever in total darkness. Forever only lasted until two in the morning. 

I woke up to Sparky’s growling. This time, louder. He barked, hackles raised, and stared straight at the door. Someone, *something*, was trying to open it. The knob rattled for a moment, thankfully locked. Sparky’s attention moved to the side window, then. The one right next to the garish, sunflower-painted headboard. Through the sheer curtains, a moving shape. 

She never touched the window. Never knocked. Never spoke to me. She just stood there, like being close was enough. I wanted to scream. I wanted to punch something. I wanted to run away, or puke, or cry. I sat like a stone at the end of the bed, too scared to get up.

Hours passed. I stared at the window. My mother didn’t move. I only knew she was still there because the dog never calmed down, never looked away. The clock on the microwave across the room read seven in the morning, but it was dark as pitch outside. That darkness stretched its claws under the door, leaked slowly through the cracks around the windows like gas. It’s hard to explain what it looked like. Solid, but not — like something and a nothingness that replaced somethingness all at once. It was like it reduced three dimensions to two wherever it touched. And it had trapped us in the house.

I grabbed the dog and retreated to the center of the room, standing on the coffee table under a ceiling light. I was half-paralyzed by fear, praying that the late sun would just wake up and rise. Sparky shook and pissed all over everything. The darkness spread fast. When I blinked, it stole entire walls, and then the air in front of them- as if light died suddenly and completely at its border. I could swear it had teeth, millions of eating mouths that reached out from its edges. 

As those frenzied, gnashing mouths came for us, I did something I’m both ashamed and glad to admit. Staring into the flat, hungry blackness of the world, I screamed for my mom. I begged her to make it stop. I told her I loved her. And as the shadows ate their way up to my feet and down to my head and closed in all around us, I told part of her own story back to her. I screamed at her that dead things should not walk the land. 

Everything stilled for a moment. Grasping shadows froze in place. After a heartbeat, just as suddenly as it had come, the darkness fled from the room like hundreds of black hounds scrambling over each other to escape. The sun shone bright and orange through the windows. I shook so badly, I thought I would fall off the table, thought my legs might just give out, but I managed to step down, to set Sparky gently on the floor. He was untouched, perfectly fine. Trembling almost as badly as I was, but otherwise in one piece. I realized, looking down at my feet, where the shadows had crept the closest, that I wasn’t. The tips of each of my big toes were missing. Just *gone*, down to the base of my toenails. It didn’t hurt. The skin was completely smoothed off at the ends.

I sat on the couch for a long while, probably in shock. When I finally came back to myself, I put my shoes on, grabbed Sparky and my belongings, and walked out the door. When we’d arrived at the Airbnb, there was a maple tree in the front yard, healthy grass, and shrubs growing along the front of the house. When we left, there was nothing but cracked dirt, paving stones, and tunnels where roots once stretched. Not an inch of life left on the property. Not even the remains of it.

It’s been about a year since Mom died, and then died again. My toes haven’t grown back, but I’m back to work, and I’ve made some new friends. I’ve even been going on dates. The Airbnb owner took me to court over the disappearance of her lawn. I won. I don’t think any lawyer could hope to convince a jury that one woman uprooted and carried away every living thing on the property in one evening. I still feel bad over it, honestly. But I have bigger problems, now. 

I’m writing this because I woke up at the bottom of a lake this morning. 

Mom’s stories are coming back. I don’t know why, and I don’t know how. But I know what happens at the end of *Rika and the Riversong*, and it isn’t good. 

If you’ve somehow heard these stories, know that they’re real. Know that they’re still alive, and the things that live *in* them are still hungry.",5,1750227529.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1le9x3w,https://i.redd.it/8z10gityom7f1.jpeg,Day 8 of turning characters into ice cream flavors: Toya Aoyagi,"
Intro from the last post: Lately I’ve found myself in a “making ice cream” phase, so I thought it could be fun to think outside the box a little bit and make one for each character. I’m not sure if I’ll get to all of them yet though. I want to capture these character's personalities and looks within each flavor- no artificial dyes though, because that makes my stomach churn really bad.

This one was kind of difficult, because Toya is my favorite character, so I didn’t want to fuck it up. I chose a classic flavor (chocolate) that could benefit from a new take on it, to reflect on him using his classical music skills in new, more modern styles. No offense to chocolate (or classical music), but I find it a bit boring. Anyways, just a chocolate base slowly turned into a mocha one (c’mon, it’s Toya, how can I not add some coffee element?) and from there I thought “how can I spice it up a little more.” Out came the German chocolate cake topping, and it ended up being a perfect fit- it’s nutty, it’s unique, but it’s still grounded in more traditional dessert and ice cream elements. I considered just a Vietnamese coffee flavor (too bitter), an earl gray flavor, and some kind of latte and cookie type ordeal- but I think what I came up with was overall more fitting. For the final reason… old people probably love Toya, and would love this ice cream.

I rate this flavor an 9.6, still partial to fruity flavors- but damn if I do love chocolate still. Not a big fan of nuts though. My dad rates it the same, which is shocking, because he’s the coconut monster.

This one I had to theory craft a little, chocolate ice creams tend to come out hard and dense. I curbed that outcome pretty well though, and this base has more cream compared to other bases, without any reduction. It’s about a 3:1 ratio now. I used three kinds of chocolate: bar, powder, and a ganache. The topping is walnuts, almonds, and coconut. I used just a touch of espresso and vanilla in here too, so I’d say this probably the most complex flavored ice cream yet (which again ties to Toya, my man has baggage.) The ice cream itself is very very creamy, with a subtle sweetness, but it’s grounded in more bitter flavors from the espresso and chocolate. This perfectly balances out with the crunchy and sweet caramel-like topping, which makes the entire thing not too sweet and have a lot of textural contrast. It has a bit of a bite through all the cream from the nuts. ",8,1750227507.0,ProjectSekai,0,0.91,False
