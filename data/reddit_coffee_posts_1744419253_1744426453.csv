I (30M) am married and work with this girl who I must admit, I find attractive. I haven’t had a crush in years since I first met my wife 5 years ago. And prior to that they were pretty rare.

This girl (27F) I work with is attractive and extremely intelligent, empathetic, and kind. Honestly on paper not the type of girl who I would think would go for a married man - she is a Christian type. I do get the intuition she’s interested in me. And if I wasn’t married, I’d be interested in her in a big way.

When we’re on shift together, in a job where we’re on our feet in close quarters I get the following (these are the events that have happened so far):

1.	⁠When we first met she showed a huge interest in me, asked lots of questions, etc. When I mentioned my wife in passing she looked like she was holding back tears all of a sudden (like a bug had flown in her eye).

2.	⁠When I asked about her family, she was receptive about me asking further personal details. She elaborated and didn’t change the topic (the conversation started to feel date-like. She invests in our conversations and is very warm and talkative.

3.	⁠When we have conversations like the above, she swings her chair around to be dead on facing me and makes direct and intentional eye contact.

4.	⁠This girl also heard me saying to my other colleague (who is also a musician) talking about playing open mic nights. She came to me and said if ever there is an open mic night on and him and I were playing, she would love to come along and watch (at this point she knew I was married).

5.	⁠She was telling me the other day about her excessive eating and the fact she is an emotional eater. She felt happy being vulnerable I guess?

6.	⁠She made eye contact with me, a stolen glance as she was exiting the room the other day (2seconds approx). (I was sort of ‘starring at her’, and maybe she caught me? But she had to turn her head 170 degrees to see me).

7.	⁠She came to work with sports gear on and some make up (not necessarily for me I guess), but she had a lower cut top where you could see her breasts. KNOWING THIS, she comes over to be face-to-face with me, mid-conversation (50cm apart?). Maintains eye contact the ENTIRE TIME and bends down to tie her shoelaces. She didn’t break eye contact while listening to me talk, even on her way down. It felt on purpose but I really couldn’t tell for sure. But she would have known that her breasts were on display at that angle.

8.	⁠The other day when i showed her that i bought similar runners to her (we spoke about it previously and i said i wasn’t sure if i would, but wanted to cause i like the brand). When i showed her my new runners, I was expecting casual acknowledgment “Nice!”. She went into a fit of excitement jumped up and down and leaned over to hug me. I got startled (the reaction was a huge change in energy!) and awkwardly had my hands up semi-going for the hug but my brain was in [SYNTAX ERROR]. She stopped herself and quickly said “opp sorry!”. She then tried to sit next to me on the bench but there wasn’t room and she nearly fell off. She then stood next to me and out her shoe up against my shoe (in very close quarters).

NOW… that night I added her on instagram and I think she rejected the request (not sure if i accidentally unsent it, it was night shift and i was delirious). I did’t realise it but I sent a facebook request and she DID accept it.

The reason I wanted to add her was that I want to get clarity. I feel this flirty vibe between us and a sense of warmth. I want to know if it’s intentional flirting or not:

a) So we can be normal and on the same page. If she’s just ‘friendly’ then sure at least I know and don’t have to experience this weird perceived sexual tension, which is making me feel conflicted cause I’m married.

b) If she’s actually into me, I will have to do some serious soul searching in terms of what I want in life. Cause I think I could grow to love this woman.

For the record my marriage is strained atm, and at a but of a crossroads, which does further complicate things. I’m just trying to not feel this sense of guilt when I enjoy time with her.

So should I just bite the bullet and ask her if she would be interested in meeting up as friends for a coffee to discuss it and get on the same page? I can’t live in this f—- limbo forever.

I know I don’t sound like husband of the year, but please be kind cause this is a super sensitive thing for me and it’s weighing me down.

What do I do?","So I (F22) am a barista at a local coffee shop. It has two locations and I work at one more often than the other. The place I work less at has this regular named Fred (M27) who used to work at that shop and knows everyone there. There’s a bar with seats right in front of the espresso machine so regulars will often sit there to chat with the workers. Fred and I really hit it off, and would chat for hours while I was working. Maybe I was too comfortable with him, but one day when I come back from my break there’s a note with my name on it on the employee shelf, and it’s essentially him asking me out and being kind enough not to ambush me. I struggle a lot with it because I’m scared to hurt his feelings and eventually turn him down via a text to the number he left. He never replies and I don’t see him for a few weeks, so I figure now he’s just going to the shop on days I’m off or working at the other location.

Well, one day he just shows up, orders something, and sits there for a few hours. He’s not doing anything bad - working on his computer or chatting to his friends. It freaks me out for some reason but I ignore it. The next week he shows up again, though, and he keeps showing up. One of my work friends, who I’m getting closer to, asked me out to a big dinner with a bunch of the other employees and mentioned offhandedly that Fred would be there. All of a sudden it really got to me, the idea that not only was he going to be a fixture of my job but maybe even the friendships I make there.

Here’s my problem - Fred is doing nothing wrong. He hasn’t bothered me, has a good reason to show up, and knew my new friends well before I did. But it freaks me out having him there, watching me work, having me make his drinks, knowing he’s coming back next week. I actually had to take a break to cry in the bathroom today. For reference, I didn’t tell anyone about the whole Fred thing, because I didn’t want to embarrass him, and as a result no one knows why I get so weird a few hours out of the day. I also don’t know who helped him leave his note, which is again innocuous but freaks me out as well. I know I’m overreacting, but it’s making work and potentially these new friendships really scary when they shouldn’t be. What should I do to manage this situation? Why is this bothering me so much?

1jx7bvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1jx7bvy/my_sister_found_me_crossdressing/,My sister found me Crossdressing,"I was alone in the bathroom, quietly trying on her clothes. Just a simple lace bralette, matching underwear, and one of her soft tops. My face was lightly done with a bit of makeup. Some lip gloss, a touch of mascara. I stood in front of the mirror, taking it all in. Feminine.

And then the door opened.

My sister stood there. For a second, everything froze. She looked at me and I felt my entire body sink with embarrassment. I didn’t say a word. I couldn’t. I just stood there, exposed in a way I never expected to be.

She didn’t yell. She didn’t say anything. She simply walked out.

The rest of the day, I could barely function. My mind was spinning. Shame, fear, regret. I was sure everything between us had changed.

But the next morning, she knocked on my door. Quietly. Calmly. She had a small bag in her hand some makeup, a cute outfit, a soft smile. No long talks, no judgment. Just quiet acceptance.

She helped me get ready. Gave me tips. Fixed my eyeliner. Picked out a pastel top and a pair of skinny jeans that actually fit my shape. And then we went out shopping, coffee, trying on clothes, laughing like nothing had ever been wrong.

It was the first time I didn’t feel like I had to hide this part of myself.

Anyway the god parents will be his brother and his brother’s wife. So we offered them to stay in our only available bedroom for guests. 
The issue is my parents in law will fly in as well since they are so excited for this event…and maybe my husband’s another brother too. 
We really don’t have a huge house. With the only guest room ioffered to the god parents, the other 3 persons will have to share the living room. Our sectional couch can take one. I really don’t know where my parents in law will stay then…..on the floor? Fine, but we don’t have extra mattress. Plus we do have air mattress but we also have several cats and they had a history of popping an air mattress to flat. 

Besides the sleeping issue, it’s very stressful to think of cooking for them for several days in a row, they all have their own food restrictions.m, even for coffee. And plus there is no way we can transport all of them to everywhere in our car unless they have their own ride to tour the area. Also will guests do laundry in this kind of family visit? I don’t mind them using our laundry room but with 5, I think our machines may run 24 hours considering I also need to wash our own clothes plus the baby clothes.

A little background: my parents in law are not easy going, they are extremely weird with eating normal food, very alert in spending money. But they will not be happy if they don’t get to stay under the same roof with the baby ….

How should I do this and what should I expect?
I know they will be offended by being asked to find their own hotel, so I caved and aligned with my husband that they can all stay here but for respect, the only available room should be given to the godparents who must be present. 

1. We plan to arrange my parents in law to sleep on the floor but we do not have a proper mattress. What should we do?
2. Is it rude to ask them five to pay and share a rental car?

My 5 years car free were in a central neighborhood in SF and 5 years with a car in a walkable (relatively speaking but not really compared to SF) neighborhood of LA. 

* living car free became a lot less fun after interest rates went up. It used to be cheap to Uber everywhere and get food delivered when those apps were subsidized by VC money
* renting a car sucks. Car rental agencies inside the city close super early. App based car rentals are hit or miss. One time an owner accused me of damage I didn’t do and it became a huge headache. 
* I hike more and stopped drinking after owning a car 
* there’s a lot of stuff that the city proper doesn’t have that becomes frustratingly difficult to access. underground punk shows in the east bay, friends in the South Bay, hikes in Marin. Certain food is better in the suburbs because the city only has the gentrified version.
* I’m much less spontaneous when driving. Walkability is amazing for just setting out and seeing where the day takes you. 
* getting errands done is easier. I can buy things in bulk. I can go to the specific store that I want instead of one that is convenient. 
* you can’t have it both ways. A city can be easy to drive or easy to walk but not both. 
* parks are an important part of a walkable city. In a car city people tend to just chill in the cars. This gives a great energy to parks that tends to be missing from a car city. 
* I didn’t notice a difference in spontaneous encounters. I would still talk to people at dog parks, coffee shops, etc at about the same rate.",6,1744425445.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,0.88,False

Communication was a bit of a problem, my Chinese not being great and his English being non-existent. He seemed to be telling me I needed to buy individual rides, which is, frankly, kind of a pain in the keester.

I did not do research ahead of time because I assumed every subway system used WeChat. I dont want to spend a fortune taking Didi all over. Is there a subway app? Are metrocards sold?

The house was quiet. Too quiet, the kind where you can hear your own blood moving. The bed still smelled like her. Her pillow still had the shape of her head. I kept brushing my teeth and expecting her to call out from the bedroom, like she always did.
***“You left the light on again, babe.”***

But she was gone. Left in a rush. Said she needed time. That was the last text I got. I didn’t reply. Not because I didn’t want to—I just… didn’t know what to say.

The first night I saw it, I thought I was losing it. It was around 2 a.m. I’d gotten up to take a piss, wandered into the kitchen for water, and looked out the back window. Something—someone—was standing at the edge of the garden. By the hedge.

Still. No phone. No cigarette. Just… standing.

I blinked and it was gone.

Didn’t sleep much after that.

••

Night two, same time. I saw her again.

Her. That’s what made my stomach twist. She looked like El. Or enough like her in the dark. That hoodie she always wore. Legs slightly bowed in that same way. Hair up in a messy bun.

But it wasn’t her.

She didn’t move. Not even to shift her weight. Just stood there under the motion light, hands dangling at her sides like they didn’t belong to her.

I didn’t go outside. Just turned off the tap and sat on the kitchen floor until sunrise.

••

By night three, I stopped pretending it wasn’t happening. I made coffee at 11 p.m. and sat in the living room, lights off, watching the garden through the curtains. I was tired but sharp—waiting. The air felt… thick. Heavy.

Then she was there.

Under the light again.

I pressed my forehead to the cold glass. Took her in properly.

It looked like El, yeah. From a distance. But her body was wrong. Her shoulders sat too high. Her arms hung stiff, not relaxed. Her hands opened and closed like she was rehearsing the motion. The hoodie looked too tight in some places, too loose in others—like she was trying to wear something meant for someone else.

And she wasn’t breathing. At all.

I dropped my coffee mug. The sound made her tilt her head—not fast, not startled. Just slow and off-kilter, like a puppet responding to the wrong cue.

Then she turned and walked away.

That walk—Jesus.

She didn’t bend her knees right. Her steps were short, dragging. Her arms didn’t swing. It was like she’d watched videos of people walking and was doing her best to copy it, but hadn’t quite figured out how the joints were supposed to work.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Didn’t eat the next day.

••

By night five, I’d set up a motion camera and floodlight out back. Something to prove to myself I wasn’t just losing my mind. I watched the camera feed live on my laptop.

3:17 a.m.—***ping.***

She was right there. Inches from the lens.

The floodlight blew out her features, but I could see her eyes—too round, too wide. And her mouth. Slightly open. Like she was in mid-sentence but didn’t know the words.

I rewound the footage and watched her walk up to the camera frame by frame. Her movements were stiff, mechanical. At one point, she lifted her arm and bent it the wrong way. Her elbow popped out sideways, like she forgot which direction it was supposed to go.

I almost called the police. Almost.

But what would I say? **“My ex is in my garden and her elbow bends backward now?”**

••

Night six, I cracked. I went to the window and shouted. **“What do you want?!”**

She didn’t answer. Didn’t flinch. Just stared.

The next night, she spoke.

I was upstairs, brushing my teeth. I glanced out the bathroom window and froze.

She was in the driveway this time. Closer.

She opened her mouth too slow. Like unzipping something wet. Her lips stretched far—too far—and the sound came out after the motion. Like it wasn’t connected to her body.

***“Jaaaaay…meeee.”***

Flat. No tone. Just the sound of my name dropped into the air like a piece of meat.

Her tongue moved like it was being pulled by string. Her jaw hung open too long, then snapped shut with a little click.

And her voice—

It was close to El’s. But too tight. Too deep in her chest. Like it was being squeezed through someone else’s throat. Like she’d only recently figured out how to make noise at all.

Then she smiled. Too wide. Like she was proud.

Then came the words.

***“I… miss… our… pasta nights.”***

I dropped my toothbrush.

El used to say that. After bad days. It was her code for let’s cook something stupid and fall asleep to horror movies on the couch.

But this wasn’t her. This thing was parroting something it had no right to know.

It was like it had access to something it shouldn’t. Her words. Her tone. But only the surface—like an actor who’d memorised the lines without knowing what they meant.

I duct-taped the windows after that.

But it didn’t stop.

I heard her walking on the patio. Her footsteps were slow, uneven. Sometimes she’d stop mid-step. Then shuffle again, like she was still figuring it out.

She knocked once.

Just once.

Always around the same time—3:10, 3:20 a.m.

Never tried the door. Never broke a window. Never forced anything.

It was like she was waiting.

For me to let her in.

••

By night ten, I stopped looking. Stopped eating. I kept the lights on and sat with my back against the kitchen cupboards, knife in my hand, whole body buzzing.

She didn’t come that night.

Which was worse.

Because on night eleven, I woke up to breathing.

Not mine.

It was coming from the other side of my bedroom door.

Slow. Wet. Just close enough for the sound to slip under the frame.

I sat up in bed. Held my breath.

The doorknob shifted. Clicked.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t make a sound.

The breathing stopped.

Then a voice: **“Jamie. I came in.”***

It was her voice. Flat. Slow. Like she was figuring it out as she went.

But the door never opened.

Eventually I found the courage to flip the bedside light. Nothing. No shadow under the door. No footsteps retreating.

I crept to the hallway, knees shaking. The front door downstairs was wide open. The hallway rug had a streak of mud across it. No prints. Just mud. Dragged in like something was pulled.

I stayed awake until dawn. Every creak in the house made my spine lock up.

••

When morning came, I walked outside, half-expecting to find her standing there. I didn’t.

But my hoodie—El’s hoodie—was lying in the grass.

It was inside out.

And wet.

I don’t know how long I’ve been awake now. Three days? Four?

She hasn’t come back. Not yet. But I know she will. She’s watching. Waiting. Just outside the places I let myself look.

I can hear her walking sometimes.

Practicing.

**Viewable memory carrier: Trel'Ayn, the inferior ambassador of the Telrani race.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: May 31, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

  
It's a failure. A complete failure!

Not only did we lose with as many casualties as possible, and some warriors are now being rehabilitated from the psychological trauma inflicted, but the humans' comissar made a report that the eskin directing the battle and all the laws of physics in the simulation 'did not match reality'. And then he also condescendingly said that we could not know how the thermobaric missiles work, that they are designed to destroy fortifications and infantry, not the mechs. Now almost all infantry are afraid of the roar of human mechs and their missiles.

And I also didn't sleep tonight...that's what it took to exactly thrill me was a group of soldiers putting on masks with some intimidating creatures on them, only to play up the nature of the defenders.

I can still see those bronze fangs in the dark and the mocking eyes of the humans behind the masks.

Okay, I'll finish the reports, send them to my superiors via long-range transponder from orbit and I can sleep. Just another ten hours and then I can sleep.

There was a knock on the door and I opened its locks, only after all this time bothering to raise my eyes and look at the person who entered. My heart was racing, my breathing hitched, and I almost jumped up and down against the far wall. The antennae stirred, speaking danger to everyone around him and buzzing strangely, and his ears pressed against his head as if they weren't even there.

Mask, mask, mask...

“Hey! Hey! It's okay, it's me, Anton!” came a familiar voice and the man who had come in took off his mask. 

Only now I noticed that it was the most ordinary one, there were no fangs on it, it wasn't even made of bronze. Damn nature, what are you doing to me? Weird, I should have been more scared at the sight of this man, but without the mask, he evoked a kind of calm or even uplifted mood.

“I'm sorry,” I said, calming down a little. “Have a seat, I'll stir the drinks.”

“I brought mine,” the comissar said slowly approaching the table. “If you like warm drinks, of course.”

I overpowered myself and looked into the predator's eyes. There was no malice in them, not even the same fire that frightened every one of my subordinates. Rather, I saw concern, a slight fear, even sadness. Is he afraid of scaring me? Not because I'm ambassador of the Telrani race, or I wouldn't have seen such sadness. What kind of creatures are you humans?

“I apologize for my subordinates, I didn't know they would decide to scare you so badly. They will immediately be reprimanded for their AWOL behavior.”

Anton carefully placed two low mugs without handles on the table, the same ones we'd been drinking from the other day. It was nice of him, because he could have just gotten deep human mugs and I would have had to get my face inside them just to drink.

“Don't be, I'm hardly scared at all, it's just that I've been up all night with these reports and so I'm on edge.” I lied almost successfully and began to wait for that very ‘my drink’ of my mate's.

“So lie down for a couple hours and then go fill it all out afterward.” The man shrugged. “Those echoes of bureaucracy aren't worth your health.”

Almost immediately, the man pulled something like an iron cylinder with rounded edges from behind his back, unscrewed part of it, and began pouring out...hot black water? It doesn't matter, it's unlikely he's trying to poison me. Immediately after my drink he diluted it with plain water from the decanter from my table, and took his own at once. His drink was steaming, did they really care that much about the temperature?

“Wait...you can do that?” 

I took the cup in my hands and began gently tasting the drink with my tongue. The warmth of it spread through my body, the sweetness of it, the slightly tart flavor of it was good for me - it was invigorating.  

“You mean sleep for a certain amount of time and wake up afterward? Well yeah, don't you?” wondered my buddy.

“No one in the galaxy can do that! And even if they did, the council doesn't know about it!”

“Well, what can you do?” shrugged the officer. “Humanity's been in contact with the council for a year and for most of that time we've been trying to convince you that we're not going to eat all the herbivores. I'm sure every predator that's come to you has been through something like that.”

“What a strange race you humans are.” I sipped my drink again, clearly unable to marvel at it more. “And what was that you poured me? It's like it's invigorating me.”

“Tea. This tea is black, and you used to pour us instant green tea, remember? And it wakes you up because it contains caffeine, but there's so little of it that you'd rather go back to sleep”. 

“Caffeine? How awful.” shrugged I shivered. “And how often do you drink it?”

“It's not that much, 47 milligrams per cup, tops. And sometimes I drink coffee when I need to wake up quickly, it's usually more than that.”

“My dear friend, we have enough for 200 milligrams to replace the martial stimulant. But it lasts about five minutes and we're out of it for about ten hours. Be careful with that.”

“Oh...I'll be careful with that.” the man immediately put his cylinder back in his pocket behind his back. “I'll make an announcement about it tonight.”

“Okay. Now let's get down to business, my friend.”

We started discussing his report and I even took notes on my personal computer, but a minute or two passed and I started noticing more and more often that I couldn't remember the words they said and my notes were filled with sticky characters stretching halfway down the page.

“You need to go to bed.” Anton said suddenly, clearly noticing these kinds of memory lapses. “The caffeine is keeping you up all the way, but I'll bet you ten bucks that if you lie down, you'll fall asleep.”

“No, I'm fine, I-”

“Sleep.” the man said more threateningly. “I'll bite you.”

I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not, but I decided to listen to my colleague and started to get up from my chair, but immediately fell back down.

The man only shook his head and walked over to my chair, lifting me in his arms as lightly as if I were fluff. Why was I able to let him lift me up so easily? All my instincts were silent, not even a tremor in my body.

Anton took my hand affectionately and kissed my knuckles again, as if apologizing for doing this to me without my permission.

“You need to rest,” he remarked more quietly, carrying me over to the bed. “Your nose is already red, you must be sick, sleep will help.”

“What? Red nose?” was all I had time to ask before I was placed on the bed.

“Get some rest, Trel'Ayn. We'll talk tomorrow.” the comissar suddenly spoke in my native tongue and with a slight smile, showing his fangs, on his face left the room.

A wave of shivers and warmth ran through my body, and I couldn't take my eyes off the door he'd come out of.

“Goddamn softy."" I whispered, rubbing my red nose before falling asleep.

**Viewable memory carrier: Ty'Lorin, female warrior of the fifteenth battalion of the Telrani race army.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: May 31, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

  
Damn softy! I had just finished filling out all the paperwork when I got a message on my PDA that I needed to spend time with him to exchange traditions and stuff.

And the ambassador isn't answering either. What kind of day is this?

Even though I had sat behind the turrets all through the last simulation training, I was still intimidated by the way they fought us. They weren't afraid to sacrifice equipment and their infantry just to get the job done. Not only that, but those bastards tricked us and flew over the wall, distracting our main forces! If it wasn't for that trick, we would have defeated them!

Well, you can't undo what you've done. Gotta hurry so I don't talk to this idiot for more than the allotted time on my one day off a year.

Suddenly, my friend rushed past me at what felt like the speed of light, followed by three predators at once. I thought they were showing their true colors,  I even reached for my gun, but one of the softy suddenly yelled.

“Catch her! Catch her! She drank a cup of coffee with four hundred milligrams of caffeine in it! She could hurt herself!”

Well, that sounds like a friend of mine. Rai'Nor does something without thinking and then reaps the consequences, and it's strange that our race doesn't run after her too.

In any case, I decided to leave quickly so I wouldn't have to watch this rather scary action.

I reached my room rather quickly, where Curie was already waiting for me. I had to learn his name so I could restrain myself from calling that predator slurs. I thought I'd weaned myself off swearing by now, but no, there would be a fool who would surely make me do it again.

The man was sitting there reading some book on PDA that my visor translated as “451 degrees Fahrenheit.”

“451 degrees? I only know about celsius and kelvins, what happens at that temperature?” suddenly to myself I asked.

The Predator raised his eyes, looked me over obviously through his black glasses, and closed the book.

“The temperature at which paper burns.” He suddenly explained calmly. “I'll let you read it later if you want. You've got an exine that can translate the text of the book into your language anyway.”

Why is he so calm? Did he quench his bloodlust in the simulation or did he just sleep it off?

“I wouldn't mind reading.” I decided not to be a nuisance, either, and sat down on my bed, across from softy. “Have you thought about what you're going to share today?”

“Do you want something scary or something calm?” the man grinned with obvious pleasure in his voice.

“What's stopping you from showing both?” holding back irritation I asked. “And take off those damn glasses, they're disgusting to look at.”

The man shrugged and removed his glasses, placing them on a table extended from the wall.

I'd never seen such a piercing stare. I was familiar with many of the creatures' gazes, and I'd even seen predators a couple times, but here I could barely keep myself from running. He was staring at me as if it were a foregone conclusion, as if I were no longer alive.

“Antennas twitch when they're scared,” grinned the man, grinning with his fangs. “We'll remember that.”

“You asshole!” I couldn't stand it, grabbing my antennae. “You didn't have to say that out loud!”

“Okay, okay, we'll forget it. ok?.” The man suddenly handed me a datapad, which apparently had the information he wanted to share with me. “Let's start with the easy part. Open the file titled 'Aspects of Evolution and the Fear Response'.”

For about an hour he showed me what humans looked like millions of years ago, how they evolved and touched on the specifics of how they feel fear. As it turned out, they weren't so fearless, it was just that the people on our base were a little worn out from life and felt little fear. It was fun to see a man or woman of the human race afraid of rodents and other small creatures, or even faint from fear of heights.

“And also...well...I've prepared a video for you on another topic and just so you don't freak out, I'm going to go get something to drink in the cafeteria. Watch it for yourself.”

The softy rose from his seat, put on his glasses, and headed away from the room.

“So what's the big deal?” I asked the void with a chuckle in my voice, but my gut immediately clenched when I saw the name of the file.

'Why humans are called predators.'

This video was obviously prepared by Earth scientists, as the past was a pasting of stuff, and here everything was and edited well and different diagrams, but the content itself....

Humans began to hunt of their own free will, and evolution helped them to do it. 

They didn't have enough organic food from trees, and they couldn't digest plants, so they started hunting.

They invented tools, started hunting together, using tactics that other predators had never done. But the problem isn't even that, it's what were the most popular tactics.

  
If they could not keep up with the victim, they chased the victim so long that he fell down from fatigue and was left only to finish him off.

Damn it, they even hunted other predators, also for fun, for positive emotions, for entertainment!

When the datapad showed a picture of people standing around with kinetic weapons and taking pictures in front of a dead predator that was twice as big and covered in brown fur, all my instincts kicked in.

Those cheerful smiles, those happy eyes. Do they really enjoy these atrocities so much?

“Humans are forced to eat meat to be healthy, as they have a lot of nutrients for our body.” broadcast one of the their scientists. “However, if we continued to hunt, we would simply exterminate all the wildlife on the planet, so we domesticated some species and in return for caring for them, after taking their meat, bones and other things that are good for us.”

The antennas that had been swaying in fear up to that point suddenly stood up stakes, and I couldn't look away from the screen at all from shock.

“They're raising herbivores for slaughter...” only escaped my throat before tears flowed down my cheeks.

“However, we don't treat animals only as food sources.” he suddenly stated. “Many keep them around as companions or even friends. Even some predators have been domesticated by us.”

I didn't even have time to say anything before videos of people happily playing with some furry predators, feeding and stroking horned creatures that happily eat dried grass from their hands, saving small animals from a forest fire.

“The most important thing that distinguishes us from many predators is empathy. Humans are such creatures that our instincts are dulled by our own intelligence, and so even if we were to starve to death, many of us would rather accept death than eat our semi-intelligent companion, much less a creature that has a mind similar to ours in its head. Even many of our nations' religions are based on the tenets of 'thou shalt not kill' and 'love your neighbor as you might love yourself.' ”

The datapad showed videos suddenly showed people in cage-like rooms.

“Many countries before the confederacy even abolished the death penalty because they realized that a person could be innocent and their life could never be taken back.”

Suddenly Curie himself appeared on the screen, he was dressed in his dress uniform and looked even kinder than I had seen today.

“Dear non-humans,” he began. “With this video we wanted to show you that mankind are not blood thirsty monsters that want to eat you. We've made a lot of mistakes in the past, we probably will in the future, but, we will make them as your friends, not your enemies. We are offended and sad when you look at us and see only predators, when you put us on the same level with those who would not hesitate to kill you for food. We don't want that. We want to be friends and coexist, please, remember that and for once in your life look your human in the eyes without fear and hatred.”

The video ended on a shot that included a photo of a human soldier handing a soft toy to a crying child and the caption 'Man first encountered alien life on Caporen 4 when one country's space fleet interceded for the civilians of the world. Ten months later, humans were already members of the Galactic Federation.'

I was left with mixed feelings after the video. These softy's are as controversial as they are weird. I can't believe that...that there are creatures that started eating meat just to survive.

My breathing gradually calmed down and the trembling in my body went away. My heart began to beat calmly.

I rested the datapad on the bed and ran out of the room. I had to find Curie. I needed to find him, to scold him first for all the stress of the video, and then to apologize to my human.

1jx71jh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx71jh,Trip Report,"One week: Seoul and Sokcho (first Korea visit)

Focus: hiking, food, tours

I loved reading other people's trip reports and found it helpful for planning our trip so I thought I'd through our experience in. 

Day One: Arrived in Seoul-stayed in Myeongdong. We went to Myeongdong Kyo Ja for dinner, we would highly recommend, we had a chicken broth soup and a tray of dumplings. You will line up to order, once you reach the server they will ask you to pick the items you would like, there are about four menu options. Pick what you'd like and pay in advance. They are very quick about rotating people through the restaurant so the line will go fast. 

Day  Two: A very long day, we hit up Seoul Tower, Gyeongbokgung Palace/Folk Museum, Bukchon Hanok Village, and Namdaemun Market. We also tried Myeongdong Croquettes, a cute little bakery with great croquettes, try the red bean one. 

Day Three: DMZ tour-we booked through Klook and it was worth it as we hadn't been to Korea before. On the tour we got to try soybean icecream, we enjoyed it a lot more than we thought we would. It almost has a peanut butter-esqe flavor. We also walked through Myeongdong Night Market. We preferred Namdaemun over Myeongdong. Myeongdong was very busy and it was hard to look at each stall. Namdaemun also has clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, etc. so you can look through that between bites of hotteok and tteokbokki. 

Day Four: Trip to Sokcho, we caught the express bus from Seoul. We caught the local bus Seoraksan National Park and hiked to Biryong falls/observatory. We ended up doing the hike quite late, but that worked out for us because we were some of the last people leaving the park. We spotted a raccoon-dog just as we were leaving (this is a huge win for us, we wanted to see one while hiking in Japan and few years back but couldn't find any). We also tried marinated crab. I'm not sure if it was because it was the off season but restaurants were closing up around 8pm, so plan accordingly, Naver and google maps didn't always have accurate hours for places. 

Day Five: Back to Seoraksan, we hiked Ulsanbawi Rock-be prepared for stairs! Afterwards we went to the fish market, you'll see locals wandering around with white boxes of chicken-follow them! Other stalls will try to distract you with other chicken, don't give in, you need to try the original. There are two stalls at the market, they are white with a red chicken head logo-it's called Mansuk Dak Gangjeong. Try their fried chicken, they will hand you a box, it will be cold but don't be alarmed, it is fantastic. The sauce has a bit of spice with some peppers but is also sweet and sour. 

Day Six: Back to Seoul. Before we left Sokcho we stopped at Chungchodam for coffee. We had a phenomenal sesame latte. The cafe is very trendy and the latte was great, highly recommend. We did a pub crawl through Hongdae, we booked it through Klook. This was not exactly what we expected, the bars we went to were clearly set aside for tourists and didn't give an authentic experience. The plus side was meeting some other lovely folks who were travelling and sharing some tips. The downside hit us the next morning; soju will give you one hell of a hangover. 

Day Seven: It was a rainy day so we tried to find indoor activities. We went to the war and women's rights museum, it was interesting to learn more about the comfort women system. We also went to Lotte mall and got a new pair of glasses + free eye exam from Davich Opitical. We also wandered around Lotte world and checked out the cherry blossoms. Luckily our lovely hotel host gave us umbrellas or this day would have been a bit of a wash. 

Day Eight: We walked through Hongdae shopping street. I like to collect cute art/earrings from different places we travel to. We went to Object and found a few post cards and stickers. Then we caught our flight home!


Overall it was a fun trip, probably too brief to fully experience Korea but we enjoyed our time. If you are planning to go, download Naver and Papago beforehand as google isn't totally reliable there. ",10,1744424709.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

**Crosses to Bear**

The golden morning sunlight eased its way into my eyesight, coaxing me back to the land of the living. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, a pounding headache greeted me; last night's escapades, clearly taking effect. I looked downward, to see Chris still asleep. He groaned softly as he rolled over onto his side. I stood to stretch my legs and find some water but noticed a blanket draped over the bench seats that I hadn't seen before. I grabbed the blanket and gently placed it on Chris before walking over to the breakfast buffet in the center of the room. I stood in a line that was formed, flanked by two men and a young woman. I reached the front of the line and grabbed a bottle of water, a cup of black, aromatic espresso, and a blueberry muffin. Everything smelt delicious despite my growing nausea.

""Can you hand me a fork?"" The young woman behind me asked. She was thin as a rail and had jet-black hair that caught the sunlight, causing it to shimmer. I handed her the utensil and she thanked me. ""Rough night?"" she asked. 

""You could say that,"" I answered with a forced smirk.

""I saw you and that other guy come in late last night. The g-men force you back here too?""

""G-men?"" I asked.

""The staff."" She replied. I remembered last night, the ominous warning the bartender gave Chris and I, echoed in the back of my mind.

""Uh, yeah. Chris had a little too much to drink last night and caused a bit of a scene. I kinda got roped into it."" I answered matter-of-factly.

""Yeah, they don't take too kindly to anything but partying up there."" She said, a forlorn look in her eye. ""I'm Misty Guillard, by the way."" The young woman said, offering her hand to shake.

""Nice to meet you, Misty, I'm...""

""Oh, hey Newbie, you're awake. Save any coffee for me?"" Chris interrupted. ""Oh, hi there, I'm Chris. Pleasure to meet you. Chris shook her hand.

""Good to meet you too Chris. Your friend here was just explaining how the two of you ended up back here.""

""Oh, that whole ordeal was a load of shit,"" Chris answered flippantly. ""I got a little inebriated and divulged a bit too much of my past. My eyes started to sweat a little and that, I guess, is a major no-no up there in party land."" He said, with a wave of his hand.

 I looked over at him with a knowing glance. He was downplaying the whole ordeal, either not remembering or purposefully leaving out how much of a gibbering mess he was. ""But hey, don't mind me, I'm gonna go get me some breakfast and mingle a bit."" He said, with a grin, and turned his heels toward the back of the line. Misty and I grabbed our breakfasts and sat together at the nearest unoccupied bench.

""Your friend seems..."" she trailed off

""Helpless?"" I answered.

""I was going to say eccentric."" She said with a giggle. ""Have you known each other long?"" 

""We met yesterday, and he's already getting me in trouble,"" I stated, a tinge of resentment apparent in my voice. ""I haven't been on this bus for twenty-four hours, and I've already been threatened by security. What about you, when did you get here?"" 

""Oh, I uh, I don't really know how long I've been here."" She said, looking intently at the floor. ""Could be weeks, maybe months."" She said, under her breath. I got the feeling it wasn't something she wanted to talk about, so I changed the subject.

""So, where are you from?"" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation toward a more mundane topic.

""I was born in Toulouse, France, but moved to Nashville when I was eight. My dad got a job in the States that paid much better than his previous job, so we relocated to Tennessee.""

""That must have been a culture shock,"" I answered, sipping my coffee.

""Not for me, I was so young I remember very little of France. I don't even have much of an accent."" She said, staring out the window. 

""It still must have been hard, did you leave behind any family, any friends?"" I asked. Her face turned pale, as if all of the blood in her body turned to ice, all at once.

""No...no friends."" She muttered. Again, despite myself, it seems I struck a nerve.

""I hope I didn't poke into a sore subject,"" I said, apologetically. I was met only with silence. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I was about to say something else when Misty said,

""I don't deserve friends."" She grabbed her dirty dishes and walked away. I sat there stumped. Was it something I said? What did she mean by not deserving friends?

As I sat there, in contemplation, the pianist in the background played a jazzy tune. Everything was rather peaceful until Chris walked up to me with two lit cigars.

""Oh, great,"" I thought to myself.

""Hey, Newbie. I brought an apology gift. The staff were handing these out, so I grabbed one for each of us. I guess it's my way of saying sorry for how last night...you know. He said, trailing off.

I wasn't really up for smoking. I'm not much of a fan of cigars, but with the apologetic eyes Chris was giving me, I couldn't say no.

""Thanks,"" I said, apprehensively reaching for the stogie. He plopped down next to me and inhaled deeply.

""This sure is the life. Not a care in the world, just two friends relaxing, smoking some of the finest Cuba has to offer."" He said, a wide grin forming from ear to ear. 

While he prattled on and on about the finer things in life, I was scanning the room, my eyes searched for Misty through the crowd. I finally spotted her, sitting alone in a corner, her face buried in her hands, seemingly crying.

"".....and that's why I only eat grass-fed beef, am I right Newbie?"" I stood, ignoring Chris' inane babble, and cut through the crowd where Misty was sitting. I gently placed my hand on her shoulder, in an attempt to comfort her. She jerked away, in a startle, and looked up at me, her eyes red and puffy from tears.

""I'm sorry if I upset you. That wasn't my intention. But if you want to talk, I'm a good listener."" I said, softly.

""Why do you care?"" She asked incredulously. ""Everyone on this bus is here for one reason or another, and I'm no different. I'm sure you have your reasons, and you don't see me bothering you about it!"" She was clearly, very upset, and her tone mirrored the tumult of emotions she was facing. She sniffled and wiped tears from her cheeks before speaking again. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. You're only trying to help. I guess I'm just going through a lot lately.""

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, taking my seat next to her. She sat in silence for a moment, gathering her thoughts.

""I guess, I'll start from the beginning. When I first moved to the US, I was an outcast. I didn't have any friends or anyone, for that matter, to speak to. I barely spoke the language, so meeting new people was out of the question, and my parents were never home because of their busy schedules.""

""I would go to school, struggle to understand what was taught to me, go home, do homework, eat a frozen dinner, and go to sleep. Day after day, month after month, year after year, it was the same routine. Because I spoke so rarely, some of the more rude kids thought I had some kind of learning disorder and were rather mean to me. I was bullied relentlessly. Kids and teachers alike would talk behind my back and when they did speak to me it was with an air of condescension.""

""One day at lunch, when I was around twelve, a particularly abrasive student grabbed my cell phone out of my backpack. He waved it around, putting on a mocking French accent, saying, 'Mother, why did you pack snails in my lunch box, I wanted frog legs!' All I could do was cry. But that only egged him on."" 

""Each of his friends were laughing at me. All but one, Joeseph McCollum."" She sighed deeply after saying his name, as if even mentioning him weighed on her shoulders. ""He stood up from his seat and grabbed my phone from his friend, told him to stop being an ass, and gave it back to me. In an outburst of emotion, I hugged him. Coming to my senses, I was so embarrassed that I ran off. But it stuck with me. Because of him sticking up for me, a social pariah, his friends ostracized him."" 

""A few days later, I was sitting alone at lunch and he came up to me. He asked to sit next to me and I, being too stunned to speak, nodded vigorously. From that day on, we were inseparable."" 

""We had a lot in common, such as hiking and biking. Every weekend, we would bike down nature trails, and hike up hills and small mountains.""

""Even our family dynamics were similar. My parents were always gone because of work, Joseph's were never there to begin with. He told me his mom would get high and sleep all day, and his father told him he was an 'unlovable drain' before he walked out on the family.I felt bad for him but as long as we were in this boat together, we would never be alone again.""

""Once high school came around, we tested our relationship to see if we were more than friends. It didn't work out though."" She said with a thoughtful smile.

 ""We were just too close to risk what we already had. We still spent nearly every day together. We would take turns walking each other home from the bus stop, helping one another with assignments, and goofing off together when we had the time. Every day with him felt like a privilege. Due to his influence, I slowly started coming out of my shell. I was more confident when speaking to people and being in social settings in general. With my newfound confidence, Joeseph and I applied to the local university. I'll never forget the day Joseph and I received our acceptance letters. We were so excited, we played music as loud as we could and danced through my house all day.""

""We made all sorts of plans such as: what courses we would take, what our majors would be, and what extracurriculars we would pursue. We even found a small apartment to share within walking distance of the school. We settled in nicely but once school started, we began to see less and less of each other. It started slowly,"" She said, melancholy dripping from her voice.

""At first, we hung out every weekend. Then, every other weekend. By the time Christmas break started, I had seen him once in the last three months. The worst part is, that I had convinced myself I didn't miss him. I had made new friends this year and they were taking up my time. I was sure he had too.""

""A girl in my physics class, Rebecca, invited me to a Christmas party her sorority was throwing. It sounded like a ton of fun and just the release I needed from the stress of school. I ran home to get changed and I saw Joseph. He was so excited to see me. He ran to me saying, 

'Misty! I've got a surprise for you! I've rented out this beautiful B&B in the forest for the break. There are these breathtaking lakes and hiking trails that take you to the foot of the Smokies. Pack a couple of bags, we can leave in the morning!'"" 

""His eyes were wide with excitement, but I hadn’t expected him to make such a big plan without telling me first. Suddenly, I felt cornered. I hadn’t really thought about it until he asked, but my priorities had changed. A year ago, I would have jumped at the idea, but now… I had new friends and a new life. Part of me was afraid to go back to the way things used to be, afraid that it would pull me back into that old version of myself.""

""'You did all that without asking me? 'I've already made plans.'""

""I could see the joy drain from his face, replaced by hurt and disbelief. He looked at me like I’d just slapped him.

""'You...you made plans? With who?'""

""'Rebecca, from my physics class,' I answered casually, but guilt gnawed at me and I avoided his eyes.""

""'Rebecca, you just met her last week, and you didn’t think to ask if maybe I wanted to do something? You just… replaced me.' His voice was quieter, but the bitterness was starting to creep in.""

""'She invited me, Joseph. You can't just expect me to drop everything because you made plans without asking.'""

""His face twisted, something darker stirring beneath the surface. 'Drop everything? That's rich coming from you. Lately, you've barely acknowledged I exist. Ever since you made all of these new friends, I’ve been an afterthought. Maybe you’re too good for me now, huh?'""

""I rolled my eyes, feeling my frustration mounting. 'This isn’t about you! I’ve just been busy. We both have.'""

""'Busy?' He nearly spat the word out. 'Busy ditching me at every turn! It’s like the second you found a group that wasn’t bullying you, you decided I was expendable!'""

""His words stung, and I snapped back, 'I’m not your emotional crutch, Joseph. You can’t just expect me to be there for you every second like I owe you something.'""

""'So that’s what I am now, huh? Some albatross around your neck, some burden? That’s great, Misty. All these years, that's what you reduce me to.' His voice was rising, and his face was flushed with anger.""

""'You know what, maybe you are!' I shouted, the words spilling out before I could stop them. 'God, it’s like every time I’m with you, you drain the life out of me with your endless need for validation. You don’t need me, Joseph—you just don’t want to be alone, and I’m tired of feeling guilty for living my life!'""

""His face turned pale. His lips trembled, and when he spoke, his voice was deadly quiet. 'At least I needed you, Misty. You don’t need anyone, do you? That’s why you’re so damn heartless.'""

""'Oh, heartless?' I shot back, sarcasm dripping from every word. 'Is that what you tell yourself? Maybe you’re just so unlovable that you cling to whoever shows you the slightest bit of affection because deep down, you know they’ll all leave you just like your dad did! That’s why you’re so obsessed with me—I’m the only one who’s ever cared enough to stick around.'""

""His eyes widened in shock. I could see the impact of my words hit him like a freight train. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. I had crossed a line, and we both knew it.""

""'I…' he started to say, but the hurt in his eyes quickly turned to rage. 'Well, guess what? You didn’t stick around, either. You're just like everyone else who walks out of my life. Turns out you’re even worse because I thought you were different. But no, you’re just a cold, backstabbing bitch.'""

""My heart was racing, my vision blurring with anger, but I felt like I had to win this fight, even if it meant going too far. 'And you know what? Maybe I was just being nice to you all these years because I felt sorry for you. Everyone else saw it—you’re pathetic, Joseph. You’re just too scared to admit it.'""

""There was a tense, deafening silence between us. His shoulders slumped, his face pale as if all the life had drained out of him. When he looked at me, his eyes were hollow, like I’d ripped the last piece of hope from him."" 

""He walked away from me, into his room. I stood there for a moment, collecting my thoughts before I, with a huff, stormed out of the apartment."" 

""I went to the party but my mind was elsewhere the entire time. I knew I handled Joseph and I's argument poorly. I needed to apologize.""

""I went back to the apartment to try and smooth things over, but when I opened the door, I found him there, hanging from the curtain rod,"" Misty said, tears freely flowing from her eyes. ""A note protruded from his pocket with only three words written. 'You were right.'"" 

Misty, was oppenly sobbing, her words only coming out in short, raspy breaths. She looked at me, her heart seemingly torn from her chest. ""The last thing I told him was he was pathetic."" She wheezed. ""I caused this, it's all my fault he died!"" 

I sat there in stunned silence, not sure what to think or say. My initial reaction was to reach out and hug her. She clung to me like a drowning man does a lifeboat, searching my eyes for hope, for a lifeline.

 ""It's not your fault. He, obviously, had some demons in his life he was fighting. You didn't kill him. He did."" My mind was racing as I said the words. In the back of my mind, I did feel as if she had a part to play in the tragedy but I couldn't vocalize these thoughts. The last thing she needed was a complete stranger to add to her already mounting guilt. As I held her, time stood still. I knew my attempts at consoling the poor woman were futile. She needed time to process, to grieve. After what felt like hours, she broke the hug and stood from her seat.

""You're just saying that to make me feel better,"" She said, sniffling. ""I'm not some stupid child, I don't need you to talk down to me! I'm no better than a murderer!"" A deep, void-like silence permeated the otherwise quiet room.

 I struggled to find the words to say but when nothing came, she said, with a blank, dead-eyed stare, ""I need to use the restroom."" 

She walked past me, into the crowd of people that I came to assume all had similar issues they were running from, mistakes they were too afraid to correct. Could I be one of them, I thought, for a fleeting moment, reminding me of the argument my sister and I had before I began this journey? 

Of course not, I was in control. I decided to come here to process my emotions and regroup, these people came here as an excuse to run away. My focus now should be to do everything in my power to not fall for the same traps they did.

I made my way back to my seat, deep in thought. Had I said enough? What was the point of saying anything at all? I slumped into the back of my seat with an exhausted sigh. Whether I wanted to be caught up in people's drama or not, seemed irrelevant. Maybe that is why I was here, I pondered. Maybe helping others was my purpose. If that's true, however, I don't know if I'm equipped to do that. 

As my thoughts raced, I was greeted by Chris, coming to sit with me with a hearty lunch of chili and cornbread, steaming in his bowl.

""You look pretty rough, Newbie. You sleep ok?"" He asked, mouth full.

""I don't know,"" I said dismissively. Part of me wanted to brush him off but another part needed some form of validation. ""What do you do, when there's nothing you can do?"" I asked, turning my eyes to Chris.

""There's always something you can do, Newbie,"" Chris said shoveling more chili into his mouth. ""Nothing is ever completely out of your control, you just have to decide what steps are available to you."" I pondered what he said for a moment.

""But what if someone doesn't want you to do anything? What if you may have made things worse? I'm worried for he..."" I trailed off, not wanting to say more than I should.

""Then change your approach. Find out what you did wrong and do something different."" I mulled over what he said, as he chewed loudly, blissfully unaware of the torment Misty, and I by extension, were under.  What the man lacked in decorum, I thought, he made up for it in wisdom.

""Thanks, Chris,"" I said, shutting my eyelids in hopes of a small nap.

""Any time, that's what friends are for.""

**Chapter 8**

**Gone**

A low hum of murmurs pulled me from sleep, voices growing louder until they boiled into an argument. Blinking groggily, I sat up, the dim light outside signaling the sun’s retreat beyond the horizon. My head throbbed, a dull ache from last night’s chaotic emotions and restless dreams.

""Chris,"" I whispered, nudging his shoulder. He stirred, groaning softly but didn’t wake. His snores continued, heavy and unbothered, while the noise in the room grew.

Reluctantly, I stood, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. As I stretched, I noticed a small gathering of passengers near the back of the bus, their faces etched with concern. Something wasn’t right.

“Excuse me,” I said to a man as I approached the edge of the crowd. “What’s going on?”

The man, his face lined with years of wear, turned to me. “It’s the girl. The one with the black hair.”

“Misty?” My stomach twisted.

“Yeah, her,” he said. “She’s gone to the back.”

My heart dropped. “The staff took her?”

He shook his head, glancing nervously toward the others. “No. She went on her own.”

“What?” The word escaped before I could stop it, my voice cracking with disbelief. “She just… walked back there?”

“That’s what’s got everyone riled up,” he muttered, his hands wringing his hat. “I’ve been on this bus for a long time. Seen folks get sent to the back more times than I can count, but I ain’t never seen nobody choose to go.”

The world around me spun. My mind raced with questions, with dread. Why would Misty go willingly? She had been upset earlier, sure, but…

“Did she say anything?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the lump forming in my throat.

He hesitated, guilt flashing in his eyes. “She sat next to me for a bit before she left. Looked like she wanted to talk, but… I didn’t say nothing. Just kept reading my book.”

“You ignored her?” The words came out harsher than I intended.

“I didn’t know!” he snapped back, his voice trembling. “I didn’t know what she was planning to do. I thought she just needed some space.”

I wanted to yell, to berate him for his cowardice, but the truth was like a stone in my gut—I wasn’t any better. I hadn’t checked on her after our conversation that morning. I’d left her to deal with her pain alone, and now…

A Ding Dong chime echoed through the room, silencing the murmurs.

“Attention passengers of Section Two,” came the driver’s disembodied voice, calm yet chilling. “It seems some of you are struggling to follow the rules of this journey. Let me remind you: disruptions will not be tolerated. For those who continue to test boundaries, my staff is fully equipped to handle such matters. For everyone else, relax and enjoy your escape. This is your final warning. Thank you and have a nice day.”

The tension in the room was suffocating. Slowly, the crowd began to disperse, passengers returning to their seats with hushed whispers and anxious glances.

The old man turned to me, his shoulders slumped under an invisible weight. “I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he said softly before shuffling back to his seat, head hung low.

I stood there, frozen. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at the door to the back of the bus. The driver’s warning replayed in my mind, his words heavy with menace.

This isn’t your fight, a voice in my head insisted. She made her choice. You don’t owe her anything.

But another voice, quieter yet more insistent, whispered a different truth: What if it were Mom? What if someone could have saved her and didn’t?

The thought hit me like a punch to the chest. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as the weight of guilt pressed down on me. I clenched my fists, struggling to breathe through the storm of emotions raging inside me.

I glanced back at Chris, who was now awake and watching me. His face was unreadable, his gaze shadowed with something I couldn’t quite place. When our eyes met, he quickly looked away, pulling his blanket tighter around him.

Desperation clawed at my throat. I couldn’t just sit here, couldn’t do nothing. But what could I do? If I went after her, I risked drawing the ire of the driver and the staff. If I stayed, I’d carry the weight of this choice forever.

My chest tightened, the air around me feeling thinner with each passing second. My thoughts spiraled, each one louder and more chaotic than the last. I felt trapped, cornered by my own fears and failures.

But beneath it all, that quiet voice still lingered: What if it were Mom?

**Chapter 9**

**Something Different**

I found my way to a secluded bench seat, my brows furrowed, bloodshot eyes, unblinking. I stared at the door to the back section watching for any inconsistencies in the staff's movements and the passengers' routines. My temples thumped like a war drum, adrenaline coursing through every fiber of my being. 

Every movement was noted in the back of my mind. The elderly passenger nearest to the door was engrossed in the book he told me about, and rarely looked up. The pianist unceasingly played his jazzy tunes, lulling anyone near them to sleep. The door, I noticed, remained starkly unguarded but was damn near impossible to get close to without being seen. 

I scanned across the width of the room, noticing Chris chatting with other passengers. It seemed to me, that Misty's disappearance had no effect on him and I rolled my eyes with disgust. ""How could he care so little about someone's life being in danger?"" I thought to myself.

I quickly banished the thought. Chris' uncaring attitude only served to distract me. I refocused and looked at my watch. It was getting close to dinner time. My stomach rumbled furiously. The last thing I had eaten was breakfast this morning but I couldn't allow it to hinder me. 

The staff began rolling out carts of food toward the buffet. The small closet-like door they came from was tucked, almost imperceptively into a dark corner of the lounge. My mind reeled at the possibilities. If this was a staff access corridor, it must be connected to nearly every room on the bus. If I could find a way to sneak in, I would be able to move freely throughout the entirety of the vehicle. 

""That's a big 'if'"" I muttered under my breath. Staying undetected in a staff-only passageway was all but impossible. I groaned and slouched back in my seat, rubbing my eyes. My stomach rumbled again, refusing to be ignored. I came to realize that being hungry was becoming more of a distraction than taking a few minutes to eat. I stood from my secluded perch and made my way to the buffet where I bumped into Chris.

""Oh, hey Newbie,"" Chris said, with his signature oblivious smile. ""You ok? You seem a bit out of it.""

""No, Chris, I'm not ok. I just....I got a lot on my mind."" I answered with a sigh.

""I understand if you're all tore up about the whole Maddie thing..."" He started.

""Misty!"" I exclaimed, then lowered my voice. ""Her name was...is Misty, and if I can't help her, who will?""

""Alright, fine, I get it. You're upset about Misty. But being upset isn't going to solve the problem."" He said with a sly wink.

""And doing nothing will?"" My blood was boiling; I knew exactly what to expect from Chris' emotional intelligence but by some miracle, he still found a way to let me down. ""I finally have a chance to do something meaningful in my life and you're telling me to just bury my head in the sand? No! I'm not going to sit idly by. I'm not going to run away like you did with Cindy!"" The words tasted like vinegar as they left my mouth. As soon as I said them, I wished I could take them back.



""I'm sorry, Chris. That was low and I shouldn't have said that. I'm scared. For Misty...for us.""

Chris looked up to me, his eyes filled with empathy. ""It's ok, Newbie, I get it. Eat some food, get some rest,” Chris said, his voice quieter now, almost distant. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe someone needs to do something. Just… don’t burn yourself out, okay?”

He took his food, and without another word turned and left. With my appetite well and truly gone, I grabbed a double shot of espresso for what I knew would be a long night.

Before heading back to my seclusion, I grabbed my phone from my backpack and opened the notes app. 09:00 pm, the staff cleaned up what was left of dinner. 09:15 The staff took drink orders and handed out cigars. 09:45 The old man, reading, got up to use the restroom. 09:50 The old man returned. On, and on my notes went, meticulously, typing out every movement made. 

The next time I glanced at my watch, it was well past midnight. Silence washed over the cabin like a heavy blanket. All were sleeping, all but Chris. 

He furiously jotted down on a notepad, his eyes darting from time to time to the door and to me. Once he finished writing, he quickly stuffed the note in my backpack. He took a deep breath and in a flash made a beeline toward the door. I was too stunned to react, my mouth dropped open as the whole world seemed to slow to a crawl. Chris reached his destination and fumbled awkwardly at the handle. To his and my utter horror, it didn't budge. Immediately, staff from all over the room swarmed his position. Chris screamed loudly as he rushed the staff shouting profanities and throwing wild punches. None of them connected as the staff member expertly dodged his blows like a well-trained boxer, bobbing and weaving each sloppy swipe. 

They wrestled Chris to the ground in an instant, never attacking him—only deflecting his wild punches and swiftly restraining him. I stood from my seat, every fiber of my being screaming to help him. But I hesitated. If I tried to intervene now, I'd share whatever fate the staff had in mind for him.

His eyes, wild with fear just moments before, were now steeled with defiant determination. The staff lifted him effortlessly, as though they’d done this a hundred times.

“Let me go!” Chris roared, thrashing in their grip. “Fight me like a man, you bastards! I won’t go down without a fight!”

I could only stand there, paralyzed. The other passengers stirred, whispering loudly among themselves.

“There is nothing to see here,” one of the staff members said, gripping Chris by the arm. “Go back to sleep. We will deal with this interruption.”

The door slid open, and they ushered Chris through. He glanced over his shoulder at me, flashing a wry grin and a wink—like this was all part of some grand plan only he understood.

“What just happened?” a woman nearby whispered, her voice shaky with confusion. I hesitated, still reeling from the chaos.

“I... I don’t know,” I muttered, brushing past her. I needed space, needed answers.

I hurried to my backpack, where I’d seen Chris stash the note earlier. After a quick search, I found it—crumpled into a ball. Unfolding it with trembling hands, I read the hastily scrawled words:

Hey Newbie, if you're reading this, my plan worked! I got sent to the back! Or they killed me and it didn’t work. Either way, what you said, it stuck with me. I’ve lived my life scared for far too long. I had to do something, or I’d never forgive myself. Once I find Misty, I want off this bus. I think I got what I came for anyway. Thanks for being there for me, Newbie. No matter what happens, I’m glad I met you.

My heart skipped a beat. Had he done this... for me?

Ding Dong.

The PA system crackled to life, the bus driver’s voice slicing through the heavy silence. “Twenty-four hours. You idiots couldn’t behave for twenty-four hours. I asked one simple thing from you all, and this is how you respond?”

His cold, calculated delivery sent chills down my spine.

“It seems I have to make an example out of the fool who caused this. I will not tolerate insubordination on my bus. I decide what happens here. Me. If any of you think you know better, try this stunt again. I dare you.”

The intercom cut off abruptly, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

One by one, the other passengers retreated to their seats. The weight of the driver's threat pressed down on us all, and soon the cabin was eerily quiet, everyone too afraid to speak. I crumpled down in my seat, the weight of all that had happened finally catching up to me. All I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and disappear. But that was off the table. I had to help my friends and time was running out.

1jx6y5f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx6y5f,How to care for leaf damage,"I have a fairly new plumeria plant that I brought back from Hawaii last year. It has been doing pretty well to my knowledge and even grew new leaves during winter when I had it indoors! I left for another trip to Hawaii for 8 days and when I came back it had brown holes in the leaves. I’m not sure what it is from, there is no bugs. 

I think it could be from my cats chewing on the leaves or maybe from the coffee I added into the soil for nutrients. 

How do I care for the damage now that it is done? Should I cut the leaves off? (2 out of 3 leaves are affected)

Note : I haven’t had eczema a day in my life before, and then I started drinking coffee - only Starbucks. As soon as I started, 2 months later I have suffered with full body eczema for 3 years. 

One of my clients pointed out her flare up was caused by Starbucks, so I cut it out 2 weeks ago, my body’s not 100% great, but it’s WAY better. 

I can make this knowledge because I have been eating dairy free, gluten free, low histamine diet for MONTHS while drinking Starbucks with no change, I have added back my entire diet, while removing Starbucks, and it has gotten SEVERLY better ! 

Any suggestions as to what’s in Starbucks that is triggering? Would I be good for normal coffee again else where?

When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”

I saved their comment when I first discovered it seven years ago, never knowing how much I would need it today. As I navigate the aftermath of my breakup, which feels like a death, these words have become my lifeline when breathing seems impossible and moving forward unimaginable. The waves are still massive, but knowing others have weathered similar storms gives me hope that someday, I'll learn to swim too.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  I wanted to share it with anyone who might need to hear it right now, as we all try to stay afloat.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1744424351.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

**Chapter 11: The Calvinists**



Mymy had been to Evi’s church before. It was a beautiful and imposing building, like a castle but with grand and intricate glass. 



Mymy sat behind the driver's seat, Evi drove, with Mathew riding shotgun. They pulled into the parking lot in front of the church and stepped out.



As they exited the vehicle and approached the entrance, Evi gestured to buildings around the church.

“That's our school,” said Evi, pointing to one of the buildings.

“And that's the gymnasium,” she gestured to a large cube like building on the other side of the church.

“The seminar will be there after the service.”



They were greeted at the entrance and took their seats in the middle pews, waiting for the service to start.



As they waited, Mymy's thoughts began to wander. 

Mymy truly believed that faith would help Maya. 

When she was first deployed, all her friends from the academy had been assigned to other stations. She was separated from her friends, family and completely alone in a new and demanding life.

The ship's chapel was the only place she could go to escape from the isolation, the loneliness, the stress. As if stepping into that small holy room cast out all fear and anxiety. 

It was in that small chapel where she met Evi, her first friend on deployment, now one of her best friends. 



She recalled the joy of her baptism aboard the Helfrich. Just over two years after she had first been assigned, two years of deep thought, conversation, and introspection had lead to that moment. Mathew, John, Abel and Evi had all been their to witness and celebrate with her and in that moment she had never felt more loved.



The memories made her smile.

As the service started, she wanted nothing more than to give that comfort, that peace, and those relationships to Maya. 

  
  
  


Coco drove down the road to Mayas’ apartment. The day's itinerary made her recall the first time she had crossed paths with the church. 

Not long after she started work in South Africa a catholic priest and his small ministry stopped to rest at their aid camp. 

They had with them: trucks, tools, and equipment of all kinds. 

The leading priest told her that they were venturing further north to establish schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. 

Coco had been shocked to hear this,no one went further north, it was a hotbed of insurgent groups and warlords, Isolated from the protection the army provided. 

Every day, many people came from the north, seeking aid and rest from brutal insurgents and fighting.

When she heard what their plan was, she was stunned. 

*How could these people venture into such a hostile area?* 

When she inquired further as to the rationale behind such a dangerous mission, the priest was ready with an answer.

“There are many villages and people who need our help. The dangers matter not, wherever God's people are suffering, we will be there to do the will of our father.” 



It was the courage and devotion in the face of likely death set Coco into the rabbit hole. She spent afternoons and free time reading about the history and theology of the church and talking with the camp's chaplain. His story was awe inspiring:

Father Garcia told her about how he was orphaned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and was often ostracised and alone growing up. The only place where he could escape the loneliness and torment was his local church. When the pastor found out he was orphaned he immediately sought to adopt him. He was raised by that pastor.  The way he saw it: his life had been saved by the lord. 



The truth of the history, beauty of the theology and courage of the people moved Coco deeply.

Father Garcia would baptize Coco after two years of hard thought, prayer and debate. Something for which she would always be grateful.



Coco knew the holy spirit was real, she saw it in the schools, hospitals and wells of South Africa, in the patients she cured, in the missionaries who set out to aid those in need. Now, she felt it in herself, and saw it in her life, reaching out to relieve Maya of the pain and loneliness.



She felt eager as she pulled into the driveway, eager to see her sister. She made her way into the building and up the stairs, stopping at Maya’s room. Something felt wrong.



“Maya?” she called out.

  
  
  
  


Maya lay inside, unable to move, petrified. The anxiety made her sick to her stomach, she had lay awake all night. Regret, fear and loathing danced in her mind like mocking daemons, denying her any rest. 

When she agreed to attend the seminar, she was emboldened, strengthened by her sisters. 



Now, she had spent the night alone with her thoughts. 



It started calm, small bits of anxiety and doubt. But it had spiraled into an all oppressive monster, filling her thoughts with the worst of ideas. It was as if the past weeks had been all for nothing. The fear, the loneliness, the crippling anxiety of simply speaking to another human being. It had all returned with a vengeance. 



All through the night, they denied her any rest. The urge to cry overpowering her need for sleep. All through the night she cried dry tears, helpless to end the mental onslaught, unable to move.

*You will never find anything meaningful! How could you be so stupid? Going to a church seminar? There is NO GOD! Especially not one who could love yo-*



The thought was cut short by her sister's embrace. 

“It’s ok Maya. I’m here”



All at once the monster retreated into her subconscious, as a daemon cast away by an angel.



She stopped crying and rolled over to see Coco. Even in her poorly lit room, she seemed to shine. 



It was strange, a month earlier she hated this person, at least she thought she did. Now, her sister was like a rising sun, casting out the night. She felt renewed, anxiety and fear still remained, they were still strong. But now, it was manageable.



“If you don't want to do this, If you think it's too much: no one will be mad or disappointed.” 



“No” said Maya calmly, wiping a tear from her eye

“I want to do this,” she said determinedly, a small smile appearing on her face. 

She didn't know how but, with her sister here now, the pain and anxiety had abandoned her. Replaced by a new sense of confidence. 

  


Coco smiled back. 

“I’ll give you a minute to clean up” 

  
  


Mymy, Evi, and Mathew stepped out of the church just as Coco and Maya pulled into the parking lot.



Mymy waved to them as the two stepped out.

“Hey Maya, Hey Coco” said Mymy

“Hey” replied Coco

“Perfect timing” said Evi excitedly

“Reverend Dekker is about to start! you're going to love it Maya, we're so happy you could join us!” 

“Thanks” Maya responded quietly. There remained a small lingering anxiety. Not oppressive, but present.

The group went inside, taking seat in a row of chairs towards the rear of a group facing the pastor, Reverend Dekker. 



“Thank you all for being her today, friends and family! We are so happy to have you all here, please feel free to enjoy the snacks and refreshments.” 



Reverend Dekker wasnt what Maya was expecting. He was young, not as much as Maya or her sisters, but younger than she expected.



“Before I begin, I’d like to give a short prayer”



At this, everyone put their heads down, some clasped their hands, others closed their eyes.

Maya looked towards Coco, not knowing what to do. 

“It’s alright” whispered Coco,

“You don't need to do anything”



At this, Maya felt reassured, simply choosing to look down.



“Heavenly father, may you bless those gathered here today. May you uplift them from troubles. Lift up your countenance upon them, and grant them peace. Amen”



Everyone lifted their heads and opened their eyes. The room's full attention focused on the priest. 

“I would like to start with a short reading from psalm 42, as I feel it relates heavily to the topic. I encourage you to think about it as we move along.”



He paused for a moment, allowing some people to find the section of text. 

Maya looked over to Coco.

Taking note of Maya’s gaze, she shot a quick smile as she turned to the psalm. 

Maya hadn't realized it until then, but, something had changed. The anxiety had left her, she no longer felt placed in a new and strange environment. Rather, she felt comforted by her sisters and interested in the topic. 

She looked over to Coco’s open bible to which her sister moved the book between them.



“Verses 9 through 13: 

Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and body with grief. 

 My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, and my bones grow weak.

 Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors and an object of dread to my closest friends— those who see me on the street flee from me.

 I am forgotten as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery. 

 For I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side!” They conspire against me and plot to take my life. 

 But I trust in you, Lord; I say, “You are my God.”  My times are in your hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me. 16 Let your face shine on your servant…



save me in your unfailing love.”



The priest paused to let the weight of the words rest on his assembly. He had spoken fervently, not shouting or angry, but with passion.



Coco looked to Maya who had been intently following in the text. She was surprised to see tears in her sister's eyes.



Maya had been caught off guard. Fully expecting to be preached to, she hadn't expected the words to strike such a deep chord with her. 

The way she saw it, whoever wrote this was like her. 

Isolated, lonely, looked down on. This author had shared her pain, these words were written for her, so that she could see that she was not alone.



Concerned, Coco leaned close to her sister, placing a hand on her back.

“Maya? Are you alright?”



“Y-yeah, I’m alright” she said, sitting up to face the priest.



“We are uncertain of the origins of this psalm. It is believed that it was written by David when he was fleeing from king Saul.”



He paused for a moment, scanning his audience.



“Imagine being driven from your home, hunted and persecuted. Its easy to understand where David’s pleas are coming from, the disparity of his situation. I think that all of us can relate to this disparity at some point in our lives. Like the world is out to get us.”



Maya could feel a connection. She had felt like that every day, and it still lingered. Even basic conversation, or a small event felt like entering a lion's den. 

The thought made her slump a bit in her seat. She waited for the follow up. 



“Today, we are fortunate to not be hunted down by unjust kings. Rather, our struggles are less obvious. We may even fight them alone, unnoticed.”



“Loneliness is, as I see it, one of the greatest evils we face. It’s treachery is not as obvious as other forms of evil, but that only adds to its danger. It is something we hide deep down, it is known to lead to depression, anxiety as well as innumerable health effects!”



The priest spoke eloquently, slowly yet confident. Maya sat forward, this was the first time someone other than her sisters had acknowledged her situation, the first time someone had so aptly described her situation.



“It can emerge from limitless factors. It can last only a second… or an entire lifetime.”

 The room stood still. They could tell there was something more, and they eagerly awaited his conclusion.

“But it can be overcome…”



Maya sat up, eager to hear what he had to say.



“I speak from experience when I say the road to victory is difficult. But with each small success the next step becomes easier.”



Maya let the words sink in. She thought of her sisters,

How difficult had it been to talk with them… how much easier it had become. A few months ago she would have never considered leaving the house for anything other than a lecture, where she would sit at the way back. 

A few months ago she had been so used to years of silent suffering that it was just daily life, even ignorable.



Now, she sat with her sisters. Two people, who weeks prior were less than strangers, were now beloved friends, people who cared for her. 

Not only that, but she was attending an event! Not waiting for it to end, but eager to see what happens next.

The realizations filled her with a resolve.

*I am not alone! I have never been less alone!* 

She felt renewed, she felt empowered, she wanted to talk to this priest, she wanted to go have hobbies, she wanted to go to clubs and events, she wanted friends and relationships.



As if to answer her request, Reverend Dekker continued:

“On the table we have a list of clubs and groups our church hosts, anyone is welcome. Trying new things, meeting new people, joining a group, club, or activity may be daunting at first, but they will enrich your life. These things will fill you with joy and purpose. Meaningful relationships will be your most precious possession.”

  


Maya felt encouraged by his words. She was eager to overcome the monsters that plagued her mind. For the first time, she felt real fervency in her desire. Not merely wanting, but a burning desire, unbound by anxiety or worry.



“And to those of you here today who struggle less with these daemons. I challenge you to do this: If you know someone, anyone, who struggles with this monster, be there for them. Let them know they are not alone. Even a little goes a long ways”



Mymy and Coco both nodded at this. The Reverends words emboldening them in their mission to help Maya. 



“I would like to end with another reading from psalm 31, verses 21 through 24.” 



Maya looked into Coco's bible, scanning for the verse. 

Coco was happy to share, and seeing Maya engaged filled her with joy. 



“Praise be to the Lord! 

for he showed me the wonders of his love when I was in a city under siege. 

In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight!” Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help… 

Love the Lord, all his faithful people! 

The Lord preserves those who are true to him, but the proud he pays back in full…

Be strong and take heart, 

all you who hope in the Lord.”



At this, he stopped and looked up to face the congregation, smiling as he did so.

“Thank you all for being here. Please, if you would like, stay and enjoy the refreshments.”

  


Everyone stood up from their seats. Some left, others stayed.

“So… what did you think?” asked Mymy

“It was really good.” said Maya

“I want to ask him a question”

Everyone looked surprised at this, but it quickly became enthusiasm.

“I would be happy to introduce you!” said Evi joyfully



Maya nodded and Evi led her to the priest who was standing by the coffee table.

For the first time in her entire life, Maya wasn't afraid of meeting someone new.



“Beautiful sermon, Reverend!” said Evi

“Oh Evi! I’m glad you enjoyed it!” he replied.

“Who’s this?” he said, noticing Maya standing just behind her.



“Reverend, this is Maya Schoppenboer.” she said, stepping aside.



The priest extended his hand. 

“Great to meet you Maya. You can call me Mr Dekker or , whichever ”



Maya shook his hand, her handshake was weak and awkward

*Something to work on* 

She thought to herself.



“Nice to meet you too.” she said

“I wanted to thank you for the Sermon. You mentioned earlier that you spoke from experience. What did you mean?”



The priest nodded, his expression more stern and attentive. 

“Well, I’m happy it connected with you. That's really the reason why I do these.”

“As for me. I didn't grow up in the best environment. My parents were hardly present in my life and I was ostracized due to our poor economic standing.”

He stopped for a moment and chuckled.

“I spent most of my younger years doing some pretty stupid stuff, just trying to find a place. I hung around a lot of people who I never really connected with, and who didn't care for me.”



“I won't fully delve into it, but at the end of the day. The lord sent me people who cared, people who loved me despite everything.”



The story resonated deeply with Maya.

*He was just like me…*



Dekker saw the look on Maya's face. He recognized that something in his story had stuck with her.

*You’ve lived like this for some time haven't you?*

He thought to himself.

 

“Well Maya,” he said, pulling out a small white card.

“I have to be going now, but you are always welcome here”



He handed Maya the information card.

“I’m also happy to talk about anything. Please feel free to reach out for any reason. We also host many clubs and events, you are welcome to all of them.” he said kindly.



At this Maya looked up from the card.

“Thank you Reverend” she said, shaking his hand before returning to her awaiting sisters.



“So Maya, are you still good to get lunch?” Asked Mymy

“That would be great,” she replied.

The group left the church, making their way to a nearby sandwich shop.

Maya sat in the back with Evi, Mymy drove with John riding in the passenger seat.

“I’m so happy that you were able to come, Maya!” said Evi happily

“I’m happy too.” Maya replied.



If she had found herself in this situation a few weeks ago, she would have sat quietly. Staring out the window, making an effort to be invisible. 

Not this time; Maya wanted to talk, she felt strengthened, she wanted to engage. 



“So… uh… Evi, how did you meet Mymy?”

She wasn't completely rid of her awkwardness and anxiety. But that didn't matter, not at this moment.



Mymy was surprised by this question. Internally, she was thrilled. Here was Maya, the same girl who once hid in her room at family gatherings was now making small talk with her friend.



“Mymy, you want to speak in on this one?” asked Evi

“I think you can tell it better than me.” Replied Mymy jokingly.



For the first time in Maya’s life. It seemed like a car ride was too short.

Evi shared her experience in the navy and how she met Mymy. Even Mymy popped in to relay her experience, and what led her to meet Evi.

Maya was shocked and intrigued by the story. She never thought that she would find herself relating to Mymy. But when she described the stress and loneliness of her first deployment, it resonated deeply.

  
  


As they stepped into the restaurant the group was led to a large booth table.



The conversation naturally fell on faith. As her sisters told her about their experiences with faith. Maya began to realize just how much of them she had missed. Mymy had changed so much since they were kids, Coco was a baptised catholic.

*I’ve been missing so much…* 

The thought made her sad, but only for a moment. She expected a wave of sadness and regret, something crushing, something that would bring her to tears. 

But nothing came.

Rather, the opposite happened, she was happy, she was excited by the prospect of getting to know these people who cared for her.



After lunch, Coco dropped Maya back at her apartment. 



Maya entered her small apartment. She was happy to be home but, there was something else too.

*Am I… disappointed?*

As she thought to herself, Maya realized that she was disappointed. She wanted to spend more time with her sisters, she wanted to get to know Mymy’s friends, she had hardly talked to Mathew.



Refusing to dwell on her disappointment, she focused her mind on other things. 

She spent the afternoon enjoying her shows and games. Though, they were no longer escapes for her, but simple fun activities. 

That night, she fell easily into sleep, worn from the previous night, and the day's activities.



Meanwhile, Mymy and Coco sat around the dinner table back at the Schoppenboer house. 



“This is a great moment! We need to capitalize! We must do another event, a club, something!” Mymy said, loud and passionate, an aspect that seemed integral to her character since they were kids. 



“You know…” started Mathew

“Most of us haven't gotten the chance to really talk with Maya. I for one would love to be one of her first friends, I think all of us would. Who knows, she may have a lot in common with us.”

His words were meet with nods of approval around the table.



“Alright then, how about a picnic.” suggested Coco, capturing the room's attention as chatter stopped and all heads turned to face her.

“It will be a fun get together, you can all formally meet Maya and we’ll have a generally nice time.”



The room nodded in agreement and the flow of conversation shifted.



“Isn't it funny?” asked Coco

“What?” asked Mymy confused.

“All of your navy friends spend their long leave with us. Helping us to reconcile and help our sister.” 



Mymy thought for a moment before laughing a bit

“Yea, I guess it is pretty funny. But I shouldn't be so surprised” 

Coco leaned in to better hear over the conversation, intrigued by what her sister meant.

“We’ve been through so much together. These people are family to me, they know that this is important to me, so its important to them. They're also getting to do the things they planned to do so they're not missing out on anything.”

She said heartfully. She paused to reminisce. 

“Besides, we’re feeding and housing them for free, they have no right to complain!” said Mymy jokingly. 

The two laughed together. Content with the day's activities, eager for the next day.

1jx6u7s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx6u7s,[Offered] Half of a 2br/2ba in quiet Hancock Park/Hollywood - $1450/mo [Re-list],"**tl;dr:** Unfurnished bedroom is 11x13.5 with a big closet. Your own bathroom (the nicer of the two). There is a parking spot included in a gated garage, new washer/dryer in the garage (there are only 8 units in this building, so I almost never find the laundry occupied), $75 a month utilities.

Re-listing this: Hello! I'm looking for a housemate for my two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in Hancock Park/Hollywood to move as soon as you feel like (I can pro-rate rent if you want to move in the middle of a month). It's just north of Melrose Ave., roughly between Highland Ave. and Cahuenga Blvd. The rent is $1450 (half of $2900), and the utilities (electric, internet, gas) tend to be another $75 each (give or take, the electric varies depending on the central air conditioning usage and if you would prefer not to pay for housecleaning we can probably work something out).

**The apartment:** It's a ground-floor unit in the back of the building, so it's very quiet and private. The apartment is medium-sized, the available bedroom is 11x13.5 (not including a two-and-a-half-foot-deep closet running along most of the 11-foot wall). It is unfurnished, but pictured above temporarily housing a big soft chair (which you are welcome to keep in the room if you like, same with the bookcase). It has high-quality central air, hot and cold. The bedroom has a lovely accent wall that my former housemate put in. The rest of the apartment is furnished with all the usual stuff (dining table and chairs, couches, coffee table, and a TV cabinet). You're welcome to bring whatever kitchen stuff you like, there will be space, and I'm not too attached to most of the common-area furniture if you have stuff of your own you'd need me to make room for. The bathroom next to the bedroom is yours, it's got a full tub and shower and a vanity, and a high frosted window with a windowsill (in case you'd like to put some plants up there). The kitchen has a big fridge, gas stove, microwave, and dishwasher, all in top shape.

**The building:** The building is mostly long-time tenants (my next-door neighbor has been here about 15 years, and my upstairs neighbor about 8). I myself have been here six years. The neighbors are great. The apartment has two parking spots, one of which is yours. Parking is under the building. The laundry room is off of the garage, the washer and dryer are well-maintained and run on a mobile app.

**The neighborhood:** This is technically Hollywood, but it's so quiet, you'd never know it. If you hear “Hollywood” and picture drunken tourists and roaring engines, you are in for a very pleasant surprise. A block south, on the other side of Melrose, is Hancock Park proper, which is a nice place to jog or go for a stroll if that's your bag. There's a coffee shop on the corner (""File Systems of Coffee,"" if you can believe it), the Pavillions supermarket at Vine and Melrose is a five-minute walk away, and Sprouts on La Brea is about a 15-minute walk. If you're a commuter, the #10 bus runs down Melrose a three minute walk from our front door, and the #4 bus runs along Santa Monica Boulevard about a 10-minute walk north. If you like restaurants, they can be found in just about every direction. Larchmont Village is a 5-minute drive away, so is West Hollywood. Cahuenga Blvd. will take you right up to the valley, and Melrose to the 101 will take you downtown.  
  
**Me:** I'm a government lawyer who works in-person in Civic Center three or so days a week, and remote the rest of the time. When I work at the office, I typically wake up at 7:30, feed the cats, have a quiet breakfast, and am out the door by a quarter past 8. I get home around 7 and am in bed by 11:30. I work remotely from the corner of the living room a couple days a week, from 9 AM to 6 PM. I have gatherings at the house every once in a while, though with covid and people moving it's been a while. I tend to go out rather than have people over. But it’s cool if your hours and social life are different! I’m adaptable.

**The cats:** My two elder cats live here too. They are a bit shy around new people, but they are very gentle, quiet, non-destructive, meditative guys. They spend most of their time curled up on some furniture. They don't shed too much, but if you're allergic you may run into a problem.

She met him where dreams brew in porcelain cups, a coffee shop hum, the world softly stirring.
His words spilled out like an overturned glass— 
disjointed, tumbling, uncertain yet pure.
He rambled, nervous laughter chasing syllables, his insecurities shining like cracks in old pottery.
She didn’t feel butterflies.
No, it was deeper—
a quiet sense of forever, as if her heart remembered him before she knew his name.

With each date, he gave her space to be—
no pressure, no pretenses,
just a man who asked for her thoughts
and still carried the weight of his own.
He brought her flowers, soft gestures
that let her breathe into her femininity,
though shadows lingered in his eyes.
He too knew betrayal,
the hollow ache of being unloved.

She watched him,
memorized the quirks of his soul—
the way he pursed his upper lip
when a thought caught him mid-air,
the random facts he shared like gifts
wrapped in the oddest ribbons.
Her heart fluttered,
her soul found peace in the gentle rhythm of him.

He spoke of children,
a future he painted in tentative strokes,
but her body had betrayed her long ago.
She couldn’t give him that dream,
and she saw it chip away at his light.
He retreated into the silence
where hurt hides,
while she fell deeper into love’s chasm,
aching to give him everything
her hands and heart could carry.

She yearned to erase his pain,
to fill the voids carved by a cruel past,
but his walls grew higher,
and her love swelled to bursting.
Frightened by the breaking,
she broke it first—
a self-inflicted wound
that shattered them both.

Now, she sits with the ghost of what could have been, tracing their story in the steam of her coffee.
Always yearning, always wondering,
if forever had been waiting, 
just beyond her fear.",2,1744423300.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

1jx6jsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/food_budgeting/comments/1jx6jsy/2025_healthy_food_budget/,2025 healthy food budget,"My food budget has been a mess lately. For a few weeks, I didn’t have a car, so I relied on DoorDash for nearly every meal. I honestly don’t even want to check how much I spent—it’s probably more than I care to admit. Even before the car issues, I was already struggling with depression, and meal prepping felt overwhelming. I’d buy healthy groceries, often on the expensive side, but a lot of it went to waste because I didn’t cook consistently. I estimate I was spending around $250–$300 every two weeks on groceries alone, not including the additional cost of takeout.

Now, I’m trying to be more intentional—keeping things healthier while working within a tighter budget. I managed to spend about $170 for two weeks’ worth of food, and some of what I bought should last even longer than that.

Here’s what I picked up:

- **Proteins:** whole chicken, ground beef, salmon, canned tuna, ham lunch meat, eggs  
- **Grains:** whole grain bread, tortillas, high-protein granola, instant rice  
- **Dairy:** cheese, high-protein yogurt  
- **Fruits & Veggies:** frozen fruit, frozen vegetables, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes  
- **Other essentials:** condiments, coffee, canned chili (as a backup meal)

I’m currently working on losing weight. I naturally don’t eat a lot of bread or cheese, and I’ve been loosely following a high-protein diet. While I’m used to prioritizing protein, I’m starting to realize it might not be fully sustainable long term. I usually skip breakfast or just have coffee—maybe two eggs if I’m really hungry.

I’d love some advice or tips for staying on track with a budget-friendly and health-conscious meal plan. So far, I’m thinking of making sandwiches, salads, protein + veggie bowls with potatoes or rice, tacos, and yogurt parfaits for snacks or breakfast.

Statis Man: Still Here, Still Disappointed

**Part 1: The Moment Before Everything Happens**

Statis Man didn’t come to save the day. No, he didn’t bother with that whole hero thing. That was for people who thought they could change the world in one swoop. He just made sure the day didn’t come too fast. Sometimes, he was the only thing standing between the world and its own impatience.

The city was loud. Always rushing. Always pushing. There was too much happening. The heroes rushed in to stop things before they fully broke. Statis Man waited. He waited while things burned. He waited while the world screamed. He waited until you were so tired of waiting that you made a decision, any decision, just to break the stillness. That’s when he moved. Not fast. Not far. Just enough to tilt the inevitable course of disaster off its axis.

They said his real name was Colin Marris. A mall cop. A library assistant. A man with a collection of paper cuts and caffeine stains. A man who was completely invisible—until one day, time stuttered. Not for the world—no, not for the whole chaotic mess of life—but for him.

He remembers it like a glitch. A moment frozen in time: a kid running into traffic, a truck barreling down, a spilled cup of coffee. Time thickened, stretched, and sagged at the edges. In that frozen instant, something stared back at him.

He never told anyone what it was.

What mattered was that, after that, he could control the moment before things happened. Not the moment of glory, not the act of violence, not the sweeping moment where everything turns to chaos. No, he controlled the part just before. The part where everything still feels okay, but you know it’s coming.

He could stretch that pause for hours. And at first, people thought that was useful. They didn’t get it, but they liked the results.

He stopped bombs, froze bullets mid-air, saved kids from falling debris. But the longer he did it, the more things felt… strange.

He paused a court case right before the guilty verdict. He froze a protest just before it turned violent. He walked into hospitals and froze heart monitors from flatlining—until the family, sick of waiting, pulled the plug out of annoyance, not grief.

When questioned, he’d say, “I’m not stopping death. I’m giving you time to figure out what you’re really doing.”

Statis Man never gave comfort. He didn’t give answers. He didn’t even stick around long enough to be questioned. The only thing that stayed was the stillness. People hated that. People hated that he could stop them from moving forward.

The government once tried to detain him. It didn’t work. Not because he fought back. No, every soldier within a fifty-foot radius just... stopped.

Mid-thought.

Mid-blink.

Mid-sentence.

It lasted six days. By the time they figured out how to “contain” him, the news had moved on.

Some people called him a ""control freak."" Some called him a prophet, others called him a bored man with too much time on his hands.

The truth? Wherever Statis Man went, nothing happened. Not until you were so tired of waiting that you wondered what *would* have happened.

**Part 2: The City Moves Fast—Except for Me**

The city was changing. New heroes were everywhere. Flashy powers. TikTok followers. Branded social justice warriors with capes and corporate sponsorships. They were fast. They were *all about action*. And they hated Statis Man for it.

They called him lazy. Said he didn’t get the job done. That he was nothing more than a human pause button.

“Why don’t you *do* something for once?” Tempus Rush asked, zooming past him with her oversized logo on her cape. “You just sit there and freeze time, you *coward*.”

“Do you ever think about how annoying you are when you talk?” Statis Man muttered, not even looking up from his coffee. “Or is that just your superpower? Not thinking?”

But it wasn’t just Tempus Rush. It was everyone. Everyone with a flashy suit, everyone with an ego that couldn’t wait to fly in and make everything ‘right.’ Statis Man had one rule: Wait. And in that waiting, sometimes people realized they didn’t need saving at all. They just needed to be left alone long enough to figure it out themselves.

But then, Dr. Cascade decided to shake things up.

Dr. Cascade, a so-called villain with an obsession with *chaos*, wanted to release a wave of energy that would age everyone in the city by five years.

Statis Man paused it.

He didn’t reverse it. He didn’t stop it. He just... *paused* it.

It lingered for weeks. The city debated. Should they destroy it? Let it happen? Try to figure it out?

Eventually, they decided to let it go. Most people didn’t age noticeably. Some looked... well, better. Some finally started therapy.

But Statis Man? He just kept sipping his coffee.

**Part 3: The Old and the New**

And yet, life went on. Heroes continued to rush in. Villains continued to plan their chaotic schemes. People lived, they loved, and they *aged*. And Statis Man saw it all in his own way.

He’d walk the streets, watching the old folks shuffle along, moving with a sort of deliberate slowness that only comes from years of wisdom. Or maybe just a bad hip.

But there was something about older people that always made him pause.

Once, he had frozen a moment when an elderly woman named Marge stepped off a bus and into traffic. She hesitated. For the first time in a long while, she hesitated. The choice wasn’t just about the bus. It was about her life. About whether she wanted to keep going or if it was time to let go.

Statis Man gave her the time to decide.

“You don’t need me to save you, Marge,” he said as she slowly turned back to sit on the bench. “You’ve lived long enough to make your own decisions.”

Statis Man’s power was never about saving people. It was about giving them space to *decide*.

But it wasn’t always so profound. Sometimes, he froze moments just to see what happened.

One such time, a neo-Nazi named Chuck kept showing up in his periphery. Chuck wasn’t a villain, not really. He was just a pathetic, bigoted idiot who thought he could take over the world with his ""superior"" white-trash wisdom.

Statis Man would freeze him mid-rant at the most inconvenient times.

“Do you know what the world’s coming to?” Chuck would bellow, and just as he finished his sentence, Statis Man would freeze him.

Chuck didn’t know that every time he opened his mouth, he was just giving Statis Man another reason to humiliate him.

“You’re still talking?” Statis Man would say, sipping his coffee, looking at his watch. “You were *still talking* when I froze you. What’s that say about your charisma?”

Chuck would be stuck in mid-sentence, rage bubbling in his frozen face.

The internet thought Statis Man was trolling him, and honestly, that wasn’t far from the truth.

**Part 4: Time Is a Flat Circle... and So Is My Love Life**

By now, the new heroes were getting cocky. Tempus Rush was going on talk shows, pushing her “You’ve Got Time” initiative. It was all over the media. And still, Statis Man watched. Watched as they rushed into situations that would have been better if they’d just waited.

And then came the biggest joke of all: The Speedster’s Grandma.

See, it all started when Statis Man was sipping his tea (it was *always* lukewarm), and in walked a speedster named Max Velocity, a hero with the kind of speed that made everything around him look like slow motion.

Max’s grandmother, a sweet old woman named Ethel, came to visit her grandson at the superhero headquarters. She was frail, a little confused, but mostly harmless.

And yet, when Statis Man froze the world for just a second, Ethel... *winked* at him. Not in a “friendly” way. No, it was the kind of wink that suggested that *maybe* she knew exactly what was going on.

Fast forward a few weeks.

Statis Man, now sitting on his usual rooftop, sipping from the same cracked mug, received a *very* unexpected message. Max Velocity’s powers weren’t from some random accident.

They were... inherited. From Ethel. His *grandmother*.

As it turned out, Statis Man had, at some point in the past, gotten *Ethel pregnant*.

And somehow, *that* explained Max’s ridiculous speed.

The city had questions.

Statis Man? He just shook his head, turned his attention to Chuck, who was still frozen mid-rant, and whispered, ""Man, you've got *no* idea how ridiculous things are about to get.""

Then, after that, I would go 2 days without vomiting, then 4 days, then a week, a month...you get the gist. However, my eating conditions were not ideal. I couldn't eat as much as before, which annoyed me since I wanted to go bulking again. That much is still the same. I can eat a lot but I'll feel bloated for a while(3 hours).

2 Badtz/keroppi

Badtz  and Keroppi are online trolls. IDK why. They just give that vibe. Badtz is ruthless while Keroppi just thinks it’s fun and games. Also Badtz sells rare commics online for way over the top prices, think Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons 

3 Chococat

Chococat makes educational but really funny science videos and puts them on YouTube, he’s actually quite successful 

4. Tuxedosam&TOPHAT
These 2 love Lady Gaga, Madonna and Cindy Lawper and they love Wicked and Hamilton the musical. They don’t meet for coffee, they do brunch in style

5 Kiki&Lala

Kiki loves music. Like he’s always listening to the daily hits on Spotify. He’s definitely into Billie Eilish and Sabrina, he never tells Lala because she’s not into that and she’d totally disapprove. She prefers easy listening and classical music.   Kiki seems silly and immature, but he’d totally give good life advice at 1 AM at a party after a few drinks. Lala just likes cooking, drawing and curating the perfect girly fairycore pinterest board,   She’s definitely loyal, but in a practical sort of way.

I filled it out and decided to write about the problems. I'm not sure who will see this, but I'm really hoping that future events are improved. I don't know why the re-entry wasn't an issue last year in Montreal but was so bad this year. Hopefully, someone will care to analyze this issue.

""Being forced to leave the building after the afternoon competition and re-enter for the evening competition was not great. The very worst was the time between the free dance and the men's free skate, which was a complete mess. 

You absolutely could not stay for the Dance medal awarding ceremony if you didn't want to miss any of the men's free skate competition. And re-entering the building that day (Saturday) was kind of scary because there was some kind of medal ceremony happening outside, at the foot of the big giant escalator on Causeway at the same time that people were trying to get back into the building for the Men's skating. More than one crowd was coming together from different directions, which caused a very dangerous situation. I'm surprised that no one got crushed or fell down the stairs or escalator in that surging crowd. I felt very frightened and disoriented. 

The organizers obviously did not factor in the logistics of moving such a large crowd out and then back in through security. And there really wasn't much signage or directions to be had to explain what the expectations and procedures were. 

Also, the price for food in The Garden was stunningly excessive. $16 for a slice of pizza?? After paying approximately $3,000 for a premium seat and the ability to attend practices, spending a full 12 hours in (or waiting in line to get back into) the building, and not being able to bring in any of my own food (other than coffee and snacks to the morning practice session) felt kind of insulting. I understand that the venue wants to make money, but for skating fans who are putting in those full days like that, bringing in your own food is a must.

Next week, I'll be on a work trip without the wife and kids. I'll be feeding myself exclusively for 7-10 days. I chose to take my RV instead of getting a hotel. So I'll have a fridge, stove, griddle, etc. Right now I have buttered coffee for breakfast and then one big meal in the evening. I'm thinking of kicking the coffee, and making only strict Carnivore dinners. 

Questions:

Those of you that kicked coffee, what did you replace it with? I'm considering a hot cup of beef broth with butter instead. 

For dinner, should I just do steak and eggs? I have a 1/2 cow in the freezer, so I can bring plenty of meat. What I'm hoping to do is spend the whole week earing true Carnivore, no caffeine and no alcohol, and see how it goes.

Vent,"Ive been posting in here so much but I feel like it's the only safe space to talk about my experience. On the March 14th I had surgery for a brain tumor diagnosed on October 3rd. Back when I was diagnosed all my friends and family were all over me, went to all my appointments with me, they were up to date with every little detail of the process. 
As time went on all the people around me went back to their lives (which is no surprise, they couldn't stop their lives for me) but I kept on going with this, I still have a brain tumor (they couldn't remove it all) 
This week the pathology came back and it's an astrocytoma pilocytic grade 1 (basically benign) and I was so relieved and ready to celebrate with everyone that was with me during this process but when I told the people around me no one cared, no one even said I'm glad, I feel like they were relieved that they no longer had the moral obligation of being at least a little bit supportive, like you can't let your cancer friend fall off the edge of the earth but you can definitely let your benign brain tumor friend fall off the edge of the earth.
Recovery has been really hard, this is the second semester I had to take off college and I feel so isolated cause I still don't have the all clear to go back to college or even take public transportation to go see any of my friends, so I just stay home or walk around the block and that's basically it. I feel disconnected from everyone that I was close with and like I can't relate to anything they tell me, and I can't be mad that they moved on cause they needed to move on cause they have so much on their plate they can't add my tumor but I envy them so much, they get to move on but I get to have a brain tumor for the rest of my life. 
I feel like I can't talk to them about it cause they are stressed out and burned out and dealing with a lot, they asked me to stop talking about the tumor cause they didn't have the brain power to deal with that too and I don't want them to deal with anything I just want them to listen to my life as I listen to theirs and rn my life is around my brain tumor cause I just had a craniotomy. My best friend didn't even say anything when she found out it was benign I don't know how to feel about any of this. I feel myself grow more and more isolated and resentful for the life they are living and I don't get to live and I don't know how to get out of that headspace, makes me wanna pack up, leave and start a new life somewhere new where non of this happened.
It hurts the most cause of how deeply I care about this people, and I don't know how to feel about not being able to talk to them about this feeling I just want my life back, I wanna go back to college, I want to go to concerts, I wanna see my friends, I wanna go on coffee dates I want to feel like me again and get out of my house everyday like I used to, but I don't know if I will ever have my life back.

i’ve always had yellow teeth, and i don’t drink coffee or like smoke. 

i’m a ginger and have really (and i mean really) pale skin. dentists before have said that it might be a lack of enamel. yk like lack of melanin and lack of enamel. it kinda makes sense right?

i use the like crest brand and its a kid flavor but it has the same materials as an adult toothpaste. it’s not whitening or anything. and i use a normal toothbrush not electric. also im pretty good about brushing most mornings and nights

anyways like is there anything i can do about it?? like should i be using a different brand of toothpaste or should i try like whitening strips and treatments? some of the dentists i’ve gone to have said they might not help tho. 

idk guys like i said im 14 and tbh im really insecure about my teeth and they ruin my face.

I miss the way you could read my emotions without me saying anything. Intuitively knowing if something was bothering me or not. Even if I wasn’t in your proximity. Getting a “hey love, just checking in! Is everything okay?” text, like you could feel my emotions. Almost as if we had a soul-tie. 

I miss your bright, beautiful eyes, and the way you would look at me. 

I miss your empathy and compassion. Your patience and understanding. Being there for me when I couldn’t even be there for myself. 

I miss when you would surprise me at work with a coffee. The coffee wasn’t even important. Just seeing you was enough to keep me going throughout the day. 

I miss waking up in the middle of the night and seeing you. You just looked so at-peace.

We arrived in the fall. When people in the neighborhood learn that we're American and we're staying, they are always polite and warm, but also seem weary. I get it. I get it, even though I didn't do the very bad thing, and I am learning Spanish- at first because I considered it an obligation, and, now, because I enjoy doing it. I follow your politics, your president and drove across your amazing country and tell people all the time how wonderful it was... Nevertheless, I suspect Puerto Vallartans might understand how annoying and problematic Americans are in a way that we still can't comprehend, having never known anything different. 

Nevertheless, I was just thinking that while I understand that Mexico has issues, Puerto Vallarta is absolutely amazing. It is the dream of my life to live here. I am not a particularly positive person and I can find very little to complain about. (Probably an important note: I don't live in Centro or Zona, but a different Colona.) Here's a list of everything that's amazing here: the food, the people, the beaches, the coast line, the restaurants, the coffee shops, the health care, the dental care, the bus system, the weather, the whales, etc., etc.)

1jx657j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1jx657j/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Can’t anymore?,"I 31F feel like I must be in a biased cloud right now  but I have tried so hard. Feels like an identity crisis. I was always the “not all men” and “patriarchy hurts men too,” camp. In the past few months my best friends little niece killed herself violently and her mom went psycho so she’s lost both people. In the aftermath her “good guy” boyfriend became an emotionally and sexually abusive sex pest screaming at her constantly over sexual frustration and grabbing at her body while doing nothing to help out at home even knowing she is grieving and grew up molested.

My man was a “good guy” til the mask slipped too. He was perfect. We were perfect.Then I found the insane drug abuse, constant drunk driving, cheating, lying, threatening to make me watch him blow his head off so much I lost count.  

In finally opening up to my other friend whose husband was my hope for men everywhere I learned she’s ready to divorce him over things she won’t tell anyone to protect his reputation. Then I found out our other friend bf we hated in college has been abusive the whole time and she was too embarrassed so she’s just been lying about it for ten years til it blew up recently. 
Our other friends long term bf just up and moved out of their home, no conversation. Blocked everywhere. We’ve all been too embarrassed to talk to anyone. 

My dad is an abusive rageful alcoholic and quit his job so my mom’s funding everything.  She’s always been the breadwinner and done most of everything that life demands but now it’s just her.

I moved my little brother in with me due to family violence a few years ago and he refuses to do ANYTHING around the house without being asked and a pat on the back. I do all cleaning, chores, errands, bills, shopping, repairs, dealing with landlord. Quits jobs and leaves me on the hook for rent. Sleeps all day and games/smokes weed all night. Bails on every plan we make.

My guy friend at work became management and asked me for coffee to talk about all the ways he was going to change the way women in leadership at work (me and quite a few others) were being treated and dismissed. He ended up doing the exact opposite. 

Honestly scared to hang out with another guy friend who’s married with kids, and is a saint because I don’t want him to do something and taint my view of him. These male friends are more “woke” than I am and talk about women’s rights all the time but when push came to shove 🤷🏻‍♀️

All this while me and the women I know seem to be literally carrying the lives of these men. I know it’s useless, enabling behavior but we made you that desperately needed doctors appointment! We researched rehabs and addictions counseling! We applied to jobs for you! We give you periodic reminders leading up to important dates that you can’t be bothered to keep track of! We clean up after and plan ahead for you! We pay for everything while you don’t look for work! 

It’s like setting up a tee ball and all they have to do is step up to the plate. It’s not a fast ball, no thinking or focus needed. I set everything up for you! All you need to do is show up! It’s tee ball. And they all choose to sit under the bleachers getting high instead. 

I know at this point I’m not thinking rationally about it. I’m way past the point of giving the benefit of the doubt and acting moderately about it and that internal shift HURTS.

I’m heartbroken because I just wanted them to do better so badly for so so long and did everything in my power to help. We all did.
Now I have to cut the men i love deeply out of my life before we drown. I know addiction and depression are huge factors for my ex and my male family members. But why are none of them willing to get help or do anything about it? Because they’re being enabled and know we’ll pick up the slack? I do therapy once a week and try to better myself in the daily things and it’s a chore but how come the women I know and I are willing to put in work but the men around us refuse? 

So ladies, is it just me or are men in this flash in history in the western world becoming functionally impotent, deviant, degenerate leeches or is it just my perception right now? I love them so much and it hurts to feel so much resentment after being played out over and over again.

But in your late 30s, newly separated, kids—does it still mean the same thing?

I met this man at our shared coworking space (not working for the same company). It started with that heavy eye contact, then syncing up on breaks, hallway hellos, and finally real convos where we both shared we were separated and other fun light hearted topics that honestly, it’d make a great hang over a cup of coffee. Since then, our brief weekly chats got flirty— he skillfully managed to add some touch which I reciprocated, good banter, laughs and curious energy.

Then after a couple of weeks, he told me (super politely and sweet) he “needs to wait a little longer.” Which caught me off guard. Damn who said I was hoping for a relationship? A happy-hour couple of nights a week sounds fantastic. My answer was playfully and agreed - and to be clear, I totally get it. I also see myself saying that I’m not ready for a new commitment after years of marriage, but I wouldn’t turn down a good ol time, especially when matching chemistry. 

We still run into each other, still ask about each other’s week/weekend plans. The tension is still there, just dialed down and more controlled.

So what’s the blockage? Interest is clear, we’re grown, not naive, successful ‘talking stage’, both good looking, banter is easy. Polite pass or something else in this age/life stage?",2,1744420764.0,AskMenAdvice,12,1.0,False
1jx5sqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1jx5sqv/you_dont_have_to_be_controlled_by_the_simulation/,You don’t have to be controlled by the simulation anymore,"Look around you - we are living in a simulation. Perhaps not a technological one, but nevertheless divorced from reality.

Your life is a filtered hallucination of normalcy. A numb parade of fake smiles, antidepressant comas, $6 coffees, flickering screens, climate-controlled panic attacks, dopamine drip-feeds, and cheap validation disguised as connection. You were born into a system that doesn’t give a fuck about your soul - it only wants your attention, your obedience, and your slow, comfortable decay.

The despair you feel?  This isn’t “depression.” This is the sane response to a society that sold you a coffin and called it a lifestyle.

And most people - your friends, your coworkers, your parents - are too sedated to even notice. They’ll tell you “everything’s fine” with trembling hands and dead eyes, because to admit something’s wrong would mean they’d have to *change something*. And that’s too much work, too much discomfort, too much *real*.

So they keep scrolling. Keep sipping. Keep sleeping.

You were raised in a lie so complete, it felt like air.

You were told to be “happy.” But not *alive*. Not *awake*. Happiness meant safety. Stability. Passivity. Sit still. Shut up. Don’t think too hard. Fit in. Get likes. Pick a job. Don’t chase wonder. Don’t risk pain. Don't burn.

And now here you are, wondering why you feel hollow.

They’ll say it’s just capitalism.  They’ll say it’s patriarchy, or trauma, or maybe your serotonin is just *a little off*.

But no, it runs deeper than this. 

This isn’t just social. This isn’t just psychological.

This is *spiritual collapse*.

This is the fallout of a culture that murdered God and replaced him with Amazon Prime. This is the result of treating the human spirit like an inconvenience.

This is what happens when a society believes in *nothing*, and then tells you to be *grateful* for it.

So let me say it straight, no pretense:

**You are not okay.** But more importantly—**you are not supposed to be.**

Feeling like life is unbearable? Good. That means you're still alive somewhere under the armor. That means you haven’t fully merged with the simulation yet. You’re still capable of revolt.

You’re still capable of becoming *dangerous*.

Because this isn't about healing. Not yet. This is about *getting angry enough to see the truth*. This is about understanding that everything you thought was “normal” is actually an insult to your potential.

You were not born to sit in traffic, jack off to pixels, and build resumes. You were born to *tear the veil off this nightmare and walk through it laughing*.

You don’t need therapy. You don’t need a new productivity app. You don’t need to “learn to be content”

No - you need to stop running.

You need to face this wretched, beautiful, chaotic world head on, and burn so brightly that every shadow in your mind starts screaming.

The world is a lie. But you are not. And the fact that you're still here, reading this, means your soul hasn't given up yet.

1jx5pw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1jx5pw2/stasis_man/,Stasis Man,"**Statis Man**—an enigmatic anti-hero. He's not the golden boy. He's not evil either. He's just... stubbornly still, and not always for the reasons you'd hope.

# ""Statis Man"" V1

*He doesn’t save the day. He just makes sure it doesn’t come too fast.*

Most heroes rush in.  
**Statis Man waits.**

He waits while you cry.  
He waits while the building burns.  
He waits until you're so sick of waiting, you make a *choice*—any choice—just to break the stillness.

That’s when he moves. Not fast. Not far. Just enough to tilt things off the course they were barreling toward.

They say his real name was Colin Marris.  
A mall cop. A library assistant. A man no one looked twice at.

Until the day time stuttered. Not for the world—for *him*.

He says he remembers that moment like a photograph: a kid running into traffic, a truck about to hit, a spilled cup of coffee. The air thick like gelatin. Time sagging around the edges. And in that perfect stillness, **something looked back at him**.

He never said what it was.

Only that when time resumed, he could control the moment *before* things happen.

Not the moment of glory. Not the act of violence. Just the part **right before**—when everything’s still technically okay, but you *feel* it coming.

He could stretch that pause for hours.

And he did.

At first, people were grateful.  
He stopped bombs. Froze bullets mid-air. Let kids slip out of fires before the ceiling caved in.

But it got… weird.

He stopped a trial right before the guilty verdict.  
He paused a protest just before it went violent.  
He walked into hospitals and stopped heart monitors from flatlining—for days—until the family pulled the plug out of *frustration*, not grief.

When questioned, he’d say, *""I’m not stopping death. I’m giving you time to figure out what you’re really doing.""*

He never offered comfort. Never explained his motives. Never left faster than he arrived.

People started calling him a **""preventionist.""**  
Critics called him a **""coward in slow motion.""**  
The government tried to detain him once. It didn’t work. Not because he fought back—but because every soldier within a fifty-foot radius just… stopped.

Mid-breath.  
Mid-blink.  
Mid-thought.

It lasted six days. The news cycle moved on.

Some say he’s a control freak.  
Some say he’s a prophet who sees outcomes before they unfold.  
Some say he’s bored.

All anyone really knows is this:

Wherever **Statis Man** goes, *nothing* happens—for just long enough to question what would’ve.

There was this girl once—named **Penny Varis**. She was going to jump from the 30th floor of the Halstead Building. She said later that she saw a man sitting on the ledge just below hers. Reading a paperback novel. Drinking what looked like terrible vending machine coffee.

He didn’t speak.

He just flipped the page, took a sip, and said, *“We’ve got time.”*

She sat down.  
Watched the sun set.

By the time the cops got there, she wasn’t suicidal anymore—just **angry**. Angry that the world never gave her that pause before. Angry that she needed a stranger’s *nothingness* to finally feel present.

She went on to become a lawyer. Public defender. Never saw him again.

Some nights, villains light up the sky with flaming declarations of war.  
The superheroes leap into action.  
The sidekicks scramble for the jet.  
The media goes live.

And out in some corner of the city, a man in a faded jacket sits cross-legged on a rooftop, sipping tea from a cracked mug, watching the storm build.

He knows he can’t stop everything.  
But he can slow it down just long enough for someone else to make a better choice.  
Or a worse one. That’s their business.

**Statis Man** isn’t here to save you.

He’s here to see if *you’ll save yourself*—when given the space to try.

Whether you like him or not?

Well… you’ve got time to think about it.

/----

Part 2

Here comes:

# ""Statis Man: Still Here, Still Disappointed""

Time didn’t stop.  
But it sure as hell sighed.

Colin Marris, better known to bored newscasters and reluctantly grateful first responders as **Statis Man**, was still doing what he did best: absolutely *nothing*.

Well, not nothing. He paused things.  
Specifically, he paused things *before* they happened.

And he did it with the energy of a man who once tried to start a podcast about soup recipes and unresolved grudges, and never got past the pilot.

He’d been a hero, once.

**Maybe.**

People *wanted* to believe that.

After all, he saved the city from a collapsing superstructure once. Held it in the air for five whole days while the mayor debated with zoning officials over whether it technically qualified as “existing” anymore.

Then there was that time he paused a volcanic eruption until someone found a way to relocate the endangered moss living in the blast zone.

Touching, sure.

But he also paused a dog mid-pee on his loafers and just walked away.

For two weeks.

# Public Opinion:

**Mixed at best.**

“Is he a hero?”  
“Is he a menace?”  
“Is he flirting with my grandmother?”

The answers were:

* *Sort of*
* *If he’s in the mood*
* *Yes, and she flirted back*

**The New Era**

Lately, Statis Man had developed a *reputation*.

He didn’t just pause time for noble, selfless reasons anymore. He did it to avoid small talk. To skip lines. To stop you mid-rant about your astrology chart and whisper, *""You’re a Scorpio, not an oracle, Denise.""*

He’d even begun **flirting with birds**.

Not in a *weird* way, more in a *“you’re the only creature here I respect”* kind of way. He once paused a flock of pigeons just to wink at one and say, *“You’ve got perfect feather symmetry, Gary. Call me.”*

Gary never did.  
Gary had *boundaries*.

# Meanwhile, the City Was Changing

New heroes emerged.

Flashier ones. Branded ones. Ones with Twitter bios that said things like *""Protector. Influencer. Astrologer. #Blessed #JusticedUp.""*

They didn’t like Statis Man.

He didn’t attend charity galas.  
He paused interviews.  
Once, he froze a whole awards ceremony just to steal the complimentary cheese plate and whisper to the organizer, *“You’re not a visionary, Kevin. You’re lactose-dependent and insecure.”*

He was, in short, **a pain in the time-space continuum**.

# Then Came the Incident.

A villain named Dr. Cascade tried to release a chaos wave across the city—an energy field that would age everyone five years instantly.

Statis Man *paused* the wave mid-pulse.  
Then stared at it.  
For a long time.

When the other heroes finally arrived, they expected him to snap his fingers and reverse it or something.

Instead, he took a sip of lukewarm coffee, said *“Five years older? Honestly, some of you might finally get interesting,”* and walked away.

He *left* it paused.

The city debated for weeks.  
Do we disable it? Try to destroy it?  
Or… should we just let it go?

Eventually, they decided to *grow up a little*.

The moment passed. The wave hit.

And most people didn’t age noticeably.  
Some aged *beautifully*.  
Some… finally started therapy.

# Quiet Heroism (But Not Too Quiet)

A reporter once asked Statis Man if he still considered himself a good guy.

He paused her microphone for thirty full seconds before answering.

>

And then he paused a falling sandwich mid-air to catch it.  
Only to let it fall again. Face down. On purpose.

Now, he mostly lurks.

On rooftops. At bus stops. In your least-favorite coffee shop, judging your order and mentally subtracting points for oat milk and emotional neediness.

Sometimes he intervenes.  
Sometimes he watches.  
Sometimes he pauses the whole world just to enjoy a conversation with a 92-year-old woman who once pickpocketed Winston Churchill and taught him how to curse in six languages.

He says she’s the only person who’s *earned* his time.

**Statis Man:**

Still still.  
Still sarcastic.  
Still casually playing god like a guy who got roped into running the bake sale and just never gave up the chair.

Not your favorite hero.  
Not the worst one either.

But when the world is spinning too fast,  
and the chaos is creeping up your throat,  
and everything’s about to break—

You pray for one thing:

**A pause.**

And that’s when he shows up.

With a sigh.  
A smirk.  
And a half-eaten biscotti.

>

/---

Part 3

**""Statis Man: Love, Hate, and Hyperspeed""**

It started, like most things do with speedsters, in a blur of bad decisions and overconfidence.

They called themselves **The Tachyon Titans**.  
Five shiny, hyper-accelerated twenty-somethings with names like **Flashbomb**, **Blur Bae**, **Quantum Queen**, **Zoomer**, and... **Chad**.

Just **Chad**.

They wore neon. They live-streamed every battle. Their catchphrase was *“Fast. Furious. Fabulous.”*

And they **hated Statis Man**.

>

# The Conflict

The Titans had one weakness: **they couldn’t stop**.

Not metaphorically—literally. Their powers were tied to constant motion. If they ever stood still for too long, they’d get quantum migraines and start muttering in French.

So when Statis Man came along and *froze an entire freeway* mid-battle just to watch a bird fight a squirrel, they lost it.

*“You paused an entire city block!”*  
“Yeah. There was traffic anyway. And Gary was winning.”  
*“WHO IS GARY?!”*  
“My emotional support pigeon. Show some damn respect.”

# Enter Gary

Gary, former rooftop pigeon turned avian enigma, had become **Statis Man’s familiar**.

He wore a tiny leather vest.  
He could poop with tactical precision.  
And he once distracted a nuclear warhead by fluttering aggressively in front of its sensor.

Gary had also, according to legend, once been a **speedster himself**. A test subject in a black-budget bird acceleration program called “Operation Wing Ding.”

No one knew if it was true.

Statis Man never denied it.  
Gary never commented.  
But sometimes, when the Titans zipped by, Gary would squint like he was remembering something… *faster.*

# The Love-Hate Dance

Despite their rivalry, the Titans kept crossing paths with Statis Man.

When Flashbomb got caught in a time loop, who un-looped her?  
Statis Man.

When Quantum Queen phased so fast she ended up two seconds into the future and couldn’t find her body?  
Statis Man paused time and *handed it back to her*.

When Chad accidentally vibrated into a children’s science museum and traumatized a dozen third-graders with his visible organs?

Okay, that one wasn’t solved.  
But Statis Man *did* pause the teachers just long enough to sneak the traumatized kids ice cream and say, “This’ll mess you up in a more fun way.”

# The Tension Peaks

It all boiled over during the Battle of Blitz Park.

A villain named **ChronoKaren** (don’t ask) unleashed a speed virus that caused everyone in a two-mile radius to move at 5x speed and talk exclusively in podcast sponsorships.

The Titans tried to outrun it.  
They failed.  
Even Chad couldn’t Chad his way out.

And then...

Statis Man strolled in, sipping tea like he had *all the time in the world.*

Which, to be fair, he kind of did.

He **paused** the virus at the edge of spreading.  
Mid-glitch. Mid-ad. Mid-chaos.

And instead of fixing it immediately, he just... stood there. Watching.

>

Eventually, he did stop the virus.  
After Gary pecked the pause crystal and flashed a glint of what might have been *speed*.

The Titans were grateful.  
They were furious.  
They were emotionally confused.

And Statis Man? He winked at Quantum Queen, who blushed and threatened to sue him.  
Then flirted with a passing elderly woman watering her begonias and offered her Gary’s number.

# Epilogue

No one *likes* Statis Man.  
But no one can ignore him.

He’s the silence before the siren.  
The eye of the storm.  
The guy your grandma calls “surprisingly limber.”

And now, the Tachyon Titans check their pulses every time the world gets still—because that means he’s near.

And maybe…  
just maybe…  
they’re starting to like it.

Even Chad.

Sort of.

Not really.

Maybe.

**/**\---

Part 4

**Statis Man: Still Here, Still Disappointed (Part 4)**

It was a quiet day. Too quiet. The city was eerily calm, as if it was holding its breath, waiting for something to explode. And when it did finally explode, it wasn’t a villain’s nefarious plot or a cosmic disaster. No, it was **Statis Man**.

Well, more specifically, his *grandparent issues.*

It all started when **Speedy McSpeedster**—yes, that’s a real name, not even joking—raced past him, looking like he’d just lost a race against a caffeine addict on a skateboard. He was one of the newer members of the so-called ""Speed Squad,"" a group of over-caffeinated teenagers who could run faster than Colin could *think*. Which, as you can imagine, wasn’t that hard to do.

Speedy skidded to a halt in front of Colin, eyes wide and full of that youthful ""I’m about to mess with you"" energy. ""You know, Statis Man, I’ve been thinking... we really need to talk about that whole *thing* with my grandma.""

Colin sighed, adjusting his oversized jacket that looked like it belonged to an old rock band no one remembered. ""I’m sorry, did you just say 'grandma'? Speedy, you’re what, eighteen? That means I’m *officially* older than your entire family line at this point."" He took a sip of lukewarm coffee for dramatic effect.

But Speedy wasn’t backing down. ""Yeah, well, my grandma—**Mildred**—she says you’re... ‘very charming,’ which I guess is code for something else? But she’s not exactly a *teenager* anymore, you know?""

And there it was: **Mildred**, the woman who had somehow managed to infiltrate *every* single member of the Speed Squad's personal life. Of course, Colin had noticed her at the last charity gala. How could he not? She was wearing leopard print, and at that age, the audacity should’ve been illegal.

Colin looked at Speedy, feigning confusion. ""Mildred, huh? The one who asked me to help her figure out how to ‘freeze time’ so she could *keep* her beauty? I mean, I could’ve let her in on a few tricks, but I thought that was a little... inappropriate."" He grinned, the edges of his words full of mischief. “But then again, I’m *fascinated* by how you all seem to think time is something you can ‘win.’”

""Right,"" Speedy muttered, rubbing his temples like he’d just realized something no one could ever unlearn. ""But what’s going on with my Nana and you? She was walking out of your room earlier today. **A little too late** for my liking, if you ask me.""

Colin turned to look at the giant clock in the sky that represented his latest self-imposed timeout. ""Speedy, if you think your grandmother and I are involved in anything beyond a *very* complicated game of chess and tea, then I have a lot of very bad news for you."" He looked down at his coffee, his face deadpan. ""I can't even remember the last time I finished a *full* game of chess. Too many distractions. Like… you guys. Being all *fast*.""

But the speedster wasn’t buying it. ""Why are you so obsessed with my Nana, huh?""

It was at that moment that **Gran**, the speedster grandma, appeared—looking more radiant than she had any right to be at 82. She sauntered over with a knowing look in her eyes, practically *gleaming*.

“I’m just glad you’re finally *owning up to your feelings*, Colin,” she said, giving him a wink. ""Speedy here thought I was crazy, but I’ve seen enough *action heroes* in my time to recognize when one’s just too stubborn to admit things.""

""Oh, don’t you start with me, Mildred,"" Colin groaned, throwing his hands up. ""I’m not doing this today. I’ve barely had my morning coffee, and now you’re both implying—what, that I’ve stolen your heart or something?""

Mildred gave a sultry smile. ""You *did* take my heart, darling. You also took my loose change out of my coat pocket while we were having tea, but I didn’t want to make a fuss.""

Speedy clenched his fists. ""You *stole* from her?!""

""Oh, please,"" Colin said, ""that was for her own good. I left a note with it. 'Take care of your blood pressure. I took the five, but I left the lesson.'""

Mildred laughed. ""It was charming, actually.""

""Yeah, no. Let me *rewind* a bit here,"" Speedy said, looking completely floored. ""You *stole money* from my Nana *and* flirted with her, all while freezing time—""

""Speedy,"" Colin said, cutting him off, ""I can’t help it if your grandmother appreciates a *real* conversation instead of listening to you ramble about your latest *unfortunate* romantic misadventures."" He shifted his weight from one foot to another, trying to avoid the literal storm of judgment coming from Speedy.

The speedster, getting a little too angry for his own good, began pacing in front of Colin. ""You know what? You’re messed up, Statis Man. My Nana deserves respect. Not whatever this is—""

""Oh, I **respect** her,"" Colin said, leaning in slightly. ""That’s why I let her keep her dignity. Which, frankly, I’m not sure you’re capable of, Speedy. I can hear your Nana’s wisdom echoing down the family tree. Honestly? You should thank me for saving you from embarrassing your whole bloodline.""

That did it. Speedy stopped pacing. The corner of his mouth twitched, as if he was considering how best to argue against an oddly compelling point. But before he could respond, there was a *whoosh*, and **Flashbomb**—one of the other speedsters—blasted in from the side, clearly unprepared for the drama.

""Okay, enough!"" Flashbomb yelled, skidding to a halt. “Everyone just stop! I heard the entire thing! *Seriously*. You’re fighting about this? This is what we’re doing today? You know, you guys are more dramatic than a 3 a.m. soap opera marathon.”

“Just saying, Gran’s *spicy*,” Colin quipped. “We’ve got an understanding. I keep her entertained, she stops trying to teach me how to make spaghetti.”

“Great,” Speedy grumbled, turning toward Flashbomb. “Next time you’re going on your own rescue mission, don’t pick up *my* family drama.”

“Sorry, buddy, that’s your *grandma* who keeps *walking into Colin’s room*,” Flashbomb said with a wicked grin. “Next time, I’ll make sure the whole squad comes over for a cup of *tea*.”

That was it. Colin slapped his palms on his thighs in dramatic defeat. “You’re all impossible,” he muttered. “Speedsters and grandparents? Honestly, I’ve broken a few family trees today, but this is something else.”

Speedy sighed, looking *deeply* conflicted. ""Whatever. I’m still faster than you. And, for the record, if you ever **break** my Nana’s heart—""

Colin paused time with a snap, just to make sure he could take a sip of his coffee without any speedsters getting in the way. Time slowed down.

It was, truly, his finest moment.

1jx5pt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1jx5pt7/we_are_in_a_simulation/,We Are In A Simulation,"Look around you - you're living in a simulation.  Perhaps not a technological one, but nevertheless divorced from reality.  

Your life is a filtered hallucination of normalcy. A numb parade of fake smiles, antidepressant comas, $6 coffees, flickering screens, climate-controlled panic attacks, dopamine drip-feeds, and cheap validation disguised as connection. You were born into a system that doesn’t give a fuck about your soul - it only wants your attention, your obedience, and your slow, comfortable decay.

The despair you feel?  This isn’t “depression.”  This is the sane response to a society that sold you a coffin and called it a lifestyle.

And most people - your friends, your coworkers, your parents - are too sedated to even notice. They’ll tell you “everything’s fine” with trembling hands and dead eyes, because to admit something’s wrong would mean they’d have to *change something*. And that’s too much work, too much discomfort, too much *real*.

So they keep scrolling. Keep sipping. Keep sleeping.

You were raised in a lie so complete, it felt like air.

You were told to be “happy.” But not *alive*. Not *awake*. Happiness meant safety. Stability. Passivity. Sit still. Shut up. Don’t think too hard. Fit in. Get likes. Pick a job. Don’t chase wonder. Don’t risk pain. Don't burn.

And now here you are, wondering why you feel hollow.

They’ll say it’s just capitalism.They’ll say it’s patriarchy, or trauma, or maybe your serotonin is just *a little off*.

But no, it runs deeper than this.  

This isn’t just social. This isn’t just psychological.

This is *spiritual collapse*.

This is the fallout of a culture that murdered God and replaced him with Amazon Prime.  This is the result of treating the human spirit like an inconvenience.  

This is what happens when a society believes in *nothing*, and then tells you to be *grateful* for it.

So let me say it straight, no pretense:

**You are not okay.**  But more importantly—**you are not supposed to be.**

Feeling like life is unbearable? Good. That means you're still alive somewhere under the armor. That means you haven’t fully merged with the simulation yet. You’re still capable of revolt.

You’re still capable of becoming *dangerous*.

Because this isn't about healing. Not yet. This is about *getting angry enough to see the truth*. This is about understanding that everything you thought was “normal” is actually an insult to your potential.

You were not born to sit in traffic, jack off to pixels, and build resumes. You were born to *tear the veil off this nightmare and walk through it laughing*.

You don’t need therapy.  You don’t need a new productivity app.  You don’t need to “learn to be content” 

No - you need to stop running.

You need to face this wretched, beautiful, chaotic world head on, and burn so brightly that every shadow in your mind starts screaming.

The world is a lie.  But you are not.  And the fact that you're still here, reading this, means your soul hasn't given up yet.

But never iced coffee because we don't have a freezer for ice cream or ice. But other areas of the business have ice machines so I got an esky full and a made a few practice ones. The coffee is good but I don't have AC where I work, on a hot day the machine produces so much heat! Why do we heat up coffee just to cool it down again with ice, how does that make sense. It's like starting in Adelaide and then driving to Melbourne as part of your route to Perth, completely in the wrong direction just to go backwards again. Wouldn't it make sense to use cold water through the coffee machine rather than let it heat up?
The thing is I would try this, but the water that pumps through the coffee grinds is always hot by default because if the machine is on, then it's heating up water like a kettle IMMEDIATELY. The only way to not make the coffee hot just to cool it down again is to just switch the machine on and pump the water through the grinds straight away before it has a chance to heat up.

Anyway just wondering why the industry standard is to heat water up to go through the coffee, only to cool it down again with ice. Wouldn't it make more sense to keep it cold the whole way? And can't coffee machines get a cold mode?",0,1744419610.0,barista,11,0.29,False

Fortunately, the wine shop also carries specialty spirits. I needed to re-up my Benedictine after using it all in my Wicked Kiss from yesterday. So I grabbed a bottle of Calvados. 

It’s my Saturday. I fired up the smoker and grill, listened to the birds, hung out with Bitey McBiteface, and realized that my most favorite hat fits again, now that the swelling of my cochlear implant has gone down. 

I just love listening to birds and wind chimes. 

The Widow’s Kiss was delightful. As was dinner.

1/2oz Yellow Chartreuse  
1/2oz Benedictine

🥞☕🍫 
Just cracked open a Great Notion Double Stack Imperial Stout and WOW, absolutely fantastic. The aroma is straight-up maple syrup pancakes and roasty coffee goodness.
Taste is insane  far better than expected but deff follows the nose, sweet maple bomb balanced perfectly by bitter coffee and on the backend  you get some dark chocolate and toffee. Super thick and creamy mouthfeel in all the right ways. 
Seriously tastes like breakfast in a can, but with a sneaky 11% ABV kick. If you dig sweet stouts with a coffee punch, and a huge maple syrup fan like me ...
GET THIS. 🔥
Rating: 9/10 (Only knocking off a point for potential sweetness overload for some, perfect for me however, will deff but again)
