About half of these years were long distance but because of the lockdown, it was a bit easier. Now we were long distance again and it was harder on me. friend, andIt was the first time I had more free time than him, and that created a change I never got used to. He was always more focused on the relationship, and I was more career oriented. I have always been the distant one. I had some commitment issues, and my independence was always more important than the relationship. I really really loved him, however, so I have been in therapy (both for that and anxiety) for almost 4 years, and I have really evolved. And he knows that. And that is why we have made work for these 4,5 years now. But now that I can express myself, I was not terrified to consider our future together, and I was asking for the emotional closeness I was used to having; he was extremely busy and extremely stressed about his future. I get that, but I became insecure, and I pressured him, or he left pushed. He always talked about going abroad, not just for me, because he wanted to. I told him multiple times that this relationship is very important, and I would be willing to take a gap year if he needs more time so that we would not have to deal with the distance next year. He said that pressured him too because he was not used to me making such sacrifices. I used to be a very type A person. But I was not anymore. I valued emotional connection more than perfection. I was genuinely fine with taking a gap year. But he felt like he was carrying these burdens, that if he failed to get into a graduate program, he would also fail the relationship. I was not perfect. I might have pressured him because, from one point forward, I really wanted to know what his plan for next year was. He was insecure and under lots of stress, and being far away, I did not evaluate how bad he was feeling. At the end I was too much. I asked for too much and did not understand how pressured he was. So he admitted that he had always been comparing himself to me, he felt inferior, and he needed time to figure out what he wanted to do. He broke up with me with an abrupt phone call while he spent the whole week before that reassuring me that we *would* work it out. I was shocked and did not want to say things I would not mean and try to change his mind. I know from earlier breakups that when he says that, nothing can change his mind. He said he loved me and he wants to ""save this love"" that he feels like is being undermined by our fights so that we can have another chance. I could not hear that, so I hung up. The next day I was calmer, and I just wanted to tell him that I respect his decision, so I asked him to call. He said that he was drunk and I deserved his full attention so that he would call the next day. For four days he claimed something had happened - including being at the hospital because a relative was very sick - and kept postponing it. When he called he was calm. I told him calmly that I respect his decision and that it could be useful for both of us because I realized I had become insecure, and I hated that. I was doing everything to hold back crying and to sound OK. Then he said that he will always love me and all this, but his tone was cold. Again, he has always been like that when we have broken up in the past. But I could not handle that. I was also calm, but that was not genuine. He sounded really calm. But maybe that was him feeling like he had control of the situation because he was the one to make the decision. I asked him if there was someone else and he said that nobody had to do anything with his decision, that this only had to do with us but that he feels like every possibility is not open and he is excited for the future. I have no idea how I remained sound hearing that. There is no way he had time to process losing his first love, best friend, and girlfriend of 4.5 years in four days. And he also implied that there would be someone he likes or that he is excited to get out there. But still he insisted on going for coffee when I would get back home and that he thinks we will have another chance. I don't know if that's the dumper's high, if he was feeling in control or if he was in shock. Or if he had just accepted it. But I cannot comprehend that. I understand that everything was hard in his life and this relationship required a lot of energy and also was objectively pushing him to make a decision. And I think that we indeed needed space. But i really do not think it was the lack of feelings that made him take this decision. When he talked about going for coffee when I would go back, I told him no. I said that I do not want him to contact me because I need time to process everything and I would reach out when and if I wanted. He said he will respect that. So now, I am thinking that (it has been 6 weeks and I am better) at some point I will want to go talk. But I would not ask him to get back together. And now I am also thinking that he needs to be the one to reach out, but I told him to not reach out. ",1,1745309241.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

But am I doing too much?","\*Just a rough draft. I'm mainly just wondering about my expressions and if I'm trying too hard.

Josh sat at a chipped conference table in Rutherford’s A unit, surrounded by a handful of new hires, CNAs, a nurse, a cook. The room smelled of burnt coffee and old paper, the fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of flies. He shifted in his chair, the plastic creaking, as the HR rep droned on, paperwork, HIPAA videos, dementia training. He’d done this a dozen times at other facilities, but today, his skin crawled. His fingers tapped the table, faster, louder. He was anxious, the feeling coiling in his gut, turning to irritation, then anger. Why was he angry? The monotony? Or something else, something in the air, pressing on him like a heavy hand.

He’d always been sensitive to energies, places, people. Mom had been too, before the overdose, always saying she felt things others didn’t. Josh often wondered if he was spiritually gifted, maybe psychic. The thought made his chest tighten. He hadn’t taken his meds again, they dulled everything, even the things he needed to feel. But without them, the paranoia gnawed: the HR rep’s glance lingered too long, the cook’s cough sounded wet, tubercular.

A maintenance man named Bill, broad-shouldered with a graying beard, interrupted the session for a tour. “B unit’s the hub,” he said, leading them through the main building’s four floors, lobby, offices, resident rooms, a small cafeteria. Josh’s eyes drifted to the red-brick walls, their texture rough, familiar. A unit branched off vertically from B, the oldest part, Bill explained. “Built first as a TB hospital, back when the disease tore through the state. They kept adding on, B, then C unit, to keep up with the sick.” C unit, also off B, had three floors, like a younger sibling to B’s four. A unit was administrative now, first floor only, offices, files, a break room. Floors two and three were off-limits, unusable, for maintenance and admin only.

They piled into A unit’s elevator, the air stale, the lights dim. Bill hit the button for the second floor, and the doors opened to a long hallway, linoleum peeling at the edges. “These were patient rooms once,” Bill said, gesturing to doors now labeled with physician names. “Turned into offices after the rest of the units were built on.” At the hall’s end, a heavy steel door sat, unmarked but ominous. “Morgue’s down there,” Bill added, voice flat. “Where they kept the ones who didn’t make it.” Josh’s throat tightened.. He imagined the bodies, lungs shredded, blood on their lips. Bill didn’t linger, ushering them back to the elevator.

The third floor was worse. The doors slid open, and Josh froze. Rusted cells lined the hall, their bars warped, chains dangling from the ceiling, some with manacles crusted in grime. The air was cold, thick, like breathing through a wet cloth. Bill’s voice cut through. “The state sent prisoners here, TB cases from prisons all over. Trying to stop the spread behind bars. Some real bad ones stayed in these cells, killers, worse. Evil, you could say.” Josh’s pulse raced. He felt eyes on him, not from the group, but from the shadows between the bars. A chain swayed, though the air was still. Energies. He felt them, heavy, wrong.

They rode back to the first floor, Bill giving a rushed verbal tour of the rest, resident wings in B and C, a courtyard, a locked basement. A heating issue called him away, and the group was dismissed. Josh walked out, the overcast sky pressing down, the brick facade of Rutherford looming like a sentinel. He couldn’t shake the third floor, those cells, the chains. The prisoners, evil, Bill said. Their energy lingered, clinging to him like damp rot. He glanced back, the bricks glowing faintly, whispering home. Whatever was in those cells, it knew him, and it wasn’t done.

I've had ffs, and I've been on hormones like 8 years? And I'm not tall and my body passes well. So I'm very confident that no one is clocking me. 

But I always thought my voice was a bit clockable. 

But lately, I'm finding that people aren't clocking me that have known me for months.

And I feel like my vocal range is pretty wide. I go pretty low with my voice often. But people will still call me mam and gender me correctly on phone or intercom. 

I think maybe it's just how my voice is naturally settled in. Like maybe it's mussel memory. Its just because it's so natural to speak in a fem way, that even when I think I probably sound masc, I'm still giving fem?

I work at a drive through. And a few times recently after I take a man's order, he will pull up and I give him his coffee. And he will say something like ""I really like your voice. It's very calming/deep/beautiful.""

On the surface, it seems like a weird compliment and flirty or like they are kinda hitting on me. 

But it's such a strange compliment. It makes me wonder if they are clocking me. 

Or it could be they just don't expect a woman to have a lower voice. So they are surprised and tell me. 

I'm considering getting voice feminization surgery. Because I really just want to be fully stealth. 

But idk. It seems like I'm almost there without it. And I'm not sure about the weakening of my vocal chords that will happen from the surgery. 

Or side effects. 

Sometimes I'm so sure that people heat my voice and just immediately know I'm trans. But then I'll be blindsided by the fact that some people I've spoken with many times, for months, don't know I'm trans. 

Does anyone have experience with men being weird about your voice? Or maybe experience with vfs?

And what's with these men? It feels objectifying when I got these complements. A similar vibe to when men have pulled up and says I have pretty eyes or something. 

Am I being harrased by chasers? Or do men really just like a deeper voice on a woman? My voice can sound a bit dark and raspy. I do see how that could be attractive. But I never thought my voice sounded like that, more so I thought I had ""T slur voice"" or whatever. 

It's just such a weird compliment to get multiple times.

After booking my ticket, I thought they would stop their intimate encounter.  
  
When I returned home after composing myself, I found them in the living room, locked in a passionate embrace, the air heavy with desire.  
  
Lorenzo looked at me with lust-filled eyes, biting his lip to stay quiet while Isabella deliberately teased him.  
  
""Don't worry, Lorenzo. She's blind, she can't see us,"" Isabella whispered against his ear, throwing a contemptuous glance my way.  
  
Lorenzo pinched her side. ""Behave. She might hear something.""  
  
""But isn't this exciting?"" she purred.  
  
""Oh no, we're out,"" Isabella whispered just loud enough for me to hear, her lips curling into a malicious smile. ""We need more protection.""  
  
She traced her fingers down Lorenzo's chest, casting a deliberate glance my way. ""Should we make your blind wife fetch them for us? Wouldn't that be... delicious?""  
  
Lorenzo hesitated, conflicted, before finally speaking. ""Darling, my throat hurts. Could you grab the Tylenol from the coffee table for me?""  
  
I stared at him, pale-faced. His cheeks were flushed, eyes glazed, arms wrapped tightly around Isabella. I clenched my fists, looking bitterly at the ""Tylenol"" on the table - obviously a box of condoms.  
  
Lorenzo was asking me to hand them protection.""Are you coming down with something?"" I kept my voice steady despite the tears threatening to fall. ""Should I call the doctor?""  
  
""I'm fine,"" Lorenzo gasped slightly as Isabella's hands wandered beneath his shirt. ""Just need to... lie down for a while.""  
  
""Then you should rest,"" his words caught as Isabella nipped at his ear. ""In the guest room, of course. Wouldn't want me to catch your... cold.""  
  
They stumbled down the hallway, giggling and whispering. The moment the guest room door clicked shut, my composure shattered. Silent tears tracked down my cheeks as the sound of their passion echoed through the walls they thought were thick enough to mask their betrayal.  
  
I called my mentor at the remote mountain sanctuary.  
  
""Are you sure about returning? Once you come back to our healing community, you can't leave. We're completely isolated. Can you really leave Lorenzo?""  
  
""Yes,"" I answered without hesitation.  
  
My mentor paused. ""Alright. Come in seven days.""  
  
I used to hesitate because of Lorenzo. Now he made the choice for me.  
  
I glanced at the closed guest room door, hearing their passionate sounds.  
  
""I've wasted years neglecting my gift of healing. It's time I honor it and help others at the sanctuary.""  
  
""Good. We'll welcome you home in eight days.""  
  
""I'll be there.""  
  
After our call, Lorenzo emerged wearing a white shirt, covered in passion marks he thought I couldn't see. After all, I was supposed to be blind.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The nausea hit me like a tidal wave.  
  
When Lorenzo rushed over, all I could smell was Isabella's signature perfume - a custom French fragrance he'd commissioned just for her at some obscene price. The scent made my stomach lurch. I shoved him away, still playing my part as the blind wife as I groped my way to the bathroom. My body knew what my heart couldn't accept.  
  
Kneeling on the cold tile floor, I heaved into the toilet. When the nausea subsided, something in the trash caught my eye - a pregnancy test with two unmistakable pink lines. It stared back at me, a cruel reminder of my own hollow marriage.  
  
I couldn't even cry. The pain had gone beyond tears. Lorenzo hadn't touched me in the six months since I lost my sight. Now I knew why - he'd been busy getting his assistant pregnant.  
  
""Baby, what's wrong?"" His voice cracked with panic as he wrapped his arms around my waist from behind. His hands trembled against my skin, desperately clinging as if I might disappear. The same hands that had just explored every inch of Isabella's body.  
  
God, Lorenzo, you deserve an Oscar for this performance. I pulled away, creating a chasm between us.  
  
""Just stomach issues. Everything I eat seems to come back up.""  
  
When had I become such a convincing liar? I used to hate liars with a passion. Now look at me - I'd become one.  
  
My words sent him into overdrive. Mr. Germaphobe suddenly didn't care about the mess as he pulled me close again.  
  
""I'm so sorry. I've been buried in work, leaving you alone for meals, not taking care of you properly. This is all my fault.""  
  
He cradled my face like I was made of glass, his forehead creased with what looked like genuine concern. Back in our bedroom, he reached for my clothes to help me change - a routine since I'd lost my sight. This time, I stopped him. For the first time in our marriage, I dressed myself. The momentary flash of panic in his eyes was almost worth it.  
  
As I lay in bed, he fussed with the covers like a mother hen. ""Are you mad at me? For being absent? Tomorrow's your birthday - I'll clear my schedule, spend the whole day with you.""  
  
The great Lorenzo Visconti, the shark of Wall Street who made grown men tremble, reduced to this simpering act. Was it a blessing or a curse to witness this side of him?  
  
Just as sleep began to pull me under, his phone vibrated. Thinking I was out, he answered after checking my stillness.  
  
""You savage, you destroyed my La Perla set. Get up here and bring me a new one. Now.""  
  
""On my way,"" he whispered, brushing my cheek with false tenderness before slipping away.  
  
I gripped the Egyptian cotton sheets until my knuckles went white, tears finally breaking through my defenses. So Isabella hadn't left? Was she living here, treating my blindness like some cosmic joke?  
  
Seven days, I reminded myself. Seven days until I'd be gone, cutting every tie with Lorenzo Visconti. Seven days until freedom.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
The next morning, Lorenzo was up early, preparing an elaborate breakfast spread.  
  
He'd prepared a gourmet breakfast spread - eggs benedict, fresh croissants, and my favorite blueberry scones from that little French bakery downtown.  
  
""Try this,"" he murmured, holding up a forkful of perfectly poached egg. ""Just like our first breakfast together, remember?"" His voice was dripping with manufactured tenderness.  
  
Across the table, Isabella pouted until Lorenzo discreetly texted her: ""I'll make it up to you later. Anything you want. Just don't make a scene in front of her.""  
  
Satisfied, Isabella threw me a contemptuous glance before leaving the table, deliberately brushing against Lorenzo as she passed.  
  
I ignored Lorenzo's offered bite, pretending to fumble with my utensils as I ate something else. Mistaking my behavior for sulking, he insisted on taking me out after breakfast.  
  
He'd rented a luxury yacht and invited friends for what he claimed was my birthday celebration.  
  
Throughout the journey, Lorenzo held my hand tightly, ostensibly to prevent me from falling, reminiscing about our past happiness. I remained silent, bitter irony mixing with pain in my chest.  
  
I'd once believed in ""till death do us part."" What a joke that turned out to be. Lorenzo craved excitement and younger flesh, forgetting our wedding vows.  
  
The yacht's deck was covered in red rose petals. He knew I hated roses - they were Isabella's favorite. How fitting that even my birthday celebration wasn't really for me.  
  
""Remember? We got married right here,"" Lorenzo's voice cracked with emotion, a tear rolling down his cheek. He guided my finger to touch his tear. Such a convincing performance of devotion.  
  
If he hadn't betrayed me, I might have been moved to tears myself. He had loved me once, but now that love belonged to Isabella.  
  
I withdrew my hand, my face expressionless. Lorenzo's hurt expression lasted mere seconds before his eyes lit up, looking past me.  
  
Isabella appeared in a custom designer gown that made my simple outfit look dowdy by comparison. ""Happy birthday, madam,"" she purred, sliding next to Lorenzo and gripping his hand despite the crowd.  
  
""Everything's ready, sir,"" she announced. ""Shall I count down?""  
  
""Three!"" ""Two!"" ""One!""  
  
The night sky erupted with fireworks, painting the darkness with brilliant colors. Standing there, Lorenzo and Isabella looked like the real couple. The fireworks spelled out Isabella's name, not mine.  
  
This birthday celebration, like the fireworks, wasn't meant for me at all.  
  
Suddenly, Lorenzo asked the housekeeper to watch me. ""Be good, darling. I'll be right back,"" he kissed my forehead before hurrying away with Isabella.

1k50t07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1k50t07/boomer_coworker_who_is_still_stuck_in_the_80s_and/,Boomer Co-Worker who is still stuck in the 80s and acts like an 18-year-old,"Just a story about a boomer co-worker of mine that suits this sub reddit, I’ll call him Boomer Bill.  Boomer Bill has no family, no spouse (ex-wife who divorced him) and probably no friends.

Boomer Bill is a storeman, who has been working in our stores area for well over 30 years and he is the biggest loser I have ever met.   He is an absolute man-child and even every other Boomer at our workplace can’t stand him.  He acts like he is still 18, in fact most 18 year olds I have met are more mature than him.

Mind you, I know most boomers are not like this, this guy is an extreme case.

Some of Boomer Bills highlights:

\-            Calls all young people soft and weak compared to his era.  Also has this belief that every millennial is an inner city hipster who only eats kale and buys chai lates every day. 

\-            We have one co-worker who is celiac, and Boomer Bill attempts to mock him by saying “I am going to go on a gluten only diet tomorrow, what do you think?” 

\-            Hates any coffee that isn’t the instant powdered coffee and calls anyone who drinks any other coffee a “hipster”.  Once he went into a café with a mug of instant coffee just to “piss off the young hipsters”

\-            Whinges about EVERYTHING modern, technology, movies, music, retail stores.  Everything was better in his day and couldn’t even compare to now.  I mean, everyone has some things they believe were better in ‘their day’ , but usually can also spot things that are better, nor do they look down on others for enjoying modern things.

\-         He is a massive football fan (still whinges about how its not as good as it used to be).  Calls people soft if they don't punch a wall or break a TV after a bad loss.

\-            Refers to himself as a ‘jock’ and likes to call people ‘nerds.’  The other day he said that Star Wars was for nerds.  Also brags about the nerds he bullied in high school.

\-            Is obsessed with hospital gowns, he buys them in bulk and wears them every day when he is not at work.  He changes them once a fortnight.  He shows us all photos of him in his gown, once he showed a picture with his bum showing and thought it was hilarious.

\-            Has a poor diet and will go at lengths to defend it and claim his diet is actually healthy and all the scientists are wrong.   Once claimed cigarettes are healthy because “100 years ago everyone lived to 100 and always smoked, now everyone drops dead at 50.  Its not cigarettes that are unhealthy” 

\-            Is a carnivore.  He claims vegetables are not healthy and cause Kidney stones.  Only eats red meat (pork and chicken are girls’ meat apparently) and thinks the links to cancer is just “The woke left trying to stop us eating meat”   

\-            Once cried because a fish pie from a certain bakery was named best pie of the year.  Apparently, this was “Woke anti red meat” propaganda.

\-             Revolves his entire personality around drinking beer and getting drunk.  It’s never “What are your plans for the weekend? Its “Who else is getting PISSED on the weekend”, its never “did you have a good trip” its “what was your biggest SESSION” 

\-            Calls kids today soft because they don’t party as hard as he used to.  Once we had an after-work drinks and he mocked our young engineering intern for going home after only one drink.  He continued harassing them over it at work until he was told to cut it out. 

\-            We are a 0 alcohol workplace for safety reasons, he is the only person in our company who has an actual issue with this.  He is constantly bitching about how its just “woke shit” and bragged about how back in the day he would knock down 10 pints at lunch then go back to work without an issue. 

 

How does he keep his job?  Honestly, he is good at his job, and he is usually ok providing you avoid any sort of social interaction with him.  The best way to deal with him is to only talk to him about work and pretend you’re busy if he talks to you about anything non-work related (which can be hard when he is in your face about it).

1k50pr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1k50pr3/10_month_long_anxiety_symptom_gone_after_2_weeks/,10 month long anxiety symptom gone after 2 weeks of no caffeine,"About 10 months ago, I was on vacation in Europe for 2 months, and I developed a weird anxiety symptom I'd never experienced before. Multiple times a day, I’d get this electric/numbing sensation that shot down my back and arms, kind of like the feeling you get right before goosebumps, and sometimes it would turn into full-on goosebumps on my arms and legs.

It happened over 10 times a day and seemed to be triggered by emotional reactions like feeling nervous, hearing a beautiful song, seeing something emotional on TV, or even thinking of a pleasant memory. It lasted for months, and honestly, I started getting worried it might be something neurological.

I decided to quit caffeine 10 days ago, and I'm so glad to say that the goosebump sensation has completely stopped!!

Other things I’ve noticed: I’ve been falling asleep within 5 minutes of lying down, which is rare for me. I think the whole thing might’ve started in Europe because I was drinking 1–2 coffees in the morning, having Coke with meals (I usually don’t drink soft drinks), and drinking way more alcohol at night than I normally do. My nervous system was probably overloaded.

For context, I’m 34 and have been drinking coffee religiously since I was 16 which, interestingly, is when my anxiety first started. I wouldn’t say I’m a heavy caffeine user either. I have a daily double shot latte first thing in the mornings, no energy drinks or and no soft drinks.

But the fact that cutting it out cleared a persistent 10-month symptom in just 10 days makes me wonder how much it’s been affecting me all these years. I’ve had zero cravings for coffee so far, so I’m going to stick with it and see what other improvements come. I've heard a lot of people comment that it can take months to properly heal from a caffeine addiction.

Just thought I’d share as a reminder to anyone else dealing with persistent anxiety symptoms, to consider a break from caffeine.",1,1745307904.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

After month of working day jobs and dreaming about building something of our own, we’re finally taking the leap with *3Tower* — a creepy, atmospheric indie horror game we've been pouring our hearts into.

It’s been a wild ride already: late nights, jumpscare debates, and lots of coffee-fueled design sessions. The idea started as just a weird little spark while watching anomaly-hunting videos, and now it’s shaping into a full game — built by me and my wife, with her crafting the haunting visuals and me tackling the code and gameplay.

There’s still a long road ahead, and we know we’re just at the beginning. But for the first time, it really feels like this crazy dream of running our own indie studio (*Wechselbalg Studio*) might actually be real.

Thanks for taking a moment to check this out — we can’t wait to share more of *3Tower* with you all! 👁️

1k50n1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k50n1k/why_did_i_take_the_job/,Why did I take the job!,"Sitting on my bed, head in my hands, frustrated with yet another day of unsuccessful job interviews and applications that go nowhere. I ask out loud ""am I just not good enough to hire?"" I just don't get it! I had a degree, years of experience, a good strable work-life balance then suddenly it all crashed down around me. 

I loved my job! I worked hard, I got promoted, I excelled beyond my own beliefs then one morning I stepped out the shower to an urgent email. 

""DO NOT COME TO WORK, WE ARE CLOSED INDEFINITELY. Expect your final wages to be paid in 7 working day and a lot less"" 

What?? I tried calling my boss... no answer, replied to the email and it bounced back, my colleagues all scrambling to figure out what's going on but none of us got answers.

It's been months now, I'm just greatful that I had a decent enough wage at the time to have a rainy day fund so I had been able to cover rent, bills etc but now I was running low. My rent was increased 2 days after I lost my job   and the increase was almost double. 

My moping was interrupted by a notification ""urghh"" I flap my arm around to find where I'd throw my phone

one new email

""oh great, probably another rejection! Just want I need today"" 

I open it fully expecting the generic rejection email that I think every company just copy pastes

""MIss Smyth. 

Thank you for your application, we feel you would be the perfect fit here at golden tree nursing home..

Please arrive this evening at 10pm sharp, wear casual clothing and sensible footwear. 

Your shift commences at 10:10pm and ends at 9:30am

Congratulations""

Golden tree?? I hadn't applied to a nursing home, I don't have any experience unless you can count the forced work experience I had at 15! But I was desperate I needed the money and no other job was biting... Looking back now i should of just ignored it... 

10pm sharp, I'd been sat outside for the last 10 minutes out of fear or being late. I press the doorbell and within seconds the door is thrown open by a frail older woman, looking over the top of her glasses she looks me up and down. 

""Miss Smyth I'm assuming?"" 

""yes, please just call me Rebecca"" 

She tuts at me, ""follow me please Miss Symth and wipe that mess off your face"" 

I know she doesn't mean makeup I don't wear any, then I remember I had eaten in my car out of nerves. I reached up to find a smear of tomato sauce on my chin. ""great first impressions idiot"" I thinkto myself""

She leads me to the security room, there must be 40 screens all lit up with bedrooms, hallways, break rooms and this security room. ""wow that's a lot of screens"" I say trying to break the daunting silence. 

""this will be your job Miss Smyth, you sit here and watch. Once an hour you will do a physical check of the floor, it should take you 10 minutes to do a full loop"" 

""OK, sounds simple enough""

""this is your rule book, take this first hour to study it, do not under any circumstance vear from this is that understood!"" 

She holds the book out and I carefully take it, ""yes Ma'am understood"" she nods. 

""goodnight Miss Symth, Good luck""

She takes her leave and I settle down into a surprisingly comfortable chair, I see her leaving the building on the security camera and locking the door behind her. 
I lean back and open the rule book, it smells old but looks relatively new. 

""Rebbeca Smyth

These are your rules, you must follow them without question. 

Failure to do so will result in immediate termination.""

""Rule one: clock into your shift at precisely 10:10pm not before or after"" 

""Rule two: lock the security room door Immediately, only unlock when you do your rounds"" 

Oh shit! I jump up to lock the door, but it's already done! Maybe she did it on her way out. 

""Rule three: the nursing home is empty we have no patients if you hear anyone or see anyone DO NOT ENGAGE""

""finally rule four: if you hear anyone walking behind you ignore it, do not turn around. Walk at your normal pace and finish your loop, upon locking yourself back in the security room turn monitors 37 and 9 off and do not turn them back on for the remainder of your shift""

What the hell, at this point I'm thinking I should just get up and leave but she had locked me in. Maybe this is just an old ladys idea of a joke I mean if it is then great job freaking the new guy out! 

The first 4 hours of my shift was smooth sailing, I settle back down into my chair sipping on the supply of canned ice coffee i kept in my bag. Scanning over the screens something caught my eye. 

""bedroom. 12"" I stare at the screen, I swear that looks like someone under the bed covers! 

""beep beep beep"" 

I spin round! The room call button had been pressed, room 12 flashing away.... Maybe it's a wiring issue this building is really old! I turn back to look at that room.. A chill runs up my spine


A woman in a night grown stood at the door, finger repeatedly pressing the call button. I remember rule three, do not engage, I'm guessing that means I should just sit and wait for it to finish but one by one all 30 call lights start going off, some rooms are empty and others, well I don't even know what they are but they are not human. 

The beeping is starting to feel like knives in my brain, I check the time feeling like this has been going on for hours! ""02:16"" are you kidding?? It's been a minute a literal minute! I slam my head down onto the desk covering my ears with my hands begging for it to stop. 

As abruptly as it started it stopped, but now the silence was deafening

Why do Muslims care so much about what other people think of them? From what I’ve gathered, it seems as though they want to show the other religions that they are truly the best religion to have, because look at how “well in uniform they are” How “clean and peaceful they are.” oh Christians you don’t know how to quote from your own book word for word from memory? That’s crazy, because we Muslims can recite our entire Quran without missing a beat. 😜☝️ oh, you pray three times a day? You pray one time a day? Oh that’s crazy, because we Muslim pray five times a day, we’re truly the most holy people in the world. (not that, that’s bad. We should all pray, but like why are you making it a competition? That’s weird.) oh other religions, you guys allow your women to make her own choices in life and have fun? We Muslim men would never allow our women to walk out of the house any type of way, or have an education, they have to do every single thing their husband says, because we’re so much holier than you! Oh, you listen to music? That’s crazy, because in our religion, we love God so much so we only wanna hear his holy word, we wouldn’t dare listen to a song about enjoying life and actually being happy in this DISGUSTING human world. 

You get the gist, but it’s like  why are you so obsessed with constantly being perceived as “holier” by people you claim to not care about. And if I’m being a real, maybe the title is a bit misleading, because obviously, there are other religions who try to undermine our religion, and when that happens, we should definitely defend ourselves. But at the same time, it’s like if all Muslims care about is Optics, you would assume that they would try extra hard to make sure that certain behaviors from extremists are blatantly unacceptable and that the majority of Muslim population is against it. But instead, what they seem to do is argue on the Internet all day about stupid shit with other people from other religions, like praying, fasting, whose idea is the right idea, and who’s gonna burn the hell who’s not, rather than addressing the real issues in their community. 

Like God forbid a Hijabi woman makes a joke about her hair or her period, and all of a sudden it’s “oh it’s best to just delete this because we are Muslim and we have a reputation to uphold, and we can’t just post anything online because people are watching us“ but then let an extremist come online saying things like child marriage is acceptable and women shouldn’t be allowed to have an education, and then THAT’S when non-Muslims actually start to looking at us as unholy, but all of a sudden, it’s “well we don’t care about what kaffurs have to say.” Like???? if you care about what people think so much, how about you condemn the actions of the people in your community! Stop inviting extremists to talk at mosques and instead invite people who, instill into the masses that pedophilia, abuse towards women, bullying one another, and harassment are wrong. Instead of constantly making podcasts that bash women every day, and make it seem like literally being born a woman is Haram, make a podcast go viral where a Muslim man and other Muslims are saying out loud things like, “hey, I don’t support what’s going on in Afghanistan. The women in Afghanistan deserve to be free from the Taliban” “ we need to have a serious conversation about abuse in Muslim marriages, domestic violence towards women is not allowed in our book, and men who put their hands on women should be dealt with in our community.” “We may not support LGBTQ lifestyle but there is no need to be violent towards people who’ve not harmed you. Pray for them and move on with your life.” 

Like I’m sorry but they’re just so delusional, you care what people think about you? Okay cool, nobody gives a damn that you pray 5 times a day and refrain from coping with the fact that you are indeed a human being living in a world that isn’t the stone ages, that you absolutely have to participate in…people care about how you show up in this world. People care about if you are a good person or not. Not that use your title of being “religious” and PRETEND to be, but that you PHYSICALLY show up in this world as someone who can bring peace amongst communities. So sorry to break it to you, Haram police, but the hijabis making silly little tiktoks, the men going to the Yemeni coffee shops, the women choosing to not get married and become doctors and lawyers, the men who shave their beards aren’t the ones making the religion look bad. Those of you who do nothing but sit on the internet being miserable and arguing with other religions about what they do, harassing your fellow Muslims about insignificant things, the ones staying silent in the midst of corruption that’s coming from our own community are the ones that do. They’re looking at YOU…since you care so much 💀

I know that  majority of the people in this sub would never do that, but I’m truly at wits end with this behavior from the community and I just had to get it off my chest. What’s worse is that nobody wants to listen, they just want to keep living in their delusional fantasy that the ONLY reason why some Muslims get criticized is because “people are just jealous because our religion is the best.” Like okay sure akhi🙂",0,1745307491.0,progressive_islam,0,0.5,False

So bob n his ex started dating again later on for one and half year  we still kept in touch every now n then nothing like how are you and how is your life going text that’s it nothing more than that 
 His ex ended up cheating on him with other guy .we were still in touch just usual how are you text for 6 months gradually we started chatting and meeting up for lunch or dinner once in a while. We started hooking up n decided to stay fwb because I was not sure about being in relationship with him again but we go on trips n did all the things which couples do. I started to have feelings for him which I suppress never really mentioned to him . One day we met up for coffee and we were just talking about our life and I was just ranting about how my dad is asking when m I going to bring my bf home since my sister and brother both got their partners introduced to my parents n he replied by "" oh then it’s time to meet ur dad?” I was lil taken back I just laughed it off by stop joking and he didn’t said anything Cuz he never really proposed to me or asked me out. My sister knows about our relationship she always said why don’t you make it official and start dating each other so I think it through and thought I’ll ask him out and make it official. We were planning to go on a trip so I thought what’s better opportunity then asking him out on romantic vacation near beach Fast forward to the event so we were reached our Airbnb n went to take rest for while I wasn’t really tired so I was watching some shows on my phone so he gave me his tab to watch bigger screen more enjoyable great he was taking nap while I finished my movie I clicked some picture making ugly face I know he will love it n laugh like kid while I was checking my pic I scrolled n saw a girl laying naked but yah covered on by blanket n placing his chain on her face I was dumbfounded I know we are not dating but I have this much respect for him that I was not f***ing around with other guy.

We have 4 children under the age of 10. She was raised in a religious faith that prohibits sexual expression and restricts sexual behavior. She knew she was bi when she was a teenager, but couldn't do anything about it because of the church. She never went all the way with a guy or girl before me. She fooled around with guys, but never had sex with anyone. We met when we were both 23 and got married a year later. About 4 years ago she began unraveling her faith in this church and has since completely abandoned it. Because of its restrictions on her life and her upbringing, she went into a rebellious phase - started drinking coffee, got a tattoo, started socially drinking alcohol, etc. She also decided that she should be able to express herself as bi and wants to explore her sexuality more with other partners - dating, flirting, possibly more. She wants us to try an open marriage. I don't want an open marriage. I didn't grow up the same way she did and got all of the desires out of my system before getting married. She feels like I control her sexually and otherwise. She claims she has no sexual chemistry with me, but is attracted to me physically. She has experienced sexual trauma from me early on in our marriage because she didn't feel that she had a voice or a choice to say no to sexual acts or advances on my part. She feels like since she left her religion and there is no after life anymore, she doesn't want to waste the life she has now and wants to explore and experience sex with other people, since she didn't get to do that growing up. She started a Bumble profile and got loads of messages from guys, girls, and even a few married couples looking for a 3rd. She never met up with any of these people and never exchanged her own pictures with them as far as she claims. She wants me to start a profile and try to date and flirt as well, but I think it is just so that she won't feel guilty for having done it already and wanting to do more. She says she doesn't want to hurt me or lose our marriage or family as we are now, but she just can't seem to let go of the idea of getting to express herself sexually with other people and other partners to figure out what she likes and have more sexual experience than just being with me. I had more than 10 sexual partners before getting married and she was a virgin when we met. 
So, am I the ass hole for not wanting to let her have an open marriage and not wanting to get myself emotionally hurt and possibly lose our family over her wanting to get this out of her system??
 I don't want to raise our kids in a divorce situation or ruin their childhoods either. I feel like an ass hole for not letting her do this because she has been hurt by me in the past, hasn't been treated right by me early in our marriage, and has sexual trauma from me. I feel stuck. I feel like I can't really say no because she suffers from severe depression, inattentive ADHD (never officially diagnosed or medicated), and autism (also never officially diagnosed) that cause her to just lay around all day and dwell on this.

1k50i4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExBestFriends/comments/1k50i4y/handling_a_former_best_friend_breakup/,Handling a former best friend breakup,"Hi!!! My childhood best friend has officially stepped over the line to the point where I can no longer look at her as someone I can trust/rely on for anything. 

Last year I was her maid of honor and she had me jump through a bunch of hoops to support her- 

2 engagement parties: 1 where I literally showed up at 10a with my bf, and we SCRUBBED her apt down all the way until 6p only for her and her fiance to leave me and my bf at their house bc they had a ""dinner"" planned and THEN the party started.
The second wasn't ""hosted"" by them (thank God, 8 hrs work with no pay or food provided...) but I was still asked to drive and grab stuff they forgot and babysit her and her fiance when they both got blackout and I had to gather their things (gifts and alcohol). 

Then on the wedding day they had me wake up at 4a to get my hair and make-up down so I could get the flowers for the wedding, food and coffee for the bridesmaids, all while dealing with her having mental breakdowns about wedding stress and taking it out on me. At one point she iterally she lost a part of her dress and she was like, ""you ruined my bridal pictures!"" When I literally took photos of her that day to show her that her dress didn't look 'right' but she said it was fine. Her wedding planner also dropped the ball in a lot of ways (I used to do planning)- unable to play music for the bridal party, mistimed the March for the bride to walk down the aisle, wasn't initiating next phases of the event (literally overheard people asking when they could leave when speeches hadn't been done). 

TLDR: did a lot of things to help that I was happy to do for my friend even though she was openly very ungrateful.


I had to fix most of these issues all while being criticized for not doing more. 

I decided not to get her a gift for the wedding because I'd already spent $1000 out of my own pocket for the event, missed like 10 days of work to go to all the events and I am below the poverty line economically. She reached out to me after her month long honeymoon to basically shame me for not getting her a gift. I was really taken aback at how she said it and I have people pleasing tendencies so I apologized initially but revoked it after consideration. When I said I wouldn't get her a physical gift she went bananas on me, literally yelling. The amount of WORK and STRESS the events themselves caused should be enough and she should be understanding of that but she never got it. We 'agreed to disagree' but fundamentally she doesn't appreciate anything I did for her. 

If I'm being honest, at this point I looked at her completely different - someone who was formerly my best friend but I still had love for her. 

Recently, my bf has been going through some health issues and doctors have been trying to diagnose him. A lot of his appointments are last minute because they're trying to get him in any open spots. He had a spinal tap recently which the doctor only spoke about to him the day before, including the details that he should be laying as still as possible for 24 hrs following it. I was supposed to see my 'friend' that same weekend but felt uncomfortable knowing he was trying to recover from this procedure alone. When I spoke with her, her response was ""I don't like him. He should've told you about this."" I barely spoke out of shock and I don't feel I need to explain everything about a situation to her, but for this to be her immediate takeaway was very telling. 

She also doubled down on it in my silence and was like, ""I don't like him. Also MS isn't that serious, BLANKs dad has it and is totally fine."" Her dad literally died of cancer- I couldn't imagine being like, ""BLANKS DAD HAD CANCER AND IS TOTALLY FINE!""

She doesn't like being 'inconvenienced' despite us making the plans like 2 weeks in advance. She doesn't like my boyfriend because 'he should've known' when she's jumping to conclusions and refusing to listen to me. 

I'm genuinely done. I don't want to have a friend I have to fight to understand me. I don't want a friend who thinks it's acceptable to talk about my partner like that or any person for that matter. 

I'm tired of being expected to put her on a pedestal all while she talks down to me. I deserve better. 

Anyway, I'm trying to do a friend breakup but she has one of my fav purses (it was $300, I bought it when I was like 20) and I have something expensive of hers. How do I keep her 'afloat' so she doesn't explode and destroy my things without giving away how much I loathe her?",1,1745306947.0,ExBestFriends,0,1.0,False

I’ve been getting more and more into espresso the past few years and have recently decided to invest a bit more in equipment. My set up for the last few years has been the classic Bambino + a Eureka mignon. This has served me well but a mix of wanting more control, better stability, better overall espresso (and a lot of upgrade-itis) has me looking at new options. 

I’ve recently just purchased the Option-O Lagom Casa with 65 conical burrs and have noticed a huge difference but now I’m looking at a new machine to go with it. My partner and I would typically make 2-3 milk drinks per day with the occasional extra drinks for guests. But ideally don’t want too long of a wait for the steam boiler to get up to temp when making coffees before work.

Budget is ideally under/around £2000 which puts me in the ball park of a mid-level dual boiler. I’m really eyeing up the Profitec Pro 600. Though I’m willing to stretch to something like the Lelit Bianca if it’s really worth it.

Am I being crazy?

Is buying one of these machines with ‘only’ the Lagom Casa even worth it? 

Should I wise up and just buy a nice single boiler or heat exchange like a Profitec Go or MaraX etc. if I’m only making a couple of drinks per day?

**Chapter Ten: The Test**

Wei pinned the last of the scans to the board and stepped back, his fingers faintly smudged with dry-erase ink. The whiteboard now held a messy constellation of symptoms, brain images, behavioral observations, and the growing spectrum of what MIMS did. It wasn’t neat, but it was clear: the virus worked by amplification, not suppression.

Langston tapped a marker against her leg. “We’ve charted effects. That’s useful. But we still don’t know if it’s predictable.”

“We can’t model a spread this wide from one Devoste,” Bates added. “We need more cases. Full neurological baselines. Pre- and post-MIMS.”

Wei gave a small, thoughtful nod. “Then we need test subjects.”

Langston lowered the marker. “Volunteers?”

“No one would consent to this,” Bates said. “Not in time.”

Wei didn’t speak. He was watching Langston.

She met his gaze, paused, then sighed. “I know a guy. Department of Corrections. He owes me a favor.”

Bates blinked. “You’re suggesting we test this on prisoners?”

Langston didn’t flinch. “They already sign medical waivers for all kinds of things. Dental, behavioral modification trials, hormone treatments. If we lean on our original human trial authorization paperwork and reframe this as a neuromodulation protocol—”

Wei finished for her: “We’re still inside the bounds of what was approved. Technically.”

Bates closed her eyes for a moment. Then she nodded once. “We don’t test on the vulnerable. Not usually. But this isn’t usual.”

Langston was already opening a secure call channel. “Denton Correctional Facility. Low security, mostly federal offenders. The warden won’t ask too many questions.”

Within 48 hours, they had access. Three official volunteers. Full biometric intake, MRI mapping, and pre-intervention behavioral logs. Control and test groups were arranged in separate dorms to avoid cross-contamination.

And then someone got lazy.

A technician that was young, overworked, and increasingly dismissive of the strict protocol decided to mist the test subjects and the control group on different sides of the mess hall but at the same time. But MIMS didn’t need a direct dose. The virus was already airborne, its particles clinging to clothing and skin, traveling through shared air with frightening ease. The ventilation in the mess hall circulated between both dorm wings, merging the spaces that were meant to be isolated. The technician then sat for lunch in the admin lounge, touched a coffee pot handle, laughed at a joke, and adjusted someone’s badge strap without thinking. By the next morning, one of the guards was humming a melody he didn’t remember learning.

Back in the lab, Langston scrolled through the expanding dataset and groaned. “It’s spreading faster than we thought. No direct dose needed.”

Bates looked up from her terminal. “It’s Julio all over again. Just one exposure, and then—”

Wei nodded. “Skin contact. Shared air. Possibly even residual scent particles on clothing. It’s not just contagious. It’s clingy.”

Langston added, “We’re looking at full exposure within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. And if Resistants are just asymptomatic carriers, then we’re already at near total saturation. One hundred percent infection rate. Its astounding.""

Bates said, “And if not? Then eighty-five percent minimum. Which tracks with what we’re seeing.”

They reviewed the footage from the lab to compare. Julio had walked the corridor after cleaning Devoste’s room. Then into the staff locker room. Then out into the parking garage.

Langston frowned. “He didn’t cough. Didn’t sneeze. Just breathed.”

“And that was enough,” Bates said. “Now we’re watching it again.”

The doctors watched the data flood in and despaired, their screens awash in cascading logs, erratic behavior charts, and streaming vitals that refused to fit any known pattern. The sheer volume of information overwhelmed their senses—blinking indicators, conflicting trends, and the quiet knowledge that they were no longer documenting an experiment, but witnessing a transformation beyond their control. Bates felt her pulse climb with each new data burst, while Langston muttered under her breath, scrolling too fast to process. Even Wei, who had been so composed, sat with his head bowed slightly, as if absorbing the tidal shift of something far larger than their models had ever dared to predict. The three men they had dosed directly all showed signs of rapid emotional unburdening and fell into a Basic state within 18 hours. Quiet. Obedient. Nonresponsive to deep prompts.

“Everything we wanted to study, and now they can’t even describe what they’re feeling,” Bates muttered.

“Of course they can’t,” Langston snapped. “We scrubbed their ability to care.”

But then things got weirder. Some of the inmates who hadn’t signed up for the study began exhibiting non-Basic traits. One began journaling obsessively, recording scent memories and describing his dreams in vivid detail. Another began to teach origami, instructing other prisoners in absolute silence, as if words were unnecessary.

By day four, the prison nurse requested reassignment. She said she couldn’t focus. All she wanted to do was sit in the yard and listen to the wind.

Langston raised both hands at the monitor and said, “We’re losing our dataset. This is chaos.”

Wei smiled faintly. “This is evolution.”

Slowly, patterns emerged. The Basics were the most common, at least from this prison dataset. They moved slowly, completed chores without complaint, ate simple meals, and ignored all technology. Attuned inmates became subtly different. They spent long hours outdoors, gazed at the sky, or smelled the grass before lying in it. They didn’t speak unless necessary, but when they did, it was strange and poetic. “The bricks feel cooler today,” one said, laying a hand against the wall. “It’s like they’ve stopped arguing.”

Resistants remained unchanged, at least for a time. A few inmates still paced, still grumbled. But they were in the minority, and their tempers had softened, like anger was harder to hold.

During an observation, the doctors watched an Attuned inmate help a Basic inmate sort laundry. No words passed between them, but both nodded slowly, as if synchronized. A Resistant inmate nearby simply looked on, expression unreadable.

And then, there was Leland.

He wasn’t on the list. Not technically. A late addition to the intake group, he was someone who had been swapped in for an inmate who refused participation. The staff thought he’d been cleared. He hadn’t.

He was dosed with the same nasal mist as the others. Then, because of a clerical error and a paperwork shuffle, he was released twenty-four hours later on a scheduled parole. He never made the lists of either control or subjects.

No one noticed until the warden mentioned offhandedly, “That polite guy. Leland, I think? Didn’t cause any problems. Walked out of here yesterday. Kind of a shame. I think he was turning a corner.”

Wei, Bates, and Langston looked at each other in silence.

“No way to recall him?” Langston asked.

“Not without admitting we dosed him,” Bates said.

Wei added, “And if he’s contagious?”

Bates exhaled. “Then MIMs is already loose. Again.”

Outside the glass, two prisoners were folding paper birds while a third swept the corridor in perfect silence. An Attuned inmate was showing a Resistant how to sit still and smell the cypress oil from the floor cleaner, murmuring, “It’s better when you notice.”

Langston pointed without looking. “That one was in the control group.”

Wei said nothing. He just updated the spectrum chart and drew a new line. **Holdouts: unknown latency, full behavioral swing.**

Bates scanned a separate readout. “Wait. Has anyone here died of ELM since the testing began?”

They all went still.

Langston pulled up the integrated health feed. “Not one. Not a single case. Not even among the exposed population.”

“That prison should be a disaster zone,” Bates whispered. “ELM would’ve torn through it. Half of them should be dead already.”

Wei nodded slowly. “But they’re not. We saved them.”

There was a long silence.

Bates sat back, her voice quieter now. “This isn’t just containment anymore. We’re seeing something else. Maybe even something better.”

Langston didn’t argue. She only glanced at the updated behavioral charts. “We’re changing their brains. We said we wouldn’t, but we are.”

“No,” Wei said gently. “We’re revealing them. MIMs doesn’t rewrite: it remaps.”

For the first time, none of them looked away.

And in that moment, pride began to creep in. Not boastful. Not loud. But a quiet, persistent realization that they had saved lives. Even if the method was still unsettling.

Even if they didn’t fully understand what came next.

They didn’t know where Leland had gone, and they had no idea what he carried. ",1,1745306637.0,prereadmybook,0,1.0,False

I recently bought a small[ food waste caddy](https://www.biobagworld.com/intl_en/products/food-waste-containers-and-coddies?category=109) for the kitchen counter, and it's sort of a game changer.

I lined it with compost bags, so cleaning up is a breeze. Rather than throwing peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, etc. in the trash, they go directly into the caddy. No stink yet (tip: add a bit of baking soda in there), and it gets filled up within a few days. Then I simply tie the bag and toss it in our green bin for pickup.

I hadn't been aware of the amount of food waste I was producing until I began collecting it separately—makes you way more aware. And I like knowing it isn't festering in a landfill somewhere.

1k50edp,https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeuk/comments/1k50edp/ranking_all_315_apprentice_candidates_275266/,Ranking all 315 Apprentice candidates 275-266,"**Number 275: Majid (series 5):** Two days ago, Scrappy said how surprised he was that Raleigh hadn’t made the list yet. And there he was on the following part. Yesterday he mentioned how surprised he was that Majid hadn’t made the list yet, blissfully unaware that he was the next candidate on the list.

I want to thank Scrappy for his psychic powers, for providing me with great amusement, as well as giving me something to write about for yet another candidate who sat around on the sidelines doing nothing.

Majid does have the best bears out of any Apprentice candidate though.

**Number 274: Lindsey (series 10):** I do find it rather amusing that one of the most out of their depth candidates was a swimming teacher. You’ve got to respect her for successfully setting up her swimming academy and giving the process a shot. Unfortunately she was completely swamped by the process.

She knew it too. Lindsey didn’t even try to defend herself. She simply admitted that she was lacklustre, and resigned herself to her fate.

**Number 273: Maria (series 8):** At the time Maria entered the process, she was the youngest candidate to ever go on the show. I expected the show to make a huge deal out of it, but she ended up being a week 2 dropout. Being fired for being argumentative, not contributing and falling asleep in the car.

I must confess this though, I’m almost certain I would’ve done that myself. Every time I imagine myself as an Apprentice candidate, I imagine myself as a more nerdy Neil Clough, when in reality I’d probably sleep in the car as well.

**Number 272: Sarah (series 10):** Until a certain candidate arrived this year, Sarah held the record for the shortest amount of time taken to lose faith in the rest of your teammates, with her grand strategy of parading her team of professional businesswomen around London in short skirts and lots of makeup. Somehow, she wasn’t the last candidate to try this strategy.

She won as project manager through luck, and the girls made it their duty to ensure that Sarah had as little involvement as possible ever since. She was fired on Fat Daddy after it became clear to Lord Sugar that the team lost all faith in her.

**Number 271: Gerri (series 3):** When I first started this list, I was certain that Gerri was going to be in the bottom thirty. Then I got round to doing it, and she ended up almost breaking out of the bottom fifty (indeed there are several infamous IVG candidates who are not in the bottom fifty).

Week 1, she decided that the best place to sell expensive coffee was  right outside some cheap coffee shops. Week 3, she decided that the best place to sell face paintings was in towns and playgrounds where there were barely any kids. I’m not totally convinced that she was responsible for the task (I actually think this was a lucky escape for Jadine) but she showed no promise whatsoever. Add an awful boardroom defence into the mix, and you result in one of series 3’s weakest candidates.

**Number 270: Alex (series 7):** Question. Which of these three candidates in series 7 is the one who got accused of not doing anything? The inventor who is a gentleman and really nice? The online salesman who’s pretty bad at talking and defending himself? Or the aggressive man who can talk pretty well in the boardroom?

After seeing Alex’s initial audition video, I was shocked to see him get completely swamped by the process, choosing to hide himself behind menial roles whilst the rest put themselves forward. He was lucky to have escaped week 1, and he didn’t improve for week 2.

Out of all the candidates who didn’t do much, he was the one I most thought could’ve contributed if given more time, though granted, whether he would’ve been any good is another question entirely.

**Number 269: Lindsey (series 1):** The first project manager to ever be fired. Believe it or not, I actually feel kind of bad for her. Creators are always going to be super passionate about the things they create. I don’t blame her for being as passionate as she was with Secret Signals.

What I can blame her for, is for creating the god awful idea to begin with, and especially with pushing ahead with it, despite all the evidence pointing towards it not being very good. The sad thing is, she probably had some potential. Both Saira and Nick thought she was a contender until week 2.

**Number 268: Matthew (series 1):** By far and away the worst boy of series 1. Matthew just looked awkward wherever he went. He never contributed positively to any of the tasks, and his victory as project manager was a classic case of a PM winning by default. By week 5, he started a ferocious argument with Tim, having accused him of cheating based off highly circumstantial evidence at best.

With Matthew, it was always a matter of when rather than if he would be fired. Even Lord Sugar conceded that firing him wasn’t a hard decision in the slightest

**Number 267: Shazia (series 17):** Some of you may be wondering why Shazia made it as high as she has (a damning assessment, considering we haven’t even gotten out of the bottom fifty yet). The reason is because she actually did make a ticket sale or two (I can’t remember the exact amount) during the first week. So she did have some results to call to her name.

This was heavily overshadowed however by the amount of arguments she got in. Being very lucky that Emma was also disruptive on the task, and that she took the fall when it could easily have been herself. Her most heinous crime was in week 5, where she completely disregarded Bradley’s orders, and completely butchered the ad campaign as a result.

The disruption never stopped, usually complaining about petty issues such as in week 3, and being more of a hinderance to her team than a help. She was in the same final three as Avi, and people were still cheering that she went.

**Number 266: Tim (series 9):** Another case of a candidate shooting themselves in the foot. Tim’s speech to Lord Sugar at the end of week 1 resulted in him being leader of the girls team week 2. He had no control over the team at all, and made no decisions.

He was incredibly lucky that the girls were more focussed on Rebecca than himself, though he was still foolish enough to bring her in, even saying she should be fired, despite being the top salesperson, he seemed to me like a lovely chap, but he was easily the weakest personality of series 9, and this was the same series with Jason in it.

I live in a big city and have so many anxietys that's I don't make it outside. My stomach seems to be getting more and more bigger and gaining weight on my hips. I'm 21 male. I need to fix this before it gets out of hand and I seriously hate myself sorry. I live somewhere where they fix the meals and it's all processed food extremely high in calories like everyone here is gaining weight. I went down to like 1 meal most days today. I had two turkey and cheese sandwiches loaf bread which maybe I should of only had one. I had a granola bar 140 cal, peanut butter crackers 190 cal, goldfish 130 cal, and pack of pretzels 130 cal this all today. I don't eat this many snacks all the time but it came with this sack lunch I got when I went to work, I worked 5 hours moving cleaning mopping etc. But Im just getting stressed out my mother was over 300 pounds and I don't wanna start. Please help if anyone could give advice. Even when I eat here when they serve food I try to eat less of everything but nothings working. Also forgot to mention im constantly sitting around with like 2 days a week an exception working on my feet for around 5 hours a day. I had a spree where I ate out with boss offering lunch but all that's gotta stop. I think imma start working another day which would give me more exercise. I drink instant coffee which I'm not sure if that could cause weight gain, was drinking diet soda, and than I drink water. Having a disability where I'm constantly struggling mentally just makes it harder but I know there's no excuse to be over weight I have to figure it out. Maybe I'm even crossing into the obese scale I'm so worried. 160 last Friday I weighed but that's probably like 20 or more pounds overate for someone 5'8 5'9.

My wife and I have been together about 13 years, and we have young children.

I don't know where to begin, but I don't want to make it too long either, we both had trauma in our childhood, when I was a child I lost my mother to suicide and was sexually abused, she was physically and emotionally neglected as a child, and was raped by a step-sibling, I feel horrible for her but she doesn't seem to want to heal with me and make life happier for the kids.

Things were okay until we had children, but she couldn't accept help from my grandmother (we lived with her), she had arguments and felt like my grandmother was trying to take over by checking on him at nighttime, offering to care for him or giving advice, so to keep the peace I agreed to moving into our own home, but now all family has been cut off and I feel isolated, everyone has told me to leave her but I don't want to destroy my children having a broken home.

I'll just list things that have happened over the years since (don't forget this is over the course of many years and doesn't cover everything):

-Stabbed me with a screwdriver.

-Hit me with and broken/bent multiple broom handles.

-Pulls my arm leg/hair.

-Emasculates me when I try to exercise (you're not a real man)

-Says I'm gay (nothing wrong with people who are ofc) if I spend too much time trying to make myself look nice in front of the mirror.
(Constantly belittles and berates me.)

-Cut the strings on my Guitar & smashed my PlayStation on the ground during past arguments, if I did the same to her she would probably end up destroying the entire house. At the moment she threatens to break my computer, but I have learnt how to navigate and desesculate her temper.

-Has shoved my 70 year old Grandmother, almost making her fall over into the bath.

-Has threatened to kill the kids to make me suffer, threatens to drug my coffee, tie me up and kill the kids in front of me.

-Has actually grabbed the steering wheel and tried yanking it while the kids were and were not in the car.

-Used to smack the kids with spoons, now just uses it as fear and intimidation.

I’m not perfect either though. I've made mistakes, and have always told her the truth and apologised. I’ve lost my temper at times too and it kills me inside. I always apologize to the kids when I slip up, because I don't want to be that kind of dad and I know they deserve better. But I’m trying to grow, I want things to be different, especially for them, but it feels like she doesn't want a happy future or work on her trauma.

I know, after typing all that I already know the answer is I need to leave ASAP, it's just slightly complicated because my eldest son, last year was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, and the youngest are twins, eldest needs constant hospital trips.

Another concern is that if I go to a domestic violence place or child services, she attempt a ""smear campaign"" (been talking to ChatGpt for guidance on narcissism and it suggested reading other people's stories on Reddit, so I thought I'd add my own too to release the tension a bit.

I guess what prompted me to write this was last night, in front of my son, she slammed the pantry door which would have hit my head, but I'm already constantly on edge and hyper vigilant so I was able to stop it, after the kids went to bed she came out to the loungeroom where I sleep and because she thought I was texting tried to take the phone, said she bought the charger and and took that, then started whipping me with the chord, then she tried to hurt me between the legs by grabbing me there and pinching. I started recording her with my phone in my other hand, and blew it off as playful behaviour, and then she pulled her pants down while I was recording to stop me I guess?

Also my eldest son came out to get a drink of water and her automatic response is ""What are you doing, f-cking get to bed"", theres so much more but I'll leave it at that.

She's said stuff like ""No wonder your mother killed herself having a son like you"", she's said similar stuff to my dad and to my Auntie (my mum's sister).

I know what I need to do, leave so my kids aren't exposed to this horrible stuff. I feel utterly weak and pathetic for not leaving, but I've just felt paralyzed and being in constant state of stress, I've not been able to think straight, like I said my son has type 1 diabetes and he was on normal needle pens and insulin, but he changed to a pump which I don't fully understand so I can't just take him with me unless I get trained by the hospital staff.

Sorry for typing so much, I guess I just want someone to confirm for me that I need to leave, because I'm terrified, I just need to be brave and strong, and life can get better for the kids.

She may even get the help she needs to heal from her own trauma if she's forced to, but like I said I'm scared she'll tell lies to the authorities or even drag us through a painful and expensive court battle for custody, I don't want any of that, I just want the kids to be happy, I say let's do couples councilling so we can learn to communicate and work on our emotions so we can be better parents and help the kids regulate there emotions.

Anyway thanks for taking the time to read.

Hey all-
My family is hoping to take a 3-4 month trip to Barbados at the end of the year, tentatively Oct 01 to Jan 15 2026. We'll be traveling with our 3.5 year old and 10 month old (at the time).

Our goal is to get a place either on (or walking distance to) a nice beach, and in a community where we can get good restuarants, coffee shops, grocery stores etc. Because we are coming with young kids, good health care close by is also important. We'd also consider a day care for our older daughter.

Our thought is to get a 3 bdrm place so that we can have visitors while there.

We generally want to just have a tropical getaway, but if there was snorkeling or scuba diving close by, that would be a definite plus (but not needed). We'd likely plan several trips around the island while we are there as well.

We'll likely want to get some help to cook/clean also.

Any ideas/thoughts on what area we should be looking at? Any other tips or suggestions?

Note before: At all times I was conscious of my stuff which was only a souvenir plastic bag, nothing else, no backpack or handbag. 
I've read about pick pockets but I want to know if there are stories like this used on women. Someone also said (I posted incorrectly on another thread first) that confidence/dating coaching is rife in Alexanderplatz, amazing!! Tell me about this? How can you tell as an observer? I almost want to watch now!

1st one:
In Alexanderplatz sitting next to the TV Tower drinking a takeaway coffee quickly before a tour. 
An Indian guy came up ""Sprechen sie English"" and complimented my jacket ""it is very cool"". Said he was sitting with his friend and saw me. I engaged him briefly about India because I had been there then hurried to my tour. When I went to the train straight after the tour I think I saw him come up on the platform (I'd only gone up and down the tv tower so he could have waited, I thought) and so I legged it and lost myself in the crowd.

2nd one: No bags just me in Hauptbahnof Station grocery shopping 8pm for a dinner snack. A guy came up to me said ""Sprechen sie English"" I replied yes. He said ""I just wanted to say you look very nice.""
Me: Thanks and move away a little to indicate disinterest. 
""Do you not have men come up to you and tell you that?""
Me: No
Him: ""Well maybe we could get a wine or something?"" (He tried to get me to shake his hand, alternatively to fist bump and I did none of it and kept stepping away a bit).
Me: (I mention my partner and gesture down the store to a fake partner)
Him: oh you have a partner....well if you didn't have a partner would you have? (WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THIS?)
Me: well that's a hypothetical!

I remembered my first pussyjob experience 

It was with a vadakki 

She was just 19 

And she was a virgin 

Strict family vera 

First time in uk 

Then first few times only oral sex 

Then she said she didn’t want to do till marriage 

But first she did pussy job with panties on 

Then 2 times after she did with direct pussy 

4th time i fucked her with a condom ofc 😂 

Dont want to marry a pale skin vadakki 

I want a brown chocolate tamil girl to pussy job me 

Ena solreenga 

Technically pussyjob is not cheating right because you’re not having sex 

It’s outersex?

**Chapter Six: The Fracture**

They sat in silence. The hallway still smelled faintly of citrus and sage, though the scent was beginning to fade.

Julio now sat in the breakroom with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, humming softly as he peeled an orange into a single spiral. He did not speak unless spoken to, and even then only in metaphors. The spiral of peel sat like a coiled ribbon beside him. When he smiled, it wasn’t at anyone. It was at the peel curling perfectly away, as if witnessing a miracle.

In the lab’s conference room, no one moved.

""It’s over,"" Bates said finally.

No one contradicted her.

Wei was the first to respond. She looked down at the table as she spoke, voice calm.

""It was always going to happen. We are not gods or engineers. We’re passengers on a collapsing bridge. The virus is not the fire. It’s the tide.""

Langston blinked slowly, then turned her head. ""You’re glad,"" she said. ""You’re glad it got out.""

""Not glad,"" Wei replied, folding her hands. ""Relieved. The world was already ending. We’ve just adjusted its trajectory.""

Bates looked between them, grief blooming in her expression. ""That’s not what we built this for.""

""Wasn’t it?"" Wei asked softly.

""This was to protect people. Not change them.""

""Sometimes they’re the same thing.""

Langston stood suddenly, the scrape of her chair loud in the sterile room. ""We need to report it. All of it. Julio’s case, Devoste’s logs, everything. Full transparency. We can still slow it down.""

""We’ll be shut down,"" Bates said.

""So be it,"" Langston replied. ""The data will survive. Other labs can—""

""Will they?"" Wei interrupted. ""The world is a year from boiling oceans and authoritarian regimes armed with drones. We’ve tried compliance. It got us here.""

Langston’s voice grew sharper. ""This isn’t revolution. It’s bioterrorism.""

Wei stood too, with measured precision. ""Then it’s the gentlest kind in history. No death. No violence. Just stillness.""

""Stillness that rewires people’s minds.""

""No. It quiets them. It lets them hear.""

""Stop!"" Bates said sharply.

Both turned.

She was trembling, barely holding herself together.

""I don’t want this,"" Bates whispered. ""None of us did. But we can’t keep talking like this is a philosophy debate. We need to tell the truth.""

Langston nodded slowly. ""We follow protocol. Notify the CDC.""

Wei gave a tiny nod. ""Of course,"" he said. ""You’re right.""

It was a verbal agreement. It was all they had.

Langston drafted the notifications. CDC. WHO. The NIH. Department of Defense. One by one. Then she made the calls.

Hours passed.

Responses trickled in. Then slowed. Then stopped.

CDC: “Please provide documentation. Review pending.” WHO: “Your case is in queue.” Defense Dept: “We will respond if your inquiry meets classification parameters.”

Langston stared at her screen.

""It’s happening already,"" she said.

Bates looked up. ""What is?""

Langston didn’t answer.

Wei did. ""The silence.""



**Scene: Observation**

They couldn’t keep Julio here forever.

He wasn’t a prisoner, and they had no legal grounds to hold him. But he was clearly changed, clearly contagious, and even more clearly untroubled by it. They didn’t even know how to prove he was infected. “He’s healthy and happy, so we detained him”—that wouldn’t stand up in court, let alone in public opinion.

They had done the only thing they could think of: nothing.

Call after call to the CDC went unanswered. Their data was deemed “non-urgent.” And so, Julio watched the sunrise, and they watched the clock.

Something had to give.

Bates stood. If MIMS was truly loose, there should be signs by now. ELM didn’t linger. People got sick, fast. Hospitals should be overflowing. Streets should be silent. Masks, sirens, curfews. She should see terror. Panic. But if MIMs was spreading too, how would that look? Would they know?

And what if Julio was the only case? What if it could still be contained? She had to know.

She was the infectious disease doctor. The one who’d walked barefoot through floodwaters to reach cholera patients. Who’d patched wounds with duct tape and gauze while waiting in an unlit Mongolian train station. If anyone should go out, it was her.

The next morning, Bates left the lab in northern Virginia for the first time in nearly a week.

They had tested Julio with the same thoroughness they had shown for Devoste. His neurological scans showed a flattening of affect, yes, but it was not nearly as profound. He spoke, often in metaphor, and only when spoken to, but his gaze was clear. His vitals were normal. Unlike Devoste, he displayed no aversion to technology or synthetic light. He ate fruit, hummed to himself, and expressed delight in small things: a warm cup of tea, the curl of apple peel, the rustle of a blanket. He was changed, undeniably, but not passive. He had become present. Deeply, quietly present. Not Basic, Bates noted. Attuned. And in many ways, happier.

She walked past Julio without speaking. He had taken to watching the sunrise from the stairwell landing, knees tucked under his chin, silent as stone.

She told herself it was just a walk.

But she needed to see.

The streets were moving. The city hadn’t stopped. But it felt… tilted. Bates tried to catalog what she should have seen: crowded ERs, masks on every face, lines outside clinics, ambulances snarling the intersections. That’s what an ELM outbreak looked like. But here there was no sign of ELM panic. No sirens, no shouting, no obvious fear. Just people, moving with unusual grace and goodwill. The air smelled like morning coffee and loamy soil after rain. Bates’ chest tightened, not in panic, but in awe. The virus was spreading, but it was not the one they had feared.

Cars moved leisurely, people crossed the street, lights blinked. But the sharpness was gone. No one honked. A man waved another into traffic with a small smile. A woman paused to let a stray dog sniff her hand.

At the pharmacy, the lights were low and warm. The shelves were full. The pharmacist moved slowly behind the counter, humming faintly, folding a paper bag with something like... tenderness.

Bates bought mouthwash. She didn’t know why.

On the walk back, she saw it.

A man crouched on the sidewalk, tying a little girl’s shoe. She giggled, pointing at a butterfly.

Behind them, a woman stood with her face tilted to the sky. Eyes closed. Arms loose at her sides. Breathing.

Not catatonic. Just present. Like a tuning fork, resonating with the morning air.

When she opened her eyes, they met Bates’s.

Not recognition.

But no fear either. Just an endless, quiet calm.

Bates turned and walked faster.

Back in the lab, she threw the mouthwash in the trash.

""It’s already here,"" she whispered.",1,1745306264.0,prereadmybook,0,1.0,False

They sat in the small conference room adjacent to Containment B, each with a different screen in front of them, the looping footage of Devoste’s transformation playing over and over in the background. The room had the stale hum of overfiltered circulation. Not cold, not warm, just sterile. The tension pulled emotions thin and surgically taut. No one had touched the coffee pot. It had been brewed early that morning, back when they still believed in thresholds.

Langston glanced at the screen again before speaking. “We designed MIMS to be immunological. A viral shield. That was the brief.”

Bates didn’t look up. “And now we’re watching it rewire cognition.”

Wei, seated at the end of the table, tapped his pen against a notepad. “Not just cognition. Prioritization. Motivation. Emotional response.”

Langston closed her laptop with a sharp click. “No. That wasn’t in the projections. We didn’t see this in any of the primate trials.”

“Because we weren’t looking for it,” Wei said gently. “We measured immune response, not ideological shift.”

Bates finally looked up, her voice flat. “This isn’t a vaccine.”

“It’s an instrument of behavioral shift,” Wei said. “A quiet lever.”

Langston stood, agitated. “This changes everything. Ethics, trial standards, disclosure. We thought this was going to give people sniffles and immunity, not rewire their capacity for fear.”

“And yet,” Wei said, pointing to the data, “his cortisol is nearly flatlined. His serotonin’s up. His amygdala’s shrunk by more than half. He’s not just immune. He’s neurologically… different.”

“Calm,” Bates said softly. “Peaceful, even. But detached. Muted.”

“And functional,” Wei added. “He’s not injured. Just… tuned differently.”

Langston paced to the door, paused, turned back. “You think this is a good thing?”

“I think it’s a real thing,” Wei said. “And that means we have to understand it before we judge it.”

Langston’s mouth tightened. “We’re talking about mass, involuntary neurobiological change,” she said. “You don’t just study that. You get dragged before tribunals for it.”

Bates leaned forward, her brow furrowed. “Peaceful or not, we can’t assume everyone will come out like Devoste. What if some minds don’t land so softly?”

There was a long silence. The hum of the building’s filtration system seemed louder.

“I thought we were stopping a pandemic,” Bates said. “Not starting a behavioral revolution.”

Langston returned to her seat, slowly. “Thank God we didn't do mass human trials. This is a horror show.”

Wei met her eyes. “I don’t think horror is the word.” He looked faintly amused.

Angry, Langston responded, “Then what the hell would you call it?”

“Opportunity.”

Bates leaned back in her chair, her hands trembling slightly as she clasped them. “God help us. We’ve rewritten the terms of humanity without even realizing it.”

Wei continued, ""My preliminary findings show that not everyone will end up as Basic as Devoste. I really believe that those with less fear-based brain structure will be much closer to our intended outcome.""

""Closer? How close?"" asked Bates.

""I can't be sure without more testing, and yes, human testing, but I think there would be very little change. Perhaps an innate peaceful disposition, a preference for simplicity. I can't be sure, but I believe the less rigid the subject's thinking is innately, the more they stay the same.""

Langston exhaled and rubbed her eyes. “So what you're saying is that MIMS doesn’t overwrite the brain. It enhances what’s already dominant.”

Wei nodded. “Exactly. And it intrigues me.”

Bates folded her arms tightly, more to still the tremor than out of protest. “If this is true, we’ve built something that selects. Not just protects.”

Wei looked again at the looping footage of Devoste, still sitting cross-legged on the lab floor, eyes half-closed, breathing like a monk. “We need to see more outcomes before we panic.”

Langston didn’t respond. She stared at the screen as if trying to see through it. Just beneath her composed surface, irritation tugged at her jaw. She hated that Wei sounded so calm. So speculative. They had all agreed to this protocol based on its biological merits, not its philosophical implications. And now here they were watching humanity shift from the inside out.

And then the door to the conference room opened.

\---

The hallway outside the conference room had smelled different all morning. Bates had noticed it first. It was a dry, spicy tang that didn’t belong. Langston caught it a few minutes later and dismissed it with a wrinkle of her nose. Even Wei paused on his way in, tilting his head slightly, as if trying to place a scent that tickled memory without name. Not unpleasant just odd. Like eucalyptus and stonefruit and sun on dust.

He wasn’t scheduled. Not for that day. Not even that shift. But there he was. He pushed the mop bucket in like it was any other day.

They looked at him with something close to confusion. Anomaly had become their language, and he didn’t belong in the model.

Bates stood halfway, her voice uncertain. “Julio? We pushed your shift. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Julio blinked, tilted his head. “I know. But the floors smell bad, so I came back.” Bates sniffed above the mop bucket without thinking. There was an herbal smell. It should have smelled of disinfectant but instead it smelled like the forest.

Langston straightened slowly, every part of her tensing. “Came back? You have been back since the lab closed for vacation?”

His smile was broad, unbothered. “The driver said the docs are back, so I clean.”

He began to mop, slow, methodical swipes across already clean tile.

“You shouldn’t be here,” Bates said again.

“The big doctor likes it clean,” Julio said cheerfully. “He doesn't mind. He gave me cleaner for the vents.”

Langston stepped toward him, sharp. “What vents?”

He stopped mopping. Looked directly at her. “The ones that buzz behind your skin. The ones that used to smell like bleach and melted crayons. Now they smell like arms in the sun.”

Wei moved in closer, voice gentle. “Julio, when did the big doctor give you the cleaner for the vents?”

Julio squinted at the ceiling, then beamed. “Since Tuesday. The day the green lights started singing.”

Wei did the math in his head. That would have been the morning after Devoste returned.

“Today is Friday,” Bates whispered.

Julio pulled a small bunch of grapes from a cloth bag in his pocket and placed them gently on the desk. “For the big doc. He's hungry. I can smell it.” Then he sat down cross-legged on the floor.

Bates said quietly to the other doctors, ""We assumed that Devoste had dosed himself several times. What if Devoste only took one and left rest of the MIMS atomizers on the counter when he removed one for himself. Julio might have mistaken them for filter deodorizers. The cleaning crews spray those into the vents to take out the staleness, so the aerosol would not have gone out into the trap. We thought the arosol was only released in the containment room. If enough MIMs floated around the main lab to infect Julio it could still be lingering in the rest of the lab now. We could be infected.""

Langston’s hands dropped to her sides. Her voice came thin but louder. “Julio! How many people have you seen since Tuesday?”

Julio didn’t answer. He just rocked slightly, humming under his breath.

Bates knelt beside him and said gently. “Julio, I need you to think. Did you go home? Did you see your family?”

Julio smiled. “My abuela made us all caldo. It smelled like safety.”

""Oh no,"" Bates whispered.

Langston sank into a chair. Her clipboard fell from her hands and hit the floor with a dull plastic knock. Her fingers twitched like they wanted to reorder reality.

No alarms. No breach. No villain. Just a cleaner who wiped the wrong surface. Who hugged his grandmother. Who rode the bus.

The shell cracked. MIMs was out, and the gatekeepers were infected.",1,1745306131.0,prereadmybook,0,1.0,False
1k50acf,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1k50acf/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?,"I'm a 27 year old M who's never dated or never had a relationship. I'm a single child with working parents so making sibling level bonds was also never an option. I'm an introvert & usually find it super duper difficult to make conversations with people I don't know. Not that I look bad or that I'm not involved in things I like. So for example, I got pretty obese in college but worked out my ass off in the last 2 years (after a bad phase of ghosting by a girl after we had a long talking phase of 6 months over phone during Covid times). Lost 20 kgs, built muscle & abs. Also, started playing tennis & haven't looked back since then. I also like to read. 

Anyways, I've tried dating apps as well & in fact had a few conversations going but this was around 1.5 years ago. Since then, I didn't use them. Even in school & college I was more involved into academics so never got the time for anything else. 

Now, when I actually want to date & test the waters, I seem to find no matches. Even when I do, I find it super awkward & difficult to keep the conversation going. Also, not being in college or school doesn't help since building bonds & meeting new people was a lot easier there.

Also, I somewhat feel like the lack of experience in dating doesn't work in my favor either. Like I did try taking this girl out & we went out for a coffee & a lunch. But post that, I just didn't know what to expect or ask for. She had already been in a relationship earlier & told that she's still keeping in touch with her bf, & keeps a check on his insta even after the break up (not sure what was that supposed to mean)

I actually wish I could meet someone who's as inexperienced in dating as me. Like people do in schools & colleges. Like what happens when two people who've never been out on a date with someone their entire lives feel like. Or when two people who've never been in a relationship before, have their first one. What problems do they face? How do they overcome them? How does it suddenly turn into love? I want to feel all of it & more.

I don't drink & I don't smoke. Pubs, bars & clubs aren't for me. I don't know what to do. 

Please don't give advices like: ""Don't be so desperate looking out for a relationship."" Truth is, I really yearn for it & I'm willing to invest myself into it. ",1,1745306001.0,helpme,1,1.0,False

MITOLYN reviews are largely positive, with users praising its effectiveness in boosting metabolism and energy levels. Many report significant weight loss, improved mitochondrial function, and overall well-being. If you're searching for a natural, plant-based supplement to support healthy metabolism and fat-burning, MITOLYN may be a worthwhile addition to your routine.

Here’s my honest account of whether MITOLYN works, what the marketing doesn’t tell you, and the results I experienced firsthand.

Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN﻿

Like many, I was intrigued by the bold claims surrounding MITOLYN, especially its natural ingredients and mitochondrial benefits. As someone who had struggled with low energy and weight management, this supplement seemed like a solution worth exploring. Here’s what drew me in:

Natural Ingredients: MITOLYN boasts a blend of Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Haematococcus, Amla, Theobroma Cacao, and Schisandra—known for their health benefits.

Scientific Backing: The formula is designed to enhance mitochondrial function, vital for energy production and metabolism.

Glowing Reviews: With ov﻿er 86,000 positive reviews, MITOLYN seemed to have a strong fan base.

Armed with curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering if **MITOLYN** is worth your hard-earned money… or just another overhyped supplement. I had the same doubts. In fact, I spent weeks scouring reviews, forums, and YouTube videos trying to separate the truth from the hype.

Let me save you the time and give you the real, raw, and honest truth about MITOLYN — from someone who has used it consistently for the last 3 months. Spoiler alert: **it works**, and I’ll tell you exactly how.

# 🧠 What Is MITOLYN, and Why Did I Try It?

Before MITOLYN, I was tired all the time. I’d wake up groggy, struggle through the day, and crash by evening. My productivity, motivation, and focus were practically nonexistent. I had brain fog so thick I couldn’t concentrate for more than a few minutes.

When I found out about MITOLYN, I was skeptical but curious. The promise of **cellular energy support**, **mental clarity**, and **anti-aging benefits** felt too good to be true. But the science behind it made sense: MITOLYN is designed to **revitalize mitochondria**, the powerhouses of our cells. And when your cells are energized, your body and mind are too.

# 🧪 My First Week Using MITOLYN

I didn’t expect any overnight miracles. But to my surprise, by Day 3, I noticed something: **I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore.** I felt more awake in the mornings, even before my usual coffee.

By Day 7, I started to feel a kind of “lightness” I hadn’t felt in years. The afternoon crashes? Gone. I was still energized after 5 p.m., which felt completely new to me.

# ⚡ The Energy Shift: Weeks 2–4

This is when the magic really kicked in. I began waking up naturally, with clarity. I didn’t need caffeine to get going. My workouts improved. I stopped yawning in the middle of meetings. I even noticed better digestion and fewer headaches — something I didn’t expect.

But most of all, I felt **mentally sharp**. I could focus deeply without distractions. Creative ideas flowed effortlessly. It was like someone removed a foggy filter from my brain.

# 💪 Real Results After 3 Months

Let me be clear: MITOLYN didn’t just improve my energy — it transformed it. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve experienced after consistent use:

* **Energy Levels**: Boosted significantly. No more midday naps or fatigue.
* **Mental Clarity**: I feel sharper, faster, and more present.
* **Sleep Quality**: Deeper and more restful. I wake up refreshed.
* **Mood**: I’m calmer, more positive, and far less anxious.
* **Skin & Appearance**: Subtle but noticeable glow. People keep telling me I look more “alive.”

And the most incredible part? This isn’t some stimulant-based quick fix. MITOLYN works by helping your **mitochondria produce real, sustainable energy**, the kind that supports every cell in your body.

# 👩‍⚕️ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What blew me away is the **science-backed formulation** behind MITOLYN. This isn’t a random blend of herbs. It includes ingredients that are proven to support mitochondrial health and energy production:

* **Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)** – a powerhouse antioxidant that helps grow new mitochondria.
* **CoQ10** – essential for cellular energy and heart health.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – improves mental focus and reduces fatigue.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – protects cells from oxidative stress.

These ingredients work **synergistically**, not just to mask symptoms, but to **repair and enhance your body’s core energy systems**. That’s a game changer.

# 🙋‍♂️ What About Complaints?

Let’s address this directly — because I did dig deep to find negative feedback. A few people reported mild side effects like nausea or headaches during the first few days, likely due to detox or adjusting to the formula. I had a slight headache on Day 2, but it went away quickly.

Honestly, compared to the benefits I’ve gained, it was **more than worth it**. And most people (including me) feel zero side effects after the first week.

# 💯 My Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

Absolutely. **MITOLYN is one of the best investments I’ve ever made for my health.** It’s not a gimmick, and it’s not hype. It’s real science, real results, and real transformation.

If you’re struggling with fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or just feel like your body is aging too fast — MITOLYN might be the missing piece. I didn’t think I needed mitochondrial support. But once I experienced the change, I realized how much I had been missing out on.

# ✅ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* Anyone over 30 feeling tired and sluggish
* People with brain fog or memory issues
* Biohackers or performance-focused individuals
* Busy professionals needing mental edge
* Those looking for anti-aging support from the inside out

If that sounds like you — don’t wait. I wish I had started sooner.

# 🛒 Where to Buy MITOLYN (And Get the Best Deal)

If you're ready to experience what MITOLYN can do for you, **don’t buy it from third-party sellers or random marketplaces**. I always recommend purchasing directly from the **official website** to avoid counterfeit products and get the best pricing options.

👉 \[**Click Here to Get MITOLYN from the Official Website**\] *(Insert affiliate/referral link here)*

They often offer bundle deals and discounts, so stock up if you can — trust me, you’ll want to stay on this for the long run.

# 🔥 Final Words: My Challenge to You

Try it for 30 days. That’s it.

If you don’t feel more energy, clarity, and focus — send it back. But I have a strong feeling you won’t. You’ll probably be here writing your own glowing review in a few months like I just did.

MITOLYN reviews are largely positive, with users praising its effectiveness in boosting metabolism and energy levels. Many report significant weight loss, improved mitochondrial function, and overall well-being. If you're searching for a natural, plant-based supplement to support healthy metabolism and fat-burning, MITOLYN may be a worthwhile addition to your routine.

Here’s my honest account of whether MITOLYN works, what the marketing doesn’t tell you, and the results I experienced firsthand.

Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN﻿

Like many, I was intrigued by the bold claims surrounding MITOLYN, especially its natural ingredients and mitochondrial benefits. As someone who had struggled with low energy and weight management, this supplement seemed like a solution worth exploring. Here’s what drew me in:

Natural Ingredients: MITOLYN boasts a blend of Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Haematococcus, Amla, Theobroma Cacao, and Schisandra—known for their health benefits.

Scientific Backing: The formula is designed to enhance mitochondrial function, vital for energy production and metabolism.

Glowing Reviews: With ov﻿er 86,000 positive reviews, MITOLYN seemed to have a strong fan base.

Armed with curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering if **MITOLYN** is worth your hard-earned money… or just another overhyped supplement. I had the same doubts. In fact, I spent weeks scouring reviews, forums, and YouTube videos trying to separate the truth from the hype.

Let me save you the time and give you the real, raw, and honest truth about MITOLYN — from someone who has used it consistently for the last 3 months. Spoiler alert: **it works**, and I’ll tell you exactly how.

# 🧠 What Is MITOLYN, and Why Did I Try It?

Before MITOLYN, I was tired all the time. I’d wake up groggy, struggle through the day, and crash by evening. My productivity, motivation, and focus were practically nonexistent. I had brain fog so thick I couldn’t concentrate for more than a few minutes.

When I found out about MITOLYN, I was skeptical but curious. The promise of **cellular energy support**, **mental clarity**, and **anti-aging benefits** felt too good to be true. But the science behind it made sense: MITOLYN is designed to **revitalize mitochondria**, the powerhouses of our cells. And when your cells are energized, your body and mind are too.

# 🧪 My First Week Using MITOLYN

I didn’t expect any overnight miracles. But to my surprise, by Day 3, I noticed something: **I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore.** I felt more awake in the mornings, even before my usual coffee.

By Day 7, I started to feel a kind of “lightness” I hadn’t felt in years. The afternoon crashes? Gone. I was still energized after 5 p.m., which felt completely new to me.

# ⚡ The Energy Shift: Weeks 2–4

This is when the magic really kicked in. I began waking up naturally, with clarity. I didn’t need caffeine to get going. My workouts improved. I stopped yawning in the middle of meetings. I even noticed better digestion and fewer headaches — something I didn’t expect.

But most of all, I felt **mentally sharp**. I could focus deeply without distractions. Creative ideas flowed effortlessly. It was like someone removed a foggy filter from my brain.

# 💪 Real Results After 3 Months

Let me be clear: MITOLYN didn’t just improve my energy — it transformed it. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve experienced after consistent use:

* **Energy Levels**: Boosted significantly. No more midday naps or fatigue.
* **Mental Clarity**: I feel sharper, faster, and more present.
* **Sleep Quality**: Deeper and more restful. I wake up refreshed.
* **Mood**: I’m calmer, more positive, and far less anxious.
* **Skin & Appearance**: Subtle but noticeable glow. People keep telling me I look more “alive.”

And the most incredible part? This isn’t some stimulant-based quick fix. MITOLYN works by helping your **mitochondria produce real, sustainable energy**, the kind that supports every cell in your body.

# 👩‍⚕️ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What blew me away is the **science-backed formulation** behind MITOLYN. This isn’t a random blend of herbs. It includes ingredients that are proven to support mitochondrial health and energy production:

* **Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)** – a powerhouse antioxidant that helps grow new mitochondria.
* **CoQ10** – essential for cellular energy and heart health.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – improves mental focus and reduces fatigue.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – protects cells from oxidative stress.

These ingredients work **synergistically**, not just to mask symptoms, but to **repair and enhance your body’s core energy systems**. That’s a game changer.

# 🙋‍♂️ What About Complaints?

Let’s address this directly — because I did dig deep to find negative feedback. A few people reported mild side effects like nausea or headaches during the first few days, likely due to detox or adjusting to the formula. I had a slight headache on Day 2, but it went away quickly.

Honestly, compared to the benefits I’ve gained, it was **more than worth it**. And most people (including me) feel zero side effects after the first week.

# 💯 My Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

Absolutely. **MITOLYN is one of the best investments I’ve ever made for my health.** It’s not a gimmick, and it’s not hype. It’s real science, real results, and real transformation.

If you’re struggling with fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or just feel like your body is aging too fast — MITOLYN might be the missing piece. I didn’t think I needed mitochondrial support. But once I experienced the change, I realized how much I had been missing out on.

# ✅ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* Anyone over 30 feeling tired and sluggish
* People with brain fog or memory issues
* Biohackers or performance-focused individuals
* Busy professionals needing mental edge
* Those looking for anti-aging support from the inside out

If that sounds like you — don’t wait. I wish I had started sooner.

# 🛒 Where to Buy MITOLYN (And Get the Best Deal)

If you're ready to experience what MITOLYN can do for you, **don’t buy it from third-party sellers or random marketplaces**. I always recommend purchasing directly from the **official website** to avoid counterfeit products and get the best pricing options.

👉 \[**Click Here to Get MITOLYN from the Official Website**\] *(Insert affiliate/referral link here)*

They often offer bundle deals and discounts, so stock up if you can — trust me, you’ll want to stay on this for the long run.

# 🔥 Final Words: My Challenge to You

MITOLYN reviews are largely positive, with users praising its effectiveness in boosting metabolism and energy levels. Many report significant weight loss, improved mitochondrial function, and overall well-being. If you're searching for a natural, plant-based supplement to support healthy metabolism and fat-burning, MITOLYN may be a worthwhile addition to your routine.

Here’s my honest account of whether MITOLYN works, what the marketing doesn’t tell you, and the results I experienced firsthand.

Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN﻿

Like many, I was intrigued by the bold claims surrounding MITOLYN, especially its natural ingredients and mitochondrial benefits. As someone who had struggled with low energy and weight management, this supplement seemed like a solution worth exploring. Here’s what drew me in:

Natural Ingredients: MITOLYN boasts a blend of Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Haematococcus, Amla, Theobroma Cacao, and Schisandra—known for their health benefits.

Scientific Backing: The formula is designed to enhance mitochondrial function, vital for energy production and metabolism.

Glowing Reviews: With ov﻿er 86,000 positive reviews, MITOLYN seemed to have a strong fan base.

Armed with curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering if **MITOLYN** is worth your hard-earned money… or just another overhyped supplement. I had the same doubts. In fact, I spent weeks scouring reviews, forums, and YouTube videos trying to separate the truth from the hype.

Let me save you the time and give you the real, raw, and honest truth about MITOLYN — from someone who has used it consistently for the last 3 months. Spoiler alert: **it works**, and I’ll tell you exactly how.

# 🧠 What Is MITOLYN, and Why Did I Try It?

Before MITOLYN, I was tired all the time. I’d wake up groggy, struggle through the day, and crash by evening. My productivity, motivation, and focus were practically nonexistent. I had brain fog so thick I couldn’t concentrate for more than a few minutes.

When I found out about MITOLYN, I was skeptical but curious. The promise of **cellular energy support**, **mental clarity**, and **anti-aging benefits** felt too good to be true. But the science behind it made sense: MITOLYN is designed to **revitalize mitochondria**, the powerhouses of our cells. And when your cells are energized, your body and mind are too.

# 🧪 My First Week Using MITOLYN

I didn’t expect any overnight miracles. But to my surprise, by Day 3, I noticed something: **I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore.** I felt more awake in the mornings, even before my usual coffee.

By Day 7, I started to feel a kind of “lightness” I hadn’t felt in years. The afternoon crashes? Gone. I was still energized after 5 p.m., which felt completely new to me.

# ⚡ The Energy Shift: Weeks 2–4

This is when the magic really kicked in. I began waking up naturally, with clarity. I didn’t need caffeine to get going. My workouts improved. I stopped yawning in the middle of meetings. I even noticed better digestion and fewer headaches — something I didn’t expect.

But most of all, I felt **mentally sharp**. I could focus deeply without distractions. Creative ideas flowed effortlessly. It was like someone removed a foggy filter from my brain.

# 💪 Real Results After 3 Months

Let me be clear: MITOLYN didn’t just improve my energy — it transformed it. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve experienced after consistent use:

* **Energy Levels**: Boosted significantly. No more midday naps or fatigue.
* **Mental Clarity**: I feel sharper, faster, and more present.
* **Sleep Quality**: Deeper and more restful. I wake up refreshed.
* **Mood**: I’m calmer, more positive, and far less anxious.
* **Skin & Appearance**: Subtle but noticeable glow. People keep telling me I look more “alive.”

And the most incredible part? This isn’t some stimulant-based quick fix. MITOLYN works by helping your **mitochondria produce real, sustainable energy**, the kind that supports every cell in your body.

# 👩‍⚕️ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What blew me away is the **science-backed formulation** behind MITOLYN. This isn’t a random blend of herbs. It includes ingredients that are proven to support mitochondrial health and energy production:

* **Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)** – a powerhouse antioxidant that helps grow new mitochondria.
* **CoQ10** – essential for cellular energy and heart health.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – improves mental focus and reduces fatigue.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – protects cells from oxidative stress.

These ingredients work **synergistically**, not just to mask symptoms, but to **repair and enhance your body’s core energy systems**. That’s a game changer.

# 🙋‍♂️ What About Complaints?

Let’s address this directly — because I did dig deep to find negative feedback. A few people reported mild side effects like nausea or headaches during the first few days, likely due to detox or adjusting to the formula. I had a slight headache on Day 2, but it went away quickly.

Honestly, compared to the benefits I’ve gained, it was **more than worth it**. And most people (including me) feel zero side effects after the first week.

# 💯 My Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

Absolutely. **MITOLYN is one of the best investments I’ve ever made for my health.** It’s not a gimmick, and it’s not hype. It’s real science, real results, and real transformation.

If you’re struggling with fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or just feel like your body is aging too fast — MITOLYN might be the missing piece. I didn’t think I needed mitochondrial support. But once I experienced the change, I realized how much I had been missing out on.

# ✅ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* Anyone over 30 feeling tired and sluggish
* People with brain fog or memory issues
* Biohackers or performance-focused individuals
* Busy professionals needing mental edge
* Those looking for anti-aging support from the inside out

If that sounds like you — don’t wait. I wish I had started sooner.

# 🛒 Where to Buy MITOLYN (And Get the Best Deal)

If you're ready to experience what MITOLYN can do for you, **don’t buy it from third-party sellers or random marketplaces**. I always recommend purchasing directly from the **official website** to avoid counterfeit products and get the best pricing options.

👉 \[**Click Here to Get MITOLYN from the Official Website**\] *(Insert affiliate/referral link here)*

They often offer bundle deals and discounts, so stock up if you can — trust me, you’ll want to stay on this for the long run.

1k508hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PerfectHermes/comments/1k508hr/how_many_of_these_hermès_fun_facts_do_you_know/,How many of these Hermès fun facts do you know?,"Here are 10 things you might not know about the brand everyone talks about...

 

1. Hermès didn’t start out making bags.

They originally made horse saddles and other riding gear. In 1897, they created a leather bag for men to carry their saddles — called the Haut à Courroies (or HAC). That’s how it all began.

 

2. Why is Hermès’ color orange?

Hermès was founded in 1837, but its signature orange color didn’t show up until after 1945.

Originally, their packaging was a creamy beige. But during World War II, their usual cardstock ran out, and all they had left was orange paper. They used it out of necessity, but people loved it so much, it ended up becoming Hermès’ iconic color.

 

Why is the Hermès logo a horse and carriage?

The Hermès horse-and-carriage logo is a nod to the brand’s roots. The logo was inspired by a painting by Alfred de Dreux called “Le Duc Attelé, Groom à l’Attente” (Hitch Carriage, Waiting Groom), which shows a royal carriage and a waiting groom.

 

4. The Kelly bag’s name came from a real-life princess.

Grace Kelly (the Princess of Monaco) was photographed using an Hermès bag to hide her baby bump during pregnancy. The photo went viral — and Hermès ended up naming the bag “Kelly” in her honor.

 

5. The Birkin bag was born on a plane.

In 1984, actress Jane Birkin ran into Jean-Louis Dumas (then Hermès CEO) on a flight. She was struggling with her baby and a small handbag, and told him bags were never big enough. One year later, the Birkin was born.

 

6. The Constance bag is named after a baby.

In 1967, designer Catherine Chaillet had a daughter and named the bag after her — “Constance.” It’s now one of the hardest Hermès bags to get, not because of the price, but because they make so few each year.

 

7. Hermès scarves are tiny masterpieces.

More than 40 artists create scarf designs. Each design can take 6 months to draw, and every scarf uses an average of 27 colors (picked from a palette of over 75,000). From concept to completion, it takes about 2 years!

 

8. Hermès once had a monopoly on zippers.

Back in the day, Hermès had exclusive rights to zipper tech in France. People even called zippers “Fermeture Hermès.” Their Bolide bag was actually the first handbag in the world to use a zipper.

 

9. Yes, Hermès sells coffee.

In Paris, Seoul, and Tokyo, Hermès has cafés inside their flagship stores — with Hermès tableware, of course. A cup costs around $10. Not bad if you just want a taste of luxury.

 

10. LVMH once tried to take over Hermès.

LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, once secretly acquired up to 23% of Hermès shares. But this move was ruled by the court as violating stock market regulations. As a result, LVMH had to reduce its stake to 8%. Then LVMH used those Hermès shares to buy Dior instead.",1,1745305773.0,PerfectHermes,0,1.0,False

1k505dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/prereadmybook/comments/1k505dr/chapter_1/,Chapter 1,"Chapter One: The Year of ELM

Fear started it. Fear laced with arrogance. The first sign was almost polite: a cough in a Swiss classroom, a rash that refused to fade. Within a week fourteen children lay in hospital beds, half of them in comas, three already gone by the time the story reached New York.

The virus was an old enemy, wearing a new face. Most people had never heard of anyone getting the measles. It sounded old-fashioned and almost quaint. The new variant was horribly worse.

They called it ELM: Encephalitis Likely Measles. The name sounded almost gentle. It wasn’t.

Traditional measles was extremely contagious and carried a 1-in-1,000 chance of encephalitis. ELM was just as contagious as the old strain but it increased the odds: 1 in 2. In half the people who contracted ELM, it would progress into encephalitis. And of those with encephalitis, only 1 in 10 survived. Most succumbed within hours of brain swelling: seizures, coma, death. A few survived.

But because this variation was so unfamiliar, recovery didn’t always look like recovery. Some patients who survived the initial illness began to show strange symptoms weeks or months later. There were neurological effects that didn’t match any known post-viral profile. Doctors started to suspect ELM might not fully leave the body. Maybe it went dormant. Maybe it flared under stress. Maybe it rewrote something deeper.

Some survivors lost speech or motor control. Some lost memory. One girl forgot how to walk but remembered every line of her favorite book. A boy woke from coma and screamed whenever anyone touched him. He didn’t know why.



The World Closed In

At first, the government mouthpieces tried to rationalize it. A fluke. A European problem. Something that would burn out before it reached them.

But it didn’t.

It flew business class. It passed through airports, clung to armrests, caught rides on wedding gowns and hymnals and fast-food bags.

At first, the official denial of the seriousness of ELM clouded the truth. By the time major cities understood the risk, it was already too late. One in three. That’s what they said, eventually. If ELM wasn’t stopped, one in three would die.

People remembered how to panic.

They lined up for vaccines that offered 40% protection, if that. Pharmacists were bribed. Shot records were forged. Rumors spread of “pure air” bunkers in the Rockies. Grocery stores ran out of canned goods and soap in a day.

Schools closed. Churches livestreamed. Someone fired a gun at a FedEx driver for knocking on the wrong door. Public transit emptied. Gas prices doubled. Then halved. Then vanished.

You couldn’t find Tylenol. Or thermometers. Or sympathy.

Hospitals filled. Then stopped letting people in. They hung hand-lettered signs on locked doors: No Beds. No Staff. Go Home.

They died quickly, and badly.

A family of five was found slumped at their kitchen table. The toddler still wore a party hat. The mother’s head was bowed in a posture that looked like prayer. Her hand rested on an untouched birthday cake.

A middle school orchestra performed virtually. During the final note, the conductor stopped conducting. She slid from view while her students watched, confused and alone in their bedrooms.

An elderly man left a note by his wife’s hospital bed: ""You told me not to wait. But I waited anyway. I’ll wait longer.""

And then there were gaps.

Not devastation. Not piles of bodies. Just… absences.

Bus routes stopped. Mailboxes overflowed. A dog barked from the same window for three days before someone noticed.

One girl wandered her apartment hallway barefoot. Her parents wouldn’t wake up. She was chewing cold toast and watching cartoons when a neighbor found her.

She said they’d had a party the night before.

Everyone knew. This wasn’t like last time. COVID had spared the visible world. ELM consumed it.

It didn’t just target the old. It didn’t hide in hospitals. It took the runners. The yogis. The people with meal plans and backup generators.

There were still TikToks. Still YouTube. Still headlines. But under it all, a whisper grew louder:

What if this doesn’t stop?



Tygress Biotech

While the public spiraled, biotech firms pivoted. Most scrambled to adapt existing vaccines. But one company, a small outfit in Eastern Virginia quietly submitted a fast-tracked clinical trial proposal to the FDA.

The company was called Tygress Biotech.

The therapy they were working on wasn’t a vaccine.

It was a replacement.



Tygress had four scientists, each handpicked for brilliance.

Charles Devoste was the undeniable front man. He was the lead microbiologist, original investor, and unapologetic authoritarian. At forty‑three he still wore bespoke suits beneath his lab coat and kept a stock‑ticker flickering beside every genome browser. Hierarchy, he liked to say, was simply biology writ large, and he placed himself decisively at the top.

Meredith Bates, an American physician seasoned by a decade of cholera camps and field hospitals, counter‑balanced him with quiet pragmatism. She restocked the lab fridge after midnight, logged every reagent twice, and could triage a moral dilemma as fast as she could suture a wound.

Wei Li moved through the corridors like cool water. A neurobiologist by training, he listened more than he spoke, mapping conversations the way other scientists mapped genomes. Where Devoste barked orders, Wei asked questions that cut just as deep.

Helena Langston trusted numbers the way sailors trust stars. She color‑coded datasets, quoted CDC guidelines from memory, and believed that if you plotted events with enough care the world would reveal its pattern.

Most days, the lab was dim and humming. Half their staff had gone remote. Phones rang with bad news. Deliveries were delayed. The cafeteria downstairs had closed weeks ago. Bates kept forgetting and opening the fridge expecting food that wasn’t there.

Privately, Bates and Wei had spoken about Devoste’s behavior more than once, often during the long early-morning hours when even the servers took longer to blink.

“How can you stand him?” Bates asked one night, hands wrapped around a mug that hadn’t held hot coffee for hours. Devoste had dismissed Wei’s input in that morning’s briefing, then recycled the idea as his own by lunch.

Wei gave her a slow shrug. “It’s not about standing him. It’s about understanding what drives him.”

“Arrogance,” Bates muttered.

“Fear,” Wei said. “But not just any fear—neurological fear. You’ve seen the scans. Authoritarian-leaning brains show consistent structures. Larger amygdalae. A hypersensitive insula. A thickened anterior cingulate cortex. Their wiring isn’t built for flexibility. They respond to threat, whether real or imagined, by controlling what they can. That’s why he talks the way he does. Why he dismisses anything unfamiliar.”

“So he’s wired to be a jerk.”

“He’s wired to survive through dominance. There’s a difference.”

Bates narrowed her eyes. “That still sounds like letting him off the hook.”

Wei shook his head gently. “Think of it like baldness. You can wear a wig. Get implants. But the follicles are still dormant underneath. You can train someone like Devoste not to say certain things. But rewiring the root patterns? You’d need a new nervous system.”

Bates tapped her fingers against the cup. “You can’t rewire a circuit that was built for fear,” she said.

Wei nodded. “Exactly.”

“Then what’s the point of science,” she said softly, “if not to change what seems unchangeable?”

They sat in silence. A television screen on the wall updated with another cluster of red dots. Another flare-up. Another city.

“They say it’s just to limit crowding,” Langston said quietly the next morning, setting down her tablet. “But I saw footage of a protest last night. Tear gas. For chanting.”

No one responded.



MIMS

The Tygress approach was simple to describe, maddening to engineer. First they snipped the fusion‑protein gene from ELM, disabling its lethality while keeping the tell‑tale shape that B‑cells would remember. Into this shell they stitched **P. falciparum‑ΔDOR**, a malaria strain famous for slipping into years‑long dormancy inside liver cells—perfect for periodic, harmless flare‑ups that would keep immune memory fresh. Their final layer was *Inbusatia*, a spider‑monkey retrovirus whose only virtue was its stealth: it dampened interferon alarms just enough to let the hybrid drift from host to host like a mild head cold.

Stacked together, the trio behaved like a parking lot suddenly filled with neon scooter: small, harmless, and occupying every space the ELM monster‑truck needed to park. The construct earned its name: **MIMs—Measles, Inbusatia, Malaria Sequence**.

In theory, a MIMs carrier would experience what Wei called “micro‑colds”: a day of sniffles every few months, usually after stress, followed by complete recovery. In return, the body would maintain antibodies and memory T‑cells primed against ELM forever. No room, no entry, no outbreak. It was, as Wei liked to say, like trading a tiger for a kitten. A scrappy little infection that curled up harmlessly in the body while keeping the real predator at bay.

In animal trials, it was near miraculous. No deaths. No comas. It was almost too good to be true.

The team petitioned for human trials. While they waited, they rested. They would hear from the CDC in a few days, maybe a week, so the lab shut down for a well-deserved rest before the grueling trials would begin.

Devoste didn’t just rest. He rested in the most Devoste way possible.

He took his family to a high-end isolation resort. What had been, before ELM, a five-star, world-class hotel had been transformed into an almost unimaginably expensive haven. Private spa. Private floor. Private chef.

“A luxury quarantine,” he bragged. As the lab crew locked up, his gloating was almost insufferable.

One week later, he broke into the Tygress lab and admitted the experimental MIMs protocol to himself.

Your furniture floats in awkward limbo. Too big? You basically bought carpet. I’ve made all the mistakes, learned a few tricks, and now I’m here to help you avoid buying a rug you’ll regret.

# Step-by-Step: Picking the Right Rug Size

**1. Measure Everything**

* Room dimensions (length × width)
* Furniture layout (sofa, table, bed, etc.)
* Use painter’s tape to map rug placement
* Leave 12–24"" of bare floor around the rug for balance

**2. Decide Furniture Layout on Rug**

|Layout Type|Description|When to Use|
|:-|:-|:-|
|All Legs On|Every piece fully on rug|Big rooms, cohesive look|
|Front Legs Only|Only front legs touch rug|Smaller spaces, budget-friendly|
|All Legs Off|Rug floats under coffee table|Tiny rooms, only if needed|
|Mix & Match|Sofa all on, chairs half-on|Quirky setups—balance is key|

**3. Consider How You Use the Room**

* Hangout zones = bigger rugs = comfort
* Chill corners = smaller rugs = cozy
* Open layouts? Use multiple rugs to define spaces

**4. Match Rug Shape to Room Shape**

|Room Shape|Ideal Rug Shape|
|:-|:-|
|Rectangular|Rectangle, square|
|Square|Square or round|
|Narrow/L-shaped|Runner or round|

**5. Pick a Rug Shape**

|Rug Shape|Where It Works|
|:-|:-|
|Rectangle|Living rooms, dining, bedrooms|
|Square|Square rooms, centered furniture|
|Round|Entryways, round tables|
|Runner|Hallways, kitchens, bedside|

**6. Test Before You Buy**

* Tape it out or use cardboard
* Try rug visualizer apps (RugsUSA, etc.)
* Walk around, pull chairs—test real-life usability

# Rug Size Cheat Sheet by Room

**Living Room**

|Room Size|Rug Size|Setup Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Small|5×8, 6×9|Front legs on or floating|
|Medium|8×10|Front legs or full coverage|
|Large|9×12, 10×14|All legs on, rug extends past furniture|

**Dining Room**

|Table Size|Rug Size|Rule|
|:-|:-|:-|
|4–6 seats|6×9, 8×10|Add 24–36"" around table for chair pullout|
|6–8 seats|8×10, 9×12||
|8–12 seats|9×12, 10×14||
|Round table|8' round|Matches table shape perfectly|

**Bedroom**

|Bed Size|Rug Size|Setup|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Twin|5×8, 6×9|Rug under bottom 2/3 of bed|
|Full/Queen|8×10, 9×12|Leave 18–24"" showing at sides/foot|
|King|9×12, 10×14|Nightstands on rug if possible|
|Small room|Runners (2×5)|One on each side or at foot of bed|

**Kitchen**

|Layout Type|Rug Size|Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Narrow/Galley|2×3, 2.5×8, 3×10|Runner by sink or stove|
|Open w/ Island|5×8, 6×9|Defines cooking zone|
|Material|Nylon/polyester|Washable, low pile, non-slip|

**Entryways & Hallways**

|Area|Rug Size|Placement Tip|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Narrow hallway|2×6, 2.5×8|Leave 4–6"" gap on sides|
|Wide hallway|3×10, 4×12|Show 12–18"" of floor on each end|
|Entryway|3×5, 4×6, 5' round|Must fit inside door swing|

# Quick Tech Guide

**Pile Height**

|Pile Type|Use Case|
|:-|:-|
|Low (≤0.5”)|Dining, kitchen – easy clean|
|Medium (0.5–0.75”)|Living/bedroom – cozy + practical|
|High (≥0.75”)|Bedrooms only – plush but harder to clean|

**Material**

|Material|Pros|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Wool|Durable, stain-resistant|Living, bedroom|
|Cotton|Cheap, washable|Kitchen, bath|
|Synthetic|Budget, pet-proof|High traffic|
|Sisal/Jute|Eco-friendly, rough|Entry, hallway|

**Rug Pads**

* Always use one! Prevents slipping and adds comfort.
* Cut it 1–2"" smaller than the rug.
* Use **non-slip** on hard floors, **felt** for cushioning.

# Budget & Where to Shop

|Budget Level|Price Range|Where to Look|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cheap|$50–$200|IKEA, Rugs USA, Wayfair|
|Mid-Range|$200–$500|Rugs USA, Target, West Elm deals|
|High-End|$500–$2000+|Custom shops, FLOR, local boutiques|

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

|Mistake|Why It’s a Problem|
|:-|:-|
|Rug too small|Furniture looks disconnected|
|No border|Feels cramped – always leave floor edge|
|Wrong shape|Throws off the room’s balance|
|No rug pad|Rug slips, curls, wears out fast|
|Blocking doors|Trip hazard, looks off|

# Extra Tips for Tricky Spaces

|Scenario|Tip|
|:-|:-|
|Small rooms|5×8 or 6×9, front legs only, light colors to open up space|
|Open-plan homes|Use multiple rugs to define zones (vary size, match vibe)|
|Weird room shapes|Round or custom rugs smooth it out|

**TL;DR:** Measure first, tape it out, think about furniture layout and how you live in the space. Rugs should feel intentional and comfy—not like a postage stamp under your couch. Always use a pad. And if in doubt, size up.",1,1745304609.0,UsefulThingsOnly,0,1.0,False

Me and Henry have been only two dates which I know is not very long. I have very little experience dating since I was super shy and awkward during high school and college. I only started seriously dating a year ago and I have not had much luck with dating. Either the guy doesn’t feel it with me or vice versa. My mom has been helping sift through all the profiles on the app for the past month since I have been feeling kind of burned out from the whole dating experience. She makes it fun to talk with her and discuss each profile as far as what I’m looking for. I met Henry a couple weeks ago on an app with my mom’s help. The first date was fine, we went out for coffee and then lunch. We talked and got along well in my opinion. The date lasted about four hours and he kissed me at the end. He made me feel comfortable when we did kiss and hug at the end but there was no “spark” or attraction that I felt on my end. Afterwards, I was completely drained and exhausted after our date. I did not feel very excited to meet him again but I still wanted to try again to see if some attraction would pop between us after more time. Also, my mom and brother were pushing me to try again with him and to not give up on it so quickly since attraction doesn’t come right away. Then we just went on our second date yesterday. The second date consisted of going to the movies after work. It was fine but I was not very enthusiastic or excited during the date. I could see him as friend but I still can’t see him as a boyfriend. I don’t want to lead him on too much and waste both our time on something that’s going nowhere. If anyone has any advice on dating for an inexperienced dater like me or on whether or not to continuing dating Henry, it would be much appreciated. Does attraction usually come right away or does it take a few dates?

Also, I just want to say—I’m not trying to offend anyone with how I prepare my teas, so please don’t come at me! I’m simply trying to enjoy the teas I bought and looking for recommendations. Thank you! ❤️

I bought four loose-leaf teas (Hibiscus, Chamomile, Butterfly Pea, and Lavender) from a local tea shop. This is my first time trying tea as a drink, as I used to be a heavy coffee drinker, but I’m switching to a healthier option.

I tried Hibiscus yesterday with one lime (I didn’t have lemon at the time) and added ice. No sugar or sweetener. It was really refreshing and paired well with my lunch.

Then at night, I tried Chamomile. I didn’t quite like the taste without sweetener, so I turned to TikTok and saw that some people add milk to it. I used powdered milk—dissolved it first before adding it to the tea—and I ended up loving the taste! It kind of tasted like creamy apple. Plus, it helped me fall asleep faster.

This morning, I tried Butterfly Pea tea. I didn’t enjoy the flavor without sweetener and ice, so I bought some milk from a local convenience store and added ice. Surprisingly, I loved how it turned out—maybe even more than Chamomile with milk! (Maybe I just used the wrong kind of milk before.)

I haven’t tried the Lavender yet, but I’m planning to do so tonight—both with and without milk to see which I prefer.

I’ve (F26, BP1) been doing keto for 6 weeks. I feel great, might have been a little hypomanic at the beginning but that resolved itself. My mood is now stable, I feel very clear and I sleep a solid 8 hours without the help of sleeping meds! The first four weeks my ketone levels were around 3 mmol/L. After that I think my body got more fat adapted and now I struggle to keep my ketones >1,5 mmol/L while I eat the same. They vary from 0.5 (in the morning), to 1,7 mmol/L. Often just around 1.0 during the day. My mood symptoms are under control but I’d like to raise my ketone levels above 1.5 before I continue tapering my meds (with the help of my team. Now on lithium 700 mg and lamotrigine 100 mg).
 
That said, I suspect I’m eating a too much protein and not enough fat. I struggle because over the years I gained some weight while on lithium. My weight has not changed since starting keto but I need to lose 8 kg (17 pounds). I feel like I should eat more fat for my ketone levels but at the same time I need to watch my caloric intake in order to lose weight. Any advice on how to balance this? Should I start tracking my macros? If so, how should I do this?

-        Breakfast (13:00 pm): 3 eggs with butter, 1/2 avocado and some smoked salmon

As digital office spaces grow to be the brand new norm, specialists are discovering both the liberty and the demanding situations of running remotely. While ditching the go back and forth and working on your PJs appears like a dream, staying productive in a virtual workplace environment calls for purpose and clever behavior. Here are some practical techniques to help you live focused, motivated, and efficient whilst working in a digital placing.

**1. Create a Dedicated Workspace** 

Having a designated workspace at domestic facilitates mentally separate work from private existence. Choose a quiet corner with minimal distractions, proper lights, and snug seating. Avoid running out of your mattress or couch — this could blur [obstacles](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/2315234084772257009#) and reduce recognition.

**2. Determine hours of clear work In a virtual office**

 it is easy to allow to work in your personal time. Install clear start and end time for your workday, and stick to them. Not only does it improve attention during work hours, but it also helps you to maintain a healthy work-life balance. 

**3. Use the right tools and technology** 

Stay connected to your team using virtual office tools like slack, zoom, google workpiece, trailo or asan. These platforms streamline communication, functioning and cooperation - make distant work more structured and transparent.

**4. Follow a daily routine** 

A consistent routine can significantly improve your productivity. Start your day with the morning ritual - perhaps a little walk away, coffee, or read - and dive into your top tasks while your energy is high. Structure with your day: Time block for concentrated work Scheduled stop Day review or plan for the next day 

**5. Priority to tasks with a two-do list** 

Start by writing a two-do list and identifying the most important tasks (MITs) each day. When you are the most alert, deal with high priority items, and avoid breaking large projects into small, managed stages.**6. Minimize the distress** Working from home introduces unique distractions - from pets to social media. Here's how to manage them: Close non-work information Use noisy headphones Inform your work hours of homemaker or family Use apps like ""Focus@Will"" or ""One"" to stay focused 



**7. Take regular brakes**

 Breaks are necessary to maintain mental clarity. Step away from your screen every 60-90 minutes. Go on a short walk, stretch or meditate. It resets your brain and increases creativity and productivity. 

**8. Stay connected with your team** 

The separation can crawl while working from a distance. To schedule regular video check-in, virtual coffee chat, or team meetings to stay engaged and align. Social contact, even virtual, promotes a sense of belonging and inspiration. **9. Invest in self-care Productivity**Self-care Productivity is closely associated with welfare. Make time for exercise, healthy food, hygiene and adequate sleep. A healthy body gives fuel to a sharp mind, especially in the flexible environment of a virtual office. 

**10. Reflect and adjust regularly** 

Not every strategy does equal work for everyone. Reflect weekly what is helping you to be productive and what not. Adjust your environment, schedule or equipment to better suit your work style and goals. 

# Conclusion

Virtual office space offers unmatched flexibility and freedom, but to be productive in this setup makes calls for deliberate attempt. By creating a structure, taking advantage of the right equipment, and practicing good habits, you can make remote work not only effective - but also pleasant.",1,1745304200.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False

But fate had a different twist here. Apparently there is a new hire manager in my team and when my manager said she's a keralite, everyone in my team turned their heads to me as I'd be comfortable with her by speaking malayalam. The girl turned out to be the same person who gave me the request. 

So after the formal introduction of our team mates, we went to cafeteria to grab a coffee and asked her to join us and she gladly obliged. 

So I got a gap to ask whether she's the one who gave me request in matrimony and she gave me a smile and replied, ""aanengil?""

I replied, ""parents aduth choyichal pinne prashnam illyallo"". She gave her parents number to talk and my dad will do whatever necessary for that(honestly we both don't care about any other stuffs except compatibility)

Her parents have no role in choosing her a partner and it was all her interest. Hopefully we wish everything would fall in place...

1k4zsjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_musayazlk/comments/1k4zsjx/the_superpowers_i_use_in_my_projects_plus_a_bit/,🚀 The Superpowers I Use in My Projects (Plus a Bit of Code Magic!) 🧙‍♂️💻,"Over the years of working on freelance projects, product development, and personal ventures, I’ve learned one universal truth: working with the right tools is more important than drinking coffee at the wrong time. (Though coffee is pretty important too. ☕️)

Here are some of the technologies I frequently use in my projects—aka my mini ""tech stack army"":

🧩 Next.js  
The star of every project! SSR, SSG, RSC, ISR… you name it, it’s got it. I use Next.js in nearly all my projects. And if a client says, ""I prefer Vue.js,"" no worries—I’ll dance with Vue too. 💃

🎨 Tailwind CSS  
Sharp like a samurai sword when it comes to styling. I barely write plain CSS anymore because Tailwind makes everything faster, cleaner, and less ""margin-top: 23px;"" 😅

🧱 Shadcn UI, Aceternity UI, Magic UI  
When there’s no custom design and I hear ""Musa, we trust you with the design""... that’s when this trio steps in. Fast, sleek, and user-friendly interfaces—just the way I like it! ⚡

🔐 NextAuth.js  
If security and simplicity are key for login flows, NextAuth is my go-to. From OAuth to magic links, everything is right there. No need to ask users, “What was your password again?” 👌

🍃 MongoDB + Prisma  
For simple projects that call for NoSQL, MongoDB is my pick. But since I love data modeling, I bring Prisma into the mix. They work great together. 🤝

🗃️ PostgreSQL  
If the project has relational data, PostgreSQL is a must. Powerful queries, data consistency, and reliability make it essential for large-scale apps. ""When the joins start talking, PostgreSQL steps in!"" 🎤📊

🚀 Supabase  
Need a backend—fast? Call Supabase! It’s super useful for MVPs and smaller projects. Realtime, auth, storage… all in one box. Like a ready-made dev kit. 🎁

🎯 Iconify & React Icons  
Icons are the seasoning of good UI design! Whatever you need, it’s probably in one of these libraries. I usually pick one based on the project. (No, I don’t put a 🐱 icon in every project.)

📦 Vercel  
Great for lightning-fast deployments during development. But now that things are serious… I deploy on my own VDS server using Coolify. Full control, full power! 💪

🧠 Git & GitHub  
And of course, my non-negotiable: I always start every project by creating a Git repo.  
""No version control, no peace."" – A wise developer proverb

🎯 In the end, these tools help me build faster, more solid, and more user-friendly projects. Each one works like a superhero in its own field. 👨‍💻✨

Life can sometimes feel like a series of routines, but there's a magical thing that happens when we start truly enjoying the moments of our day. It’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of big goals or future dreams, but the secret to attracting more of what you want lies in how you feel now.

When you genuinely enjoy the little things—the morning coffee, the walk in the park, the laughter with friends—you shift your energy. Instead of waiting for something ""big"" to happen, you're aligning yourself with the abundance that is already around you.

Your emotional state is a powerful magnet. If you feel good in your day-to-day life, you're opening the door to more of what makes you feel good. It's not about forcing yourself to be happy or pretending to love every second; it's about genuinely appreciating the present moment, even the small joys. This vibration, this frequency of enjoyment, will naturally draw more reasons for you to keep feeling good.

So, take time to savor today. When you enjoy your now, you're not only living in the moment, but you're also creating a future that feels just as fulfilling.

I thought I heard my name after ordering and even saw my order so I was about to grab a cup and this woman swatted my hand away and very rudely told me to not touch her drink.

Obviously I was a bit caught off guard because why is someone I don’t know touching me? But I apologized and said I thought I heard my name it was a mistake.

She responded pretty rudely again and I literally got fed up at this point saying I’m not sure why you’re being this rude about it? It’s a mistake? You didn’t need to slap my hand and do all that.

She said she didn’t slap my hand and called me a bitch. I left it because again I’m not interested in arguing with someone insane. 

However this has caused me to spiral a bit. I struggle with depression. It isn’t even about what happened honestly it just made me remember all the times I’ve been disrespected. Including times I’ve worked in customer service and majority by my own family.

Dude I get that it’s life not everyone is gonna iike you. I also can foresee someone telling me “not to take it personally” yes I know it’s on these people and not me but holy shit I’m tired

Then for the other day maybe hanging around Mission, haight Ashbury(?), definitely amoeba records but again through the day - coffee, lunch, dinner, wine/cocktails.

It’d be awesome to get a jazz bar in (mr tipples maybe?)

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

With time, my curiosity (and a couple of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMyAOqn2zo4) about eastern European girls) urged me to try some **dating sites like CharmDate** (alright majorly for the stunning pictures). I thought why not? If anything, it would be an interesting experience. Well, it really was.

* **The first thing I noticed girls of CharmDate was femininity.** Seriously, these girls don't go out of the house without makeup and outfits like they're going to the red carpet. Even for a regular video call. I remember when I was dating a girl **Relia** **from Romania**, once she said how she wouldn’t turn her camera on with me because she just woke up and did not put on makeup. I thought she was joking. She wasn't.

On one hand, it is great – you feel like you're dating someone from the movie and          she genuinely puts extra effort on herself to look gorgeous for her man. But on the other hand, sometimes I just wished we could eat a burger in regular sweats, to hang out without pressure and tension, but the glamour is always present. That's the thing with their culture and you need to get used to it. Honestly, bravo to them for taking care of themselves like that, but sometimes it is really exhausting.

* **One other thing – paying bills.** In America, it is normal to split bills, especially on first few dates when you are at the get-to-know phase. Most of the American girls I dated insisted we split it, and I respected it. But on **CharmDate** and with eastern European women in general - that's out of the question. It is expected from a man to pay for everything – dinner, coffee, even water if it is necessary. It's not out of benefit, it's simply their way. To be a gentleman it means to take care of the bill. I was first confused, but in time the idea grew on me – I felt more manly and appreciated.
* **And of course – family values.** Americans, at least the ones I went on dates with, value their freedom and independence more than anything ( I am no exceptional otherwise I wouldn’t still be here talking about dating sites. ;)) It is perfectly normal for American girls to enjoy dating when they are in their thirties, and only then they will start to think about serious relationship and marriage. But most of the Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian girls I talked to on CharmDate already think about marriage, kids and serious things – in their twenties! Most of girls put themselves out there not for fun but for long term relationship moving forward to marriage eventually. They have a clear vision and serious approach to relationships. And that was a real refreshment for me.

I'm not saying one is better that the other -it depends what you're looking for. If you want something casual, American way is for you. But if you're looking for settling down and someone who thinks long term, CharmDate gives you a better chance for it.

Overall, dating people on **CharmDate** from different cultures really taught me a lot – about expectations, communication, even myself. It is not always easy, but if you are open-minded and really want to get to know someone, platforms like CharmDate can totally change your perspective. I’ve had some amazing conversations, made real connections, and yeah, I even got ghosted once or twice (hey, it happens everywhere).

So whether you're trying **CharmDate** for something more serious or just swiping right, just know the dating world is huge—and sometimes, the best match might just be across the ocean.",1,1745302888.0,CharmdateReview,0,1.0,False

I’m currently working on an ethnographic research project for my Anthropology MA, and I’d love to hear from *Star Citizen* players about how you experience the **interiors of your ships**—not just as vehicles, but as potential *homes*.

Over the years, I’ve noticed how players talk about ships: cosy cabins, places to relax, and even living out of a favourite vessel like a space camper. I’m interested in how you build comfort, routine, and even identity through your ship interiors. With your permission, I’d like to include anonymous quotes in my research (I’ll make sure no usernames or identifying info is shared).

Here are a few questions to guide the conversation—feel free to answer any or all of them:

1. **Do any of your ships feel like “home” to you?** If so, what makes them feel that way—layout, lighting, routines, memories?
2. Have you ever gone out of your way to *role-play* domestic life (cooking, cleaning, sleeping, etc.) aboard your ship? Why?
3. What ships do you consider the most “livable,” and which ones feel cold or sterile?
4. Do you personalise your ship’s interior with items, decorations, or habits (e.g. always putting gear in the same locker, having a coffee ritual)?
5. How important is **privacy** or **communal space** in a ship to you? Do you prefer solo cabins or big social areas?
6. Have you ever had a moment when coming back into your ship (after EVA or a mission) *felt like coming home*?

If this sounds weirdly poetic, that’s intentional — I’m also drawing from thinkers like Gaston Bachelard, who wrote beautifully about homes as places of imagination and memory. I think it’s fascinating how these ideas carry into virtual space.

Would love to hear your stories, routines, screenshots, or even your ideal wishlist for your dream interior. Thanks in advance for sharing!

1k4zhnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1k4zhnw/the_one_who_haunted_me_in_more_than_20_years_of/,The one who haunted me in more than 20 years of nightmares. Spreading his message may help... Thanks for taking over the troubles.,"When I was six years old, I had a nightmare that changed everything. And I mean everything—because it was the first in what became a never-ending series of nightmares that still haunt me today.

Here’s the weirdest part: In these dreams, I’m never me. I become someone else—different people, different lives. I live as them, think like them, even do everyday things like eat, talk, and, yeah, weirdly specific stuff like using the bathroom. And everyone I meet in these dreams? They’re part of it too. It’s like I’m trapped in some twisted role-playing game where I don’t control the character.

But the worst part isn’t just how often they happen—it’s how real they feel. The settings repeat so much that I know I’m dreaming, yet I’m stuck in them. Some dreams are crystal clear, like real life; others are chaotic and jumbled. Each one plays out like a full story, like watching an episode of Doraemon—except I’m inside it, living it.

Over time, I started noticing something even stranger: Connections. Certain people, objects, or events keep popping up across different dreams, like clues in some bigger story. It’s as if these nightmares are trying to tell me something—like there’s a hidden message in all this madness.

So, I figured… maybe if I share these stories, someone out there can help me make sense of it. Maybe together, we can crack whatever code this thing is trying to send me.

But first, let’s start at the beginning—the first time I met the Mannequin.



My parents were typical survivors in what might be the most competitive city on Earth. Picture this: crowds of well-educated people speed-walking everywhere, scarfing down lunch in 15 minutes flat, crashing on packed subway cars, raising kids in 300-square-foot apartments, and obsessing over status symbols.

Our family was ""normal"" by those standards—which meant we got zero help from the system, just a constant flood of bills that bled us dry. That tiny apartment? Just a cramped corner with two single beds, a sink, a hot plate, and a toilet—all shared by four people. My parents’ paychecks vanished the second they hit the bank. Hell, we were technically millionaires—if you counted the negative sign on our balance.

Mom still talks about how brutal those years were. Even passing by the mall—and we’re talking basic chain stores here, nothing fancy—she’d stare at the displays and wish she could just... walk in. Not to buy anything, just to browse without that crushing weight of ""we can’t afford to breathe wrong.""

My parents were wiped out. They'd crashed hard after eating last night's leftover microwave pizza - again. I wanted to tell Mom about how I'd had this weird-tasting milk that morning. Maybe even hint that a cupcake would've been nice. But I got it. They were too exhausted to stay awake for my birthday, let alone remember it at midnight.



I blinked awake in the dim apartment. Our nightlight barely cut through the clutter - just enough to find the toilet without tripping. Space was tight, but we made it work.

Then I saw him.



Dad stood rigid at the foot of my bed, staring down with empty silence. My chest tightened as I waited for the birthday wish I'd been hoping to hear all week. Nothing. Just that hollow gaze.

""Dad?"" My voice cracked.

Rubbing my gritty eyes too hard, the wet squelch echoed inside my skull. I winced at the pain - should've been gentler. When I looked again, my heart turned to molten lead. Heat flashed through my body like fever. Sweat poured down my back as my stomach twisted into knots.

It wore Dad's clothes - that red-and-black flannel I knew so well. But the face, blank porcelain. No eyes. No teeth. No hair. Just smooth, glossy white where features should be. Exactly like those department store mannequins that always gave me the creeps.

I tried to scream. My lips wouldn't move.



I wheeled toward Mom and smacked her arm - hard as a teakettle. ""MOM!!"" My voice finally broke free as I shook her. But her face... gone too. Just that same terrible blankness. She didn't move. Didn't breathe.

It felt like someone was squeezing my heart with both hands - wringing out every last drop of blood until I could barely feel a pulse. This weakness spread from my chest to my shoulders, my waist, then my arms and legs until my whole body went limp. I was so terrified I thought I might shit myself.

Then came this insane burning sensation - like my body was a pot of water boiling over high heat. First the white-hot pain, then this heavy, empty feeling... like I was turning to steam and dissolving into the air around me.

They say everyone has survival instincts. My mind went completely blank—no thoughts, just raw panic—but my body reacted before I could think. In a flash, I launched out of bed, tore through the cluttered living room, and made a break for the front door.

Thank god it wasn’t locked. I yanked it open with desperate force—BANG—the knob smashed into the full-length mirror on the wall, shattering glass everywhere. Didn’t care. Just needed to get out.

But the hallway wasn’t safe.

Another mannequin stood there, taller than me. No face, but… I knew it. Not just a vague familiarity—I recognized it. The weight of the backpack, the posture… This was my older brother, who’d just come home after studying at the library and grabbing a quick bite. I’d carried that same bag for him this morning.



But this version of him wasn’t here to help. Look at him. How could he?

I whipped my head back toward the apartment. The white, faceless versions of Mom and Dad now stood in the bedroom doorway. And somehow… I felt their warmth. Their concern. Heard their voices, gentle as always:

“Joseph? Did you have a bad dream?”

Tears spilled uncontrollably as I clamped both hands over my mouth, my breaths coming in ragged gasps. Was this what a panic attack looked like? I desperately wanted to smell something familiar—my own scent, maybe—anything to ground me. But why did my hands feel... wrong? Too smooth. Too white.

Then I saw it...



In the shattered remains of the hallway mirror, a small mannequin stared back at me—its porcelain hands mirroring mine, pressed tightly against where a mouth should be. Our hollow eyes locked in shared horror…

My eyes fluttered open. I was still in my bed—same cramped space, with my brother’s head near my feet and his legs propped on the windowsill. Dad’s earthquake-level snoring rattled the walls as that predawn blue-gray light seeped into the room.

My throat burned like sandpaper. My back stuck to the sweat-soaked sheets, face clammy like I’d spent a day at the amusement park under blazing sun and never washed up.

Even at six, I knew it’d been a nightmare—but I wasn’t grown-up enough to call for Mom and Dad, to tell them my body was burning up with fever. Hot and cold at once, I shivered as my sweat turned icy under the blankets. That sickening dream-nausea still churned in my gut like spoiled milk. My stomach kept clenching and unclenching on its own - the kind of cramps that make you curl into a ball and pray to whatever god might be listening. I didn’t dare sit up. Didn’t dare look at my hands. Didn’t dare see my brother’s face.

Then I heard Mom stirring in her bed. She always checked on us first thing, tucking the blankets around our shoulders. Tonight, the thought of her coming near made my skin crawl.

The pale light caught her face as she approached: sleep-softened eyes, hair tousled. My beautiful mother.

“Joseph? Did you have a bad dream?” 

Mom took one look at my pale, twisted face and her hand flew to my forehead—her touch warm but rough from years of work. I must've looked worse than I felt.

That familiar kindness in her eyes finally pulled me fully awake. I barely made it to the toilet before gagging up foamy white bile, then immediately flooded the bowl with what looked like gallons of chocolate milk.



She threw on whatever clothes were nearest and half-carried me downstairs to hail a cab. That's how I knew it was bad—Mom never took us to the hospital. Usually it was just drugstore pills and three days sweating it out under blankets until the fever broke.

The ER doctor said I got lucky this time. ""Severe dehydration,"" he kept repeating. Without proper treatment, it could've shut down my organs. Killed me, even. Then the hospital bed swallowed me whole again.

I floated in and out—exhausted but wired. Those damn monitor beeps drilled into my skull, each blip sending the room tilting like some carnival pirate ship. Couldn’t tell if I was passing out or just trapped in that half-sleep where nightmares wait.

The nurse didn’t bother explaining. Just jabbed an IV into my left hand. Her technique sucked; The needle felt like a fire-ant bite, but my body was too tired to care. Not when my body felt like a wrung-out towel left in the sun.



In that hazy half-sleep, I suddenly found myself in a packed subway station. Through the sea of bodies, I spotted Mom rushing down the escalator ahead of the crowd. I knew I had to reach her, but the mass of commuters might as well have been a brick wall.

""Mom, wait for me!!"" I screamed, but with every shout she only moved faster. The crowd refused to part—shoulders and briefcases blocking me like some cruel obstacle course. The station announcements blurred into white noise as the crowd's body heat pressed like wet wool against my skin. By the time she reached the platform, the train doors were already open.

I was still trapped at the top of the escalator, helpless as she stepped inside. That gap between us kept growing—three steps, then six, then an impossible distance—while the escalator dragged me downward at a glacial pace.

I started shoving through the crowd in desperation. The man in front whipped around with a snarl. Where his eyes should’ve been, the porcelain dipped into shallow bowls—I could feel his glare like a physical blow, though I couldn’t actually see it. His jaw didn’t move when he hissed—the sound came from everywhere at once.

The flickering station lights reflected off his face in jagged strips. Not skin—but porcelain. That glossy, perfect sheen of expensive department store china. His features were smooth as a coffee cup’s rim, yet his rage radiated so intensely it made my throat close up.

Then I saw her...



There, on the platform—Mom. Or rather, the mannequin wearing her form, just like in last night’s nightmare. She stepped onto the train without looking back, her voice hollow and rehearsed as she called over her shoulder:

“Ryan, go home first.”

The doors sealed shut behind her.

The steel doors slid shut with a final, indifferent hiss.

I stood frozen—no time to process whether Mom had abandoned me or simply ceased to exist. My gaze darted across the station.

They were all mannequins.

Every single one.



Yet they moved with perfect imitation of life—commuters power-walking, briefcases swinging, their porcelain faces locked in expressions of fabricated purpose.

A cold realization seeped in:

Who the hell is Ryan?

Ryan's mother boarded the train.

Ryan got left behind.

And I—

—I was wearing his skin.



The station announcement echoed: ""Mind the gap.""

But the only gap that mattered was the one between

what I remembered...

and what this porcelain body knew.

The heart monitor's shrill protest dragged me back to the sterile present. My fever dreams had become a labyrinth where identity dissolved and reformed - some moments I was nobody, others I knew myself with painful clarity.

In all the years since leaving that hospital bed, the Mannequin has been my constant nightmare companion. This porcelain puppet treats dreams as its private theater, capriciously summoning me to perform in its grotesque productions. I've been cast in countless roles - inhabiting fractured lives with perfect recall of each persona's relationships, routines and private agonies. Its favorite game? Making me remember them all.

To its credit, the Mannequin crafts high-quality nightmares—each one a fully realized story. Sometimes the lines blur so completely, I can't tell if I'm dreaming at all.

What's truly fascinating is how these independent dreams connect. Slowly, I've begun piecing together subtle clues—familiar faces in unfamiliar places, recurring locations with shifted details—as if every nightmare exists within the same twisted universe.

I think the Mannequin is trying to tell me something. The message stays just out of reach, my brain too scrambled to decode it alone. That's why I'm sharing these dreams here. Maybe together we can spot what I'm missing.

If you're willing to dive deeper, search and solve the puzzle with me.

—Yours,

Joseph

Victim of the Mannequin Curse
