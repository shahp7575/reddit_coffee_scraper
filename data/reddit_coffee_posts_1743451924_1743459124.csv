I (24f) work in a small but busy cafe in my town I have altogether 2 colleagues who work front of house with me there are others in the kitchen! So the two I work with are ""EMMA"" (32f) and ""BLAKE"" (19m) now you may be wondering which one I got fired and you'll know reasonable soon. 

So it was lunch rush on the 20th of March just gone we were havkng a unusually busy day lots of meals and coffees being ordered! I was on making the coffees dutie ""BLAKE"" washing up and ""EMMA"" on customer service, taking orders etc.

A customer came in probably early/ mid 20s, a new customer, she had no idea what to get and asked ""EMMA"" for a suggestion. ""EMMA"" rolled her eyes like a d*mn teenager and goes ""whatever you want"" just wait it gets worse. This customer ordered a double espresso latte and a diet coke for her child who was waiting outside. I make the latte and grab the drink while ""EMMA"" is charging her more then it cost. 

Okay double shot espresso is £4.50 the diet coke is £2.90 so thats £7.40 right? Yeah it is I hear ""EMMA"" say ""that will be £25.50 please madam"" both me and ""BLAKE"" looked at her like excuse me. This poor woman starts crying because she cannot afford that. I take over and tell her ""it will be £7.40"" im which she paid, took her items and left! After rush ""BLAKE"" went on break and I pulled ""EMMA"" to the side asking ""what is wrong with you charging over 20 quid for a coffee and coke?"" this girl I swear proceeds to laugh like a child. she then says im her posh rich girl accent (even though she gets paid the same as me) ""I think her asking for a suggestion deserved an extra charge"" 

I was fuming after work I went to have a chat with our manager ""TINA"" (53f) and explained it all. 

The next morning I come into work ""EMMA"" is there clearly fuming and sees me. She then comes over and says ""how could you get me fired, can you not take a joke"" I said nothing and put my apron on. She then shouted at me ""yeah you do your skanky job being all high and might acting like your better then me because you have a job"" and proceeded to pour hot coffee over me. Of course I ended up in A&E nothing too bad luckily but I was off work for a while still am. I'm going back on Wednesday and she has officailly been banned from the property. She was also arrested I have no clue whats going on there.

I've been using Armodafinil 50mg intermittently. While it helps with endurance, it doesn't do much to motivate or drive me to start on tasks.

Yesterday was my first day on 5mg memantine. I took it before sleeping and today in the morning, I took Armodafinil. I usually drink about 2 cups of coffee in the first two hours after waking up. 

I'm not sure but I definitely noticed a big boost in my productivity. I managed to get what needed to be done today without a lot of struggle and anxiety. 

Another major thing I noticed is an significant increase in libido. I also checked my BP and it was quite high.

I'm thinking of taking it alternate days and see how it goes.

* **No influencers**—just people who *actually* reply.

**Why I’m posting here**:

1. **I need your honesty**: Would you use this? (Or is it doomed?)

Hey MaximizeMe fam! Ever have one of those days where focusing is harder than trying to keep a straight face during a TikTok binge? Yeah, me too. 

Here's the thing: life's chaotic and sometimes our brains just wanna take a vacation. But I stumbled on something that's a real game-changer and super simple—even more so than brewing your morning coffee (or spilling it... Tell me I'm not alone in that? 😅).

**Enter: 5-Minute Habit Stacking!**

What's habit stacking, you ask? It's like piggybacking new habits onto stuff you already do without even thinking. Like brushing your teeth or scrolling for cat memes. Seriously, it works. Let me break it down:

- **Start with a Trigger:** Pick something you already do every day. Got a morning tea ritual? Perfect! That's your starting point.

- **Stack One Little Habit:** Add a mini-focus session—just 5 minutes. *Before you sip your tea, jot down the one thing you need to focus on that day.* No need to channel a Zen master here; just write it and sip away. 

- **Repeat and Build:** Once you get the hang of it, stack another micro-habit. Like, right after your tea, stand and do a quick stretch while thinking about your focus task. Movement gets the brain juices flowing!

Why does it work? Because you're transforming your autopilot mode into a launchpad for productivity. Plus, it makes focus feel less like summiting Everest and more like stepping onto firm ground. 

Want to know the best part? You can personalize it:

- **Love music?** Stack a 5-minute focus playlist right before you dive into work.
- **Big on meditation?** Sneak in a couple deep breaths after the playlist to let intention settle in.
  
Anyone try something like this before? Have your own twist on habit stacking? Hit me up below! Curious to hear if it's as big of a game-changer for you as it was for me. 😊",1,1743458116.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jof9ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1jof9ib/in_a_dark_room/,In a dark room,"I (24M) write this from the dark room I’m currently living in. 

3 months ago, my life felt surreal. I had an amazing job opportunity lined up that I had worked/studied so hard to obtain. My ex gf (22F) of 4.5 years and I were living in a comfortable, roomy apartment with our three dogs. We had an amazing social life, separately and together. I had finally began to get back into shape and lost so much weight. The holidays had recently passed and it was so joyous. My birthday had also recently passed and I had such an amazing day with my ex gf and our friends. Everything around me just looked and felt so beautiful. I felt this immense feeling of gratitude and happiness. After working so hard, I had finally achieved the life I wanted and was so proud of.

2 months ago, she broke up with me out of the blue, completely unexpectedly. We both had several issues in our relationship but I never saw it actually coming to an end. We had gotten through so many issues in the past and made it this far. In my eyes, she was worth working through any problem or difficulty that life may throw at us. I begged and pleaded to stay together and work things out, especially since our lives were fully intertwined. I’ll never forget that last night we spent together. We stayed up so late reminiscing, laughing one minute and then sobbing the next. We fell asleep together (not sex) one last time holding hands. 

The next morning I asked her if she was absolutely certain about her decision in breaking up with me. I just couldn’t believe it. She looked straight into my eyes and with certainty said we’re done. 

I knew I wouldn’t be able to stay in that apartment, or even the same city, after this. I made the decision to move to another state and start over that same day. Also our apartment lease was coming to an end soon. According to her, she had been checked out of our relationship for 6 months and already made living arrangements and everything. I quit my job and called my closest friends to say goodbye. I packed up whatever I could fit into my car. I’m tearing up just thinking about it. My ex and I had one last “family hug” our three dogs that last morning I saw her. I’ll never forget that moment. 

Forward to today, I feel hopeless and lost. I lost everything I had worked so hard to achieve, my relationship, my apartment, friends, job, lifestyle, and ultimately myself. It’s been 2 months since I’ve arrived to this new state and city. As of now, I still have no job and no friends. At first, I felt hopeful that this would help me move on and heal. I pictured a perfect world where I’d find another amazing job opportunity, quickly make new friends, get my own apartment and decorate how I want to, talk to women and have fun dating, and hopefully even find myself in a new and better relationship. I envisioned myself improving my physical health and appearance, picking up new hobbies, and living a happy life as a newly single young man.

Unfortunately, that hope quickly faded and reality hit hard. I’ve applied to over a hundred jobs now and have only gotten 1 interview, which I never heard back from. I have joined several meetup/social groups online, but have yet to make any meaningful connections from them. The groups seem to appeal to an older crowd, at least from my experience. I’ve gone on dating apps and have had a few dates, which have only caused me more harm than good. Modern day dating is absolutely brutal. I’ve gone out to bars, nightclubs, coffee shops, libraries, etc to try to meet people but I haven’t had any promising results. 

The past two weeks especially have been so tough for me. I find it so hard to even get out of bed these days. I’ve been drinking way more alcohol than I’ve ever used to. I’m high almost every hour of the day. I’m completely burnt out from applying to jobs that I haven’t done any recently. I’ve been eating so much junk food again and not taking any care of my health or physical appearance. I stopped going outside or to social events/meetups because of how lonely it made feel. I know I am not alone but I’ve never felt more lonely. 

I really wanted to get this off my chest. All day I am reminiscing about the life I used to love. I miss everything about it, the good and the bad. I especially miss my ex gf and our dogs. I find myself constantly convincing myself that this is a dream and I’m going to wake up back into my previous life. I dream about her every single night. 

I’ve been a long time lurker in this reddit and never thought I’d be posting here one day. If you made it this far, thank you so much. I would love nothing more than to hear that it gets better. Could you shine some light into this dark room for me? Thank you 🖤",2,1743457927.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1jof87c,https://www.reddit.com/r/lactoseintolerant/comments/1jof87c/accidentally_became_lactosetolerant/,Accidentally became lactose-tolerant,"Just posting because this is something I’ve been pondering recently—

I (F27) have been lactose intolerant for most of my adult life. 

However, last year I went on an overseas volunteer trip for six months, where I spent the first three months in Italy and the next three months in Cambodia. 

In italy I did as the Romans do and drank 3 cappuccinos per day, and most cafes never had alternative milks on hand, so I had no choice but to opt for whole milk. While I felt bloated and uncomfortable and had an acne break out for the first 6 to 8 weeks, after that I noticed my body adjusted. When I went to Cambodia, i kept drinking coffees and teas with whole milk (they also rarely offered alternatives). I also ate a lot of gelato and ice cream in both places. 

I’ve been back in the US for 3 weeks now and have continued to take my coffee with whole milk and eat plenty of ice cream just to see, and lo and behold—I’m tolerating it fine! 

I know the quality/pasteurization/process of milk probably varies a lot between the three countries, but my theory now is that you can force your body to adjust / build lactose tolerance if you just keep consuming it and can get past a longer period of side effects. 

In the past whenever I’d try to see if I could drink whole milk again I’d never make it past two weeks because of the bloating and acne. 

Thoughts, anyone? ",1,1743457826.0,lactoseintolerant,1,1.0,False
1jof828,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jof828/setting_my_space_up_for_success/,Setting my space up for success!,"Hello collective! I am moving into a new apartment after living at home for a few month. I’ve moved around the country 3 separate times for work and have come back around to my home town. I’ve taken time to find the perfect place to settle and would like some suggestions for that space to help with keeping things tidy. 

Some context to my ADHD: I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 12 (now defined as ADHD inattentive type). I’ve struggled with keeping things picked up for the entirety of my life. Lately, I’ve found big success with Finch for forming habits related to cleaning and remembering to take my meds (not sponsored, but I absolutely love that app). I’ve also done a lot of soul searching into what has worked for me in the past keeping my space tidy and what has not worked. I’ve identified clutter collectors, like a coffee table, where I will not have one of them in my new home due to their ability to collect junk and don’t serve much purpose for me beside that.

Here’s where I’m looking for tips- one thing I have identified as a way clutter builds up is not having designated “homes” for stuff. The places they go are somewhat ambiguous within a closet or drawer, or they do not go anywhere and end up on the floor or on unintended surfaces. There’s a lot of closest space in my new apartment and I want to maximize its and my drawers’ ability to store things. I’d like any recommendations for containers, bins, as well as drawer organizers, and things along that line that will give me good homes for my things to live in when not in use. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated as I’d like to get ahead of my own untidy tendencies! Thanks in advance!

I got tired of writing trash commit messages like `""stuff""`, `""quick fix""`, or `""final-final-FINAL""`, so I built **Commitron** — an AI tool that reads your `git diff` and writes a clean, clear commit message for you.

The cool part?  
🧠 You can run it **entirely locally** with your own LLM (no code leaves your machine)  
OR  
☁️ Plug it into APIs like **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, etc. if you prefer cloud models

It's super handy whether you're working solo or just want to keep your Git history useful without context-switching.

I got my prescription from Hims and I feel like they’ll say anything to keep me on to fuel their seemingly pill mill, but I’ll still talk to my doctor. I took my first dose of Wellbutrin 150 XL last Thursday. I do not think this medication is right for me, but maybe it’s too early to know? The first day was fine, I noticed a slight increase in mood, but was exhausted from not having caffeine. Friday, I made the mistake of drinking coffee (only a few sips) and was anxious to the max. I felt like any second I’d snap and have a panic attack. Saturday, I felt very socially anxious when opening at work, but later in the day I felt pretty good and energized. Sunday was the best day, It was beautiful, I felt very focused and happy. That night, though, I had very noticeable chest tightness, despite not feeling any anxiousness. Now onto today, I took my pill as normal at 8 and drove to my 11 am college class. Everything seemed fine, until I sat down. My palms became super sweaty to the point they were dripping and very cold and clammy. I turned white as a ghost, and felt completely off the walls anxious. I felt like if I didn’t get up, I would start freaking out. I was got extremely dizzy. I had to step out for a while, ate food (I didn’t eat breakfast) and then went back in 20 mins later feeling ok. I sat down and within five minutes I felt like I was gonna die. I could not stop clenching my jaw, sit still, and felt like if I stared in one place for too long I’d have a seizure or panic attack. Very tweaked out. I had to leave campus before my next class and called a friend because I have never felt anywhere near that way before. I really don’t think I can stick it out and actually see if this med is right for me. I feel like this med is just too stimulating for me since I was on my feet serving all weekend, but was freaking out just sitting in a lecture hall.

“The Nullborn may not be part of our system anymore, but that doesn’t mean they’re without access. And no, they aren’t diseased or mutated or any of the other bullshit you hear. They’re just like us. Just *people* who were handed a shitty sentence by a shitty system.” I took one look at Ozzy’s face and chuckled. “What? You think the system we live in is *fair*?”

“W-well, no. Of course it isn’t *fair*,” he stammered. “But that’s just how it *is*, right? Some people have more than others. That’s all.”

“Uh-huh. Look, kid. The Nine aren’t gods. No more than you are a tree.”

Ozzy’s eyes widened. “But-but, isn’t that *blasphemy*?”

I nodded. “Yup. Sure is. What kind of *god* gets nearly a fucking *quadrillion* in debt transferred into his private accounts? If he’s such a high and mighty “god”, wouldn’t such a thing have failed?”

“I mean… it *did* get sorted out in a couple of hours.” Ozzy looked hopefully at me. I hated being mean.

“No. A *god* would be unaffected by such a thing. It would have failed immediately and the people responsible would have been found within seconds and brought to justice. Think, kid.”

I watched his face closely. He was going through a fair bit right now. If I was right about him, he *might* reason it out himself. Maybe. He started sweating.

“But… Then that means they’re just *people*. Right?”

“That's one possibility. Go on. Take it further.”

Ozzy started breathing a little harder. “Then… If they’re just people, then… then the whole thing…” He looked up at me, his eyes wide. His voice dropped to a whisper. “The whole thing’s a lie. It *has* to be.” I saw tears in his eyes.

My voice was soft. “Yeah, kid. They’re people. Stealing everything they can from us just to make themselves richer. *That’s* why the Nullborn left that message in those accounts. Do you remember what it was?”

“N…Some-something about coming home?”

“Yeah. Come home to the land. More than anyone else on the planet, the Nullborn want to see us free and happy. That you’ve been skating around the truth for a couple years is a testament to both your own wishes to be free *and* the power that the MegaCorps hold on people. Looks like all it took was a bottle of booze to get you closer to the truth than you’ve ever been.”

A knock sounded at the door. I got up and checked on Ozzy. He seemed okay, just drunk and dealing with an existential crisis of monumental proportions. I left him there in his chair and opened the door.

“Marie! Come in.” I stepped back to let the young woman in.

She took one look at Ozzy and curled her lip. “This him? Looks shitfaced, Wil.”

“He is. He’s never had a beer in his life, and one did him in. He just reasoned out the truth.”

Her face turned sympathetic. “Ah. Poor guy. How old is he?”

“Twenty-seven, I think.”

She grunted. “Yeah, that’ll do a number on his head. Anyway, where’s the toy?”

“It’s in this box. It’s *his*, mind you.”

“Ah. Guess I’ll have to talk to him. Hey! Kid!”

Ozzy looked over at us. “Wha? Who’re you?”

“I’m Marie. I was sent over to upgrade your thingy.”

“My… my *thingy*? Huh?” Ozzy looked at his crotch, and I snorted.

Marie huffed and planted her fists on her hips. “Your *glasses*, nitwit.”

“Oh. Wil made me put ‘em in that… in that box there. You won’t hurt Nova, will you?”

“Nova? Who’s that?”

“The… the AI. It’s been a lot of help.”

She smiled and took the box from me. “No, kid. I’m not gonna hurt Nova. When I’m done, it’ll be even better than before, with more storage and more power. Just you wait.”

Ozzy gave her a thumbs-up and she wandered off to my workshop. While she was gone, I watched over Ozzy as he finished the beer and curled up in the chair. We talked for a bit as he slowly sobered up. He seemed to be taking the new knowledge fairly well, all things considered. I knew of some people who, when faced with the reality of our situation, had a full-blown meltdown. Most reacted like Ozzy. A usually short period of disbelief followed with a time of mental reconstruction. It varied for each person, but could last as long as a few months, or as short as an hour.

It looked like Ozzy was going to take a few days. I hoped he had enough credit to take the time off. Poor bastard.

/\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/

“Okay! I got you all fixed up, kid. Your HoloFrames seemed to be a little different than the standard model for some reason, but the regular workarounds and fixes worked on them just like they were supposed to. I made sure your data didn’t get wiped, too.”

“Oh. Thank you.”

“Bah. Don’t mention it, kid. Just remember who helped ya, ‘k?” She winked at Ozzy, making him blush.

“Um… yeah.”

“Hah! Marie, quit teasing the boy. You good, Ozzy? Think you can walk home?”

He nodded, and Marie handed him the HoloFrames. “Good. I need to talk with her, so I need to ask you to head on home. Let me know if you get anything else worth selling, okay?”

“Alright, Wil. I’ll see you later, okay?”

“Be safe, Ozzy.” I watched him as he left, closing the door softly behind him. Poor bastard.

“Show me what he brought you, Wil. It *has* to be good if they told me to do what I did.”

I grinned at the woman. “Yeah. You’ll see it eventually, so here.” I offered her the papers.

She thumbed through the file I had, nodding in places. When she reached the memo, she halted. Gingerly placing the folder on the coffee table, she looked me in the eye. “Seriously?*This* is what they called me for? A shitty memo?”

“Did you not read it?”

“Why? It’s just a stupid corpo thing.”

I sighed and pushed my palms into my eyes. “Marie, just because it’s a corporate thing, doesn’t mean it’s worthless. This folder now contains a string of occurrences that illustrates exactly how the web of power has been spun. The Nine? The High Executor? It’s all a show. The nine MegaCorp CEOs run the show. Completely. The ‘Church’ answers to *them*. This memo is the final proof of that, Marie. I’ve already put copies in several hands in just the past four hours. This folder? It’s going into the Vault as soon as we can get a courier out here. We *finally* have the last bit of evidence we needed to help convince some of the others.”

“Are… are you sure, Wil?”

I nodded. “I am. With this, we can *win*.”

“I hope you’re right, Wil. I’m tired of running around in the shadows.”

“Don’t worry, Marie. We’ll all be able to walk free soon enough.” I gave the shorter woman a hug, then opened the door.

A little about me:

One day, I will ride across Europe on two wheels. The passenger seat is open… maybe you'd like to join?

I love watching good movies and discussing them afterward. But coffee is a must.

I've been wanting a tattoo for ages, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any cool tattoo ideas? I’m all ears.

When I visit a new city, I prefer getting lost in side streets instead of just seeing the tourist spots. Walking through ancient places and feeling their history is unreal.

I cannot stop doing stuff, organizing, cleaning, racing around etc. But I don't feel euphoric or happy or lighthearted- I am filled with intrusive thoughts, panic, anxiety, agitation, and a dark cloud. I am all over the place and cannot sit and relax at all. I had extreme anxiety and panic and depression and obsessive thoughts prior to the zoloft- big time, but this revved up drive, like I drank a ton of caffeine, is definitely from the zoloft and the other stuff seems more active as well. 

I am seeking words of encouragement and hope- Please, no horror stories right now- my heart would break. I am scared enough as it is. But anyone who has had similar experiences and is on he other side now- I would certainly love to hear from you about your own experience.

The grit. The glamour. The gore of the fashion world. 

Just before the dawn of the new millennium in New York City, designers balance on the razor’s edge of industry revolution. Though perhaps none are poised to define this new era quite like Dominique Blanc, a 42-year-old avant-garde visionary who was told “No” so many times by gatekeeping men that she tattooed the word above both wrists—in French and English.

In just six seasons, Dom’s creations have risen to the ranks of Alexander McQueen and Jil Sander, her tencels and silks draped on bodies from Soho to Singapore, yet satisfaction eludes her. She dismisses the man who persistently chases her, ignores her mother’s perpetual disappointment. What she craves most is what the art world promised: immortality, if only in thread and fabric. 

While hunting for inspiration for her definitive collection, Dom discovers her unexpected muse: disgraced model-turned-designer Myriam Nix, who vanished from the fashion scene years ago. When her assistant Edgar uncovers a storage unit filled with Nix’s extraordinary and unused textiles and rare iridescent threads, Dom feels fates to incorporate them into her designs. The results transcend anything she’s created before. 

But as fittings begin, blood seeps through delicate weaves—chokers inexplicably tightening on throats, heel straps gnawing at Achilles tendons. Bodies are maimed and fall victim to exquisite garments with insatiable appetites. And on the eve of Dom’s latest fall/winter runway, Myriam resurfaces like a harbinger, though there’s something decidedly different about her. Amidst the swirling press and mounting carnage, face to face with a woman she thought would one day be her rival, Dom is confronted with how much she’s willing to sacrifice and suffer for fashion, and how much it demands she submit.

HEMLINE, 76,000 words, is a literary horror for fans of *Natural Beauty* by Ling Ling Huang, the biting prose of Jen Beagin and Ottessa Moshfegh, and the chaotic satire and terror of films such as *The Substance*.

First 300:

The smoke from the joint swirls in the late afternoon light, catching an amber glow through the massive curved windows. Dominique Blanc sits on a wooden chair, perfectly still, as if the motion of her thoughts is enough to animate her entire body. The loft stretches around her—a temple of negative space, sparsely decorated with a granite coffee table, a leather chaise with a steel lamp bent like a question mark, massive indigo rug that anchors everything. Brick walls like over-washed hands, pine floors worn to a honeyed patina. The ductwork across the exposed beams hung as a silver large intestine.  

Dom exhales, smoke joining dust motes in the slanting sunbeams. Her eyes never leave the wall. 

“*Come on*,” she whispers to the collage that dominates the brick in front of her, a tapestry of obsession and inspiration stretched nearly ten feet high and twelve feet wide. 

At its center: a blown-up print of Michelle Pfeiffer in an iconic bodysuit. Vinyl and leather. Tim Burton's vision of Catwoman in 1992. Gleaming black second skin pulled taut across breasts and collarbones, the places where women’s anatomy become weapons. The boning of the corset constricts rage. Haphazard stitches everywhere you look, showcasing fervor, manic frenzy. All the while Michelle is prostrate, one leg arched over knee, dangerous claws dangled over her midsection, her eyes somehow both sleepy and vibrantly awake, a pout of Dior-red lips that hides blinding teeth, or fangs. 

Surrounding the centerpiece, Dominique has arranged photographs of splayed fish, filleted of their flesh but the bones intact and arranged as scientific subjects. She has a litany of skeletons as architecture, to be admired just as much as Venice or Beijing. It isn’t morbid, the remains of the bear, elk, shark, sting ray on display—none of them are human.

So I been put to strict diet by doctor and been told to cut the carbs and sugar completely. My triglycerides also very high, meaning I can't take caffeine (no coffee). I now take Krill oil to increase my good cholesterol and decrease bad one, my good cholesterol is low, because I been consuming junk food like mcdonalds, kfc and many other outdoor food especially after the pandemic. Yesterday I did ""dry fasting"" where I ate breakfast in the morning at 8am and started fasting after that for 12 hours without any food or water, then for another 8 hours in sleep, so about 20 hours of fasting I was hoping to get my autophagy up since I read/watched a lot of research on it and benefits on it. So given my circumstances what diet should I follow? I'm on keto diet and I'm also trying intermittent diet of skipping either lunch or breakfast, if I don't eat dinner I get cravings late at night so I have to eat dinner. But I also count my calories, the last 4 days I ate 1500, 1000, 600, 500 calories in total, Trying to stay below 2000 caloric intake. For exercise I do push ups with difficulty (my wrists hurt I tried stretches and that helped), I also do a lot of walking outside, like I walk my dog and running alone about 30min a day. My google fitness app was showing that I done about 3000 steps 1600 burn in, so I was very proud of that yesterday. Don't give up everyone! we can do this!

anyway, the customer asked for a tall coffee with a little room. I rang him up and turned around and started making the coffee. He then asks me in a sharp tone if I’m giving him dark roast. I say no. He tells me I didn’t offer him dark roast and that I absolutely should have. I tell him I’m sorry and ask him if he’d like dark roast. He rolls his eyes and says “Jesus you people.” I ask him again and he says yes he wants dark roast so I make it from him while he stands by the counter and glares at me.

1joet3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1joet3i/hr_until_dusk/,[HR] Until Dusk,"(Hello everyone, I submitted this story for my creative writing assignment and was really proud of it! So I was a bit bummed out when I got a 70% on it and all of the classic teacher 'notes' that were honestly pretty rude on the paper. This was an assignment to do a story set in a video game setting, I chose Until Dawn. The main focus was setting and place, I hope you'll enjoy.)

If you told me that I’d pick up structural engineering earlier I’d probably just roll my eyes and monologue about how college is a scam and that everyone is falling for it, leaving the one percent (me) in the minority. As embarrassing as my younger years occurred to me, the job honestly kept up well for me. For one I didn’t have to talk to many people, of course my boss and a couple of other coworkers whose names never seem to stay in my mind for long. I would spend hours alone checking if buildings were up to par, but not any particular buildings. I worked for a company that specializes in saving historical structures but more importantly caves and mines. It took a bit of time to adapt to considering the climate and underlying paranoia of isolation. It’s something I never thought I’d find myself afraid of, for I’ve always been a reclusive person. I suppose any over extreme dose of anything has its limits, and I certainly had mine when I started. I’ve seen my fair share of strange occurrences: voices calling out my name that I never recognized, sudden shifts in climate as you enter deeper into the devil's mouth, or sudden shadows flickering past the warmth of the torch. However, nothing logistically could explain the most peculiar encounter I’ve had. It’s the reason that I quit shortly after and it’s the reason why I will never go near isolated wilderness. 
If I remember correctly, I was around 28 when the disappearances of the Washington siblings happened. Despite that I never really paid attention to the gossip that circulated around the office so I didn’t know how it exactly happened. It was robotic, waiting for the next structure check by occupying your time with coffee stained paperwork while drying your eyes out staring at the clock. This mundane schedule that I had obtained throughout the years had caught me by the throat and restrained me for many more. 

“Hey Pete!” My boss hollered from the doorway of my cubicle, slamming his hand on the opening in the process. He must’ve caught me in the trance because I nearly jumped out of my seat only to be followed with the tingly feeling of irritation for him using the nickname ‘Pete’. Reuben and I had known each other for quite some time before this job had fallen into our laps, although I can’t give that too much credit. We went to the same middle school and highschool, my presence was always ready for him when he needed yet discarded once finding something better. 
“Yeah?” I said, my chair squeaking as I slowly turned around to look at him.

“I’ve got a new assignment, Jace says he can’t be there for the structure check on Blackwood Mountain.” His rock solid blond hair bounced around as he talked, I could practically taste the body spray on him, everything about his presence was similar to a mosquito. Nothing much but a pest to me. “It’s something with his mom, you think you can pick it up?”

I restrained the air from leaving my lungs before hesitantly agreeing. Soon after that I had received a one way ticket to the Blackwood Mountains, also the Washington Estate. I didn’t really know how to feel about it, normally I’d be ready to jump on any chance to get out of the office and into the outdoors. Not just any outdoors, the bitter coldness of snow. The dark and unforgiving climate made me see a beauty that not many others could, I guess that’s why I was fit for the job. Although this time, it felt different. 

The bus had shortly stopped, prompting me to zip my last layer of jacket before setting off. As promised, the gate to the entrance would be open, beginning my endless expedition to the abandoned mining site. This particular site had regularly housed air headed men seeking gold in the 20s. Although I could’ve swore that I heard something happen to the group, something bad. The snow underneath my boots had melted and flattened with each step I took, deflected by the waterproof features of them. The icy atmosphere had nipped at my fingertips, I knew the unrelenting pain would reciprocate for me soon enough. 

Snap!

Cursing to myself, I took my gaze off the opening of the cave to see what had crushed underneath my feet. The collection of dirt and snow had concealed itself of any fragility. I brushed it off and picked it up with further inspection. Taking my flashlight out of my pocket my eyes adjusted to the sudden reflection of the glass, thus revealing itself to be a picture tarnished by its cracked frame. It had shown to be four people, of what I assumed to be teenagers which would be further proven by the writing on the back. 

“Prom 2014! - Sam” 
“It was LIT AF! - Mike” 

Shaking my head at the lingo used a new feeling that had suppressed it entirely. Submerged by uneasiness, I flipped the frame and as certain as ever it was Hannah Washington. One of the two sisters that went missing and soon after then, their brother. 

Her posture radiated uncomfortability, as if the skin she owned was not hers. As much as I heard about her, which wasn’t much, she was a typical teenage girl. A good student all the way to excelling grades to extracurricular activities. Despite her overachieving record, she was quite the timid person. In a way I saw myself in her, as shameful as that sounds now. We both had jet black hair, although hers laid on her shoulders thick and voluptuous. We both wore glasses and had brown eyes, although hers were more of a hazel color. The kind of hazel brown eyes that would glow in the sunlight. The top she wore made it easy to see her butterfly tattoo on her shoulder. The lines were thick and uneven, something only a person who has had many tattoos can point out. So it wasn’t a surprise due to it being a typical ‘starting tattoo’. 

Torn between the settlement of what I might do, I pocketed the frame and entered the mouth of the flying head spirit that was the opening. Business carried on as usual, I would take my check list out and scribble notes if necessary. Although this time around it was a bit more difficult to navigate due to my unfamiliarity to this particular cave, it was a common occurrence to retrieve my nearly useless map constructed by the even more useless Reuben.  

I descended deeper into the mines, shivering with my flashlight and clipboard. The dirt caked walls hardened as they remained frozen in stone, countless different scratches and marks painted them a slightly darker shade of brown. The screeches of the elevator echoed, making my heart stop every few seconds when it would shake and rock. As the elevator hit its final painful cry, my fingers nearly chipped off as I pried open the doors, met by a whole new level of netherworld. I entered further into the cavern and eager to get out as soon as possible, I got to work. Unfortunately for me, this is the moment that I started finding more of what I thought at the moment was random nonsense. If only I knew what I know now.

It started with a series of letters within a small notebook that were nearly ineligible, one needed to use great effort in order to even track the date of the letter. The once pale whiteness of the surface was dyed into a sandy orange. The edges were uneven and jagged, torn by the passage of time. The letters varied in size and shape, almost as if the writer had used different fonts. The thickness in shape had emphasized different undertones. 

“Adam here. Writing this feels like a load of hooey. The fellas had finally convinced me to join them for the cave trip and now I’m feeling it hit me in the kisser. That was a couple weeks ago.I’m alone here, the hungriness is more painful than it’s ever been. I haven’t even thought of what to do about Mauris after that rub-out. He croaks in the same position as it did during the fall. I can’t look at it for too long, because everytime I do I find something new wrong about how he looks. It’s like his eyes are looking at me with deep contempt, telling me what I could’ve done differently. As the famine in my body aches, I find myself digging him out of the grave I gave him. I can’t handle this anymore. I hope you will all forgive me, that is if I ever see you again.”

I turned the page.

“Okay, I did it. Although I don’t feel anything different than guilt. Now that it’s been done, I know now it wasn’t worth it. The look on his face as I search him for a sharp knife, the discoloration of his face as he watches what I did to his body. No level of hunger would ever be worth consuming to this extremity. As the days passed on, I started to feel different. Like my body is growing each time I wake up. My skin has gotten translucent in a way, my veins glowing a pale blue. As shameful as it is to admit, I’m more hungrier than ever.”
I turned to the final page, the words were smudged and varied in size. The message was incoherent and obsessive, repeating the same word of “Hunger”. The letters covered the entire page, The remnant of humanity shown on the paper was far gone compared to the other pages. 
My stiff hands closed the notebook and pocketed yet another item that was not my own. Gazing around the isolated cave, I started to get the feeling that I’ve stumbled into something way beyond my level of comprehension. Something that wasn’t meant for me. My mind stretched and struggled as to what to do. At this point in time, continuing with the structure check was not my job anymore. I could either fill out the paperwork as normal and lie to escape the consequences, or keep searching. 

Cursing to myself once more, I descended further into the cold and unforgiving hell. My feet slipped and slid down the steep hill, the echoes of the steps taken made me wince. The body that was my own was telling me that I was being watched, like a rat inside of an experimental cage. Once reaching the bottom I could see the old and broken materials of the mining projects alongside the slope that descended down to what looked like a shallow body of water. Everything was left scattered onto the ground as if the workers needed to make a last ditch effort to leave. Something that I should’ve done, but was too enveloped in unraveling the mystery. The tools that were once used religiously were rusted and frozen to the touch, bags were left unzipped and exposed all of the contents whether that’d be pictures of their families or damp cigarettes. Searching through the bag, I saw a collection of flares. Shameful, I pocketed them before getting back to my feet. 
An overarch had been made to introduce a tunnel. Flashing my dim light to it as I approached further inside I found something else noteworthy. On one of the benches lies an old video camera. The edges were rounded but tainted by whatever fall it must’ve faced. The color remained a matte silver color	with the occasional scratch. The eye of the lens had faced the most damage, with the glass being completely shattered. Opening the cold monitor, I was beyond surprised once finding the battery to be just barely manageable. I clicked on the first recording available. It showed a scene from what looked like a made at home movie, although with a much higher budget than the cheap camera gives it credit for. Two people sat at a table across from each other with descending saws over their heads. They both screamed and cried as they called to each other. The girl’s makeup ran down her cheeks, intercepting the blood on one of them. Her matted hazel hair had obstructed much of my view of her face, only allowing it to be visible once she tilted her head upwards. The boy across from her held a handgun, looking just as distraught as her. 
A masked figure from behind the camera had emerged into frame wearing a pair of overalls, prompting the boy to unleash fire at him. The white mask had gnarly buck teeth, its pink gums protruding from the face while its glistening black eyes did the opposite by sinking backwards into the mask while the scraggly hair flowed from the back of the head. The figure with the distorted tone of voice had laughed while shaking his head.
“Oh Chris, you’ve heard of blanks before? I mean really?” He says sarcastically, reaching for his mask before two people burst into the room. I was easily able to recognize them as Mike and Sam from the prom photo that still remained in my pocket. His dirty fingers had grazed the mask as he slipped it off from his head. As the veil that disguised the psycho’s face fell away, Joshua Washington’s tired but sly profile had feigned a smirk. All in surprise, the group called to him as he started to burst out in cackles.

 “Oh very good! Every one of you got my name, and after all you’ve been through!” He wiped a tear from his eye as he circled the table. “How does it feel? Do you enjoy feeling terrorized? Humiliated? I mean, panicked? All those emotions that my sisters got to feel once one year ago. Only guess what? They didn’t get to laugh it off! No, no, no! They’re gone!” He raised his hands in a grand gesture, proud of the stunt he had pulled on these kids. Things were starting to make sense. Josh had started to monologue about how famous this prank would go on the internet before the video it cut itself off.

Rewinding the tape, I had taken a better look at the two people that had bursted into the scene before Josh was revealed behind the mask. Both Mike and Sam, disheveled. The faces I once saw filled with joy, tainted with fear of the unknown. They were a shell of what they once used to be with Sam showing it the most. Her rounded innocent face had been framed by the headlight tightened onto her forehead, smushing the blonde face framing that was her hair underneath it. The scarlet red jacket she wore was one of those ones you’d typically see a soccer mom wearing, with the black design on the sides enhancing its athletic aesthetic. This as well as the grey leggings she wore only going down to her knees, leaving her calves exposed. From what I knew of her, the loss of Hannah must’ve been big, the two seemed quite close. Like Hannah, she also had a history of extracurriculars and above average grades, the only difference is that she didn’t have the stresses of overbearing parents to influence those accomplishments. Despite it all, she remained humble. Something anyone can appreciate. The big heart she had for her best friend Hannah was still not enough to save her from the dangers of the mountain, a feeling that stung my heart as I pocketed the camera.

As I did so, I could’ve sworn I heard a voice. Albeit very faint, but I could hear it call from a distance “Josh.” The shivers I felt were not from the cold, but something much more ruthless. I returned from the steep slope that was the mining site and started to make my way towards the middle level of the cave. This is the one mistake that I made that altered this journey and potentially removed years off my life. I slipped.
Rolling down the steepness of the hill, I took several blows to my back and my head. Raising my hands to shield myself from the rocks, I was soon submerged in an icy coolness. Unable to breath, I thrashed my body around to reach the surface, the crispness of the water forcing its way through my nostrils before I gasped for air. A new level of dread filled me as I found myself in a whole new world, while I remained a vulnerable fish and whatever was watching me, the shark, to prey upon that. Floating aimlessly through the underground pond, I started to make my way towards any available land. Although my efforts would be short lived once I heard rustling that echoed through the space. I ducted my head back into the water where my eyes were the only thing exposed to the air. Soon I’d be thankful I did so, for whatever I saw is something I would never want to be caught by in my darkest dreams.

An unconscious body being drugged by a tall, almost human-like being. The reason I would never come close to saying human is because of the violent discoloration of its skin. The way its eyes varied in size and color due to its almost cataract glow. The way it stretched far past what its clothes allowed it to go. The patchiness of its brown hair, it looked like it tore off its own hair itself. Its gangly limbs swung gently as it continued to haul the unconscious human. Long after the two disappeared from my gaze, I mustered the courage to continue swimming to the surface. If I could call it that, If it hadn’t been the extreme temperatures I would’ve gladly succumbed to hypothermia. I crawled like a desperate wet rat to the rocky surface and laid on my back, panting as quietly as my lungs would allow me to. I turned my body, my gaze met another item that would answer another piece of the puzzle. Pursing my lips in anger, I snatched the item. I didn’t care anymore, I’ve brought myself into a situation where most people wouldn’t come back. Who was I to think I could be in any position of authority to search through this story?

Propelling my arm backwards, I was ready to throw it back into the water before pausing. As much as I’d hate to admit it, my attention was caught by the label. A short orange bottle with a white cap. I turned it over to look into it further, the white label with Josh’s full name depicted, “Joshua J. Washington’. Below his name would be the term ‘Phenelzine’. Opening the bottle I found it to be full of tiny white caps, causing the cap to sound like a maraca. My gaze glazed over the area as I unraveled the distant memories from my Psychology class I minored in for college. Of course there were many names of drugs I learned about, many I still can never pronounce and more specifically the uses of them . But this specific one was on the tip of my tongue. Not wanting to take up any more time than I potentially had, I pocketed the pills. To be fair, having mental issues rise from such a traumatic event like the disappearance of family members would be unfortunately common. The only thing that I wondered was why did they let him go on for so long, with this prank he set up for the friends. From what I saw it was quite a cruel one, one that clearly cannot be written off by a couple of antidepressants. 

Either way I had added to the piles of items that didn’t belong to me before standing up. Filled with trepidation, I continued through the mines. The dimness of my flashlight indicated how long I had been in there for, I turned it off and put it away being submerged into the inky darkness of the tunnel. The only light that shined through was the reflection of dim light into the pond. I searched for a way out aimlessly, wondering if I was going to have the same fate as those miners or whoever was being dragged by that…thing. I wondered if I was going to see my family again, although that would only really be my mom. I thought about all of the times I declined her calls, my breath became labored as I started to think about all of the things I’ve missed out on. My thoughts were halted once I heard a swift crunch behind me. Almost as if it was a reflex, I pressed my back against the dirt wall. The sounds were wet but harsh. Like someone chewing an apple only to spit it back up to consume it once more. Before I could make the grave mistake of taking a step, an inhumane screech was heard. 

Crunch

I stiffened my body once I saw it. Only I was unlucky enough to see the figure much closer than before. It was much taller than the distance I originally saw it in. Its pale grey skin was moist, almost as if it was feigning sweat. My breaths took a pause as the creature had begun to pass by me, its steps heavy. I saw its head turn to me, before approaching me as I remained squished against the wall. My lip quivered as I felt its hot sour breath brush against my nose, its face coated with a scarlet liquid. Mustering the courage to open my eyes, the face appeared familiar to me. Its brown patchy hair had mirrored one that was once voluptuous and thick. Its protruding eyes had mirrored ones that used to be calm but tired. The most telling part was the same overalls that I saw in the video camera that was now waterlogged in my pocket. It was Josh, but different, way different from what he looked like before. I would go as far as to say that it wasn’t him anymore, he was simply a vessel a demon had taken over. His gaze flicked across the wall, almost as if he didn’t see me. With one last pained cry that caused my ears to ring, the creature bent onto all fours before scampering away. 

I placed a shaky hand on my mouth before exhaling swiftly, the pressure in my head from the lack of air quickly dissipated. Feeling like an idiot, I pulled out the sopping wet map out of my pocket and unfolding it carefully. Pointing out the cave map off to the side, I spotted the emergency cable car. If I was lucky (which I was not feeling) it would have just enough power to let me escape. Peeling myself off of the wall, I took my last chance of survival and followed the demented creature.

Minding my footsteps, I crept further into the tunnel. I took the dim light as a sign to proceed, I was glad I did once I saw the empty dirt coated flat. This was until I fully registered the distance between the entrance from the tunnel to the cable car that would ascend back up to the surface. Despite my hesitation, I continued to take cowardly steps into the open area. Knowing full well of my exposure and how vulnerable that could potentially make me, I figured it was worth it. Now that I think of it, I don’t really know what was going through my mind. No matter how much care I put into the movements, they always felt too loud. They were all episodic but painstakingly loud. I needed them to produce less than just a quiet crunch, I needed to be muted entirely. I clenched my fists as I pursued the security of the elevator-like doors. 

Crunch

On the contrary to the cold environment clinging to the wetness of my clothes, my skin burned. The hairs on my body stood straight, my blood ran beyond hot. As my body fight or flight response encouraged me to escape, I defied all of it as I turned slowly. Josh was hunched over, allowing his elongated limbs to rest on the rocky ground. Jerking his body over it was clear he was consuming something. The squishing sounds of meat slurped through its broken yet sharp teeth. The urge to leave had caused the body I owned to move without my permission. I took a silent step closer to the elevator cart. 

Crunch 

I took another step away.

Crunch

My mind was calculating how many steps there were before I was able to slam the doors behind and spam the button with my frostbitten hands.

Thwip

A sudden pressure on my back had let me know I bumped into something. My eyes nearly popped out of my sockets as I turned to see where it had come from. It was a view I would never wish anyone to see. Not even my worst enemy would deserve to witness what I had to. At first it looked like a stump, one that your mom would make you sit on for family pictures. The dimness of the room made it difficult to see but the most clear thing about it was the cloudy grey eyes that rolled back, glistening in the haunting light. It wasn’t long after that when I realized I had been making eye contact with a severed head. It wasn't just any face, I recognized it.  It was the same one smiling in the prom picture cracked by the long span of time. This is where Beth Washington had been for the past two years. Wearing the same clothes that she disappeared in. The torso and head had been two separated pieces. Her torso wore a bright hot pink winter coat. The thought made me want to throw up, her young innocence shown through her sense of style. I gazed back down at the dirtied face. Her once bronzed glowy skin was now a cool grey. The fall had shown on her face. The scars on it had healed to a certain extent before she inevitably passed away. Despite the sudden plunge into the cavern, her grey beanie remained on her head.

Tearing my gaze away from Beth’s corpse, the monstrous Josh had turned at the same time as me, mirroring my movements. I almost expected for his expression to turn to a smile, almost as if the creature had the capacity to understand the malice of what he was doing. Somehow the emotionless expression as he contorts his body to charge after me was worse. I didn’t have enough time to think much about it, my body jolted into motion as I darted for the elevator doors. Josh had thought to do the same with the close space that was in between us. He was fast. The fastness was the closest thing I’d experience to being chased by a jaguar. My feet skidded across the ground as I entered the elevator, causing me to topple onto the ground before desperately grasping at the doors. 

Josh had clung to the half closed door, making it nearly impossible to clip the gate completely closed. The screeches and squeals combined with the slamming of the metal hatch only left me with willpower to motivate myself. The pruney beast had rocked back and forth, longing for his entrance as the gate shook violently. Pulling a muscle or two in my back, I hauled the door closed, snapping my ring finger in the gate before I was able to clip it shut and smush it in the button for my ascension. Swearing loudly, the elevator laboriously climbed up the levels. The stubborn Josh clung onto for as long as he could, causing the lift to sway back and forth and occasionally dip. I looked to my hand, drenched in my vermilion blood.

The elevator had finally come to a stop, the elevator doors had opened by themselves. Like an idiot, I didn’t think before stepping forward and running into the middle of the cavern while lighting one of the flares that was in my pocket. Soon I found that to be a grave mistake once looking up from the ground and another one just like Josh. Similar to him at least, but it was nude and much taller than him. Completely hairless and its skin shriveled to cling to their bones, It shrieked. Snapping me out of my trance, I made yet another run for it. Without looking back, I could tell that Josh was starting to catch up as well. Not knowing how that was even possible, I took a series of turns that would take me to yet another mining site. 

At last, I was able to see the outdoors with the opening into the conveyor belt. As I approached a pile of barrels, I looked to my right to see the bald creature. Snatching one of the barrels causing it to fall to the ground, I watched as a lush liquid poured out of it. Almost as if I had it planned, I threw the flare in my hand in the gas as I jumped onto the conveyor belt, causing the aged wood that I worked so hard to protect to burst into flames. With a final screech from two vessels, I knew my night of terror was over. 

After making it to level ground, I trudged my way to the nearest building and got lucky enough to call for help. The authorities were called and I was taken into custody. The items that had led me into the situation were now pieces of evidence, thus opening the investigation back up. I waited for my ride to come by, which was a long time considering how far the distance between my work and the mountains were. I stepped into the restroom and nearly gasped out loud once seeing my reflection. Granted, it’s something I never paid much attention to but I looked horrible. My hair looked greasy and stuck in several different places while my face was shaded with dirt. For lack of better phrasing, I looked like I went through the ringer. Dispensing the soap into my hands, I rubbed the grime from underneath my finger tips before moving onto my face. I let my thoughts wander as I cleaned my face, trying to fully comprehend what had happened. As I continued to think, I couldn’t help but remember something odd once I saw the creature crawl alongside the wall before I poured the gas onto the floor. Of course I could be wrong, seeing as how fast everything was going. But, I could’ve sworn that I saw a black mark on its shoulder. One that was detailed and with purpose, or even possibly a butterfly.

1joerxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1joerxa/torn_between_mba_and_mbpmain_draw_is_nanotexture/,Torn between MBA and MBP—main draw is nano-texture screen. Help me decide?,"Hey folks,

I’m stuck trying to choose between the new MacBook Air and the 14” MacBook Pro, and I could really use some perspective.

I’ve gone to the Apple Store *twice* now just to compare the displays—MBA, standard MBP, and the MBP with the nano-texture screen. And that nano-texture screen is **so** nice. The reduction in reflections is noticeable and really appealing. I often work outside or near windows, and screen glare is one of those mild-but-persistent annoyances that gets under my skin. The nano-texture just fixes that.

But here’s the dilemma:

• **MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14”, nano-texture)** – Refurb model is $1,999 from Apple:

[link](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/G1FEELL/A/Refurbished-14-inch-MacBook-Pro-Apple-M4-Pro-Chip-with-12%E2%80%91Core-CPU-and-16%E2%80%91Core-GPU-Nano-texture-display-Space-Black?afid=p239%7C1318565&cid=aos-us-aff-ir-1318565)

12-core CPU / 16-core GPU / 24GB memory / 1TB storage / nano-texture display

• **MacBook Air (M4, 13”, Sky Blue)** – $1,479 with education discount:

[link](https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-sky-blue-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-10-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb)

10-core CPU/GPU / 24GB memory / 1TB storage / no nano-texture

What I actually do:

• Standard office/research work (email, writing, Zoom, multitasking, coding/some big data stuff)

• Outdoor work fairly often (coffee shops, patios, etc.)

• Light gaming (Sims 4, maybe InZoi if it comes to Mac, or via GeForce Now)

A few other thoughts:

• I’ve only used MBPs since 2011, and I think I’ve subconsciously convinced myself the MBA is “too weak,” but that might be outdated thinking.

• Nano-texture is basically the one thing keeping me leaning toward the Pro.

• MBA would be noticeably lighter, cheaper, and still powerful.

• The MBA could also get cheaper if Apple starts offering refurbished M4 units in a few months.

• Is there any chance nano-texture comes to the Air line in the future?

• Is it overkill to pay $500+ more *mostly* for the display, given my actual use?



**TL;DR:** I want a Mac with 24GB memory and 1TB storage. The M4 MacBook Air is probably more than enough for my needs (standard office work + light gaming), but I work outside often and really love the nano-texture screen on the M4 Pro. Is the $500+ price difference worth it *just* for that display? Should I wait for a refurb MBA instead?

I already lost 15 pounds and reached my goal, my blood tests are on point (I legit solved my lifelong anemia when I lost weight) and in general I feel good. I don’t workout so maybe that’s why I dont feel the effects of my low protein diet.

# First Things’ First:

Maybe you’re used to all of this now, but my attempt is to share an older style of gaming news post. Something maybe a lil bit like the old gaming blogs / news sites that the internet used to have. Casual, opinion-based, image-heavy and maybe-filled-with-things-you-already-spotted.

This week’s edition is *far* less themed (you’ll notice the last few have been a bit Steam Deck-oriented) than those before. This one is *purely* interesting little things I’ve spotted. There *is* still Steam Deck content in here, but not as that’s-it-folks as the last was.

I hope you might grab a coffee, settle in and enjoy these bits and pieces!!!

# Physical Gameboy (DMG) bricks (literally)

Stumbled over an interesting idea: someone who made literal bricks look like original Gameboys. The website linked at the end is murder on the eyes - *seriously, the font used is just straight from Hell itself*. But there is a couple of interesting videos in there too, worth looking at.

Here’s some photos I grabbed to attach here, where the font is far more sane for your eyes:

# The Sony PlayStation 3 has new system update – 4.92 – 19 years after release

The system software update 4.92 improves system performance, according to the patch notes, and also renews the Blu-ray player encryption key to allow for disc playback.

Updates of this sort are an annual occurrence, as the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) encryption key regularly expires - it’s a copyright-protection technology that requires a key to be set on both the disc and the console in order to play new films. Will this affect the process to jailbreak a PS3 (good old HEN)? No, they’re just going to take some time to make it *right*. Here’s a photo for those who are into the jailbreaking scene, and want to read the news:

# Sega is Metacritic’s highest-rated publisher for 2024.

This will probably come as no surprise, on reflection. With games like Metaphor ReFanzio, Persona 3 Reload, Atlus: Unicorn Loverlord, SMTVV…their ‘stable’ of releases for the year was extremely strong.

https://preview.redd.it/ezxcnpj9bpre1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7bd445543fa6f2a0c657793a34ed672eb071e

Interesting to me is seeing how strong Sega is in the industry after pivoting away from hardware/consoles so, so many years ago. Especially considering the ‘talk’ about Xbox’s plans in the future (I know, all *just* talk, but they’re definitely one to keep an eye one)

# KCD II coming to GOG

For those of us who prefer DRM-free gaming (and you *should*) - Kingdom Come Deliverance II is coming to GOG on March 28th! This is wonderfully quick, by memory the first took longer to get to GOG after release on Steam. KCD II has *so* much going to it, the optimization makes it run incredibly well on Steam Deck and is currently sitting at *Very Positive* on Steam, with 53,473 reviews on Steam.

https://preview.redd.it/dhg9ojhbbpre1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=e07b70bce2875103cf543c6e8464ceb8f17d3bfc

I’ve already bought it on Steam, a *rare* buy there since I buy 99% of my games on GOG. And being the wuss I am, I’ve downloaded a few mods on it, too. I love what they’ve done, but some bits are a touch too sim-ish for me.

Regardless, this is just great news to see it coming to GOG!

# Dark and Darker pulled from Epic Games Store

https://preview.redd.it/betmy9ngbpre1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91fea83795e1383b5c0d5814ed32332fd0c6fc9

Dark and Darker has been taken down from Epic Games Store amid ongoing legal dispute.

Developers of Dark & Darker used to work at Nexon, under Nexon they were making a game called Project Q I think, can’t really remember the name, either way, that project got cancelled so the development team decided to just up and leave and continue making the game and eventually it would become Dark & Darker.

Tldr:

The legal issues come from the developers using the information they had from their time working at Nexon, any work they had done under Nexon was deemed Nexon’s property, so when the developers left they started using the same assets for common items, they would recreate systems they made essentially copying their own work, but their own work wasn’t legally theirs. So when Dark & Darker was on the uprising, Nexon sued the devs for Copyright Infringement. That failed but they were on the hook for Corporate Espionage since they took trade secrets and used it in their own product.

# Legacy of Kain

Sadly the Legacy of Kain writer, Jim Curry has passed away. Along with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Curry wrote Akuji: The Heartless and handled marketing for the Gex games.

I’m unsure whether he kept up with the industry or news surrounding Kain, but if he did, it would have been nice for him to see the recent remaster of Legacy of Kain.

Tibia - *the* oldest active MMO is adding a new ‘vocation’ to the game, 28 years after release in 1997. Known more in Brazil, Mexico and Poland as a bit of a cultural phenomenon, it’s had a dedicated and steady player base for all these years. Previously the vocations were:

* Knights
* Druids
* Paladins
* Sorcerers

But now a new one is coming to the mix: ‘monk’. Interesting news for a VERY niche passion for some!

# FSR4:

AMD have collaborated with Sony to create ‘FSR4’.

For anyone who thinks this may benefit the likes of current gen base PS5, then it is very unlikely as they are using the 2-generation old RDNA 2 architecture which doesn’t even have the required AI Hardware cores to run PSSR let alone the heavier FSR 4.

This collaboration, project amethyst is likely going to benefit console gamers likely for the next generation with PlayStation 6.

# RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business

One of the most surprising ‘AA’ games we saw recently in 2023 was RoboCop. The dev is known for their take on '80’s cinema / games of that subject (having done the same for Terminator), and Rogue City took a lot of gamers by surprise.

It played extremely well on the Steam Deck, was nicely optimized, and felt extremely polished for a (admittedly ‘on rails’) game of their budget.

1joeoxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/1joeoxb/how_to_successfully_import_bean_powder_important/,How to successfully import bean powder (important tips from Eun-sang on what not to do),"So, you've obtained a suspiciously large amount of highly coveted **bean powder** and wish to successfully ~~smuggle~~ import it to the United States? Who could blame you, your long-lost relative will surely love your thoughtful gift! After all, soybean powder is highly nutritional and great as a protein supplement. It's the perfect fuel needed to power through the day, being chased by baddies in the scorching Californian sunshine.

But how do you import bean powder without getting caught up in red tape or customs (k)drama? Thankfully, our hero, **Eun-sang** is here with some great tips on what (not) to do!

**PHASE ONE: Preparation**

First things first, make sure you know exactly what you're importing! The best bean powder is made by an experienced Ajumma (아줌마) and packed in a nondescript plastic bag. That's how you know it's *quality*. Bonus points if it's shaped like a brick or wrapped in multiple layers of plastic - you don't want it to accidentally spill all over the airport before you even board the plane!

https://preview.redd.it/ndydiueoc3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df1a319f5cd8be5b449359f34961ee5e36fdbce

**PHASE TWO: On the plane**

The flight will likely be uneventful, but once the plane nears US, the stewardess might instruct you to fill in the customs declaration form. It will be in multiple languages, but make sure to ignore the instructions in your native tongue and challenge yourself with a language you don't know. You're a smart bean powder-laced cookie - you've got this!

https://preview.redd.it/rqd6kw5qc3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41eafbc92a4caac0a5c432876d99defa75728dc

**PHASE THREE: Getting around the airport**

Having exited the plane, the game is on. So many people rushing to make their connection, who knows if three layers of plastic will be enough to protect your precious bean powder. Better strap it to your chest.

https://preview.redd.it/s58qzy4rc3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dc048628ea1320afb01110867ccbb18eab2b983

**PHASE FOUR: The Customs**

You are now at the most crucial part of the journey. It's time to handle the customs officer and prove your bean powder is totally definitely not an illegal substance but a delicious base for many savory and sweet dishes!

When you get stopped by the customs officer, make sure to hand over the declaration you've previously filled in, preferably using a marker and writing in cursive. If they become suspicious and find your bean powder, make sure to look super nervous.

At this point, the customs officer might ask if the contents of the bag are yours.

https://preview.redd.it/vi74pl9uc3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52c4b4215106de103e7266f8e306bed846e5523

**PHASE FIVE: Abandon all sanity**

PANIC. PANIC IMMEDIATELY. Also forget nearly all English you ever learnt in your life. Decide to use your best friend/joker card, aka your trusty guide for tourists which has all the important phrases.

https://preview.redd.it/dirkbcuxc3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=53d54be9de068622c5a44b13ca041529992be1b0

The customs officer might give you a really weird look at this point. Realize things are not going great and stall for time as you attempt to figure out how to explain what bean powder is without mentioning the words ""food"" or ""beans"".

https://preview.redd.it/0fceuvj2d3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d736ff4957b16040d9c8283e271279ce433601a

**PHASE SIX: Ask for help**

Decide that the best course of action is to enlist an unsuspecting fellow traveler into demonstrating that bean powder is actually food. Bonus points if you manage to call over an extremely drunk surfer dude.

https://preview.redd.it/m651qoyjd3se1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c28a2a9e12c57545be544b6f23ec38ab7ef250e

Point him to the bean powder bag in front of an increasingly bemused customs officer. Then watch in disbelief as the overly enthusiastic surfer dude tries to snort up a whole bag of bean powder at once. Wonder how much of the good stuff there was in the bag, as the floor is now completely covered in bean powder.

**PHASE SEVEN: Wing it**

As the ambulance takes the ever-so-slightly swollen surfer dude, awkwardly turn towards the questions officer and make sure to try to explain it was definitely food. You know, the stuff you eat. Not drugs. If need be, mime it.

The customs officer might not fully trust you.  Just explain that there are different ways to eat bean powder, some more unorthodox than others. He might remain slightly doubtful.

**PHASE EIGHT: All is fine**

You might get your passport taken away at this point. Don't worry, that's only because they love you so much, they want you to stay longer!

You will get your bean powder back in 5 to 10 work days once they check its origin. You made it! As a reward, you can finally visit the Californian branch of Mango Six and enjoy the taste of the original Mango Coconut.

As Eun-sang proved, importing bean powder is really easy if you follow these few simple steps!

Hey, MaximizeMe friends! Ever feel like life is a chaotic juggling act where the ball might drop at any moment? 🤹‍♂️ Yeah, I’ve been there! So, let me share a little secret—it's not about adding more hours to your day, but about working with the *energy* you already have.

A few months ago, I stumbled upon a game-changing realization: **Energy Peaks 🏔 > Time Blocks ⏰**. Sounds a bit counterintuitive, right? But stick with me, and I promise you'll get it.

**Let's dive into it:**

- **Morning person? Night owl? Doesn’t matter!** It’s about knowing when you hit your energy peaks. Think about those moments when you feel like a superhero ready to take on the world—those are your power hours. Embrace them!

- **Ditch the blocks and go with the flow:** I used to set rigid time blocks thinking that was the peak of productivity. Spoiler: I was wrong. I realized it’s about aligning tasks with those magical energy peaks. Got a peak at 10 AM? Schedule your brainstorms then. Sluggish at 3 PM? Perfect time for those routine emails.

- **Trial and error is your bestie:** It took a couple of weeks of trial and error to really map out my energy highs and lows. It was a bit of a rollercoaster, but who doesn’t love a good ride? 🎢

- **Energy over efficiency:** On days when coffee can’t even keep you awake, give yourself a break. Use that time for less mentally taxing tasks and save rocket science for when your brain’s firing on all cylinders.

And voilà, those 10 hours I saved? They're now spent doing things that light up my soul—finally finished reading that novel, took my dog on extra-long walks, and *spoiler alert* got my nightly 8 hours of sleep more often. 

Now, I’m not saying time blocking is dead—far from it. It’s more like **they’re best friends with benefits**, working together to make life a bit smoother and you, a whole lot happier.

Does this resonate with anyone? Or am I just a lone wanderer on the energizer bunny path? 😅 Let’s swap stories—what energy hacks are you loving these days?",1,1743456229.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

First pitch is at 9:40 PM ET, which means by the time this game gets interesting, I will already be asleep. I love baseball, but I also love not feeling like a zombie at work the next day. So, I’ll be watching, but around the sixth inning, it’ll just be my subconscious keeping track of the score.

Tonight, we’ve got Jackson Jobe on the mound for the Tigers. He’s young. He’s talented. He’s probably the future of our pitching staff. Which is terrifying. Because now, we have to act like we’re patient and let him develop. But the truth is, if he doesn’t throw seven shutout innings tonight, half the fanbase is going to start yelling about how we should’ve drafted a shortstop instead.

Meanwhile, the Mariners have Emerson Hancock starting. I’ll be honest—I had to Google him. But from what I’ve read, he’s a former first-rounder with potential, which is a fancy baseball term that means “nobody knows if he’s good yet.” And you never want to be the team that accidentally turns a guy like that into a Cy Young winner. The Tigers love doing that. I’ve seen guys with 6.00 ERAs suddenly look like Sandy Koufax against us, and honestly, I’m tired of it.

On offense, we’ve got Spencer Torkelson, who already hit a homer this year, which means we are now expecting him to do that every single game. No pressure, buddy. Riley Greene is swinging a hot bat, and if Kerry Carpenter joins in, we might actually score some runs—unless, of course, we do that thing where we load the bases with no outs and then somehow don’t score, which should honestly be illegal.

So, here we go. Tigers vs. Mariners. A battle of young pitchers, late-night coffee, and the eternal struggle of trying to stay awake past the fifth inning. Will we win? Who knows. Will we irrationally overreact to the outcome? Absolutely.",11,1743456197.0,motorcitykitties,3,0.82,False

I have a lot of passions and hobbies. I do a lot of research into several topics because I enjoy it. I totally understand there is no “objective truth” when it comes to preferences, but I always try to be as informed as possible.

My GF (26F) has brought up that I dismiss the things she likes and come off snobby. She has a fair point as you can like whatever you want and I shouldn’t have a right to tell her otherwise. However, sometimes I like to give recommendations and she doesn’t appreciate it.

For example, she loves Casamigos tequila. I am a big tequila guy. I understand Casamigos uses additives and sugar in their tequila. Amongst critics it’s considered mediocre. I’ve had it a few times and I agree with that sentiment.

When she was making margaritas, I recommended buy a cheaper brand that was known to not use additives. I didn’t explain that at first I just said “hey since we’re mixing the tequila in margaritas let’s get something cheaper. This tequila is really good and it’s much cheaper than Casamigos.”

She said no thanks and proceeded to take the Casamigos off the shelf. I started to explain why I felt the cheaper option would be better. Additives, mixing expensive tequila, etc and she got upset with me.
She said she likes what she likes and doesn’t need me to tell her what she can and can’t like. 

I hope you can understand where I am coming from. I know at the end of the day she is 100% entitled to her opinion and if she wants to buy Casamigos for margaritas knock yourself out. I just want to give my two cents.

This has spanned to other topics. She won’t use my expensive coffee machine that grinds the beans itself because she likes her Keurig. That’s totally fine, but she won’t even try my coffee I make. When I’ve asked if she wants some she always says “I just like my Keurig”. If I talk about how fresh beans are better, she gets upset. 

She really doesn’t appreciate that I act like I know more than her. I know she’s smart and probably smarter than I am. However some topics I know a bit about and I’d like to share.

Seattle is known for the Seattle No

Essentially its about never saying no and lying

When i lived in Seattle i got several coffee offers that never happened, when i met people and we agreed to do something together, it sometimes would not happen and there was often a lame excuse

  
I am from Virginia originally so im used to the directness and this fake friendliness was new to me

People say that its polite to agree to things that you have no intention of doing, but this gives them hope and thus causes suffering when it doesnt happen, if you had not invited them for coffee they would not have gotten hope, if you declined their request to meet, that could potentially result in some minor suffering, but its better than giving them hope which would result in more than minor suffering

Pleasure meeting you is another thing i find to be unethical, if it was a pleasure then most people would want to experience the pleasure again, but they dont so that should mean it wasnt a pleasure

Some people have said they say it because its polite, but that would imply saying a simple bye/ adios would be impolite which is illogical

If you are asked to meet and you say you are busy when you are not, thus you are lying and not respecting the other individual enough to be truthful with them, agreed?

Terminating a friendship, most people ghost, but i feel the right thing to do is to tell them why you are terminating it

Canceling plans, i believe when you agree to something you should do it provided you arent in an accident or something, if i agreed to hang but im feeling lazy or something i feel its my duty to honor the agreement and still go, if perhaps another opportunity arose and i wanted to do that instead i would ask the other party if it was alright to reschedule and i feel i should tell them why instead of saying i was busy, because technically i dont have to go to this other opportunity i am choosing to

Sticking to the agreed time, if i agree to meet with an individual at 8, i believe i should be there at 7:45 so that i am there when i said i would be, obviously there could be some situation which prevents me from being their on time but aside from that i believe you should do as you say in regards to the clock

* 30 years old, male, UK born and raised 🇬🇧
* Full time electronics product tester (it's a rad job) 🧑‍💻
* PC / Steam Deck / Switch gamer🎮
* Travelled to a few countries (USA, Japan, Czech Republic) ✈️
* Has 2 tattoos 😎
* Met 3 people from Reddit IRL 😁
* Laid back and easy to talk to - uses emojis a lot (can you tell?)

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR**

I'm very social and love to text (or better yet, voice call!) - ideally I'd like to make some new friends who I can talk with on the daily, if you also want to play games that'll be neat too! 

I love to screen share, so watching me play games or watching shows / movies / YouTube together is also on the cards, even if that means just sitting in a call together 😁

If you're based in the UK, big bonus points - you should deffo message, otherwise I'm happy to talk to anyone from anywhere. I'd like to have a little back and forth on Reddit first before possibly moving to another platform (i.e Discord) 

Direct messages are **preferred**, but instant chat requests are OK too! How about a little intro, or tell me something funny to get the conversation started! 

I'll also include this little [vocaroo recording](https://voca.ro/1lvSMfWLU7Or) for the folk who like that? 😅",1,1743455518.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False

Seriously please rate, I’m sober from *all* other substances now and coffee is just my thing. It’s routine, I like the bitterness and it replaced the harsh taste of alcohol for me. I literally have a cup 6 days a week without fail. 

Anyway I’ve heard it triggers episodes but I think I’ll go crazy without that consistency every morning. Is it really *that* bad??

1joe9ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1joe9ak/whitehead_break_out_on_chin_after_eating_meat/,Whitehead break out on chin after eating meat,"In November I started breaking out in white heads all over my chin (and only my chin) about 10-12hrs after eating pork or beef. I don't eat them a whole lot anyways so have cut them out but anytime i've had it since then i can count on the breakout to happen and last about 24-48hrs and go away on it's own. I have clear skin and no problems with acne. I went to the doctor last week to ask about why this is happening in my body after I ate organic no hormone added ground turkey (always been fine eating) and it happened again but worse than before. I've been tracking this long enough to know the only common denominater in the breakouts is the meat.

 My hormones and metobolic panel came back ""normal"" so the doctor didn't address it but did mention my liver enzymes were really high and suggested liver damage. I think it's the new Ryze mushroom coffee i started this month because I've had stomach (liver pain it turned out) pains on the days I drank it but didn't realize it was possibly the cause. I've cut it out of my diet and the stomach pains have stopped so hoping the liver just heals on it's own now. The doctor gave me no answers to the original issues I was there for so I'm back to square one. 

Other possible but maybe not connected symptoms... 
fatigue, trouble losing weight even though i am 138lb clean healthy diet and regularly workout, i hold inflamation in my face and and my body not so much my stomach area, I've had chronic mucus throat clearing since I got covid in 2020 (been to multiple doctors including an ent with two scopes up my noise down my throat/ct scan, several allergy meds with no signs of whats causing it so have kind of given up on this mystery) every once in awhile maybe every 3 months my hands and wrists swell and my palms get itchy while having dry patches show up under my nose and on my upper eyelids below my brow (this one's weird and haven't found any triggers that cause it) 

I am 32, have asthma that was pretty dormant before covid but now acts up with excersise here and there but otherwise healthy. I am at a loss for whats going on and really not sure what direction to go or what symptoms are relevant or linked to eachother. I feel like I've had no luck with doctors especially when I test normal and healthy on blood tests. I also feel like it's hard to start with a new doctor when you have all these mild symptoms that could or couldn't be related they look at you like you're crazy lol so I've just been dealing with it all. I'm worried if i keep toughing it out I may become allergic alltogether to meat and I'm not ready for that life lol. Does anyone know what I should be looking into? I feel defeated after having hope at last weeks doctors visit. ",1,1743455382.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False
1joe84l,https://www.reddit.com/r/2sentence2horror/comments/1joe84l/heres_my_catalogue/,Here's my catalogue.,"1. I like looking at leaves. But by leaves, I mean knifes.
2. I high-fived my baby brother. He died in the womb.
3. I looked up at the clouds, grinning as me and my little brother debated which shapes they took. ”That one looks like a mushroom,” said my brother.
4. “I’m having trouble finding the vein,” said the nurse as she tried to draw my blood. Eighteen tries in and she still hasn’t realized I don’t have any veins.
5. The tall man handed me a balloon. He was not my dad.
6. Do you ever look at the sky and think, how beautiful. Well, when I look at the sky all I think about is the day it rained blood.
7. I took the sandwich from my friend and said, “Thanks, yum this is good.” “That's great, it’s peanut butter and red food dye,” she laughed as my throat closed.
8. “Where are we,” asked my cousin. Freddy Fazbear’s pizzeria.
9. I was confused as to why my basketball was leaving red puddles on the ground every time I dribbled it. It was a newborn.
10. The carousel, you remember it right, that thing that turned around and around and never stopped; the horses going up and down over and over. Well, now it’s a memory of a bygone age, replaced by phones in the hands of the kids.
11. My mom’s voice left years ago. Now all I hear from her mouth are screams.
12. “Ow,” I said as I stepped on what I thought were Legos. They were deer teeth.
13. I, an acclaimed horror writer trying to reclaim his former glory, was crippled by writers block, something I had struggled with for some time, because of my disease. So I started drawing from my own real-life experiences, ones I myself caused, stories of those I brutally killed, only for the purpose of writing them into horror stories, which was my profession.
14. ”Nice shirt,” said the kid who claimed he was not autistic I was chaperoning at the amusement park. It was a plain black shirt.
15. “Happy Halloween,” I said to the zombie that sat next to me at the bus stop. It was September.
16. “Would you like seconds sweetie?” asked the boy’s mother as she cleaned up after dinner. She smiled as she noticed he couldn’t respond through the foam.
17. I sat next to my grandpa as he finished six mini cokes. “Refreshing,” he said as I watched the life drain from his eyes.
18. I woke up yesterday with a pounding headache. I reached up and realized I had no head.
19. ”Look at that one mommy,” exclaimed the boy at the zoo. I looked back at the boy, unable to tell him that I had been transformed into a polar bear by a mad scientist who wanted zoo money.
20. “Blink, and you’ll miss it,” they all said. I blinked and now I’m alone in a white void.
21. “What is up with this coffee?” exclaimed my husband after taking a sip. Only forty seconds left until the cyanide kicks in.
22. I thought space aliens didn’t exist. They do.
23. I looked at the man with a name tag that read “Crusty Dan” as he stopped filling my tank at two-thirds full and asked him “Why only two-thirds?” “The last third is for the blood,” he said as he slit my throat.
24. Yeah, you’re probably wondering why I’m here. Well, it's a long story… then the nukes hit America and I never finished the movie.
25. “And your final wish, sir?” ”800 billion more flying spiders.”
26. I shoved his head into the deep fryer after a long struggle. Next time, maybe don’t forget my Polynesian sauce.
27. I discovered a frequency that makes people suicidal. I played it over the speakers at Walmart.
28. I asked her why she would do such a thing as she ran our child's decapitated head over with the lawn mower. “Womp womp,” was all she said.
29. The next sentence is the scariest sentence ever written.
30. Why do we constrain ourselves to two sentences? Don’t we all know that good horror comes from breaking the norms, escaping the futility of life for the scare of the moment, believing for a second that yes though life is awful it could be worse, believing that it is possible to escape, and yet this is still but two sentences.
31. The octopus found a way to get out of the jar. The jar was actually my stomach and the octopus ripped me open and killed my family.
32. “This ketchup tastes weird,” exclaimed my cousin after eating the ketchup. ”Probably because it's 99% blood and 1% ketchup,” I replied.
33. I heard a knock at the door. I opened the door and was shocked by what I saw.
34. “AHHHH MY ENTRAILS,” screamed the guy with no stomach. ”That’s because I took them.”
35. You know, blood. Yep and gore.
36. Boo. Whats more scary, the word boo, or the fact that it’s an incomplete sentence.
37. “Knock Knock,” the door said as I said, “Who’s there?” “Jimmy Buffet,” said the door… but Jimmy Buffet is dead.",1,1743455299.0,2sentence2horror,0,1.0,False

\---------------------------------

The next day after the dreams, Jan woke up with a sense of not belonging to this body. As if it wasn’t only his any more.

So he decided to tackle the day the best way he could, got himself some coffee and went to continue working remaking the city.

Specially taking the asphalt off and getting the line of peach and apple trees, with some lemon tree in the middle.

He had already found and prepared the cuttings, all that was left was opening the road and preparing the soil.



Nothing like destroying the road with an excavator to raise one’s spirits.



By midday he already had done the whole kilometer of the Via Europa, one lane completely opened and the soil prepared, all that was left for the next couple of days would be to transplant the cuttings. He also had thought to install a system of automatic irrigation, might as well begin with the trees.

He sat down to have lunch right next to the vehicle he had used to bring the cuttings, a small van. Fuel was going to be still usable during the first year so, he might as well use as much as he can now, later on was going to get difficult.



While eating he took out his laptop, he had already installed big wireless access points in the roof of specific buildings. Looking back, he realized now how much work he had done while pushing forward to try to escape the pain.

He smiled and kept working on it, since internet was still working he easily found his way on information about what he would need to do the irrigation system.



Working on problems, preparing projects, analyzing and solving tasks, that always calmed his soul. To just focus on the issue at hand and working through it, the universe be damned.



It started to get dark, and he went to the apartment that was his current home. The one with the view and all the stuff spread out throughout the building.

The one he was kind of sharing with a vampire, above all the things that could happen.



He entered the apartment, the sun slowly disappearing on the mountains, and he saw there were three of them sitting on the couch and softly chatting.

“*This is starting to get a bit overboard, isn’t it?” –* he exclaimed.



“*We have to have a chat” –* said Hathor – *“And the other one is my youngest. If you don’t mind indulging me, he’s at the last phase of his training and you are the only human I can count in.” –* she smiled at him – *“Besides, if he does make a mistake and bites you” –* she continued, looking at the young guy sitting by her side – *“He will just burst into flames, so I’ve been told. Cause that is what happens if you bite a phoenix.” –* she finished, piercing him with her gaze.



“*I don’t really see the point but it’s not as if I can fight you, without damning the whole world now that I know about it” –* Jan said while approaching the free individual couch they had nicely left alone. – *“So, what do you want know? Because yes, I’ve remembered some stuff, and no, I’m not going to fuck the world up. I’m going to do my very best in leaving a beautiful world that she and my baby would’ve loved to see growing up”*

“*And you know why? Because I’ve seen it in those lives, is not just that what we do in this live echoes in eternity, it will affect the next ones. Fucking Karma is real, bitches!” –* he went on



To his surprise and that of everybody around, Hathor let out a guffaw.

“*Oh we know kid, we old creatures know, that’s also why none of us is eager to leave this world, because there will be a lot to pay”*

“*But that’s not why I wanted to chat after you woke up” –* she continued – *“Not only I mean. Is nice and good to know what your aspirations are, specially with the world how it is, so any collaboration is greatly appreciated. And I honestly love what you’re doing with the place, so much I have already instructed my people to start working in that, how did you call it? Oh yes! Solarpunk future. I really like that term and the implications”* ­- she smiled and paused.

“*No my dear, I am physically here, in this moment, to look you in the eye and gauge the status of the phoenix and yourself.” –* she finished, and Jan felt the pressure of her intense gaze.



After a few seconds of intense silence, she relaxed and smiled.

“*Good! If he was a cat I bet he would be purring. You have not only a good head but a good heart on you as well, it’s a shame that we had to meet under this circumstances”*



She stood up, and stretched out smiling, much to the astonished looks from everyone present.

“*What! Can a girl not relax a bit? You guys have no idea, it has been stressful doing all the jobs and organization with the background that one guy could completely fuck everything up in like two seconds.”*



She stretched out a little bit more, relaxing legs and arms under the stunned looks of everyone else, who didn’t knew how to act here, and then went back to the couch and sat.

“*Ok, that felt good, and now for the third reason of me coming here, is to let you know that the Sisters are coming to town” –* she said, changing into a more serious tone

“*Now, you’ll be about to ask, what or who are the Sisters? Well, to all effects they are what you understand as necromancers” –* she quickly looked at Steven – *“And don’t make go into it, with the things he has read, if I start describing their abilities he will scream it soon enough” –* then looked back to Jan

“*But not the kind of necromancer that you have read, not the stereotype though. They can do those stereotypical spells if they do wish, but their focus is in helping lost souls to cross over.*

*Every now and then though, they find a soul that is not lost, not exactly, and can be recovered without pain or pending issues, they can bring back the body and reanimate its soul.*

“*They do so because there’s always a Time Mage with them, and I don’t want to go into discussions about how Time magic works, it gives me a headache. Suffice to say that the body of a 4 year old child, can become a living 16 year old teenager with magic knowledge in a matter of months.*



“*And someone here” –* she continued, looking at Steven – *“Had contacted them and asked them to come here and look upon the souls of your loved ones”*

“*In any case, suffice to say that the Sisters will always do what they think is better for the souls, but a chance might have been given”*



Jan sat back, trying to make sense of what she was telling him.



“*You’re telling me that, those Sisters, can help me say goodbye?” –* he asked

Hathor bursted out laughing once more.

“*Of all the things to ask and you go for that, yeah sure, I’m pretty sure they can at least help you say goodbye”*



“*And where are these Sisters now?” –* Jan asked – *“Because I’d very much like to have a chat with them”*



The sun had completely fallen by now and it was getting darker, Hathor stood up and close her eyes. Letting the magic of the world speak to her.

She then smiled.

“*Found them, and there’s a clear path that way, I can take you in seconds.” –* she said

Jan stood up.

“*What are we waiting for?” –* he asked



“*Wait, I don’t know the limits of the phoenix protection so I want you, with your words, to allow me to transport your body, by any means necessary” –* she said, looking at him fiercely – *“I don’t want to go into specifics with the way we will move, but I need your consent because chances are a human body won’t very much like that, it could be even painful.”*

“*I trust you. You have been nothing but honest up until now, and I know you’ve allowed me more space that you would have preferred, I sensed your watching every now and then” –* Jan said smiling at her – *“I allow Hathor, here present, to use whatever means necessary and transport me and herself to where the Sisters are currently staying”*

“*Satisfied?” –* he said looking at her



As a response she approached him, and much to his surprise, hugged him.

“*This way is much easier” –* she whispered in his ear, and everything went black.



In the Shadow world, Hathor could go from one side of the planet to the other provided there were enough connected shadows. Leaving it and entering again was too tiring so she always found ways to go without leaving it once inside.

They had to do a bit of twists and turns, but the amount of trees in the catalan coast was really helpful and provided much necessary shadow.

A few seconds after they left the apartment, they appeared between the forest and the streets of Sant Andreu de Llavaneres, the nearest village.



Still, all that distance in a few seconds. Jan was still trying to find his bearings.

“*Well, a bit of dizziness is to be expected, but you’re doing much better than I thought”* ­- Hathor said. – *“Let’s go, they’re not far, but I couldn’t take you straight to them”*



As they were walking they heard the soft noise of voices quietly chatting. As they left the street and arrive to a plaza, they found themselves in front of three characters, two women and a man.

The women, wearing a black habit on top, with jeans and boots.

The man, pale as snow and with disturbingly shining yellow eyes, he was wearing black cargo pants with a leather jacket and was looking directly at them.



“*And just in time! How much further have you seen man?” –* said one of the women.

As a response, the pale man just laughed.



“*It’s been a while Mage”* – said Hathor, a curious respect showing in her voice – *“And is a pleasure to meet you Sisters”*

They all just nodded and extended their arm.



“*Come, sit with us, you haven’t traveled to here just to stand up, did you?” –* one of the Sisters said – *“And you, Jan I think it is, I’m Sister Marie. Come, tell us your history, why have you come” –* she continued with a smile

Jan sat by their side, and somehow, started talking.

I'm starting a business that focuses on helping job seekers.

After applying to hundreds of jobs, I know how demoralizing and exhausting the process can be. You put in all that effort, and most of the time, you don’t even get a response. Recently, I applied for a job where the company offered a free coffee from a local café as a small gesture of appreciation—and for the first time, I felt seen and valued.

That moment sparked an idea.

With a background in marketing and sales, I understand the power of rewards and incentives. I believe that when people are applying for jobs, often at a low point emotionally—a simple gesture of gratitude from a company can completely change how that company is perceived.

My plan is to partner with local recruiting firms and small businesses to offer exclusive perks to applicants like discounts, freebies, or other small rewards, as a way to say, “Thanks for applying, don’t give up.”

This would be great for companies that offer services to help job seekers and potential clothing brands to ""Help you get ready for your big interview."" 

I already know a few SMEs willing to pay a flat fee to provide these rewards to job seekers, helping to keep morale up while building goodwill for their brand.

Right now, I’m developing a system to track engagement, reward usage, and clicks so I can eventually monetize the platform. But for now, I’m looking for feedback on the idea, what do you think?",1,1743454783.0,Business_Ideas,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on an old Mazzer grinder, which I believe is a Major Grocery model, thanks to the great suggestions from this community! Now, I'd love to identify the exact model and production era to better understand its history and possibly find an exploded diagram or manual for maintenance.

I've attached some pictures—if anyone has experience with vintage Mazzers, I'd really appreciate any insights! Are there any distinguishing features or serial number locations that could help pinpoint the model and year?

Additionally, I'm looking for two modifications:

A way to tilt the grinder forward a few degrees to help coffee exit more cleanly in line with the chute.

A blower that fits over the hopper. I’ve only found 12cm versions, but this one seems to need a 20cm version. I’d prefer a solution that doesn’t require removing the top hopper to fit a smaller blower.

I hope you're having a wonderful day today. A couple of days ago I went to a coffee shop pop up on a mall in a nearby city that sells something they call ""blue matcha"". 
They had two featured options for their drinks, ""blue matcha"" which was just butterfly pea flower in a powder form, and is blue, and ""ceremonial matcha"" which they described it as ""the green matcha""...lol. I decided to get two drinks because I was curious. The first one being a pistachio milk matcha latte and the other drink was a berry ""blue matcha"" latte with oat milk. they were $10 each, I was asking them questions like ""why does blue matcha have matcha included in it's name if it's not really matcha?"" which then they answered that it's because of their similar benefits. the person I was with, sensed that they were getting annoyed by my questions but I was genuinely curious about this. ""Blue matcha"" is very different from matcha, it comes from a different plant, it doesn't contain caffeine, doesn't have L-theanine and it isn't grown in Japan nor does it share the same cultural origins... I fear that this is another one of those cases where matcha is being gentrified but i'm genuinely very confused and pardon my ignorance in advance.
I want to know all of your opinions on this topic because it really intrigues me. I have been drinking matcha for years now and I haven't heard about this ""blue matcha"" before until very recently. ",4,1743454480.0,MatchaEverything,2,1.0,False
1jodvpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jodvpd/shitty_bestie_advice/,shitty bestie advice?,"howdy everyone. i’m back again and this time for something else. i really need some advice here. this is a HEFTY story so buckle up. for privacy, all names will be changed. the “incidents” will be mentioned as i remember them (im probably forgetting some things).

i (21f) was friends with a girl who we’ll call Beth (21f). Beth and i met back in 7th grade. we weren’t really friends then because she was friends with girls who bullied the shit out of me. fast forward to October 2023, she and i start hanging out and becoming best friends. i was dating a guy who we’ll call Jared (20m) and she had already been dating a guy who we’ll call Brett (mid 20’s m). 

 incident 1 & 2: i got engaged. Beth helped Jared plan the whole thing and even ruined it by showing me the ring that was picked out, told when it was happening, where, etc. Beth drove us to a location where the proposal was happening, as Jared didnt have a car (military and was leaving the city soon) and i had just moved back to said city. we arrive, the proposal happens, i said yes, we leave. here’s where it gets really iffy… BETH IS UPSET THE ENTIRE TIME. Jared takes me to Texas Roadhouse to celebrate (my fav restaurant) and the entire way there, Beth is clearly upset. we get out the car, i go to shut the door, home girl SPEEDS away and i nearly broke my nail and lemme tell ya, that shit HURTS. i leave it be, we go inside, we leave, Beth picks us up as we were staying at her house that night. i ask Beth what’s wrong and she says “you guys haven’t even been together that long and you’re engaged before i am.” (Beth and Brett had been together for nearly 2 years and Jared and i had been together for less… we won’t talk about how long.) maybe it’s just me but you’re supposed to be happy for your best friend when it comes to something as big as that, correct???

incident 3: Beth is from the state we were living in but she had temporarily moved to NC awhile back and then moved back to our city a little after she began dating Brett. her family still lived in NC so we took a 7 hour road trip to go see them. we left and went back again (Christmas 2023). Jared knew how much i wanted to go back so he told Beth he’d pay for the airbnb as long as she drove. at this point, Jared has already left the state and is on base on a whole different CONTINENT. we get to the airbnb and you’d think i’d get the master bedroom as Jared is the one who paid for the airbnb as a GIFT TO ME, but no, we’re all sadly mistaken. Beth decides to take the room for herself. like HELLO?!?! i wouldn’t have had a problem with her taking the master bedroom had she just asked, but NOOO. home girl took it upon herself to take it, and for what? driving 7 hours? babes… i offered to switch seats with you and drive if it was needed/wanted. i then tell her i wanted the master bedroom and she gets all huffy and puffy about it. 

incident 4: this one im just a lil salty about. her birthday is December 1st, mine is January 7th. i bought her some cupcakes and some other stuff for her birthday. i posted her, bought her gifts, took her to breakfast, and stayed over at her apartment with her. my birthday rolls around, i only get a happy birthday. other people may think “don’t be that girl” but honestly, that hurt my feelings a little bit! one of my love languages is gift giving and i don’t expect a gift or anything but she couldn’t even come and see me for my birthday? NOW, i may be the asshole here because Brett is also in the military but he’s stationed in said city. he came back from an 8 month long deployment 2 days before my birthday and that’s perfectly fine. i understand she wants to see him, but he was busy with his friend on my birthday and she couldn’t come see me?

incident 5: my wedding comes up! i asked her to be my MOH and she said yes. she didn’t help plan my wedding at all and didn’t even attend because of Brett. Brett is the kinda guy who tells Beth he hates people being in his home (understandable) but he can have his friends over but she can’t? and why can’t they attend MY wedding together even tho they both went to Brett’s best friends wedding together and Brett was the best man! i had a micro wedding and not even 20 people were there. y’all. i didn’t have a MOH or bridesmaids. Jared didn’t have a best man or groomsmen. 

incident 6: i moved away from the city and then back, and into the same apartment complex Beth lives in (her idea). i finally get a vehicle (yay me!!). Beth and i were supposed to go get coffee together. i sit outside waiting for her, she tells me “i have to switch out my laundry, hold on,” so i say okay and i turn on the car, i did not turn the ignition on, just the battery. i wait about 10 mins and text her and she tells me “im washing up these dishes in the sink real quick, hold on,” so i say okay and continue to wait. i sit about 15 mins. i decide she’s not coming down within the next 5 mins so i turn the car off and text her. she tells me she’s gotta walk her dog and then she’ll be done. it’s getting HOT at this point. this was June 2024 and we live in the very south of the US. ITS AS HOT AS BALLS OUTSIDE so i turn the car on, not the ignition. i ask where she’s at and she tells me she’s changing shoes so i sit about 10 mins. i tell her im just gonna go because i had errands to run anyway. i go to start my car and it’s not starting. i killed the battery waiting 45 MINUTES for Beth. i go back inside my apartment PISSED. at this point i am livid. i’m more mad than a toddler who just got told no more candy. i understand it’s my fault for not just turning over the ignition but at the same time, how can you be that bad about chores and time management? either yes you can go or no you cannot. it can’t be both. 

incident 7: Beth no longer has a car and Brett leaves at 5:30 or so for work so he takes the truck. i have insomnia, i don’t have to work, i stay up all night. Beth would ask that i take her to work so of course i said yes. i’d see her long enough for probably 4 or 5 months only to take her to work. she works right up the road. it’s a 5 min drive. i’d always ask to go to the club house to play pool or go to the pool to swim or even go to the gym and she’d tell me she’s had so many chores to take care of. first of all, why is Brett not helping you if you both work and both pay bills? during the time of us being besties, she unfriended a girl and would talk HELLA shit about her to me just for her to turn around and be friends with the girl again all because they worked at the same place??? 

now… at this point (December 2024), i moved out of my apartment and in with my boyfriend who we’ll call Ty (21m). i cut Beth off. i told her im done being friends with a fake heifer like herself. she says okay and leaves me alone. you can’t even fight for our friendship? bye babes. good fucking riddance. currently (March 2025), i live in another city but the same state. i have tried fixing our friendship countless times because truthfully, she’s the only friend i have. i have tried forgetting everything that happened and tried starting over. i have a big heart and have stood up for her to my family when she didn’t make it for my wedding. i pushed my wedding to the side to tend to her as a friend. i was there when she cried over Brett being gone and she did the same for me. but at times i needed her the most, she was never fucking there. 

for reference, i’m a short chunky lady. i’m not the prettiest but i don’t think im ugly at all. i’m not super cool or anything but im very sweet if you deserve it. i wear my heart on my sleeve and i care a lot especially when i shouldnt. i have the utmost hardest time making friends and im an ass kisser, but in a good way. i try to help everyone and i try to be there when im needed or wanted. i’m kinda funny. i am the DUFF if you will. my point is that i have a harder time making friends than others and i always have.

anyway, to jump over a fucking book, i still miss her as a friend and it sucks not having any friends. i literally have no one. i am not exaggerating. and there are times where i wanna text her and try to be friends again but i know that she isn’t good for me. it just sucks so so much not having any friends. i have my family and Ty. (Jared and i are getting divorced because plot twist, im 90% he’s into men and it’s hard to love someone who isn’t around. i haven’t seen him in almost a year. Jared also told Beth that he felt obligated to propose because we had sex.) any advice???",2,1743454457.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

My brain feels so scrambled right now. 

So I’ll start with what’s happening now, I am No longer living at home and 2 of my siblings were just recently put into group homes after an incident where my mother threatened them with an axe and strangled my siblings. There was forensic evidence and pictures gathered and my mother is in jail right now awaiting trial. 
here’s where my mothers years of manipulation ingrained into my brain start messing with me. right before my mother was arrested she sent me a slew of messages basically with “her side of the story”. I’ve witnessed her twist things a million times but it still works on me and this time i wasn’t home when this happened so i feel more vulnerable. Obviously i’ve seen the bruises, i mean he’ll i’ve been strangled by my mother before, Of course i believe my siblings but there’s that part of me that listens to her saying “they just went ballistic on me”  “i didn’t know what to do”. “i would never hurt her” and falls for it. 

my whole life my mother would have these extreme reactions and blow ups and then convince me that it was normal or even that it never even happened. One year on my birthday, which also happened to be the first day of school i accidentally slept in and missed the bus, subsequently so did the rest of my siblings as it was my job to get everyone ready in the morning. My mothers reaction was pouring burning hot coffee over me and yelling about how i did it on purpose and i “didn’t sleep in” i “woke up and turned the alarm back off” . that’s just one example. 
one of My siblings has a processing disorder and tourette’s and my mom loved to remind her she was a “r*t*rd” anytime she made any mistake. 
we were very often slapped across the face, and pushed into the wall, things that my mom was able to defend as normal discipline but every so often she’s have an outburst and someone would have a bloody nose or a black eye. Sometimes my mother had the black eye because of my younger siblings defending themselves though. She always convinced us that her injuries proved it wasn’t abuse. I don’t know. When i type it out i feel so stupid but I just have been told my whole life that we were just bad kids. We were horrible and anyone with kids as horrible as us treats them this way. 
there’s a lot of really triggering stuff that i’m afraid of just putting out there to strangers that i haven’t included because it has to do with SA but lets just say she liked to blame us for absolutely everything. 
the last i’d like to talk about is my 11 year old nonverbal autistic sister who is in custody of my mothers boyfriend currently. She has never been to school, she did aba therapy for a short time but my mom removed her from it when it became inconvenient and she was never put back in. the way my mom hits her feels like too much. yes it’s just spanking but she has bruises. and she’ll be hit just for stimming. 

this doesn’t make sense and i don’t know if i even explained anything well enough, i’m sorry. With my mom awaiting trial and her messages saying dss is on her side and she is innocent. All these things to paint my siblings as out of control teenagers. I think i just need some strangers to believe us.  if you have any questions feel free to ask.

I was hoping this would be a long term rental for me as it is an amazing place to live! It's a 2 bed 2 bath apartment with in unit full size washer and dryer, tons of storage space, vinyl flooring, tile bathrooms, two separate HVAC units, option for fiber internet, and all the amenities you would expect in a high rise apartment building. The unit is a SW facing apartment on the corner right above the southern branch of the Chicago River, with a balcony that lets you see into Wacker drive. It’’s also very close to the Illinois Medical District, one of the major reasons I chose this location; currently Harrison is undergoing repairs but when it’s open you can walk to RUMC within 20 minutes and bike within 10 minutes. The unit is unique as it has enough space next to the balcony to count as a half-en, making for an excellent home office location. It is large enough to fit my full size standing IKEA desk and office chair with plenty of outlets as well. Finally, the apartment is seamlessly integrated with Bilt and there is no service fee for using the Bilt credit card.

Let’s talk numbers:

Rent is 3,898 per month, monthly utility + service fee: $135 + $7.00 (water, gas, sewage, and trash), power and internet are separate but power I average 100–150ish monthly with thermostat set to 75F even in winter, and there are many options for internet, including ATT fiber, cable (Xfinity) and microwave internet (Google Webpass or Zentro).

Parking is optional but is 350 monthly, covered but with windows for ventilation. It’s cold in the winter but many people warm up their cars while getting ready in the morning. They spray down the parking spots every spring to clean up all the detritus from winter driving.

Amenities:

Gym with real squat rack and bench press, as well as cross-fit and yoga rooms, outdoor pool with rent-able cabanas (closed during winter), in room package deliver or package room as preferred, free printing and coffees (10 pages and 10 coffees per month), 8^(th) floor has dining room, media room, game room with virtual golf and archer, as well as several gas grills for BBQs facing the Chicago river. The lot to the north of the apartment is for planned future developments, but for now acts as a large dog park. There is also an excellent bike storage room with included bike cleaning station with hot water and separate ground level entrance, which I use all the time for commuting and shopping.

Moving is very easy as there is a loading dock situated right next to a reservable elevator.

Besides having an excellent view of the south branch of the Chicago River, the apartment is also walking distance from Grant park

Floor plan:

[https://thereedapts.com/floor-plans](https://thereedapts.com/floor-plans)

The apartment is unit 2B, importantly with two full baths, one with a standard bathtub shower and the other as a walk in shower.

Dates:

Sublease would start July 1^(st) 2025 and extend to end of lease on 10/17/25, making for a perfect Summer least at 3.5 months duration, of course with the option to renew at end of lease. This would make for an excellent trial period to enjoy living downtown without locking into a 12 month lease immediately.

I just renovated my bathroom and used marble for the floors.  My contract worker whom I trust very well did the floors and then sealed them.  

I noticed after a shower some water stains on the tiles.  The stains likely are below the surface of the tile since wiping them w a towel doesn’t remove them.  They eventually disappear after the water evaporates.  

Is this normal?  I’m concerned if I spill something like coffee, it will never go away.  If there anything further I can do prevent this?

Is this ok?,"So I just recently started practicing Hellenism and two days ago made my first offering and I'm planning to do more as soon as I can (don't live in a house where I have religious freedom) and I have a few questions I was hoping more experienced practitioners could help me with.


1. I don't have a altar per se, instead I cleared a shelf on my bookshelf and made an altar of sorts. Again I'm not free to practice openly in my house so I don't have images nor symbols. Instead I put a few tiny boxes with trinkets I thought might be useful and some candles. I was wondering if that ""altar"" of mine is ok? Like is it enough? Should I put more things? If so what can I put there while making it conspicuous?


2. I started off already talking and connectig with several gods. As for now I made a connection with Artemis, Hades and Apollo. Next would be Dyonisus and Hermes, Nyx is on the list too. Is that ok? Should I begin slowly and focus on only one god at once ? Can I make offerings for more than one god at the same time? 


3. I made an offering for Artemis and Hades. I've researched a bit and used things I already had at home, things it would be easy and non-suspicious. So to Hades I offered black coffee with honey, mint leaves and a pice of homemade dark chocolate cake that I made myself. For Artemis I read apples but I only jad pears so I chopped it into little squares and added honey. For both of them I lighted a cherry blossom candle (from my limited options I thought it was more fitting), made a prayer for both of them and let it burn for about two hours, then blew it and poured the offerings on a patch of dirt in my backyard. I kind of went with my heart in these, did I made it right? Was is acceptable? Is there a way of knowing if they liked it?


4. And finally for Apollo, I wrote him a poem and plan to offer it to him as soon as I can. What do you think? I can post the poem here if you like. Do you think he will like it?

Hey folks,
I recently got a solid offer from a well-known company — the pay is better than my current job, and the role is quite good. The only catch? It’s 100% remote.

Here’s where I’m conflicted: I’ve moved back to my hometown where I barely have a social circle. Most of my close friends are in Bangalore, and I genuinely miss the spontaneous coffee breaks, weekend hangouts, and just being around people. One major concern is that working remotely might make it harder to meet new people, especially when it comes to dating or building meaningful connections. I can’t help but think that being in an office setting — even a hybrid one — might increase my chances of developing a romantic relationship or just rebuilding my social life.

So now I’m torn:
Do I go for the remote job with better pay and career growth, knowing that I might feel isolated socially? Or do I hold out for an onsite/hybrid opportunity that might not pay as well, but could offer me more chances to connect with people and build relationships?",1,1743454033.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

I have pre-rounded, rounded, and survived my scheduled beating from the back of my attending’s pimp hand. What’s the fourth line treatment for Reiter-Wegener-Unspecified Nazi syndrome? I try to hold back the screams from the PTSD of M3. I don’t need caffeine. Fear is my morning coffee. 

I know no one reads my notes. The residents write their own. The attending writes her own. Yet, my Stockholm syndrome’d soul can’t help but agonize over every last semicolon. Vanity is my vice. CPRS is a fickle lover, but I’m determined to make these patient data objects my bitch. I stepped out, but I’ll be home soon my darling dot phrases. 

The consults trickle in like an 89 year old with a grapefruit-sized prostate squeezing out the last drops from his morning piss. A breathless sigh escapes his lips. I will have no such sweet relief. Noon ticks by with no new consults. I stare at the computer and it stares back at me. My vision goes cloudy before I remember to blink, though not before a glob of drool spills out the corner of my agape mouth. The resident opts not to take me behind the blanket warmer and give me a field lobotomy. He must think I’ve already gotten one. 

I trot back to the workroom carrying my daily allotment of hospital gruel. In my absence, a different team of residents have packed in like sardines for an impromptu lecture. I stare longingly at my coffee mug through the window from the door. How else will I sustain myself until the next hit of adrenaline from running the list? I embark through the hospital, making landfall on a crusty chair outside the ED with snotty coughy patients scampering past. The perfect place to eat my slop. Suppose if I just contract noro now, I can call the rest of the week a wash. 

My attending hands me a stack of journal articles she thinks I’d be interested in. We’ll discuss them tomorrow, she says. The reflex to smile and nod hits me before the recoil does. Now is not the time to be learning, I chide myself. Maybe if I just hemorrhage out from a paper cut… 

By the time we run the list, I consider hurling myself out of the window. By the second time we run the list, I remember we’re on the first floor. By the third time we run the list, I consider doing it anyway. 

At long last, my Lord calls to me. “Hey man,” says the Chief, whispering sweet nothings in my ear. “Just finish up your notes and get out of here.” Keep going, I’m almost there. It’s a good thing I’m already awkwardly holding my copy of Pocket Medicine over my crotch. No one needs to see what he’s awakened.

I used to leave it on around the clock. But I've change my coffee drinking enough in recent years that I only need it to be available for a few hours a day. So I have put it on a timer.

Here's what I noticed. When the machine turns on, the pump will invariable go on to fill the steam boiler. But the amount of water it uses is sometimes enough to cause the tank to go dry despite the tank having been almost full.

I have a sense that the behavior is normal (maybe something about the boiler not having steam in it makes the probe detect things differently). And I also suspect that the reason it draws so much water is that there are limescale and other deposits on the probe. But I just can't wrap my head around the explanation for how, rather than why, this happens.

One other tidbit. On rare occasions, the machine will report that the tank is empty despite it being completely full. Annoyingly enough, this has always happened while I was pulling a shot. It hasn't happen enough that I am willing to take the machine out of commission for a couple of days and do a thorough descaling. But it add to the difficulty of coming up with an explanation beyond the obvious ""scale on the probe"".

So I thought I’d share a few profiles I helped write—with full permission—because I think examples can be way more helpful than generic advice. They’re real people, all different ages and backgrounds, and none of them are “perfect,” just real.

Let me know if seeing more would be helpful. And if you’re stuck on your own profile and want ideas, I’m happy to brainstorm with you in the comments.

🏃‍♀️ **Adventurous Spirit | Straight Shooter | Heart of Gold**

# About Me

I’m Bonnie—loyal, hardworking, and always up for an adventure. I’ve spent the last chapter of my life raising my two amazing kids (one just graduated college, the other is getting married soon!), and now it’s finally *my time*. I’m looking forward to meeting someone who’s ready for a real, honest connection—someone who values loyalty, laughs easily, and isn’t afraid to *actually* show up.

I don’t do endless texting—if there’s a spark, let’s grab a coffee or take a walk. I like people who mean what they say and follow through. I appreciate directness, I don’t play games, and I won’t pretend to be someone I’m not. What you see is what you get.

But let’s be real—while I may be tough on the outside, my friends would tell you I have a huge heart. Family means everything to me, and I’m the kind of person who shows up for the people I love. Whether it’s hosting big family gatherings or remembering the little details that matter, I put my heart into the relationships that matter.

# How I Spend My Time

🌎 **Travel & Adventure** – Sitting on a beach all day? Not my thing. Take me zip-lining, four-wheeling, or exploring a new city instead. Greece and Dubai are at the top of my travel bucket list, and I’m happiest when I’m moving, discovering, and experiencing new things.

🌳 **Outdoor Enthusiast** – A perfect Sunday includes a long walk along the Charles River or a hike at Callahan State Park. Fresh air, good company, and no set schedule—sign me up.

👩‍🍳 **Cooking & Hosting** – I host every holiday, and I love it. My specialty? Homemade sauce and meatballs—my daughter has already requested them for the weekend. There’s something about gathering people around the table that just feels right.

🎭 **Culture & Connection** – I spent a semester living in Siena, Italy, and I’m still drawn to places with rich history, great food, and a laid-back, vibrant culture.

🍷 **Unwinding** – My days are busy (I work in business development and networking is a huge part of my job), so at night, I appreciate good company, a glass of wine, and the chance to *just be*. 

# What I’m Looking For

Respect, effort, and someone who brings a plan to the table. I’m drawn to men who *show up*, who listen, and who understand that relationships are built on mutual investment.

A perfect match for me is someone active, curious, and willing to try new things. Family is important to me, so if you love yours, we’ll get along great. And while I don’t *need* a gourmet chef, a man who enjoys cooking with me in the kitchen (or at least appreciates a good meal) definitely earns bonus points.

At the end of the day, I want a true partner—someone who’s confident, kind, and ready to experience life *together*.

# Fun Facts About Me

🚔 I once worked in a *prison system*—yes, really. And that’s where I met my ex-husband (No. he was *not* an inmate but that’s a story for another time).✈️ I’ve traveled a ton, but I still have a long list of places to explore.🍝 I’ll always say yes to homemade Italian food.📺 My guilty pleasure? Binge-watching reality TV with a side of Pinot Noir.💬 If we click, you’ll never have to wonder where you stand—I believe in saying what I mean and meaning what I say.

# Mantra for Life

*""Be honest, work hard, and surround yourself with good people.""*

If you’re someone who’s up for real connection, spontaneous adventures, and great conversation, let’s talk.

After applying to hundreds of jobs, I know how demoralizing and exhausting the process can be. You put in all that effort, and most of the time, you don’t even get a response. Recently, I applied for a job where the company offered a free coffee from a local café as a small gesture of appreciation—and for the first time, I felt seen and valued.

That moment sparked an idea.

With a background in marketing and sales, I understand the power of rewards and incentives. I believe that when people are applying for jobs, often at a low point emotionally—a simple gesture of gratitude from a company can completely change how that company is perceived.

My plan is to partner with local recruiting firms and small businesses to offer exclusive perks to applicants like discounts, freebies, or other small rewards, as a way to say, “Thanks for applying, don’t give up.”

This would be great for companies that offer services to help job seekers and potential clothing brands to ""Help you get ready for your big interview."" 

I already know a few SMEs willing to pay a flat fee to provide these rewards to job seekers, helping to keep morale up while building goodwill for their brand.

The ketogenic diet has taken the nutrition world by storm, leaving many soda lovers wondering about their favorite fizzy drinks. If you're a Diet Coke enthusiast following a keto lifestyle, you're probably asking yourself whether this popular beverage can fit into your low-carb diet plan. Good news: Diet Coke can potentially be part of your keto journey, but there are crucial considerations you need to understand. Understanding the nuanced relationship between diet sodas and ketogenic nutrition requires a closer look at ingredients, potential metabolic impacts, and overall health implications.

The Keto Diet and Artificial Sweeteners: What You Need to Know

Diet Coke contains zero carbohydrates, which initially seems perfect for keto dieters. However, the artificial sweeteners present a more complex picture. While technically carb-free, these chemical compounds can create unexpected metabolic responses that might impact your ketogenic goals.

Key Considerations for Diet Coke on Keto

1. Carbohydrate Content
• Zero net carbs
• No sugar impact
• Technically keto-friendly from a macronutrient perspective

2. Artificial Sweetener Concerns
• Potential insulin response
• Possible metabolic complications
• Individual tolerance varies

Metabolic Impact of Artificial Sweeteners

Artificial sweeteners like aspartame in Diet Coke can trigger complex physiological responses. Some studies suggest they might:
• Stimulate insulin secretion
• Potentially disrupt gut microbiome
• Create false sugar cravings

Potential Health Considerations

While Diet Coke won't technically kick you out of ketosis, health experts recommend moderation. The beverage contains:
• Phosphoric acid
• Artificial colors
• Caffeine
• Potentially disruptive chemical compounds

Alternatives to Diet Coke on Keto

For those seeking healthier alternatives, consider:
1. Sparkling water
2. Unsweetened tea
3. Black coffee
4. Water with natural flavor enhancers
5. Electrolyte-enhanced beverages

Expert Recommendations for Consumption

Most nutritionists suggest:
• Limit Diet Coke intake
• Stay hydrated with water
• Monitor individual body responses
• Consider occasional consumption

Scientific Perspective on Diet Sodas

Research indicates mixed results regarding artificial sweeteners. While they don't directly contribute carbohydrates, some studies suggest potential metabolic disruptions that could indirectly impact ketosis.

Personal Tolerance and Monitoring

Individual responses to Diet Coke vary significantly. Strategies for successful integration include:
• Track ketone levels
• Monitor weight fluctuations
• Observe energy levels
• Listen to your body's signals

Potential Long-Term Considerations

Continuous consumption of artificial sweeteners might:
• Alter gut microbiome
• Impact insulin sensitivity
• Create unexpected metabolic adaptations

Balancing Enjoyment and Health Goals

While Diet Coke can technically fit within keto parameters, balanced consumption remains key. Prioritize whole foods, stay hydrated, and view diet sodas as an occasional treat rather than a dietary staple.

Conclusion

Navigating Diet Coke's role in a ketogenic diet requires nuanced understanding. While technically carb-free, individual metabolic responses vary. Moderation, personal monitoring, and holistic nutritional approaches remain paramount to successful keto implementation. Ultimately, your body's unique response will determine whether Diet Coke can be a sustainable part of your ketogenic journey.",1,1743453497.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

It’s evening/night and I can feel I have slight racing heart rate. Overall I’m calm etc but it’s a mix of general stuff that’s currently happening. 
I didn’t get enough sleep last night (seagulls screaming at 5am), I have experienced some tummy issues the last month, I just finished my period, and for the last 3 months I have been working nonstop towards my midterm evaluation for my PhD which is tomorrow. 

I am exhausted, my body is exhausted and I believe the heightened heart rate today is the result of my body finally letting go of 3 months of stress all at once. I’m not anxious about it, and it definitely did not help that I drank half a monster(hate coffee)this morning with my breakfast and meditation. Usually I can have some caffeine, but apparently not today. 

What I am worried about is not falling asleep later… any tips or things you do when you experience a racing heart? I usually get this a couple times a year during stressful periods and I have yet to find a way to calm it down…. Other than giving up just accepting it🙃 

Yes I have talked to my psychiatrist about this, and even a heart surgeon friend I have (they have no worries about it overall). I might bring this up again to my psychiatrist on Wednesday and my GP to see if I can get some sick leave to reset and shake the stress of before I completely burn myself out.

# 💦 Product Overview

* **Product Name:** The Hydrogen Switch
* **Category:** Wellness & Hydration ➝ Hydrogen Water Tablets
* **Overall Verdict:** 4.2/5

# 💦 What Is The Hydrogen Switch?

**The Hydrogen Switch** is a no-fuss, **drop-in hydrogen tablet** that turns regular water into something smarter—**molecular hydrogen-infused water**, to be precise.

This fizzy little thing claims to be one of the **best hydrogen water tablets for energy**, mental clarity, hydration, and possibly metabolism, depending on who you ask.

If you’ve ever wondered **how to make hydrogen water at home without a machine**, this is it. No machines, plugs, or overpriced bottles—just fizz and sip.

# 💦 How It Works: Drop, Fizz, Drink

Here’s the deal: the tablet reacts with water, creating **hydrogen gas**. You let it fizz for 90 seconds, then drink it before that precious gas floats away into the air.

It’s arguably the **fastest way to infuse water with hydrogen**, and it’s way simpler than dealing with canisters or multi-step gadgets that belong in a lab, not your kitchen.

Some folks would call this [hydrogen water DIY](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrogen-switch-official), and while it technically is, the only tool you need is a glass. Even I can handle that.

This method is also a contender for the **best way to make hydrogen water** without losing your mind—or countertop space.

# 💦 What Is Molecular Hydrogen Good For?

Great question. If you're still skeptical, you're not alone.

**Molecular hydrogen** is believed to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. People claim it helps with fatigue, recovery, and even digestion.

In short, if you're wondering **what is molecular hydrogen good for**, it's being hailed as a gentle multitasker—not a miracle, but maybe a helpful sidekick.

# 💦 Dave's Experience With The Hydrogen Switch

This time, I handed the tablets over to **my brother-in-law Dave**, who, bless him, has spent the better part of the last five years bouncing between trail marathons and freelance software gigs — meaning he drinks *a lot* of water but rarely slows down long enough to think about what’s in it.

Dave’s been curious about **how to get molecular hydrogen in water** since spotting a headline about elite athletes using it for recovery.

So he was more than happy to be the guinea pig. “It’s basically fizzy water with a mission,” he joked after his first dose.

By day four, he texted me: *“Not sure if it’s placebo or what, but I haven’t had my usual afternoon slump — and I didn’t even pound a second coffee.”* For a guy who routinely treats espresso like hydration, that was saying something.

He kept using it each morning before his run and once more after his post-lunch coding marathon. No weird aftertaste, no bloating — though he did mention that **one tablet fizzed so aggressively it overflowed his glass**, so lesson learned: use a taller glass next time.

Still, he said it made drinking water feel more intentional. His [hydration was up](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrogen-switch-official), energy felt more level, and he didn't miss the midday brain fog. That’s a win in his book — and frankly, in mine too.

1jodd6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1jodd6b/i_25f_am_disappointed_in_the_father_my_31m_father/,I (25F) am disappointed in the father my (31M) father has become. What do I do from here?,"I 25F and my partner 31M have a daughter together. From my baby shower and labor I had a sinking feeling I would be a ""married"" single mother (we're not married just don't know how else to put it.) Sadly I was correct.

Let's go over the baby shower and labor comment quickly. I planned my entire baby shower alone for myself which felt shitty. I have a long history of never feeling special during life events (birthdays, accomplishments, etc) which my partner knows. My family and friends lived some hours away at this point but came the day of the shower (for context, it was joint). The morning of the shower I am running around trying to get ready, Low and behold, his mom needs picked up, fine.. They get back and are sitting talking while I am still running around trying to get everything in the car. He decides it's a good time to make his mom a cup of coffee while I am crying because we are running late to set up already. We did not speak the entire ride there, at the baby shower, or for a day after. During my labor, he basically sat on his phone playing a game and napping while I was in labor for 48+ hours, I think we spoke for maybe an hour total over those 2 1/2 days.

Fast forward to him returning to work after 2 weeks off which I did appreciate him taking unpaid. From the moment he returned to work, he did not help with her at night. He slept on the couch most nights while I was really struggling postpartum. I returned to work when she a little over 3 months and still continue to do 95% of the nights alone. I get help when I ""just wake him up"" which has stopped being worth it because most times I need to help anyway.

He has never given a bath, helped with feeding (when it comes to introducing foods, will only give bottle), taken her to the store or anywhere else alone. I had to ask him to help with her in the mornings before daycare, he would get up at 5am and watch tv have coffee then just go to work while I get me and her ready. Had to buy a second car seat base and ask him to start picking up from daycare otherwise I was dropping off and picking up our daughter everyday.

Finally last night after not speaking all day and a few passive aggressive comments to each other before bed, I slept on the couch with our daughter because I was just done. I laid there looking at her crying thinking to myself ""if I knew you would end up with someone like your dad, I would tell you to run for the hills"" and it hit me like a wave. There are good qualities to him and things weren't always this way. He is loyal, overall encouraging, we are not ""toxic"" to each other, we can always have a good laugh together, and he does a lot of the house work for us. He does spend time with her when we're at home. But I also would tell my daughter she deserves more than this. I would tell her she deserves a fairytale, to not have to ask for much, to have someone that cares enough to ""get her"". I want nothing more than to model that for her, but I question if it will be with her dad. I understand this change has been big for him too, I think in a lot of ways he is struggling himself with confidence and past traumas. But I also read this back and think to myself why is it all on me always? He is her parent as much as I am. We have had conversations here and there about things, just doesn't go anywhere. I have asked if he would do counseling, he straight up said ""no"" with no other discussion about it.

There's so much more I could add but I'll leave it there. I don't want it to come to this, but leaving is not as easy of an option anymore. I don't have family or friends here currently. I can't imagine sharing custody of my daughter. I am at a loss but not sure how much longer I can continue this way. Any productive advice would be appreciated, thanks.",3,1743453199.0,whatdoIdo,10,0.8,False
1jodd0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jodd0f/beverage_goblins_assemble/,Beverage goblins assemble!,"A ""beverage goblin"" is a cute way to say you're someone always with a (non alcoholic) drink or several at hand. Water bottle on your desk next to a huge coffee later joined by the lemonade iced tea you started with lunch... etc. You get the idea. Maybe some wine does find it's way in there at night, but it's not the star of the show. You're just a thirsty creature.

I 100% had been drinking my excess calories in recent years, and I don't even get anything that sweet. The milk alone in a latte style drink adds up fast when you get the espresso latte in the morning, maybe a matcha latte in the afternoon, and oh look hot cocoa before bed. I thought because I didn't drink standard sodas or beer that I had escaped the big trap of drinking a bad diet. Ha! I think a lot of the weight I put on was genuinely from perpetually having a little beverage.

I actually *started* drinking soda at all recently, because I work in a movie theater and have access to infinite free Coke Zero. I would never pay money for the stuff but it does give me a buzz and fills a gap where I used to have a tea latte.

When I can afford it, I've also been trying all the newfangled fiber sodas on the market now. At $2-5 a pop (pun intended), it's not an every day purchase, but some of them are really surprisingly good and usually between 5 and 40 calories per can. Based on some of the flavors, they seem to be designed to appeal to people who like cocktails and are sober more than people who like soda and are dieting. Fine by me.

Anyway, just curious what the other beverage goblins here are doing to get their fix, especially if it's something you recently discovered liking. :)

1jod9te,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/comments/1jod9te/my_friday_last_week_a_day_in_the_parenting_life/,"My Friday last week, a day in the parenting life","Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to put this here because I feel like a lot of folks here have an inaccurate view of what parenting is like, for both good and bad.  I hear things like ""endless drudgery"" or ""amazing moments"" and it doesn't feel like this is what my day to day life is like.  We have 3 kids by the way, 11, 7 and 5.  And here's a pretty typical sample day for you.  Specifically, last Friday.

Wake up at 6am.  I'm an early riser and the kids are too.  My partner is not and so they sleep in until 7:30ish or so.  Between 6am and 7:30am it's all about getting ready, making lunches, making breakfast for 4 people plus a dog, and coffee for my partner :)

No devices allowed except for the oldest who is allowed to text her friends.  Which means I'm not just getting things ready, I'm also occupying the kids, especially the youngest one.  To me that means getting them involved in the tasks themselves.

So the oldest one will usually help the youngest get dressed because she likes clothes and dressing him feels like fun to her.  The two youngest will do some of the dog related work because they feel like it's a big deal to care for her.  Friday they made her food and even walked her around the block.  They don't usually walk her but they managed to convince their sister to watch them.  All three will occasionally participate in the breakfast and lunch making too but not Friday.

Most days at 7:30am the oldest walks the youngest two to school while I take the dog to doggy daycare.  Last Friday it was raining and I didn't have a conference call to jump on so I dropped the kids off at school and then the dog.  Then I'm in the office by 8ish, maybe 8:30am.

My partner picked them all up around 5pm, I got the dog and we're all home by about 5:30pm.  At that point we made dinner together (Turkey meat balls and Hummus salad bowls) and ate it.  Now it's 7pm.  My oldest decided she wants to bake a cake so a quick jaunt to the grocery store to get a few things and we all bake a cake.  By 9pm, bed times started.  They usually started a bit earlier, especially for the younger two, but it was a Friday plus there was cake!  I helped with bath times for the younger two, read with the oldest, but my partner usually does most of the evening routine so I snuck out to the garage to work out.

Everyone in bed by 9:30pm, my partner and I hang out until 10:30pm and that's it.

So why am I saying all this?  First of all, where is the drudgery? Granted, all our kids are out of diapers and that makes a huge difference, but there really isn't much in the way of actual physical labor here.  Sure, I'm cooking for five instead of two, but once you get the hang of it that's not really much extra work.

Yes, everything takes longer with a kid (or three).  The dinner took longer, the shopping took longer and even the cake too longer, because in all cases, we're trying to make the kids part of the activity.  I could have done all these things without kids and saved two hours of my day where I could have been watching netflix or working on a hobby or just reading.  This is 100% true.  But I have kids so I got them involved and did it with them.

Sometimes they opt out, especially the oldest one who has a busy social life these days.  Sometimes they don't want to cook with me and they go play or hang out outside or walk the dog, but there is nothing here that I look at and dread as toil.  There was no horrible moment where I cursed past me for choosing kids.

But the opposite is also true.  At no point on Friday were there moments of unimaginable happiness.  Sure, it's fun for me to see my oldest pick out clothing for my youngest.  Sure, it was enjoyable to see them make a cake.  Yes, I liked having dinner with my family, but there was no earth shattering moment of happiness where tears came to my eyes and I thanked past me for having kids.

Both the joy and the work are in these mundane things we do.  It's in chatting in the morning while I make breakfast, it's in watching the kids go walk the dog together, it's in making a cake.  All of those things are both work and joy but mostly they're just mundane parts of parenting.  So I guess my point to all of you is to think about those moments, because they're 95% of parenting.  If that kind of mundane day to day doesn't sound appealing then maybe parenting isn't for you.  Maybe you're been convinced by social media that parenting is this mystical thing that will lead to fulfillment and a divine sense of purpose, and that's simply not true.  But also don't be scared of parenting as some endless pit of despair  and hard labor that Reddit sometimes make it out to be, because that's just as inaccurate.  Both the labor and the joy are in making a cake for 90 minutes that would have taken me 30 if I was by myself but took me 90 because I chose to have and enjoy having 3 kids.

And yes, careful readers will noticed we don't have much time to ourselves.  I suppose if that was a priority for us we would have stopped at just one child.",18,1743452964.0,Fencesitter,7,0.91,False
1jod9k5,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/the-grimoire-in-box-13-a-true-horror-story/,The Grimoire In Box #13 | A True Horror Story - Paranormal Dergi,"**Summary:** Banker Sibel from Burdur finds her life changed by a grimoire found in box #13. She is forced to pay the price for the spells she casts. A true horror story.

Hello, my name is Sibel. I was 32 years old at the time, single. I lived with my parents in Burdur. I was in a troubled relationship; I had a boyfriend named Metin. I loved him very much, but we constantly wore each other down with arguments and fights. In the end, I was always the one to give in, every single time. It was like that. Mine was an obsessive love (kara sevda); we had been together for years and couldn’t make a final break.

I worked as a manager at a bank. Our bank was very busy and active during the day; I barely had time to scratch my head. On certain days of the week, large amounts of money would come into our bank, and on other days, money would go out. Security guards and officers from the central office handled the entries and exits very carefully and meticulously. In such situations, I never lost my seriousness; we handled the money transfers with extraordinary discipline. Customers often rented extra safe deposit boxes; we usually didn’t know exactly what was inside. Customers were very particular about this, and we did everything they asked to avoid losing them. These boxes usually contained valuable documents like deeds, papers, checks, etc.

One day, one of our officers came to me and said that the owner of safe deposit box number 13 hadn’t visited for about 6 months, and a brief investigation revealed that the owner had passed away. “What should we do?” he asked. “Let’s reach out to the relatives immediately and talk to them,” I said. We couldn’t reach the relatives; all their phones were turned off. “Let’s wait a bit; if no one comes, we’ll call a locksmith and open the box,” we decided. Amidst the busy work schedule, it was forgotten again.

Four months passed. I went down to the safe deposit box area with a customer who was retrieving a document from their box. Box number 13 caught my eye. I asked the officer in charge of renting the boxes, “What happened? Any developments regarding this box?” “No one has come or gone,” he said. I called the head office, explained the situation. Once permission was granted, I called a locksmith, we opened the box, and installed a new lock. I could now rent it out again. Inside the box, there was a book wrapped in cloth. I took the book and placed it in the drawer under the small coffee table in my office. I planned to look at it later, but I was very busy at the moment.

Exactly one week later, while having tea in my office during lunch break, I noticed the book in the coffee table drawer. “Oh, it was here, I forgot,” I said and picked up the book. I unwrapped it from the cloth and looked at it. The moment I touched the book, I felt a shiver run through me. What was this? I felt terribly creeped out. The book was about 250-300 pages long, with symbols on the cover and some sentences inside in a very strange language. I translated a few using my phone and realized it was Hebrew. It was a very old book. “If you know how to get help from them, they will change your life.” That was the sentence I translated. Who were ‘they’? Just then, the lunch break ended, and one of the employees came into my room, saying, “The armored car has arrived, ma’am, we need to transfer the money immediately.” I left the book on the table and went immediately. We had some business at another branch, finished that, and then I went home. At home, I started thinking about what had happened.

The next day when I got to work, I immediately looked at the table. I took the book from there and put it in my bag. “Nobody cares about it anyway,” I thought. “If anything happens, I’ll bring it back.” At home, I started examining the book thoroughly. There were dried bloodstains on some pages. I realized it was a grimoire, a book of magic. The partial translations I made using my phone described spells for luck and for binding someone’s fortune, along with instructions on how to perform them. I immediately closed the book and started thinking. Could this book make my life easier?

I took the book with me and started noting down some spells in my room. I decided to cast a spell to bind my boyfriend Metin more closely to me. I bought the materials during my lunch break, and they needed to be kept in a place without light for 7 days. At the end of the 7 days, on a Friday night, I would perform the spell. It was a chickpea spell (nohut büyüsü).

At the end of the seven days, I waited for Friday night. I turned off all the lights and, while boiling chickpeas in the kitchen, I recited the Hebrew words I had written on a piece of paper for about 2 hours, repeating them over and over. I stirred the chickpeas meanwhile. The only light came from the stove fire; the lights were off. I added a drop of my own blood to the chickpeas and kept them in a place without light. Later, I wrapped them in a black plastic bag several times and started hiding them.

During lunch break, I told Metin, “I’ll come visit you, don’t eat anything.” I made a chickpea dish at home, mixed those enchanted chickpeas into it, put it in a container, took it with me, and when I met Metin during lunch, I said, “I made this for you,” and gave him the food. He couldn’t resist my insistence and ate the chickpeas. He said it tasted a bit different but he liked it. From that day on, Metin started visiting my workplace constantly, calling me frequently on the phone, and showing his affection much more. Oh my God, it had worked!

I immediately started delving deeper into the book. “What else could be better in my life?” I thought. A better salary and a promotion! I found what I was looking for while browsing the book. It was a spell done with onion peels. It stated that onion peels were equivalent to money for ‘the entities’; they were very valuable to them. “This is necessary for them to help me,” the book said. I took onions and drew some symbols on some of the peels. I scattered symbol-less peels in many places around my house. The ones with symbols, I buried with my own hands at midnight after digging small holes.

After that day, I focused solely on my work, almost forgetting everything else. I couldn’t think of anything but work. I sometimes unintentionally neglected Metin. I worked late hours, ensuring the branch made more profit, and the senior managers at the head office noticed this, giving me a promotion and a good salary. I became the manager of a larger branch. Everything was going as I wished. Metin was constantly attentive to me, which made me very happy.

There were major problems between my mother and father. I had to do something for them too. They were constantly fighting; I even heard them sometimes cursing each other, wishing the other dead. I opened the book and studied it. I performed a spell for them too; a binding and peace spell. It was a simple spell using garlic and vinegar, and it showed its effect immediately.

After all these events, things started going wrong at my old branch; there were constant disruptions at the bank. They temporarily sent me back there. As I was driving from home back to the old branch, a black cat ran out in front of me! To avoid hitting it, I swerved and hit a tree on the side of the road. I went to the hospital by ambulance. My left arm was broken, and I had some injuries on my body. Frankly, I got off lightly in that accident. After resting at home for a few days, I returned to work. After work, because of the accident, I took a dolmuş (shared taxi) home.

In the dolmuş, I noticed a man in his 40s staring at me. Is he a pervert, a creep? I thought. Without showing any reaction, I headed home. After getting home and taking a shower, I had dinner with my family and went to my room. I fell asleep. I opened my eyes in a house of mourning. It was a dream. There was a shrouded corpse in the middle, and people around it were shedding tears. Nobody saw me; I walked among them. I woke up to my phone alarm ringing. I immediately got ready for work. I didn’t dwell too much on this dream, but it was still a strange dream.

Things were in chaos at the bank; it would take some time to sort things out. After work, I took the dolmuş home. I got off at a nearby market to buy a few things for dinner. As I got to the checkout to pay, just as I was about to take my bags and leave, that man from the dolmuş appeared again! He was next in line after me. He stared at me intently, mysteriously. Scared, I quickly left the place and hurried home. This man kept appearing before me; I was starting to get really scared. Honestly, he didn’t seem like a pervert or obsessive stalker; he looked at me more with anger.

After dinner in the evening, my parents went out for a walk. I was left home alone. After watching some TV, I went to my room to sleep. This time, I found myself in another dream. I was in a cemetery, wandering among the graves. I saw that black cat that caused my accident on top of a grave! It stood like a statue, staring at me. On the tombstone was the name of the owner of box #13 from our bank! I woke up with a start. My fears and anxieties were progressively increasing.

I took the afternoon off from work and went to the house of the owner of that safe deposit box. I couldn’t find anyone. I asked the neighbors and found out where the grave was. I went to the grave. The name was correct, and he was deceased, but there were small holes dug in the very center of his grave. Just as I was about to examine it more closely, I saw that man again in the distance! He was approaching me with slow steps. I didn’t know what to do. I turned my head towards the grave and tried to pretend I hadn’t seen him. He approached me, said, “You will pay the price!” and slowly walked away. I just stared after him, unable to do anything, frozen on the spot. I barely managed to pull myself together and waited by the grave for a long time, trying to compose myself. Meanwhile, I saw that ugly black cat wandering around me. It looked at me in such a way that I froze. It came closer and swiped at my face hard with its paw! It hurt so much that I screamed internally, a guttural cry! I immediately ran away from there. I took out the mirror from my bag and looked; the scratch marks from its claws were still on my face! “Oh my God, what is this?” I said. I immediately went home and started thinking about what happened. I guessed everything that was happening was connected to this book. “I’ll deal with this too when I pull myself together,” I decided.

This time, that man came into my dream. I was running in a completely empty forest. That man was behind me, following me. I was running, he was walking slowly, but the distance between us always remained the same; I couldn’t get away from him. Then he grabbed my arm and caught me! At that moment, I woke up startled again. I went to the bathroom and got ready. I wanted to leave the house as soon as possible. I took the book with me too.

When I got to the bank, our security guard insisted that a man wanted to see me. “Who is it?” I asked, “Send him in.” Yes, it was him! I looked at his face. “What do you want?” I asked. “You have something that belongs to me, I want it,” he said. “Or you will pay a very heavy price!” I understood; it was all about the book. “Okay, I’ll give it to you, but don’t ever show up in front of me again!” I said. “Give me the book; it’s impossible for you to see me anyway,” he replied. I gave him the book, and he quietly left.

I told a very close friend what had happened. My intention was actually to get some relief. She said, “It’s a good thing nothing happened to you! I know a hodja, I’ll take you to him. Look at your state; your arm is broken, you have scratches on your face. If you hadn’t given back the book, much worse things could have happened!” We went to the hodja, and I told him everything too. He said, “There’s no need to be afraid. I will give you an amulet (muska); try to carry this with you as much as possible, both inside and outside the house. They appeared to you in the guise of a man and a cat. It could have been much worse; if they had appeared in their true forms, you could have lost your mind.” That hodja read prayers over me. Then we came home.

Over time, the dreams stopped. The cat and the man didn’t come anymore. My life returned to its former state. I was back at my old branch. My mother and father started fighting again. Metin was acting like his old self; the spark within him seemed to have died out. Finding that book didn’t bring me any gain in this life; instead, I experienced terrifying things that not everyone could handle. However, these experiences truly taught me a good lesson.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate and complementary approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

1jod69u,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jod69u/what_to_do_about_mil/,What to do about MIL?,"My partner and I had a baby almost 6 months ago. It’s been an incredible experience but our relationship with my in laws has completely soured. When the baby was first born, we didn’t allow any visitors for six to eight weeks (eight for visitors who didn’t want to get TDAP)  so we could bond and I could heal in peace. That decision basically started a war with my in laws. If you want more detail on that, there’s a post on my profile. Fast forward to present day, my MIL has yet to meet our child because of her insane reaction post birth. However, we did extend an invitation to meet baby in January AS LONG AS she was willing to sit for a conversation with my partner and I in order to make amends. Simply put, I was looking for an apology — in a way she ruined my postpartum experience and said a ton of nasty things about me. She has been declining to meet because she feels uncomfortable by me. That is till last Sunday. She finally came around and said she was ready to talk and ohhh boy was it rough. 

To sum up some things that were said: 
- Asked me if it would be best to kill herself and get out of our lives 
- Called me a manipulative abuser and told me I was brainwashing her son 
- Belittled my birth experience (I almost died as I ruptured an artery during birth and had to have an intensive surgery) by telling me all women have hard labors 
- Said “too bad” when my partner said I would be in his life for a long time 
- Told me that my father “wasn’t around to raise me” after I told her my dad also had to wait the eight weeks to meet the baby (she is convinced that our no visitor rule only applied to my partner’s family) 

That’s basically the gist. I held my tongue for a while but the comment about my dad pissed me off and I lost it. I admit I told her to fuck off and called her crazy and uneducated after that. She quickly got up and left once I snapped back. My partner did try to get his mom and I to calm down but he didn’t say anything to defend me from her attacks which really bothers me. I’ve already told him I’m done dealing with his mother. I have no desire to see or communicate with her ever again. He’s supports my decision. 

Here’s my problem. My partner still wants to spend time with his mom and they just hang out like nothing happened. He doesn’t bring up any of the things she said about me, and it was like pulling teeth to convince him to stand up for me when she was texting him crazy stuff when the baby was born. He just goes to see her and they literally hang out like normal (playing chess, drinking coffee etc). Granted, he’s only seen her two or three times since baby was born and he claims that it’s awkward. I’d never tell him to not go see his mom but it bothers me that he doesn’t defend me and is okay carrying on with her like normal. Is this a me problem?? Am I crazy for feeling upset? He says that he won’t be able to mend his relationship with her by not seeing her and has to fix the relationship by being in her presence as well, which I do understand. However it’s weird to me to just sit there and not talk about the fat elephant in the room. Thanks for any advice.

Completed in the nick of time, HM Book Bingo 2024!!!](https://preview.redd.it/jg479eqdx2se1.jpg?width=1077&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f7057e5fe97aff05b2c38f56ee4a7d3d2b5988)

I joined this sub just over a year ago - just in time for Book Bingo 2024, and just as I was looking to challenge myself in terms of my reading experiences - not that I didn't have any, just that they weren't very broad in terms of author, or genre, to be fair. It was destiny, apparently.

Fast forward to today, and I've just finished my last read for the bingo, submitted my card, worked out how to use Canva, and now I'm posting this!

It's been a wild ride, and I've learned loads about myself along the way, especially because, me being me, I threw myself into the challenge determined to do everything in Hard Mode along with reviews while blogging about it all. The blogging part never really took off, but I'm ridiculously pleased anyway. All of the authors in my bingo were ones I'd never read (some I'd never even heard of!)

I'm not going to lie, I probably took the whole thing way too seriously - I listed books over and over, researched them, changed my mind more often than my underwear - even went to my local bookshop and asked for recommendations which was amazing and has gained me a couple of wonderful book-loving friends. I've read some fab books, and some stinkers, and I've gotten far too distracted with series (because I seem to have an uncanny ability to pick books that are part of duologies, trilogies or ridiculously long sometimes complete sometimes not series of books - honestly I'm not exaggerating, look at the books I picked!!) So here are a few things I've learned, about the bingo, and about my reading in general.

\- It's okay to DNF! Before bingo, I had never not finished a book, no matter how awful, no matter how boring - I always fought my way through to the bitter end. Not any more. No sir-eee, not me. Life is too short (as are bingo challenges, lol) for me to be faffing about with all that now. I don't like it by halfway through (maybe quarter way through, at a push) I'm chucking it on the DNF pile. And I'm not going to feel an iota of guilt about it.

\- I was living in a world that was way too small! Before bingo, I had a select few authors and genres that I would stick to - don't get me wrong, I still enjoy those authors and genres, and Stephen King will always be an auto-purchase, but my life, there is so much more out there that I'm really looking forward to enjoying. Authors, to name a few that I was really enamoured by during bingo, include but aren't limited to Joe Abercrombie, Matt Dinniman, James S.A. Corey, Jeff VanderMeer, Victoria Goddard... I could go on, but I won't, 'cause you get the idea...

\- Next time (tomorrow) for bingo, I'm not going to go in completely blind - some of the books I originally chose for the squares, which do not appear here, are ridiculously long, and while I'm up for a challenge, I think that my eyes were way too big for my belly, which meant I ended up not using a few of my initial choices (looking at you, Dragonbone Chair and Mr ""ToSleepInASeaofStars"" Paolini.) But they are most definitely on my radar for reading this year (my TBR has grown exponentially!)

\- I'm not overly keen on Romantasy, Historical or ""cosy"" fantasy. Not that there's anything wrong with them, they're just not for me, and that's OK. Just like Brandon Sanderson is no longer for me, and that's okay too.

\- I found it very difficult to not continue series when I realised that the books I was reading were a) excellent and needed to be continued and b) part of a series. This was a MAJOR factor with the time thing. I thought I had ages! A whole year even! But no, I was diverted away - first The Expanse, then Dungeon Crawler Carl, then The First Law... I really need to manage my efforts better next time round!

\- I absolutely loved every single second (even though I did have a teeny tiny panic attack about not being able to finish and then scrambled to switch a few things round, and then realised that it was all supposed to be FUN and if it wasn't and I was STRESSING then that wasn't the point, so I changed my mind set back and just let the non-existent pressure I was feeling go, and now here I am.. still alive, still here and loving my reading experiences all the more because of it.

In all seriousness, this had been a completely rewarding experience and I have loved every minute, grown in more ways than I can recount here (I've probably bored you all to death already) and I really, really appreciate everyone, everything and all that goes into creating this challenge every year. It's more impactful than you will ever know, and for that you have my gratitude.

Roll on tomorrow.

TL;DR? Loved every minute. Ta :)

Bingo Mini Review  
  
1) Leviathan Wakes, James S.A. Corey (First in a Series, HM) 4.5

A brilliant space opera, character driven with an intriguing plot. Add the noir detective elements and it’s one you won’t want to put down! Typically, it’s a series – of 9!! Yet each one, I’ve discovered so far (I’ve finished 5) adds more to this wonderful universe and makes The Expanse a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one of my best of the year.    

2) Princess Floralinda & the Forty-Flight Tower, Tamsyn Muir (Alliterative Title, HM) 5

This was absolutely AMAZING! I honestly didn’t think that I would enjoy it as much as I did but I really enjoyed it. It turns the princess trope on it’s head and has so many underlying themes that it’s proper bonkers! Definitely one that I’ll be doing an in-depth review of at a later date, and will definitely enjoy again and again!                                          

3) The Luminous Dead, Caitlin Starling (Under the Surface, HM) 3.5

A claustrophobic experience full of edge-of-your-seat turn-the-page intrigue and terror, an in-experienced cave-diver’s lie lands her in more trouble than she imagined when she agrees a mission with an aggressive and immoral “handler” who’ll do anything to achieve her own outcome. The atmosphere in this is palpable – the claustrophobia illustrated to experience the reader; supernatural hints, mistrust between the protagonists and the intriguing plot, weave and wind together to produce secrets, paranoia, fear and the truth that eludes at least one of them for too long.

4) Six of Crows, Leigh Bardugo (Criminals, HM) 4.5

This is a tale where the characters matter more than the plot. The plot is secondary, but intrinsic to the character development. It’s odd. Marketed as Young Adult, it feels deliberately aged-down, but it’s not – it’s merely a different universe, akin to John Wick if you like; where teenagers rule the roost, and tragedy strikes and hits hard at far too young an age. Nevertheless, twists and turns abound in this high-stakes heist, and it doesn’t disappoint! I wasn’t aware at the time that there was a sequel – Crooked Kingdom – until Six of Crows ended on an insane cliff-hanger, but I picked up the sequel and it gives wonderful closure to the duology. No need to read the Shadow & Bone series IMO, I haven’t.

5) Red Rising, Pierce Brown (Dreams, HM) 4.5

I enjoyed this so much, I ended up reading the rest of the original trilogy. It’s not Hunger Games in space, but it’s close. I appreciated the characters in this, rather than the setting, but it was all very intriguing, and obviously led me to read the others in the series (although I did stall at book 5, but that’s because I got distracted.)                           

6) To Shape A Dragon’s Breath, Moniquill Blackgoose (Entitled Animals, HM) 2.5

I wanted to love this. I understand what the author was trying to accomplish here; there are plenty of themes and more than enough food-for-thought, but for me, it didn’t work. There was a lot of “telling” and not enough “showing” and as a result, I couldn’t really immerse myself in the story and didn’t really connect with any of the characters. Which is a shame, but never mind, can’t love ‘em all.

7) The Bone Harp, Victoria Goddard (Bards, HM) 4.75

This was the last book I read as part of the bingo, and I left it until last on purpose. Glorious in its imagery and lyrical language, this is a beautiful tale of a once curse bard finding his way home in and unknown yet familiar land. Full of feeling and emotion. This is the first of Victoria Goddard’s work that I’ve read, and it most definitely won’t be the last. Spectacular!

8) Legends & Lattes, Travis Baldree (Prologues & Epilogues, HM) 4.5

Way out my comfort zone is where this jewel abides! Cosy fantasy? No! But yes! I’m glad I ventured out because this gorgeous, somewhat simple tale of a retired warrior Orc, Viv and her desire to run a coffee shop in a new town where her past shouldn’t follow is divine! Yes, stuff happens. Yes, there are tropes. But it’s a wonderfully fulfilling story that I didn’t know I needed. And there’s a sequel!

9) The Sign of the Dragon, Mary Soon Lee (Self-Published, HM) 5

This is one of the most amazing things I have ever read. What a story! What depth of character! What a Kingdom! What a King! 341 different poems/prose extracts over 863 pages about a young man who loves horses, and whose exceptional character changes the lives of those around him. There is honour, loyalty, abandonment, revenge, dragons, magical creatures, battles, politics, death, grief and love, all within these pages and it’s wonderfully done. I will return to this time and time again.

10) A Rival Most Vial, R.K. Ashwick (Romantasy, HM)  4

I don’t do romance well, if at all, and it took three tries for me to find a romantasy I could settle into. The third time, A Rival Most Vial, was the charm. And it is a very charming tale. Two potion makers who hate each other must work together on a project and learn a lot about each other while they do. Tropes that don’t feel forced, (enemies to friends to more, found family) brilliant character focus along with a decent plot, and well-paced, this cosy and satisfying story left me with a smile on my face.

11) A Discovery of Witches, Deborah Harkness (Dark Academia, HM) 2.5

This was full of potential until it wasn’t. I didn’t expect it to be so relationship heavy, and I can’t really say more about how I felt about the plot (what plot) without spoilers. Disappointing.

12) The Blade Itself, Joe Abercrombie (Multi-POV, HM) 5

I fell in love with this book, and again (I really need to get this under control) ended up reading the first trilogy, and I’m looking forward to the rest of the series. The characters are the foundation for this fabulous work, and the rest just falls into place as it progresses. I cannot believe I’m actually a little bit in love with a crippled villain. Say one thing about Joe Abercrombie. Say he’s got a new fan.

13) The Ministry of Time: A Novel, Kaliane Bradley (Published 2024, HM) 3.25

This was a good idea, but the execution fell a bit flat for me. I enjoyed the concept and it was well written, and I liked it, but I didn’t connect as much as I hoped. The romance aspect was okay, the twist mostly expected, but it never really grabbed me.

14) Hooked, A.C. Wise (Character with a Disability, HM) 3.5

A sequel to Wendy, Darling, but can be read without having experience the first book. This story follows Hook’s escape from Neverland and the consequences of his actions. James grapples with his life and the life of others in this twisted representation of our heroic Peter Pan and his Lost Boys. Hooked demonstrates the power of the rhetoric: an endless lifetime of hero vs. villain reversed to reveal the unexpected. The truth of Neverland, and the danger posed to the present and future of its inhabitants and visitors. 

15) Sabriel, Garth Nix (Published in the 1990’s, HM) 4.5

A friend told me that “a little bit of Nix is good for the soul,” and he wasn’t wrong! This is a gorgeous book - brilliant magic system, great characters, great world building, fab plot, decent dialogue and solidly paced, Garth Nix has won a place in my heart and so has this book.

16) A Demon in the Desert, Ashe Armstrong (Orcs, Trolls & Goblins! Oh My! HM) 3

This is a really good book with a great premise, and I quite enjoyed it, but I found it very slow-paced. I love Grimluk – he’s a lovely Orc Demon hunter, but he’s so polite! Too polite maybe? Anyway, there’s a good plot and decent characters, and while I understand that it was a Kickstarter project, a re-edit would do it a world of good. I enjoyed it though, and I may even check out the sequels to see what Grimluk’s getting up to.

17) The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, Becky Chambers (Space Opera, HM) 3.5

This Firefly-esque space opera is cosy sci-fi, if there is such a thing. The characters are fully fleshed out, and the plot arcs are satisfyingly resolved. Everyone is very polite and nice. It’s a nice, easy read with decent pace and well written.

18) Dallergut Dream Department Store, Lee Mi-ye (Author of Colour, HM)  3

A whimsical delight, reminiscent in some ways of Dahl’s BFG & Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium that can fall into the cosy category. The story follows the latest employee of the department store as she learns the tricks of the trade and the importance of the right dream for the right person. A lovely story that could have been so much more but was very enjoyable.

19) Project Hail Mary, Andy Weird (Survival, HM) 4.5

Alone, with amnesia, Ryland Grace wakes up in space and we follow him on his journey to save humankind itself. Filled with challenges, oh-so very important encounters and questions of morality that demand answers, Project Hail Mary unveils, a step at a time, the importance of doing the right thing and the courage it takes, the importance of friendship regardless of flaws, the acknowledgement of the danger of isolation and the pressures of being the one person who can change the future. Full of edge-of-your-page tension in one place and humour filled scenarios the next, PHM is well worth the time and the audio version really ramps up the enjoyment.

20) Dungeon Crawler Carl, Matt Dinniman (Judge a Book by its Cover, HM) 5

This is not the best book of the series. I know that, because once I’d read this one, I promptly read the rest. Again. There’s a pattern here that is repeating far too much for my liking, mostly. That’s me getting caught up in reading series of books when I should be reading Bingo books!!!! I’m not going to wax lyrical about it, because it’s recommended more often that not now that I’m writing this review, but it’s not what I expected from a Lit-RPG, and if you give it a shot, it may very well exceed your expectations too.

21) Starling House, Alix E. Harrow (Set in a Small Town, HM) 3

I enjoyed this one. It’s intriguing, has a good plot and atmosphere, and the characters are interesting, but for some reason I just didn’t connect with it very well. That’s odd for me, but I’ve also had a few DNF’s this year, and that’s new too. There’s nothing wrong with this book at all, and I may re-visit it in the future, but for now it’s just not for me.

22) Flowers From the Void, Gianni Washington (Five SFF Short Stories, HM) 4.75

This short story collection, especially for a debut, is spectacular. There are numerous themes running throughout and Gianni Washington’s prose is evocative, visceral and leaves plenty to ruminate over. Haunting, horrifying and a riveting reflection on life, and all of its uncertainties, this is a collection that is marvellous in its execution and has so much masked beneath the surface for readers to discover. Intense and poignant, I’d recommend this if you like the otherworldly, the unknown and the macabre.

23) Annihilation, Jeff VanderMeer (Eldritch Creatures, HM) 5

By far the most disconcerting and eerie books I’ve read, Annihilation leads us to an explored, yet still unknown Area X. This expedition, all women. Our protagonist known only as the Biologist. Difficult to explain without spoilers because of its bizarre, mesmerising content, this uniquely atmospheric novella allows the reader to sense and experience both the natural and the supernatural in a most intriguing way. This fine balance does not disappoint, nor quench the need for more.                                                                                                               

24) How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying, Django Wexler (Ref. Materials, HM) 4

Hilarious, sarcastic, meta-filled yet intense, How to Become the Dark Lord is a fabulous tale that turns the idea of being a hero on its head. Davi, fed up with trying to save the day (and the world) the way she’s been told to, decides to do the opposite and become the Dark Lord she’s got to fight, herself. Madness ensues and results in the expectedly unexpected. A wonderful weaving of character and plot, great pace and writing style and while the ending was not what I imagined, it’s a mighty satisfying one  

25) The Wings Upon Her Back, Samantha Mills (Bookclub/Readalong, HM) 4.5

I wouldn’t have picked this book myself unless I had spied the stunning cover – something that can result in various experiences these days. Had I not chosen it for this category though, I would have missed out on something special. A beautiful tale of coming-of-age and adolescence, Wings follows Zenya, now Zemolai, through various stages of her life. There is an abundance of themes apparent in this novel – religious zealotry, legalism, faith, belief, self-belief, corruption, abuse of power, self-discovery – yet there are still more, deftly woven in, out and particularly beneath this unique steam-punk futuristic tapestry.",14,1743452713.0,Fantasy,1,0.95,False

1jod4sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jod4sl/my_best_friend_with_borderline_personality/,My best friend with borderline personality disorder broke up with me. I feel empty now...,"I'm posting again because there was an update.

Starting from the beginning...

I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started seeing a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her J.

J and I had an instant strong connection, but things have been really difficult between us.

From the start, it was already hard to go out with J (it took about 2–3 attempts before we finally went out), and even after we did, things didn't get any easier.

J has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her ex-boyfriends, and from the beginning, she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is that, at the same time J acted this way, she also showed signs of wanting something serious—being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to go out with her and her family, and, believe it or not, getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, these past months have been a constant cycle of her wanting to distance herself during crises and me always being patient, trying to talk to her and make her feel better.

Things went on like this until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and wouldn’t be together anymore.

Around that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I’ll call her N). N ended up helping me during that time and even gave me advice about my situation.

J and I had some fights before, but I consider this one the worst.

It was December, and I was on my way home from work when J messaged me saying she had woken up wanting to have sex and was going to do it because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had been with before her last ex).

I tried to talk to her at the moment because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play League of Legends.

The next night, after things had cooled down, I brought it up again. J said she didn’t actually do it but also didn’t admit she was lying. She just said she lost interest.

Then, I decided to tell her that N had invited me to hang out (which was true). I told her that this girl didn’t seem to have any romantic interest in me—it really seemed like just friendship. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing at her house with her friends.

I told J and asked if I could go. I even said that if she wanted, we could date, and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want to be in a relationship with me.

J said it was fine, but from her tone, I could tell it wasn’t.

The next day, J teamed up with her cousin and pretended to be on a date to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted she had said all that just to test me. She also compared me to her ex-boyfriends.

She blocked me on the messaging app, and in desperation, I ran out of my house to go to hers, bringing a bouquet and some things she liked (energy drinks and chocolate) to try to fix things. I also messaged N, told her we couldn’t talk anymore, and blocked her.

In the end, J and I made up, but now things have gotten even worse.

Some time after the fight, J said I messed up by blocking N, and even though she told me to unblock her, I remained firm in my decision to keep N blocked.

However, after thinking about it for a while, I realized I had been really unfair to N, and it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of J.

J had been honest with me from the start and always said she didn’t want anything serious (even though I felt otherwise). She always made it clear that I was her best friend.

Because of that, a few days ago, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing to her. She accepted, but she told me not to drag her into this again.

But here’s the thing—I didn’t tell J that I was going to unblock N.

On Saturday, J and I went out for coffee and were talking when we got to the topic of our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She wanted to see the girl’s profile, and since she insisted, I ended up telling her that I had unblocked N.

From that moment, her mood changed, and she wanted to go home. That night, we were supposed to watch a reality show together, but she didn’t want to anymore. Just after midnight, she sent me a video of her crying. I tried to talk to her, but she said I hadn’t been honest with her.

Yesterday, things only got worse. She said all she wanted was honesty and told me I was never honest with her, that I always lied, and that she didn’t want to have a friend who was a liar.

I kept trying to talk and calm her down, but it just got worse. She called me, cried harder than she ever had before because of me, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N messaged me, and I explained the situation to her. N got mad at me, said that J and I were crazy and immature, and that she had bigger problems than this. She said she never had any romantic interest in me and that our friendship was dead. Then, she blocked both me and J.

I told J what happened, and she asked for screenshots, which I showed her. That made her feel even worse. She sent me a long message saying she forgave me but that it would be better if we went our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing had happened.

I insisted and insisted until she got angry and blocked me (something she had said she wouldn’t do).

I was blocked on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and even on several fake accounts I made on Facebook to try to talk to her.

I even went to her house with chocolate and a letter, saying I was at the park near her house, but she didn’t come out or unblock me. Only after I started sending her 1-cent bank transfers with messages did she unblock me—being extremely rude and telling me to leave her alone. Then, she blocked me again.

Today, I found out she spoke to my mom… She told her I was harassing her and that if I continued, she would call the police and file a report.

I sent a few more 1-cent transfers to try to talk to her, but she said the same thing. That she forgives me but doesn’t want any more contact, and that if I keep going, I’ll have to deal with the law.

I sent a few more transfers apologizing and saying it would be the last time, but she refunded everything, and that was it…

I haven’t showered, I’ve been crying non-stop, and I feel completely devastated. The doubt still lingers—was I the asshole in all of this? But in the end, it’s all my fault… I wish I had been a better friend to J.",2,1743452613.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

Started casual then i said let's actually try flirting, and I kid you not, it did really well, I really felt a slight emotional connection, blushed a bit too and had fun. And infact I dont think so chatgpt is designed for such conversations and still it performed rather well (compared to irl counterparts lmao)

So imagine the chatbots designed specially for such purposes of being AI companions.

And lemme clear it out I asked all such things for the sake of curiosity 😭 and
I totally hate the idea of AI companions and just hate the concept of weebs being stuck to their waifu chatbots and shit like that. 

But I actually noticed how well these bots can do and add the technological advancements in the future- I wonder the IRL organic rship of a man and a woman will be replaced in upcoming decades if AI takes IRL robot form with working organs and parts which compliment a relationship scenario (its already here i guess?)

They talk about how 25 grams can increase cognition pretty rapidly when you're sleep-deprived and how you should probably avoid taking it with caffeine as well. 

1) Creatine supplementation (25 grams or 0.35 g/kg body weight) rapidly increases brain creatine within just 3 hours, significantly improving memory and cognition after 21 hours of sleep deprivation - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2527s)

2) Creatine at 5 grams daily increased sleep duration by nearly 1 hour on resistance training days in young women, alongside notable strength improvements - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2941s)

3) Taking only 5 grams of creatine per day likely undershoots brain benefits—research shows 10 grams substantially boosts brain creatine levels, and temporarily increasing to 20 grams is ideal when sleep-deprived or stressed - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2416s)

4) Creatine combined with more than ~250 mg of caffeine (about one Starbucks large coffee) disrupts calcium regulation in muscle cells, reducing its performance benefits - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5165s)

5) Creatine supplementation significantly eases depressive symptoms when combined with medication—likely due to reductions in neural filament, a sign of brain cell damage - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=3235s)

6) Creatine taken alongside exercise increases muscle uptake by 37%, compared to 25% without exercise - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5024s)

7) It's totally safe for kids - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=4245s)

8) If you want to avoid digestive issues, just take it with food or break it up into smaller doses. - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=4863s)

9) No... it doesn't cause hair loss - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5627s)

Coffee shops, parks, and art galleries became her sanctuaries, places where she could escape the noise of the world. Yet, it wasn’t just the art or the aroma of fresh coffee that drew her there; it was the hope of connection.

Sara had recently dabbled in the world of online dating. At first, it felt exhilarating—swiping through profiles, exchanging witty banter, and finding sparks of chemistry. But as the weeks progressed, a pattern began to emerge. Men would show interest, shower her with compliments, and suggest meeting up. Each time, Sara felt a flutter of excitement, a possibility.

One particular evening, she met Michael at a quaint café. He was charming, with a disarming smile and a passion for poetry that resonated with her own love for words. They talked for hours, sharing stories and dreams, laughter spilling into the evening air. When he asked to see her again, Sara felt a rush of hope. 

But as their next meeting approached, Michael’s texts grew sporadic. “Sorry, I’ve been swamped at work,” he’d say, followed by days of silence. Sara felt a familiar pang of disappointment. She tried to brush it off, reminding herself that everyone has busy lives. Yet, the pattern continued. 

The next man, Alex, seemed even more promising. He was spontaneous and adventurous, inviting her to try rock climbing. Their first date was filled with adrenaline and laughter, and Sara walked away feeling invigorated. But soon after, the messages dwindled. “I’m so busy with my new project,” he texted, and then he vanished, leaving her with unanswered questions.

After a series of these encounters, Sara began to feel disheartened. Each time she opened her heart, it felt like an invitation to an empty room. Friends offered advice: “Maybe you’re too available,” or “You should play hard to get.” But Sara didn’t want to play games; she wanted genuine connections.

On March 20th, I went in to have my CBC and ferritin re-checked and my eosinophils were at 700 (10%). I went in to have it re-checked on March 28th and they were even higher. 1,700 (26%). My WBC was normal at 6.6 and my RBC also at 5.1.

It's not really allergy season where I live yet and I have no allergy symptoms. The two things the internet points to are allergies or parasites. Now I'm wondering if it could be possible that the same culprit for my initial iron deficiency could have been strengthened by the additional iron and now my body is fighting it? I haven't traveled out of the country but I have never been tested for any parasites. I'm wondering if I should request this from my primary or wait another week and re-test to see if the count has increased or decreased?

I really don't have any other symptoms other than some intestinal cramping and occasional loose stools. I had one strange incident one morning where my face did turn red and I became very itchy with rashes all over my arms and torso. This was after drinking a new coffee that I had never tried before. This has not happened since.

I guess I'm mostly concern if these elevated levels pose any risk for organ damage? Everything I can find online indicates that eosinophils ranging from 1,000 to < 5,000 is considered moderate, and that anything above 5,000 may cause organ damage. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1743451980.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Have made my way through most of this bag, and the last of my order

This is one of their 4(!?) espresso blends, and the first I've tried. It's their most affordable coffees at $21 per 300g bag!

I have no idea how it stacks up against their other 3 blends so I'll have to come back and comment on it later

However, the breakfast causes me diarrhea but the other two meals do not, even though they are the same size.

What is it causing it? 

I usually eat only meat with cheese and sometimes a handful of pecans.

No sweeteners, no MCT oil, no extra butter, no snacking.

I drink only black coffee with bit of salt",1,1743451936.0,keto,6,1.0,False
