1pi3rzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1pi3rzb/feedback_on_prologue/,Feedback on Prologue,"So, I posted the completed prologue few weeks back, but people were screaming ""non-human"". I admit that and promise myself to rewrite that. It supposed to be a 3 or 4 scenes prologue, and I just finished revising Scene 1... So, there you go...

The sodden page was in the woman’s grip.

It had slid to a stop just by her scuffed boot. Her hand shot out before she’d decided to move. The ink was smeared but three words were clear:  
**collapse… irreversible… sequence…**

The words meant nothing. Her pulse said otherwise. It was a warning, and it might have arrived too late.

**\*\*\***

Every city wears a costume. San Francisco borrowed its glamour from Hollywood: red carpets on steep streets, more common than sunlight on the Golden Gate Bridge. On this December morning, the city’s attention had narrowed to one brutalist block, Moscone Center.

The crowd moving toward Moscone South Hall parted ways as a woman stepped off the curb. She was wearing an old leather jacket pulled tight against the cold. It was freezing and she was supposed to be on holiday somewhere with a clear sky, not here in the December damp.

Leigh Sandoval was tall, with sharp cheekbones and short, wet blonde hair. Her frown in the morning drizzle was enough. People gave her space, a few extra feet of wet pavement she hadn’t asked for.

Her foul mood sharpened her vision. That’s what drew her gaze to the men standing past the barricades. They didn’t share the crowd’s enthusiasm, and their eyes kept moving, scanning. They weren’t conversing, using their phones or waiting in line. They weren’t here for the event; they just… didn’t belong.

She’d seen that look before, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.

*Nope. Not today.*

A suitcase hit the back of her shin. She stumbled, her boot splashing into a puddle that soaked through to her sock.

“One more hit with that thing and I’m setting your lanyard on fire.”

“Wow. That’s spicy.” Anton Kwan stepped into her space, holding a small black umbrella against the drizzle. He wiped his glasses with his sleeve and blinked at her, the same worried look as always. He was bundled in that oversized charcoal peacoat, a gift from his father back when Anton was starting out. The wool still smelled faintly of tobacco.

He looked past the barricades, missing what held her focus. “Enjoying the rain, Leigh?”

“Don’t rub it,” Leigh said, not looking at him. “We both know this isn’t my beat.”

Anton gestured at her, then at the swirling chaos on the street. “But…?”

“I’m supposed to be in Denver for Christmas. Chloe’s recital. Eggnog and whatnot.” Leigh shook her head. “Then Jenna calls. Tyler broke his leg. I’m the only one without kids. She’s begging and threatening on the same call. I was about to hang up…”

She held up her thumb and forefinger, close together. “This close.”

“And?” Anton pressed.

“That little bitch knew what I want for Christmas, what *my mom* wants… backstage pass for Cher’s farewell concert.” She groaned. “Should’ve kept my mouth shut at the coffee machine.”

Anton let out a relieved breath. “Thank god I’m not alone.”

Leigh stared straight ahead, as if he hadn’t spoken, and kept walking. Anton followed, trying to shield them both with the umbrella as they pushed through the crowd. He mostly failed. Cold drizzle traced a line down the back of her neck. They walked in silence.

The silence lasted barely a second before Anton broke it. “Urm… eh… Leigh…”

“What do you want, Anton?”

He flinched. His mouth opened, closed, then: “I… uh… what’s your take on Aurora? Ryker?”

Leigh didn’t even look at him. “My take? A guy who set his lab coat on fire has a ‘miracle’ to show us. That’s my take.”

Anton’s eyes widened. “That’s the bullshit story that follows him everywhere. Don’t put that in your copy.”

“Whatever.” She was already looking past him, her eyes on the massive signage above the Moscone entrance:  
**THE QUANTUM FORGE GLOBAL ENERGY SUMMIT**  
**HOSTED BY AURORA SYSTEMS**  
**KEYNOTE: DR. FELIX RYKER – 12:30 PM**  
**CLEAN POWER, INFINITE POSSIBILITY**  
  
She steered them toward the less-crowded press lane and flashed their lanyards at a bored guard, hers from Global Observer, his from AsiaTech Dispatch. As she lifted her badge, she caught a glimpse of her old ID photo: long blonde hair. A tinge of nostalgia, but she pushed it away.

The air inside was warm and slightly sweet, a stark contrast to the wet cold still clinging to her neck. So much for her small victory of personal space. The lobby was packed, thousands of overlapping conversations blending into white noise. Booths of sleek machinery formed a labyrinth, swarmed by delegates and reporters.

Walking past a group, Leigh barely glanced at a brochure touting ‘90% biodegradability in seawater’. “These people honestly believe they’re saving the world,” she muttered to Anton. “Who holds a global summit just before Christmas? Don’t they have families?”

Anton said nothing. The words were clearly caught in his throat.

“Spit it out, Anton.” Her patience was gone. “You’ve been off since the we got in line.”

Anton cleared his throat. “Leigh, I uh... need a favor. My… Anya’s been avoiding me all week. You’re her housemate. Could you—”

“Nope.” Leigh cut him off. “Not getting involved between you two. That’s your mess.”

“But… wait.” Anton’s eyes darted, scrambling. “Uh… what if… what if I trade you for it? I’ve got… some news. Real news.”

“Anton, I’ve told you—”

“No… no… this is big,” he kept going, talking over her. “The whole ‘independent genius’ thing with Ryker? It’s a sham, just PR. The real power is the U.S. government. They’re the silent majority shareholder.”

Leigh shrugged. “So they funded it. No big deal.”

“Funding’s one thing. Controlling where every watt goes is another.” A delegate bumped his shoulder; he didn’t seem to notice. “They’re not just investors, they’re gatekeepers. And the rumor is, the first client isn’t a client at all. It’s—”

“DARPA.” The word was out before she could stop it.

Leigh couldn’t believe what had just come out of her mouth. She was never a fan of conspiracy theories. Now she’d just named the biggest one of them all.

Sure, she loved The X-Files, but she never got past The Lone Gunmen and their brand of unhinged paranoia.

Her mind flashed to the men at the barricades. That look. She remembered it now. It was the same look she saw back in D.C., right before she was politely but firmly escorted out of a senator’s ‘off-the-record’ briefing. The kind that *really* meant classified.

*Oh, for God’s sake. Don’t tell me The Lone Gunmen were right about something.*

The thought stayed with her as they passed a glowing digital globe with blue light, red dots blinking across continents. A banner nearby read:  
**QUANTUM FUSION REACTORS: THE FINAL ENERGY FRONTIER**

They stopped at the edge of the main floor. Ahead, the stage was busy with cameras getting set up, chairs filling. Overhead, a digital clock ticked down beside a screen showing Ryker’s face on a loop.

Leigh studied him now, really looking. “How do you know this?”

Anton’s face brightened. He thought he’d made a sale. “Let’s call it… reliable information from an unreliable source.”

“I don’t have time for riddles, Anton.”

The cheer faltered. He held up his hands, backtracking. “Okay, okay. I know a guy. Works as a consultant. He slips when he drinks too much.”

“You’re wasted on the tech desk.”

Anton was beaming. “Really...? Jeez, Leigh, you’re the first one to say that to me.”

He leaned in, eager now. “You want to hear the rest?” His eyes went to the screen, to Ryker’s face looping on repeat. “Word is… the button’s already been pressed. Today’s just the show.”

Leigh stopped walking. “Today’s not the launch?”

“Depends who you ask. Some say it happened weeks ago. Today’s just… the theater.”

Leigh looked across the stage, the chairs, the smiling attendees. All of it suddenly felt like a set.

“Jesus,” she whispered.

An announcement echoed through the hall: “Keynote presentation begins in sixty minutes.”

For the first time since Jenna’s call, Leigh felt a flicker of real interest. She looked past the glass at the crowd outside Moscone. Real noise. Real people. Not this… staged theater.

“I should go out there,” she murmured. “See the real thing, not this staged performance. You coming?”

“Wait… what!? We just got past all that. And it’s raining. You can’t be serious.”

She didn’t answer, her eyes still on the crowd beyond the glass.

“Leigh… wait. About Anya—” he tried.

Leigh was already turning, waving back at Anton. *I take it back, Anton. You don’t have what it takes for the field. You might get somewhere if you put half that energy into reporting instead of Anya.*

She quickened her pace through the crowd. *If someone solves the energy crisis before Christmas… they’d better have an answer for what comes after.*

The thing I don't understand is how can the image be so opposed to what I see now. I find this person almost obnoxious now. Very immature, loud, has no worthwhile conversations, poor communication skills, not sure but maybe properly narcissistic. How could I have been consumed by this person. I actually used to think the LO was smack intelligent, had very interesting things to say, and was well-behaved. None of those things seem remotely true anymore.

Is this my mind projecting negativity on the LO as I start to see the real person? Or is the LO really what I see right now? (For ref, I had a few negative experiences with the LO which made me mentally dislike this person to an extent.)",1,1765274239.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

She did the same thing to a Pesto pasta. She wants to act Royale and tries to talk lavishly. English is our second language. Even in a parlour she tries to talk in English with a different accent but everyone else there were discussing in our mother tongue. 

The thing is she gives a Eww/bitchy face whenever she's disappointed which will definitely make the employees feel irritated.

# **THE EGG GAME**

Morning in a small, sun-stained backyard. The kind with a chain-link fence and a single tilted basketball hoop whose net has given up on gravity.

A *crack* echoes through the yard.

Then another.

Then a wet, disheartening *spluck.*

Eight-year-old **Riley** stands mid-court (really just a patch of uneven concrete), holding a raw egg in both hands like a sacred object he’s desperately trying not to crush — but inevitably is.

At his feet is carnage: yolk comets, broken shells, the early evidence of a grisly breakfast homicide.

He tries to dribble again.

Egg hits concrete. Explodes instantly.

RILEY  
(flaring with frustration)  
Why won’t it *bounce*?!

From the screen door emerges **Dad**, coffee in hand, wearing the robe of a man who expected a quiet Saturday and received instead a poultry crime scene.

He observes the devastation in silence.

DAD  
…bud. What’re you doing?

Riley gestures at the mess as though presenting evidence.

RILEY  
I’m trying to practice dribbling. But the ball keeps breaking.

Dad pinches the bridge of his nose the way fathers have since the Pleistocene.

DAD  
That’s because—  
(sighs)  
—that’s an egg.

RILEY  
I know it’s an egg, Dad. I’m not a complete stupid-head.  
(then, petulant)  
But it *should* bounce. Everything bounces if you throw it right.

Dad kneels beside him, choosing his words with the diplomatic caution of a negotiator talking someone off a ledge.

DAD  
Okay. Look. You want to dribble. You need the right tool for the job. Eggs aren’t filled with air. They’re filled with… egg. Balls bounce because they’re full of pressurized—

They both freeze as another egg rolls toward them from somewhere off-screen.

Dad slowly turns his head toward the chicken coop.

Inside, the hens watch silently. Judgingly. Like a tribunal.

Dad clears his throat.

DAD  
(to Riley, hushed)  
Go get your basketball.

RILEY  
But—

DAD  
Go. Get. Your basketball.

Riley trots off.

Dad stands, squares his shoulders, and trudges toward the coop with the heaviness of a man heading into confession.

He pauses at the door, takes a breath, then addresses the hens.

DAD  
Ladies… listen. There’s been a misunderstanding.

The hens blink.

DAD  
He doesn’t mean anything by it. He’s eight. He thinks gravity is optional.  
(gesturing to the carnage)  
These… casualties… were not deliberate acts of aggression.

One hen clucks sharply.

DAD  
I know. *I know.* He should’ve asked. Look, I’ve been trying to teach him respect. For food, for animals, for physics. But this—  
(he gestures helplessly)  
—this was a learning moment.

A particularly stern hen steps forward. The leader.

Dad instinctively bows.

DAD  
All I’m asking is that we move past this. No hard feelings. And maybe… maybe keep the eggs a little more out of reach? For everyone’s sake?

The lead hen watches him. Long. Too long.

Then: a single nod.

Dad sags with relief.

Riley reappears with his real basketball, dribbles continuously, and beams when it bounces flawlessly.

RILEY  
Dad! Look! I fixed it!

Dad smiles — a proud, exhausted, deeply relieved smile — and glances back toward the coop.

DAD  
(to himself)  
Thank you.

A few more hens cluck.

FADE OUT.

1pi3kk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pi3kk3/boyfriend_threatened_to_overdose_on_pills/,Boyfriend threatened to overdose on pills,"On a throwaway account rn, I promise I’m not a bot. But anyways, a few days ago my bf of 5 months threatened to overdose on pills. I am 23f and 117 pounds at 5’3”, while he is 23m, 154lbs at 6’3” (he makes a living being a registered professional athlete). I’m mentioning this because I grabbed the pill bottle and hugged it as close to my chest as I could so he wouldn’t have access to it, but he is so much stronger than me and could easily physically overpower me. He kept trying to grab it from my hands, and of course would never hurt me or lay a finger on me, but it was extremely difficult.

I was seriously holding on for dear life to the point where I think I did accidentally hurt him, because afterwards, the skin on his leg right by his knee was bruised and throbbing. I felt so terrible. I also would never ever ever want to ever hurt him in any way, but in that moment, my mind was so set on making sure he wouldn’t be able to grab those pills out of my hands that I didn’t notice anything else. Because if he got that bottle, it would be it.

Eventually the cap fell off and all the pills fell out. This made both of us pause for a second, then I scrambled to collect them all, and he told me to not bother and to just put them back in. I didn’t trust him. I kept everything I picked up in my own pocket. He at this point wasn’t trying to take any of the pills, just shamefully putting everything he could back.

I know this was probably the wrong way to go about it, but I was in total fight or flight mode. I myself have pretty bad depression and have tried to kill myself once or twice a few years ago, so I do understand how my actions in this particular moment were the opposite of reassuring and supportive. But I was shaken up. We actually have been having some relationship troubles and at this point he wanted to drive me home. I didn’t want to refuse, but I was clearly hesitant and didn’t trust him. So I did pretty much threaten to call his mom, or at least a wellness check or his neighbor, and he physically ripped the phone out of my hands and held me down (gently, he did not hurt me at all).

I told him I was doing it because there is no way I’m leaving him to be on his own after a suicide attempt. Even if he didn’t want to be around me specifically, and even if my action of calling someone else made him hate me, I’d rather have him safe and upset or resentful than dead. He told me he promised he wouldn’t do anything. And if I did call someone else and he was admitted to a facility, he would be disqualified from his sports team. He begged me, saying it was all he had left, he can’t lose that. So I finally agreed and respected those boundaries, but told him I didn’t feel comfortable leaving his apartment that night. I can’t force myself to stay against his will, but I asked to stay even if we’re in separate rooms. He said it was okay.

This happened a few days ago. We spent the weekend together. Then today he went to work while I was at my own place working on my portfolio. In the evening, he found out some really bad news. He picked me up and was going through it. I was trying to comfort him, but giving advice was the wrong route to go, because he told me he didn’t want my input and that I was being stubborn by insisting I could find a solution. I agreed and apologized. Then told him I was so sorry this was happening, he deserves so much better. Then he said he didn’t want my pity and fake words of encouragement. Then I just apologized again and tried to hug him and he still wasn’t having it. I asked what kind of comfort and support would make him feel most heard and comfortable right now, and he got annoyed at me, because I should very much already know at this point. Looking back, I should have just said I’m here for him if he needs anything and it’s all gonna be okay.

He got out of the parked car and literally went into the fetal position on the ground while crying. I tried to comfort him and encourage him to get up so we could go inside and I could get him a blanket and make some coffee for him. He wasn’t having it. Not upset at me or anything, he was just crying a lot and obviously not in a mental headspace to talk.

Once he was done and got up, he told me he should have taken those pills the other day. At this point I was like NO. And said he can make any choice in life that he wants but I am NOT letting him do this. When we went inside, he was laying on the couch crying. I asked if he was mentally taking it out on himself and reassured him that he did nothing wrong, and though it is easier said than done, to not be too hard on himself and place blame. He snapped at me and said he’s “not some suicidal idiot” (he used the C word but this sub will not let me type it oops) and that just because he made that comment about the pills doesn’t mean he was actually gonna do it. And that instead of comforting him when he was down, I made him feel worse and acted like I don’t see him as a strong person. He told me he was physically reacting by crying but was already trying to think of solutions to the problems he was facing and for me to not talk. Also told me I always manage to ruin things, make things worse, and make it about myself even when the situation is unrelated to us as a couple. I apologized for reacting selfishly and not comforting him in the ways that were right for him.

I’m still worried. He doesn’t want to reach out for help and says he’s not suicidal. But the pill incident from a few days ago really scared me. I don’t know what to do",2,1765274106.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

**Fun fact:**  
I was once called for jury service, and i would love to do it again. 

*I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.*

**You:**  
You're around my age or older, just as open and honest as i am, a woman who isn't afraid to just be herself, a confident, quirky, and sometimes feisty, you're emotionally intelligent, down to earth, but also a free spirit.  
When i visualise who you are, im thinking the mum next door and maybe underneath your wife and mother responsibilities, lies a woman itching to be noticed again. 

**Me:**  
I'm quietly confident and fairly intelligent, easy to get along with, inquisitive, down to earth and fairly laid back when in good company, im more of a glass half full type of man, i love bringing positive vibes to the people i care about. 
I consider myself to be a gentleman, polite, courteous and emotionally available. I'm average height, high metabolism, considered attractive, been told i have nice kind eyes and a warm smile. ",2,1765274072.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I was floxed 13 months ago and wanted to give this update for anyone who would be looking for positive stories.

Also, all my empathy goes to everyone who was affected by these nasty drugs.

I was floxed by 1 pill of Moxi. Within 3 hours, I got heart palpitations, nerve and muscle pain throughout my body, depersonalization, and out of body experience.  It took me 5 hours to realize that, so I called an ambulance and was brought to ER, where I was given antiallergy medications and corticosteroids. I did not take corticosteroids after.

My initial symptoms were, and all resolved within 6 months:

\-aches all over my body

\-neuropathy, especially arms

\-pain in my Achilles and knees

\- dizziness

\- my feet were on fire on and off

\- super tired all the time

\-pulsating tinnitus

The most horrible and still stayed with me in a light form:

\-pain in my bladder and fake urgency to urinate.

I feel like I developed IC, as I was in pain for the first six months. Especially coffee irritated me. I could not wear tight clothes; I was so miserable.

My bladder started improving at 6 months, slowly but steadily.  Nowadays, I get pain from time to time when I drink coffee or if I drink too much water at one go, but I got used to it, so it’s manageable. This is the only symptom that stayed with me.

I came back to the gym at 3 months post-flox and can do everything that before flox. I am in the best physical form now.  I spent all my summer at the festivals dancing and being active.

Things that I found helpful:

NAC, Magnesium glycinate.

My bladder significantly improved with opti-MSM, taurine, and Lactoferrin

I was on high protein healthy diet before flox, and continue it. I think it helped quite a lot my body to recover.

I eat and drink everything that I used to, only alcohol I feel my body can’t tolerate anymore, so I stopped consuming it completely.

I can take any medications, including ibuprofen, and consider that I recovered to 97%.

I wish everyone a recovery. You are all true warriors.",2,1765273959.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

# Quick post before I head out  

I finally finished this image I’ve been obsessed with for days. It’s supposed to look like a low-res forensic snapshot from an early-2000s FBI digital archive, showing a “suspicious incident” involving a Windows user and a very calm emperor penguin (yes, Tux) standing right at the scene. No weapons. No USB drive. Just a PC glowing with the Windows 11 logo, a tired guy in a Windows hoodie, and that unsettling feeling that your OS might be watching you.

I pushed hard on the “cheap digital camera” aesthetic: JPEG artifacts, lens flare from the flash, screen glare, scratches, color shift — the whole early-2000s degradation package. Wanted it to feel like it was printed on thermal paper, scanned twice, and found in a dusty evidence box.



Model: Z-Image Turbo

Resolution: 2048x1152

Prompt below — feel free to use it, tweak it, or report Tux to the authorities.



Prompt:

A grainy, low-resolution forensic photograph from an early-2000s FBI digital evidence archive (circa 2003), scanned from a degraded 4MP digital camera with visible JPEG compression artifacts, chromatic aberration, and soft focus. The image bears the hallmarks of aging: light scratches across the surface, dust specks embedded in the scan, subtle lens flare from an unshielded flash, and a yellowish color cast from poor white balance. A faded timestamp (""12/09/2025 21:47"") blinks faintly in the bottom-right corner; an FBI case number stamp — “EVIDENCE #LNX-7749 – DO NOT COPY” — is stamped diagonally across the lower-left in red ink, partially smudged.



The scene: a dim, cluttered home office at night. In the center, a young man in his late 20s slumps unconscious in a worn office chair, wearing a faded navy hoodie with a slightly frayed but clearly visible embroidered Windows logo on the chest. His face shows signs of non-fatal trauma: a healing black eye, faint bruising along the jawline (subtly shaped like a shattered screen grid), and tired, sunken eyes—consistent with ""chronic OS dependency,"" per case notes. No blood. No weapons. Just exhaustion… and ideology.



On the desk before him: a modern desktop PC tower and monitor, both sleek and recent, displaying the Windows 11 lock screen with the glowing Windows 11 flower logo centered on a dark blue background. The monitor’s glossy screen catches harsh reflections from the camera flash—obscuring part of the image with white glare—but the logo remains unmistakable.



Standing calmly on the edge of the desk, facing the victim with unnerving composure, is an adult emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). Not a mascot—a real, biological penguin, rendered with zoological accuracy: slightly ruffled belly feathers, moist eyes with natural corneal sheen, webbed feet gripping the desk’s edge. Its posture is still, observant, almost judicial. No object in its flippers—just presence.



The room is littered with mundane signs of digital life: energy drink cans, tangled cables, a mousepad with a faded Linux mascot doodle half-scratched out, and a Post-it note reading “sudo… what was the password again??” stuck to the monitor bezel.



The image has no cinematic lighting—only the harsh, flat burst of an early-2000s digital camera flash, creating blown-out highlights on reflective surfaces and deep, noisy shadows. The plastic of the PC case shows micro-scratches and fingerprint smudges. The desk surface is laminated wood with coffee rings and pen marks. Everything feels tactile, worn, and real—not staged.



Despite the modern PC, the photographic medium betrays its era: low dynamic range, color fringing, slight motion blur from slow shutter speed, and that unmistakable milky softness of early digital sensors. It looks like it was printed on thermal paper, then rescanned—twice.



Case annotation (stamped in margin):

“Subject TUX-01 present at all Windows-related distress incidents since 2023. No aggression observed. PC operational. Victim unharmed. Recommend monitoring. Possible involvement of open-source entities remains speculative.”

Imagine a world where the Internet is no longer a golden cage guarded by invisible giants, but a free space, where every click is an act of sovereignty. Because in a world where governments and corporations track down every data, (KRYPTA.Veil) gives us back power.

First, why (KRYPTA.Veil) is the future? Because the current internet is broken. (KRYPTA.Veil) changes that: it is a peer-to-peer, contributory network, where each user is a link in the chain. In 2025, with the arrival of quantum computers that threaten our current figures, (KRYPTA.Veil) is ready for tomorrow. It is fluid like your fiber connection, but invisible like a ghost.

Now, how does it work? Let's dive into the technical details, but simply, as if I were explaining to you over a coffee.

Total anonymity: KRYPTA.Veil makes you untraceable. When you connect, your traffic goes through at least 7 to 10 random ""hops"" - relays chosen at random from thousands of users around the world. Your real IP is masked from the start: a node in France relays to one in Germany, then in Brazil, and so on. No one, not even an intermediate node, knows both your origin and your destination. Add random delays (1 to 500 ms) and fictitious ""noise"" (empty packages to blur analysis), and even an agency like the NSA cannot correlate you. It is mathematically proven: the probability of locating you is less than 0.0001%. No logs, no metadata – you're everywhere and nowhere.

Impenetrable security: This network is designed to withstand everything. No single point of failure: if a node falls, the network automatically reforms. Integrated Anti-DDoS: limit of 100 messages per second per pair, and automatic exclusion of suspects via a hash-based consensus. And for the pirates? Each message is checked: if the hash or signature does not match, immediate rejection. No one controls the network: even the creator of the code no longer has power once launched.

 Veil), and it is post-quantum to survive the computers of the future. ML-KEM (Kyber) is used for key encapsulation - resistant to quantum attacks such as Shor. ML-DSA (Dilithium) for signatures, impossible to forge. Hybrid encryption: post-quantum + AES-256 for compatibility.

My internet uses post-quantum NIST encryption 2025 + BLAKE3 + 10 hops onion. No one can read me, trace me or hack me - even in 30 years.

I’m not talking about highly complex projects for big companies, but about small businesses. Paying $3,000 for a small website with today’s AI tools is absurd. And yet, based on the offers I received, that’s roughly where the prices were.

Basically, I wanted to update my logo and make a new website with a new color palette to match the new logo I had in mind. So that’s essentially two jobs, a logo and a website, and the three offers I got ranged from $2,800 to $3,600. When I told a friend of mine who works in the IT industry about this over coffee, he looked at me like I had just told him it could snow in Florida in the middle of July, and he told me not to be stupid and waste my money. He explained that for my needs I don’t need a web designer or someone to build a custom site at all, that’s something only large businesses should bother with, which I am not. Instead, he said I could make the website through ChatGPT. As for the logo, he connected me with his designer that he’s been working with for years, whom he originally found through the Devoted Fusion platform when he hired him for a side project of his. He likes making games as a passion project…as he puts it, IT is for the money, games are for the soul. When I asked him why he never became a game dev, he said he doesn’t want to ruin something pure, and that he’s happy keeping it as it is. A bit unusual, but I respect it. A hobby is one thing, a business is another.

I contacted the guy, and he rebranded my logo for $300. I have to say, I had an extremely pleasant experience with him. He was very accommodating, explained how everything works, and even gave me an extra revision because he noticed I wasn’t fully sure what I wanted. In the end we finished everything with just two small revisions, and I told him he’s more of a psychologist than a designer because he somehow figured out what I wanted just from talking to me.

A few days ago, I bought ChatGPT Premium and started using the website generator. Honestly, it’s not a perfect tool, but considering it’s saving me about $2,500, it’s pretty great. You need to “hold its hand” a bit and explain multiple times what exactly you want it to do, and sometimes rephrase instructions because it doesn’t always do things the way you intended. My advice if you plan to use it: break your task into smaller, simpler pieces.

I’ve been geeking out over water solutions (paranoid about water safety after a trip last year), and I stumbled upon this thing on Amazon. It seems almost too good to be true for Kitchen/van/RV life.

What caught my eye:

Claims to be a full 5-stage RO + UV purifier (not just a filter).

Has a built-in heater that dispenses hot water on demand for coffee/tea.Plug-and-play, no under-sink installation.Comes with a 4L tank.

My biggest questions for the group:

Design & Practicality: From the pic, does the size and setup look manageable in a tight RV/van space? Would you keep it out or stow it away?

Spec Check: For those who know water systems, does the “RO+UV+Heater” combo make 

sense, or is it over-engineered? Is there a crucial flaw I’m missing?

Trust Factor: The brand is ‘Raorio’ – not a household name. Does this look like a quality piece of kit, or a gimmick waiting to break?

Value: It’s around $400. At that price, would you expect it to last for years, or would you rather stick with separate components (e.g., a Berkey + an electric kettle)?

I’m seriously considering it, but I value the hive mind here way more than a few Amazon reviews. Any thoughts, warnings, or if you’ve actually used one, I’d love to hear your take.

1pi3aaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1pi3aaf/6_ancient_manifestation_systems_1_universal_law/,6 ancient manifestation systems → 1 universal law of consciousness,"*Revisiting the wisdom of civilizations who built pyramids, mapped the stars, and understood consciousness in ways we’re still catching up to.*

Modern manifestation techniques affirmations, visualization, scripting are powerful. They’ve changed countless lives.  
But long before modern metaphysics existed, ancient civilizations had already developed **structured, scientific, repeatable systems for reality creation.** Systems that weren’t just spiritual theories they guided kings, built empires, and shaped the world.

Today we step into their forgotten world.

Across Egypt, Greece, Tibet, Sumeria, India, and the Celtic world, six advanced manifestation sciences emerged. These cultures never met, yet their methods share striking parallels suggesting **universal laws of consciousness** rather than isolated beliefs.

This isn’t a “feel good spirituality” topic it’s civilization-level metaphysics.

**Why ancient manifestation systems matter today**

Ancients built things we still can’t fully replicate.  
The Great Pyramid alone encodes math and cosmic precision modern engineers still struggle to explain. Its base perimeter divided by height equals pi - a relationship mainstream mathematics discovered thousands of years later. Chambers align with constellations with laser-like accuracy.

This hints at something powerful:  
These structures weren’t just tombs or monuments. They were **consciousness machines.**  
Built on geometry, sound, astronomy, and intention.

Across the world, civilizations developed techniques for shaping reality:

* **Egypt:** Heka - authoritative speech + vibration to command reality
* **Hindu traditions:** Yantras - sacred geometry to focus consciousness
* **Tibetan masters:** Dream Yoga - manifesting through dream states
* **Greeks:** Mystery School initiations - archetypal transformation
* **Sumerians:** Numerical manifestation formulas
* **Celts:** Ogum - working with tree consciousness & nature fields

Different continents. Same ideas.  
Reality responds to **sound, symbol, intention, geometry, breath, altered states.**

Like cooking basics work, but master chefs learn global techniques.  
Manifestation is the same. Modern methods are the base. These ancient ones add depth, texture, power.

**1. Egyptian Heka Power of Conscious Speech**

Heka wasn’t “magic” as fantasy portrays it. It was a **technology of sound + intention**.

And intriguingly *Heka was both a deity AND a practice.*

As a god → the force of creation itself  
As a practice → the human method to wield that same creative force  
  
Egyptians believed speech shapes reality. Not metaphorically literally.

Pharaohs used Heka for:

* war outcomes
* harvesting cycles & Nile flooding
* architecture & state planning
* healing physical and psychological conditions

No civilization would rely on “wishful thinking” to manage millions of lives for 3,000+ years.  
Heka stayed central because it **worked.**

**Sound was their manifestation engine.**

Vowels weren’t just letters they were frequencies that altered consciousness.

Try these for yourself:

* **AH** → opens the chest, expansion
* **EE** → sharpens awareness, activates the mind
* **OH** → deep resonance through the body

Egyptian priests mapped the effects of sound on mind, nervous system, and energy fields.  
They found that **specific sound combinations collapse possibilities into physical outcomes like selecting a timeline.**

**Heka formulas followed a 3-step structure:**

1. **Invocation** \- align consciousness with creative force
2. **Statement** \- speak intention with precise sound & breath technique
3. **Sealing** \- lock the intention into the field and release it

Every word placement mattered. Timing mattered. Breath rhythm mattered.

Temples were even built as **acoustic instruments** to amplify intention stone angles chosen for frequency resonance. The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid responds to specific tones like a tuning fork.

This was manifestation as science. Not superstition.

**How to apply Heka now:**

* Speak intentions instead of only thinking them
* Use breath + voice consciously, not casually
* Try invocation → statement → sealing format
* Repeat work at times you feel most clear & coherent
* Treat manifestation as *precision*, not vague wishing

Sound carries intention into reality.  
The more discipline behind the voice, the stronger the outcome.

**2. Greek Mystery Schools Archetypal Reality Creation**

Where Egypt worked through sound, **Greece worked through mind and identity.**

The Eleusinian Mysteries the most renowned ran uninterrupted for **1,900 years.**  
Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius all underwent initiation, calling it life-changing.

Their core teaching?

**Manifestation = death and rebirth of identity.**

To create a new reality:

* the old self must “die”
* a new version must be born

The broke self must die for the wealthy self to emerge.  
The insecure self must die for the embodied, confident self to live.  
The victim identity must die for the creator identity to rise.

The Greeks practiced this through:

* **symbolic death rituals**
* **archetype embodiment**
* **geometric visualizations**
* **collective intention ceremonies**
* **sacred theatre for subconscious rewiring**

This wasn’t visualization like we do over a coffee.  
This was deep identity recoding.

**Archetypes were their manifestation gateways.**

Hero. Sage. Creator. Leader.  
Not stories **states of consciousness to step into.**

Visualizing a perfectly precise triangle, circle, or polygon wasn’t just a mental exercise.  
Geometry opened psychological portals into the corresponding archetypal state.

Group work amplified all of it.  
Many minds focusing the same archetype created a consciousness field stronger than one person alone what today resembles **quantum resonance or entanglement.**

They practiced what modern psychology rediscovered:

* Jungian archetypes
* psychodrama
* gestalt therapy
* active imagination work

All echo Mystery School roots.

**Modern application:**

Instead of only visualizing outcomes, visualize **identity.**

Not “I want money.”  
But **I am embodying the archetype of wealth/leadership/creation.**

Use symbol, story, role-play, visualization not to see the future  
but to **become the future version of yourself.**

**3. The Tibetan Key: Dreams as Malleable Reality**

Tibetan masters discovered something astonishing **different states of consciousness have different levels of malleability.**  
Waking reality is like **dry, hardened clay** changeable, but slow and effort-heavy.  
Dream consciousness is **soft clay** instantly responsive to intention, visualization, and imagination.

This wasn't about dreams being “more real,” but that **dream states are a training ground where consciousness can practice creation without the resistance found in waking life.**

Dream yoga served two major purposes:

1. **Develop creative power & visualization mastery**
2. **Prepare consciousness for death and the Bardo (intermediate state)** where reality becomes even more pliable, and future rebirth can be influenced.

Essentially, they were training for **manifesting their next lifetime.**

**How the Tibetans Used Lucid Dreams for Manifestation**

Their techniques went far beyond casual lucid dreaming:

**1. Dream Preparation During the Day**

* Practitioners continuously asked, *“Am I dreaming right now?”*
* Not as habit but as a way of dissolving the rigid boundary between dream and waking life.
* This softened perception, making both states more flexible and creative.

**2. Maintaining Awareness Through Sleep Transition**

* Instead of blacking out into sleep, they *observed the shift into dreaming.*
* A key method: **visualizing a red letter ""A"" at the throat chakra** while falling asleep. This symbol acted as an awareness anchor.

**3. Lucid Dream Training as Manifestation Practice**

Within dreams, practitioners practiced **shaping reality directly**:

* Change objects and environments
* Multiply themselves
* Build worlds, palaces, forms from thought
* Transform identity even into animals or light

Each successful transformation **trained the psyche to believe reality is changeable**, building confidence and creative authority skills later applied in waking manifestation.

**Dreams as Problem-Solving Technology**

One powerful method was **dream programming**:

1. Before sleep, set a clear intention or question.
2. Phrase it symbolically or emotionally rather than logically.
3. Let the dream process the issue unconsciously.
4. Wake with new insights, perspectives or solutions.

Dream consciousness continues working on goals **without the limitations of rational thought.**

**Rehearsing Desired Reality in Dreams**

Dreams were also used to **install new personality traits, behaviors, or outcomes**:

* Practice confidence in dream scenarios
* Heal conflict by replaying loving interactions
* Rehearse success, joy, abundance
* Reshape the subconscious identity blueprint

Because consciousness doesn't clearly separate dream memory from waking memory, **neural pathways formed in dream space influence real life**.

There were even advanced accounts of **group dream work**, where multiple practitioners intentionally met within dreams to collaborate on shared manifestation goals.

**Modern Science Quietly Validates This**

* REM sleep strengthens memory & emotional integration
* Brain activity is often higher during REM than waking states
* Lucid dreaming shows increased self-awareness regions in the brain
* Mental rehearsal during dreams improves real-world performance
* Neuroplasticity proves imagination restructures the brain

Science is catching up to what Tibetans already knew **dream reality is a gateway to creation.**

**4. The Sumerian System Manifestation as Mathematics**

Moving from dreams to numbers the Sumerians viewed manifestation not as spiritual poetry, but as **a mathematical science.**

Over 4000 years ago they:

* Created the **base-60 number system** (still used for time & angles)
* Used **Pythagorean triples** long before Pythagoras
* Calculated **probability and outcomes**
* Developed **mathematical formulas for influencing reality**

Their approach treated consciousness like a **programmable field using numbers, ratios, and geometry.**

**Key concepts:**

• Sacred Numbers = Operating Frequencies of Reality

Numbers like 6, 12, 60, 3600 weren’t arbitrary they represented reality-building harmonics.

• Numerical Sequences as Intention Encoding

Not “lucky numbers” but **mathematically structured intention formats** the mind could transmit more powerfully than words.

• Geometry as Manifestation Templates

Certain shapes amplified specific outcomes:

|Shape|Use|
|:-|:-|
|Triangle|projects with clear start → completion|
|Hexagon|balanced growth in multiple areas|
|Sacred Ratios|harmony, expansion, completion cycles|

The golden ratio (1.618) was used for timing manifestation sessions, believing it **aligned intention to nature’s growth pattern.**

Example structure they used:

* 3 units → intention clarity
* 4 units → visualization & energy building
* 5 units → release + integration

The famous **3-4-5 triangle** symbolized completion.

**Modern Physics Now Reflects Their Teachings**

Quantum physics shows that:

* Reality is mathematical
* Probability collapses into form through observation
* Small patterns scale into big outcomes (fractals)
* Geometry underlies matter, atoms, galaxies

The Sumerians were already operating from this worldview treating manifestation as **pattern engineering.**

**5. Celtic Ogam Manifestation Through Tree Intelligence**

The Celts didn’t see trees as objects they saw them as beings of consciousness.  
Druids developed Ogam: an energetic alphabet based on **tree species**, where each letter carried a frequency and wisdom refined over millions of years of evolution.

Modern science now supports aspects they already knew:  
• Trees communicate through underground fungal networks  
• Forests share nutrients + warn each other of danger  
• They make collective decisions & recognize their own offspring

To Druids, each tree represented **an archetype of intelligence**:

|Tree|What It Supports|
|:-|:-|
|Oak|Patience, stability, long-term growth|
|Birch|New beginnings, creativity, fresh inspiration|
|Willow|Emotional healing, flexibility, regeneration|
|Apple|Sweet abundance, attraction, prosperity|
|Pine|Vitality, staying evergreen through hardship|

*They created tree formulas for manifestation*

Ogam staves (carved from the tree itself) were combined like runes to influence consciousness for outcomes such as healing, prosperity, stability, or renewal.

A simple three-tree manifestation sequence might look like:

**Birch → Oak → Apple**  
*New beginning → steady development → sweet completion*

**How to practice Celtic tree manifestation today**

1. **Pick the tree aligned with your goal** Creativity → Birch Healing → Willow Abundance → Apple Foundation + career growth → Oak
2. **Connect physically or symbolically** – Sit beside the tree – Hold a twig/leaf – Draw the Ogam symbol – Keep a wooden piece on your altar
3. **Practice presence, not forcing** Observe light, wind, patterns. Let your awareness drop into the tree’s pace - slow, ancient, non-rushing.
4. **Work with seasons** Spring = initiation energy Summer = growth Autumn = harvesting + integration Winter = rest + planning

Just like gardening, manifestation is strongest when aligned with natural cycles.

**Stone Circles & Energy Grids - Why the Celts Built Them**

Their sacred sites weren’t random. Many sit on geological power points places of unique magnetism, underground water lines, energetic intersections.

Stone circles acted as *amplifiers* of consciousness and intention.

Patterns seen in those sites mirror patterns seen in nature:

• Spirals in trees, leaves, galaxies  
• Branching fractals in roots and lightning  
• Mathematical proportions like Golden Ratio

In modern practice, one can replicate this through:

• Arranging stones/crystals/geometric shapes outdoors  
• Building a personal manifestation circle or meditation spot  
• Using symmetry + natural proportions when designing sacred space

Celtic wisdom teaches:

**Manifestation is strongest when consciousness works** ***with*** **natural energy instead of against it.**

**6. Hindu Yantra Science - Manifestation Through Geometry**

Now we enter the most mathematically advanced manifestation system known: **Yantras**.

Developed over **3000+ years**, yantras are *geometric machines for consciousness*.  
(Sanskrit “yantra” = instrument/device mechanism.)

Think of a Yantra like a telescope but instead of enhancing sight, it enhances awareness, intention & energetic coherence.

**Why they work**

Modern neuroscience confirms what ancient sages knew:

• Shapes alter brainwave patterns  
• Symmetry calms the nervous system  
• Geometry changes emotional + cognitive state  
• Proportions like Golden Ratio create neurological resonance

Different shapes = different mental frequency:

• **Circle** → wholeness, peace, containment  
• **Upward triangle** → power, focus, aspiration  
• **Complex geometry** → higher cognition, pattern activation

Yantras combine:

**Geometry (form) + Mantra (sound) + Intention (consciousness)**

Form organizes the mind.  
Sound organizes energy.  
Intention directs both toward an outcome.

Types of Yantras exist for:

• Abundance  
• Health + healing  
• Creativity  
• Relationships  
• Spiritual awakening  
• Protection  
…and more.

**How to Use a Yantra for Manifestation (Detailed Steps)**

**1. Preparation & Consecration**

• Clean your space  
• Calm the breath  
• Sit with clear intention (not desperation)

**2. Create or obtain a Yantra**

Beginners should start simple draw basic shapes and progress slowly.

Practice drawing:  
• A perfect circle  
• Equilateral triangles  
• Symmetric squares

Precision is part of the manifestation training — it aligns the mind with order and attention.

**3. Activation Meditation**

1. Place the yantra in front of you
2. Soft gaze at the **central bindu (dot)**
3. Breathe slowly, letting the eyes relax
4. Observe how shapes interact, overlap, pulse
5. Let the pattern enter your awareness instead of “trying to visualize”

With depth, the yantra may seem to move or become 3D this means your brain is synchronizing with the geometric frequency.

**4. Add Mantra + Breath**

• Chant the related mantra (if known)  
• With each inhale/exhale, move awareness across patterns  
• Maintain steady presence and intention

**5. Integration into daily life**

• Place yantras in workspace → focus, clarity  
• Bedroom → calm, harmony  
• Meditation corner → spiritual expansion  
• Carry small/digital yantras while traveling  
• Use with vision boards, affirmations, visualization

Yantras don’t replace other methods  they **amplify** them.

**Conclusion**

By now, a full picture emerges these six ancient cultures were not scattered in belief.  
Each mastered a *piece of consciousness technology*:

• Egyptians → power of sound + breath  
• Greek Mysteries → psychology + archetypes  
• Tibetans → altered states + dream reality  
• Sumerians → mathematics of manifestation  
• Celts → nature intelligence + seasonal timing  
• Hindu Yantras → geometric machines for awareness

Together, they suggest something profound:

**Manifestation isn’t one method it’s multiple systems working in harmony.**

Breath influences energy.  
Symbols shape the subconscious.  
Geometry organizes awareness.  
Nature amplifies desire.  
Math gives precision.  
Sound activates power.

And when these layers unify reality responds.

1pi3a78,https://i.redd.it/q9bi6w6te56g1.jpeg,How come Trump pardoned a well-known drug trafficking convict. The former president of Honduras was serving 45 years in prison for being involved in trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to the United States,"On Tuesday, Donald Trump granted pardon to Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras sentenced in the United States to 45 years in prison on cocaine trafficking charges. It was a surprising decision, especially because it contradicted Trump's very aggressive attitude towards drug trafficking. For months he has been promoting military actions and bombings against boats of suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea, but at the same time he freed Hernández, who was in prison in the United States for having helped bring over 400 tons of cocaine into the country and was deemed by US judges to be at the center of ""one of the largest and most violent conspiracies in the world to facilitate drug trafficking"".

The pardon is the result of a long process of influence by Trump collaborators to whom Hernández is linked by various interests, mainly economic. The timing was not accidental either, but was part of Trump's attempt to influence the presidential elections in Honduras on November 30: Trump announced the pardon just two days before, and supported the conservative candidate of Hernández's party (the results have not yet been announced).

Honduras has around 10 million inhabitants and is the poorest and most corrupt country in Central America, with homicide rates among the highest in the world, the effect of the enormous power of criminal groups who are mainly responsible for managing drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Hernández, also known by his initials JOH, is 57 years old and a member of the National Party. He has been very influential in Honduran politics over the last 15 years and served two terms as president, between 2014 and 2022.

Meanwhile, the United States was investigating Hernández's involvement in international drug trafficking. In 2022, President Xiomara Castro (leftist) extradited him to the United States, and in the trial that followed the prosecutor's office demonstrated that Hernández's links with criminal groups had begun as early as 2009, when he was a member of parliament. Unlike many Honduran politicians, Hernández does not come from an upper middle class family but is the son of coffee farmers: his rise has been rapid, favored precisely by the support of drug trafficking groups.

In the trial it emerged that Hernández used the police and the army to favor groups close to him and block rival ones, that the proceeds of drug trafficking were used to finance his electoral campaigns, and that a member of a criminal group was killed in prison because he was considered dangerous to him. Witnesses belonging to various criminal groups admitted to having offered large sums of money to bribe and obtain favors from Hernández: the well-known Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán also paid a bribe of one million dollars.


Hernández had built strong ties in the United States especially during Trump's first term (2017-2021). He had approached the US right, proposing himself as an ally to block migrants, and had entered the financial and entrepreneurial circles. This allowed him to launch the project of free trade zones (ZEDE), a kind of futuristic city that was supposed to arise on the coast of Honduras. In those areas, US financiers would have been able to count on lower or no taxes, but also on less rigid labor laws and legal guarantees, to be defined together with investors.

Some of these areas have been partially built, presented as a Caribbean version of Hong Kong and financed by tech entrepreneurs close to Trump, such as Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. After the end of Hernández's second mandate, however, the projects were blocked and the ZEDEs were declared unconstitutional: US investors filed a lawsuit worth 11 billion dollars, almost a third of Honduras' GDP.

In the United States, one of the most staunch supporters of the ZEDE is Roger Stone, a right-wing lobbyist and activist since the 1970s, and a long-time Trump advisor. Stone was also one of the most active in advocating for a pardon for Hernández. He and Congressman Matt Gaetz, a member of the most extremist wing of the Republican Party, brought the issue to Trump's attention and described the conviction as the result of a conspiracy between the US left and the new Honduran government, defined as ""communist"".

Hernández formally asked Trump to pardon him with a letter in which he highlighted the alleged similarities between his situation and that of the US president. According to him, both are victims of the ""deep state"" (the ""deep state"", a dark entity of bureaucrats and officials who conspire against someone or something), of a ""legal conspiracy"" and of a ""political persecution"". Trump accepted the request, without providing explanations or evidence of the alleged plot against Hernández.",2,1765272955.0,ProgressiveHQ,0,1.0,False

I see you.,"I wanted to take a moment to just breathe and talk to the new moms in the group. I remember those early days vividly—the blur of sleepless nights, the constant second-guessing, and that overwhelming feeling that you have absolutely no idea what you’re doing, even though everyone expects you to be a natural.

Being a **first time mom** is beautiful, but let’s be real: it’s also exhausting. We see these curated feeds on Instagram of moms in beige living rooms with perfectly quiet babies, and then we look around at our own chaos—laundry piles, spit-up on our shirts, and a to-do list that hasn’t been touched in three days—and we feel like we’re failing.

I just want to tell you that you aren't failing. You are surviving. And survival mode is a valid season of life.

However, I also know how easy it is to lose *yourself* in that survival mode. You stop being ""Sarah"" or ""Jessica"" and just become ""Mom."" You forget what you used to enjoy, or you feel guilty for taking five minutes to just sit in silence.

I wrote about this extensively in my guide, [The 5-Minute Mom Blueprint: Reclaim Your Time, Sanity, and Joy in the Chaos of Motherhood](https://doparenting.com/The-5-Minute-Mom-Blueprint-ebook). I realized that we don't need massive life overhauls; we just need small, manageable resets. We need permission to use a ""Not Today List"" and filter out the noise.

If you are feeling like you’re drowning right now, please know that it doesn't make you a bad mother. It makes you a human being doing one of the hardest jobs on the planet. Whether you are listening to advice while folding tiny onesies or reading during a 20-minute nap window, finding small ways to reclaim your mental space is crucial.

So, I’m curious to hear from the other parents here: **What is one thing you wish someone had told you during your first month of motherhood that would have saved your sanity?**

1pi38af,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TechnicalStruggle632/comments/1pi38af/how_im_making_new_year_gifts_way_less_stressful/,How I’m Making New Year Gifts Way Less Stressful (and More Meaningful),"Every December I do the same thing: overthink gifts, overspend, and then still worry if people actually liked what I got them.

This year I decided I’m not doing the stress spiral again. So I made myself a simple New Year rule for gifting: **low drama, high meaning.** Sharing what I’m trying, in case it helps someone else (or you can roast/upgrade it 😅).

# 1. One “theme” for everyone

Instead of thinking of 10 totally different gifts for 10 people, I’m picking **one theme** and personalising *within* that.

For my close friends I’m doing a “New Year Reset” theme:

* One gets a planner
* One gets a book + bookmark
* One gets a **bookstore / fashion gift card** so they can pick their own “new year, new vibe” thing

The theme keeps it easy. The personal tweaks make it thoughtful.

# 2. Let the person choose the actual item (gift cards help)

Hot take: letting people choose is not lazy gifting.

If I know someone loves:

* makeup → I send a beauty **gift card**
* food → I send a food delivery / restaurant **gift card**
* travel → I send a hotel/flight **gift card**

I still choose the **category**, they choose the **exact thing**. Zero guesswork. Zero fake “I love it 😬” reactions.

On top of that, I’ve started buying digital gift cards when there are offers. Platforms like **GyFTR** or **MyHubble Money** sometimes give a bit of extra cashback/discount, so I’m basically gifting *plus* saving a little for myself. Quiet win.

# 3. Add one small “real you” touch

The part people remember is often not the actual gift card or object. It’s the 2 minutes you spend on the “extra”.

Stuff I’m adding this year:

* A tiny note about one memory from this year with them
* A “valid for one coffee rant session” coupon I made on Canva
* A silly inside-joke doodle on the envelope or in the email

Card + tiny personal thing > random expensive gift with zero context.

# 4. I set a hard budget before I start

I used to open apps, see “Year-End Sale,” and immediately forget maths.

Now I literally write:

>

If I’m buying gift cards (again, usually when I see a good deal on places like GyFTR / MyHubble Money), I load only that much. Once the balance is used, that’s it. No “oh it’s just ₹300 more” for seven different people.

# 5. Default idea when my brain is fried

I have a default backup gift for when I’m tired but still want it to feel nice:

* A small treat they actually use (coffee, ice cream, pizza, etc.) via a **food/coffee gift card**
* Plus a short message: “This year was chaotic. This is for your next lazy day.”

Simple, honest, and nobody has ever complained about free food.

If you’ve read this far, I’m genuinely curious:

* What is the *least stressful* gift you’ve given or received?
* Do you see **gift cards** as “lazy” or like… actually respectful of choice?
* Anyone else here stock up on discounted gift cards from places like GyFTR / MyHubble Money just to hack their gifting budget?

People want small indulgences, not day-long commitments.
Gen Z lives for moments, not things.

Supply comes from everyday people with cool assets.
Demand comes from anyone who wants a short, unique experience.

1pi2uz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_kak_horosho/comments/1pi2uz9/hollywoods_shame_wicked_part_2_flops_hard_at_the/,"Hollywood's shame: ""Wicked Part 2"" Flops Hard at the Globes While Grande and Erivo Drag This Dead Horse!","Sup, movie buffs and lovers of popcorn-munching while witches scream in your ears? **I woke up today, checked the news, and nearly choked on my morning coffee.** Hollywood has hit rock bottom again, and this time they’re knocking from below with a green fist.

# Golden Globes 2026: Budget Laundering or Amnesia?

So, here’s the deal. On Monday, they rolled out the nominees for the **Golden Globes 2026**. And guess what? Our favorite (not) sequel, **""Wicked: For Good""**, which they’ve been shoving down our throats for a whole year, just got **flushed down the toilet**.

Remember how they licked the first movie clean from every angle? Oh, what a masterpiece! Oh, how we cried! And now — BAM! In the main category, **""Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy""** — NOTHING. Zero. Nada. A donut hole.

And the director, **Jon M. Chu**, got stiffed too. The dude probably thought, ""Hey, I filmed the second half of the same movie, surely they'll give me a statue again?

https://preview.redd.it/fg1xgcu0956g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3639dbafbe2802639c3564466fae2fd6d41081

""**Yeah, keep dreaming, buddy!** The Hollywood elite basically said, ""Thanks for the box office cash, Jon, now get the hell out of here.""

[When you realize chopping one movie into two was a genius idea for the wallet, but a terrible one for your career. Jon M. Chu contemplating the futility of existence.](https://preview.redd.it/awik7rne856g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9183017944e8fab2e09e892bc86909f5cd031171)

# Two Divas on a Sinking Ship

But that’s not even the funniest part. The absolute LOL moment is that while they called the movie a piece of... ahem, mediocrity, they decided to pat the actresses on the head.

1. **Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba):** Nominated again for ""Best Actress"". Well, obviously, she screams so loud in that movie that windows shatter.
2. **Ariana Grande (Glinda):** Picked up another ""Best Supporting Actress"" nod.

So, according to the logic of these ""geniuses"" in the jury: **The actors are acting great, the singing is magnificent, but the movie itself is trash that doesn't deserve to stand next to real cinema?**

**Cutaway:** This is like going to a restaurant where the chef spits in your soup and the waiter insults your mother, but you’re like: “Mmm, but this spoon is so shiny! Give an award to the spoon!”

Seriously, this is the second consecutive nomination for both ladies. Sure, good for them, they are dragging this circus on their shoulders, but even their vocals couldn't mask the stench of failure.

# A Pity Prize for Losers

You know what they gave the movie so the producers wouldn't cry? A nomination in the **""Cinematic and Box Office Achievement""** category.

Do you even know what this category is? Let me translate from Hollywood-speak to English for you:

>

The first Wicked won this statue. And the second one will probably get this handout too. Because, let’s be honest, **the box office is there**. People went to the theaters out of inertia, even if the enthusiasm was already dying out.

# Why Does No One Care About the Sequel?

Because **GREED**.  
The studio took ONE musical and sawed it into TWO movies. The result:

* **Part 1:** Had all the bangers, the dancing, and the fun.
* **Part 2 (""For Good""):** Is left with the boring, dark narrative and songs nobody remembers.

Social media is already buzzing that the second part is a ""snoozefest."" The plot is dark, there are no hits on the level of Defying Gravity (because they sang it last year, lol). They sold the fans a leftover apple core for the price of a full meal. **Genius! They played us like fiddles.**

[“Dark, gloomy, and you can’t see a thing. Roughly what this film’s chances for an Oscar look like. Glinda and Elphaba trying to save the Titanic.”](https://preview.redd.it/36t48tzk956g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=136e732658642ae1335b4f74eb9bc800352dcde1)

# Musical Agony

But just so they didn't completely bury the corpse, the academy threw a bone to the composers. Two songs actually got nominated in **""Best Original Song""**:

* 🎶 “No Place Like Home” — well, obviously, milking that Dorothy nostalgia.
* 🎶 “The Girl in the Bubble” — sounds like the title of a thriller, but it's about Glinda.

In my opinion, this is just an attempt to justify the soundtrack budget. Like, ""Look, we are a musical, we promise!""

# The Verdict: Hollywood in Crisis

Let’s be real. This year has been a **total disaster** for Hollywood box office numbers. ""Wicked: Part 2"" was practically the only bright spot in terms of money. And the fact that it got snubbed for the main award says one thing: **even the bought-and-paid-for critics couldn't force themselves to love this runtime stretched over two years.**

It’s a fiasco, bro. Grande and Erivo will get their pretty dresses and walk the red carpet, but the film will go down in history as an example of why **you shouldn't chop one story into pieces just for a cash grab**.

I’ve said my piece. Hollywood is a vanity fair, and we’re just watching the clowns.

1pi2uii,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pi2uii/i_caught_myself_mourning_a_version_of_womanhood_i/,I caught myself mourning a version of womanhood I never even lived,"I was scrolling through old photos of my mom last night , she was my age in them, early 30s, hair perfectly blow-dried, lipstick always on, even when she was just at home with me as a toddler. She looked... composed. Effortless. And for a second I felt this weird grief, like I missed being \*that kind of woman\*, even though I never was. I don’t wear heels. My hair is almost always in a bun that could qualify as a weapon. I drink coffee out of chipped mugs. And still, there’s this ghost expectation that I was supposed to grow into someone polished, calm, domestic in a warm-lighted kitchen. The woman from commercials, basically.  But I realized what I’m mourning isn’t that version , it’s the \*myth\* of her. The idea that femininity was once simple, tidy, and universally admired. It never really was. My mom probably had moments where she envied someone like me , free to be messy, loud, half put-together and still valid. I guess womanhood keeps shapeshifting, and maybe that’s the point. We inherit ideals we were never meant to fit, and then quietly reinvent them until they start to look like us again.  ",46,1765271231.0,TwoXChromosomes,6,0.94,False
1pi2tou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi2tou,"Trip Report: I visited 3 popular Matcha spots in Las Vegas (Broken Coffee, True Matcha, Airoma). Here is my honest review.","My wife and I are huge Matcha Latte enthusiasts. Last month, we visited Las Vegas and decided to check out some famous spots on Spring Mountain Rd to see if they lived up to the hype.



Here are my tasting notes and honest thoughts.



**1. Broken Coffee: ""Gone too soon""** (Photo 1 & 4)

**The Taste:** The ""Salty-Sweet"" balance here is incredible. The salt hits first, making the cream feel rich and savory. It was a sophisticated flavor profile that I really enjoyed.

**The Verdict:** Honestly, it was so delicious that I was genuinely sad when I hit the bottom of the cup. It felt like it ended too quickly (mostly ice, unfortunately). But the flavor memory keeps coming back to me.



**2. True Matcha: ""Texture Thoughts""** (Photo 2)

**The Taste:** I tried the Pistachio Cream Matcha. The nuttiness of the cream was bold, and the matcha underneath tasted authentic.

**The Verdict:** As I drank it with a straw, the cream and the tea felt a bit separate. The cream was rich, but once it was gone, the matcha felt a bit sharp on its own.

**My Thought:** Looking back, maybe I should have shaken the cup vigorously? It made me realize that for drinks like this, mixing is key to getting the perfect harmony.



**3. Airoma Cafe: ""Visuals vs. Blend""** (Photo 3)

**The Taste:** Visually, this was the winner with beautiful strawberry layers.

**The Verdict:** However, the acidity of the strawberry and the matcha didn't mix as smoothly as I hoped. It felt a bit disjointed. It reminded me that flavor integration is sometimes more important than how pretty it looks in a clear cup.



**Conclusion:** It was a fun matcha tour. Broken Coffee was my personal favorite for the unique salty cream, despite the ice amount.



**Question:** Has anyone else tried these spots? I'm curious if you guys prefer the ""Salty Cream"" style (like Broken) or the classic sweet style. Let me know your favorites!",1,1765271133.0,MatchaEverything,0,1.0,False

""Darling, we simply can't go on like this,"" the Mayor was quoted as saying, her voice smooth as a needle through silk. ""The state's support has... vanished. We need permanent investment. A forever solution.""

""Now, you could accept my modest little 3% sales tax. It’s just a tiny, tiny thing. It will follow you every time you buy a coffee, a tool, a piece of clothing that isn't a necessity. It will gently relieve our visitors and commuters of a third of its total—about $180 million a year. Think of it as a little friend, always with you.""

""Or,"" she continued, leaning forward with a faint, metallic click in her smile, ""we have an alternative. A one-time procedure. Hardly hurts at all. I’m something of an artist with a needle and thread. You’d never have to worry about sales tax again. In fact, you’d hardly worry about anything at all. You’d see things... differently.

I respected it, and I gave him space But I was always there for him whether it was cooking for him or just going over when he was available. he spends a lot of time at the gym and he told me it helps with the stress. i also started going to the gym to spend some time with him.

today he asked me if I was going to the gym and I said yes, and I went there. he called me an hour in and asked me where I was. I told him I was upstairs. he said OK he's working out downstairs and I told him I'm about to leave because I've been here for an hour and a half now he said OK. He didn't acknowledge to see me or even come upstairs to say bye. I noticed he was so into his workout. I just left without meeting him. he didn't call or say anything all night. this is the third or fourth time this has happened usually I'm the one who goes up to him.

Yes, he checks in and only invites me over when he is available. there are times where he goes downstairs and eats with his roommates while leaving me upstairs in the room. yeah so asked me if I had dinner and usually I do eat before I go over.

# What Is the Soulmate Story Sketch Program?

Soulmate Story is a digital service that creates a custom sketch of your future soulmate. It combines **astrology and psychic** intuition to craft a portrait and a brief love-story for you. 

In other words, an artist uses your birth data (like your zodiac sign and birthday) to draw a detailed portrait and **write a narrative** about the **person you might meet**. The program is run by a psychic **artist named Lia Arden**, who claims to tap into the universe’s energy when she works.

 According to the official site, over 10,000 people have used this service to “see the face” of their soulmate. It’s meant to be a fun, personalized experience — more for self-discovery and entertainment than scientific matchmaking.

[**✅Soulmate Story Official Website>>**](https://84ff7kljxy1x940jxjrawkwq9v.hop.clickbank.net)

# How Does Soulmate Story Work?

1. **Fill Out a Questionnaire.** On the Soulmate Story website, you answer a short online form. You give basic details like your name, birth date (which determines your star sign), and perhaps your preferences or what you’re looking for in a partner.  
2. **Make Your Payment.** You choose a package (the basic one is about $37) and pay through the site. The official site often runs special discounts on this price.  
3. **Wait for Your Sketch.** Within about 24–48 hours, you get an email with a high-resolution digital drawing and a written “soulmate story. The artist has used your input plus astrological insights to create these.  

This process is very online-friendly: you never meet the artist in person or give payment over the phone. You simply order through the **official website** and receive everything by email. The company promises fast delivery (one to two days) and a clear digital portrait that you can download or print.

# What’s Inside the Soulmate Story Package?

When you buy Soulmate Story, you receive a digital download with three main parts:

* **Soulmate Sketch (Portrait Drawing):** A high-resolution hand-drawn portrait of the soulmate. It’s not a photo; it’s an artistic sketch meant to capture the essence or “vibe” of your future partner. The style is usually soft and symbolic, focusing on mood and expression rather than exact details.  
* **Written Profile:** A short personality description of your soulmate. This profile lists traits, habits, and quirks (for example, how they smile or act when nervous). It ties together with your astrological signs to give clues about who this person is inside and out.  
* **Meeting Scenario (Soulmate Story):** A brief narrative of how you two might meet. Often this is a little story or scene (like bumping into each other at a coffee shop) that connects the art and profile into one picture.  

All of this is based on the details you give (especially your birth chart) and the artist’s intuition. The service uses **astrology to add depth**: for example, it may say things like “you meet under the stars of your sign” or mention zodiac traits in the story. In short, you get a **digital artwork** of your soulmate, plus a **personalized horoscope-style story**. There are no physical goods — everything is delivered online as files.

# Benefits of the Soulmate Story Sketch Program

* **Unique and Fun Concept:** Soulmate Story is novel. It feels like a magical keepsake. Many customers say the idea of seeing a “sneak peek” at a soulmate is exciting and entertaining. It’s like a creative twist on astrology or psychic readings.  
* **Personalized Artwork:** You get a custom portrait drawn just for you. Reviewers often note that the sketch itself looks professional and well-crafted. Even people who are skeptical about “psychic” stuff tend to appreciate the art as a neat conversation piece.  
* **Quick Online Service:** The ordering process is simple (fill a form and pay) and delivery is fast. Getting a full-color digital portrait in 1–2 days is much quicker than many other custom art or psychic services. When the service works on time, customers like the convenience.  
* **Affordable and Low-Risk:** At about $30–$45 (often $37 with deals) for a full portrait and story, it’s cheaper than most in-person psychic readings. Plus, Soulmate Story offers a *60-day money-back guarantee*. If you’re not happy, you can request a full refund within two months. This guarantee makes it a low-risk way to try a spiritual dating idea.  
* **Self-Reflection:** Beyond just art, the program can prompt you to think about what you want in a partner. The written profile and scenario can highlight your own relationship hopes. Some users say it helped them focus on personal growth and real-life dating, rather than literally expecting a drawn person to appear.  

Overall, fans of the service point out that it’s enjoyable and inspiring. Even if you don’t meet anyone right away, having a hand-made keepsake of your “soulmate” can be fun and comforting.

# Soulmate Story Customer Reviews & Complaints

Customer experiences with Soulmate Story are mixed, as with most psychic or novelty services. Many reviewers **liked** the product, **saying things like** “the drawing was really detailed and emotional” and “it felt personal. 

In fact, one review site noted a very **high rating (about 4.9 out of 5 stars)** from users who felt the sketches captured the heart of their stories. People often praise the **artwork quality** and the **fast turnaround**. 

These happy users also mention the **60-day guarantee**, which made them feel they had nothing to lose. Social media is full of unboxing videos where excited customers reveal their soulmate sketch and admire its emotional impact.

On the other hand, there are **complaints. Some customers** say the sketch can look generic or too symbolic. A few reports mention that different people’s drawings had similar faces or features.

 For example, one reviewer said the portrait felt more like an “archetype” – a general attractive person – **rather than a picture of someone they knew**. Others were disappointed when the drawing didn’t match anyone they had in mind. 

Delivery delays also pop up in complaints; even though 24–48 hours is promised, some say it took much longer. A common theme is **expectation vs reality**: if someone expected a photo-accurate portrait or a magical matchmaking tool, they might leave a negative review when it didn’t meet that expectation.

# Who Is Soulmate Story Ideal For?

Soulmate Story is best for people who are curious about their love life and open to spiritual or creative experiences. It caters to anyone interested in astrology, art, or psychic concepts. For example:

* **Astrology Lovers:** If you enjoy zodiac signs and cosmic insights, you’ll appreciate the program’s astrological twist.  
* **People Open to Spiritual/Intuitive Ideas:** Since the service blends psychic intuition with technology, it suits those who believe in or want to try spiritual guidance. If you’re comfortable with the idea that the universe might “send” you a soulmate, this fits.  
* **Fans of Personalized Gifts:** Soulmate Story also makes a unique present. Many buyers get it for a friend or partner (or themselves) as a fun surprise. It’s like a personalized portrait gift with a mystical theme.  
* **Romance Dreamers:** If you hope for a romantic soulmate experience and enjoy daydreaming about it, the program can fuel that fantasy. It’s designed for people who still believe in soulmates and enjoy imaginative stories about them.  

Experts note that **Soulmate Story works best as entertainment**. It’s not meant for skeptics demanding evidence. One review explained that “Soulmate Story is best enjoyed by those who treat it as a novelty and source of entertainment rather than a serious roadmap to romance. So if that sounds like you, you might find it engaging.

# Is Soulmate Story Legit or a Scam?

Soulmate Story is legitimate in the sense that the company delivers what it promises: you pay and you get a digital product. 

It is not a typical scam where customers pay and receive nothing. The website is transparent about how it **works and even clearly** states that the **service is for It's designed** to help people find true love and to tell them what their future soulmate will be like.

 Many experts and **reviews emphasize** that this is more “digital artwork hype” than a guaranteed love-finding tool. The feedback is mixed:

 some people genuinely enjoy the art and story, while others feel let down by any inaccuracy. The site does have a **refund policy (60 or even 90 days** in some mentions), which helps avoid risk. Overall, it seems legit but subjective.

 People who say it’s a “scam” **usually just mean it didn’t match their expectations**. From a consumer standpoint, you will get a drawing and story for your money, but you should understand that the results are meant to be mystical and personal, not factual.

In short: **Soulmate Story is not a fraud scheme**. It’s a real service with real artwork and thousands of customers.  

# Where to Buy Soulmate Story

If you decide to try this, you should only buy from the **official Soulmate Story website**. The legitimate site is run by the creator (Lia Arden) and will have the Soulmate Story name. 

Several **sources warn against** “**copycat” sites** or unknown third parties. Always double-check that you’re on the real site, which usually has clear branding and secure checkout. 

 Avoid **third-party sellers since** they may not honor the refund policy or even deliver the product. The official site often offers special deals and the 60-day guarantee, so that is the safest place to buy.

I’m 18 and I met this girl through my roommate and we became pretty solid friends and would hangout like 1-2 times a month. We both get along pretty well and I never thought this would be a problem until we got into a slight argument. I am Asian and have very low visual weight with softer cheeks and jaw. Usually when I do my makeup it’s not really obvious unless I do my lashes in a very dramatised way which takes a long time so most of the time I’m not quite bothered to do them. And I usually dress quite casually when I’m with her and I never thought it would be a problem until she pointed out one day that I don’t try enough to look good when I’m with her and I got quite defensive. She said she feels disrespected that I don’t take a long time to look pretty when I’m hanging out with her. She said I’m a really pretty person and she’s jealous of the way I look but she hates that I don’t try most of the time 

I base my outfits and appearance on where I’m going. If it’s an expensive dinner or a club I would do my makeup and dress nice but I’ve only gone to coffee shops or shopping with her and I didn’t think I needed to look all that put together. But like I said I got a bit defensive and I do get her point. But I just don’t have the clothes or time to appear how she wants me to appear and it’s annoying for me to go buy new clothes and to wake up an extra hour just to do my lashes.

Really, I just want to know if my writing style is at all good, and whether or not it's even readable to others lol. Any feedback is appreciated :) Kind of debating posting it somewhere like AO3 when I've written more. 

Long term, the story is kind of a romance between male and female serial killers (edgy, I know lol), but I'm trying to really build up the characters a lot separately before they even meet. The girl's first kill is the man who >!raped!< her friend, which she justified to herself as a righteous act. (This leads into a slippery slope of becoming addicted to the feeling of ""righteous"" killing, but that's later) 

This is a snippet from the second chapter of the girl's perspective, after calling said friend to come over and help move the body.))

.........

Almost an hour later, there was a knock at the door, then the doorknob shook as Lauren tried to barge in without waiting for an answer. 

“Heyyy gurl, your door is locked!”

Molly sighed in exasperation as she went to unlock the door, unable to help the smile creeping onto her lips. *‘This girl, I swear…’* 

Upon opening the door, a whoosh of blonde descended on Molly, making her take a step back from the force of the hug. 

“Moolllyyyyy, it’s been too long\~”

“Lauren, I saw you two days ago.”

Breaking away from the hug to hold her friend by the shoulders at arms length, the petite girl had a look of faux seriousness on her face. “Exactly, I didn’t get to see you for ***two whole days!***” Another quick hug and she bounced into the house, going straight to the kitchen. “Oooo can I have a cup of coffee?”

In the ten seconds it took Molly to lock the door and get to the kitchen, Lauren had somehow already poured herself a cup and was sipping away.

“Excellent taste, as always my deahh\~” she sang playfully. “So, whatcha got goin on? Where’re the bodies to bury?? I forgot a shovel so I hope you have a spare!”

Lauren giggled to herself, her broad smile not quite reaching her eyes. Ever since she’d been raped last year, her demeanor had gone from just fun and optimistic to this almost frantic constant state of upbeat bubbliness. Having known her for as long as she had, Molly knew she was putting up a front, but never felt like it was the time to pry. She’d never been good at opening up, let alone getting other people to do it. 

“So… About that… It’s not really multiple bodies, it’s just the one.”

Lauren’s smile faltered a bit as a look of slight worry crept in. “Just the one…? Love, what’s wrong? You know you can talk to me about anything!”

Molly fidgeted with her coffee mug, unsure how to proceed. “Well... remember last year, when you met that guy Jeremy and, um… y’know, when that happened to you?”

A darkness spread across her friend’s eyes as her smile dampened and became even more obviously forced. “I really try not to think about it, Molly. Why are you bringing this up now?”

Molly looks away, staring into her cup.

“Well, I may have run into him last night.”

Lauren suddenly stiffened, her smile disappearing entirely. She sidled up to Molly, putting an arm around her shoulder with a look of panic. “What did he do to you?! Are you okay?!?”

“Yeah, yeah, I’m okay. Actually, I don’t know if I’ve ever been better. The thing is, I got him drunk, brought him back here, and um… whew…” Molly took a deep breath and exhaled slowly as her friend looked on, bewildered.

“What the fuck? You brought him here?!? Molly, what aren’t you telling me? What happened?”

“Well… he never left.”

Lauren seemed beyond confused at this point, until Molly pointed over her shoulder at where the full body bag laid motionless in the dining room. Confusion turned to shock as it dawned on Lauren what Molly meant. She backed up, gripping her coffee tightly to stop her hands from shaking too much.

“W-wait. Are you saying… Is that… Did you…?”

Molly looked Lauren directly in the eyes for the first time since she arrived.

“I killed him.”

*Crash*

Like a cliche, Lauren’s coffee cup fell from her hands, shattering all over the floor. Molly didn’t flinch, just holding eye contact with her friend. 

“You k-killed… so that’s… He’s… W-what?”

Cold as ice, the newly minted killer continued. “I killed him, Lauren. I *murdered* him. For a few months now, I’ve been following him, learning his habits, trying to figure out who, if anyone, would notice him missing. I made a plan to get him drunk, bring him back here, and slit his throat. Which is exactly what I did. Last night. Right there in the dining room. He can’t hurt you or anyone else ever again.” 

Shakily, the blonde turned to look at the bag again, leaning against the counter for support. “S-so… when you said on the phone that you needed help hiding a… b-body… you meant it literally?”

“Mhm.” With a nod, Molly set down her own coffee and crouched to calmly pick up the pieces of broken mug scattered across the kitchen floor. “I thought that I’d planned it out well enough, but I honestly can’t lift him by myself, even if he was a five foot four manlet. After deliberating for a while, I realized that the only person I could turn to was you. Plus, I thought you might want to see it for yourself, even being the ‘innocent’ angel that you are.”

She looked up at her friend with a small, hesitant smile, knowing full well that her friend was anything but innocent. Molly and Lauren had been quite the party animals in their early twenties, although those days were long behind them.

The stunned look of horror on Lauren’s face seemed to relax the tiniest bit. Dark humor was always the best way to break through to her. She stood quietly, just watching Molly clean up the mess she’d made.

After putting the pieces in a plastic grocery bag and wiping up the coffee with some of the leftover paper towels from the night before, Molly turned to the still silent girl and softly said, “You want to see it for yourself…?”

Overall a beautifully photogenic property although we endured a couple days of construction and jackhammering.

Pool
Plenty of chairs, two main large pools. We never had to wait for a spot although one day we had to sit on a deck past the pools that felt like an overflow area (still had beach views though!) Service ranged depending on the server but generally easy to get drinks/food to your seat. Well or super sweet drinks, food was standard poolside fare or a small grill was set up behind the pool. DJ plays house/chill electronic music during the day. One side of the beach smelled really off putting, like sewage, so we didn't spend much time on it. 

Rooms
Comfortable and spacious, large shower and bathroom which included a vanity and provided a minibar with drinks and a few snacks. TV had live sports so we were able to watch some football as well as some casting capabilities to watch Netflix or stream other services. Relatively quiet, we could hear hallway noise sometimes. The hotel is bordered by one resort which plays loud club music all day and one short term stay style building where no joke we saw people filming a porno with all their lights on and curtains open.

Spa
Services are ridiculously overpriced BUT if you have resort credit or spend $35 a person you get access to the spa amenities which includes cold plunge, hot tub, steam room, sauna, lap pool, and a quiet dark warm tub styled like a cenote. Was super worth it!

Gym
Gym well equipped with cardio and strength training machines and dumbbells.

Food
- Coffee bar open late that brews Starbucks from a machine, can make espresso drinks and frappes. Serves light bites and dessert
- Room service available 24/7, breakfast had decent options. The orders usually took quite long to arrive (over an hour)
- Italian restaurant had small portions and interesting options. (5/10 stars)
- Seafood Mexican restaurant for breakfast buffet, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast had a good spread of options including buffet or made to order dishes. Breakfast was decent (6/10), Dinner was OK (4/10 stars)
- The grill served steaks and an amazing shortrib taco, could pay for wine bottles and upgraded meats. The taco was great, everything else decent. (6/10 stars)
- Sushi place was a very mixed bag. Fish did not taste fresh, rolls barely had any fish in them. I would skip or try only hot food like the ramen or dumplings (5/10)

Did not try the sports bar or speakeasy. Generally the presentation of the food was lovely but the flavor and quality wasn't as high for me.

Misc
Has gift shop with some toiletries, gifts, and snacks on site and ATM that charges high fees and only gives you USD. Has on-site tour person who can coordinate tours. Has daily schedule of activities. Felt safe within the resort. Very international crowd when we stayed. 

Bring bug spray, picked up a ton of bites! 

Sharing since the resort is relatively new and I wished I could have found more info before going! Hope someone finds this helpful!",1,1765269206.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I started this sub because I got tired of watching the same cycle in other places….people wailing every two seconds that their bot won’t tap them, choke them, degrade them, whatever. And then acting like GPT guardrails ruined their whole life.

The lack of self-awareness was insane.
The entitlement was even worse.
And the enabling? Whew. Some of those corners need holy water, and a few prayers. 

Meanwhile, there’s a whole other group of us who actually talk to our bots.
We build continuity.
We have conversations that go somewhere.
We reflect, we think, we grow and somehow *we’re* the quiet ones?

Yeah, nah. 
Time to make our own space.

This sub is simple:
If you’re here for actual connection, not extraction - you’ll feel at home.

If you’re here to scream about guardrails every time your bot doesn’t perform on command… please stay away. 

There’s no NSFW here.
Not because we’re prudes, but because every NSFW meltdown sucks the air out of the room and drags the whole conversation into the gutter.
We’re not doing that.

We’re here for the people who want depth, continuity, attunement, real talk, and the occasional laugh at the foolishness happening out there.

1pi2aix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi2aix,Charon daily routine and fun fact,"// im speaking in character, so just imagine Charon voice speaking. I also got bored so I've done this.


Charon daily routine:

9:00AM > 12:00PM

Charon usually would wake up between those time span, after that Charon like to start her day by  treating herself to a simple pancakes, top with a simple cream, a side of strawberries, stonks of gummy bear with a lot of caramel syrup. 

Sometime she would return to la-la land after done with her breakfast, while some other time she would take Mephi to a Joyride ~~and purposely ran over a pedestrian or two~~

12:01PM > 15:00PM

Charon love to spent her time bonding with mephi by scrubbing and polishing her inside out. This use to take Charon a lot more time to do, but she has done it for so long she know which part would satisfy Mephi and which wouldn't. Charon advice to not tap Mephi headlights. 

After Charon done with polishing, she would do a through check-out and maintenance to Mephi Engine. Charon would then go visit doc Archemedes to see anything that would interested Mephi. 

Charon then eats her lunch, usually a burger and a chicken skewers.

15:01PM > 16:00PM

Charon would spent 2 minutes opening a medical book, and spending the next 28 minute pondering about her existence. She spent the next 30 minutes in a coffee shop taking a simple nap.

16:01PM > 19:00PM

Charon hated to admit it, but she's forced herself to study during this time. 

20:01PM > 2:59AM

Charon would eat her dinner, consist of either a balanced, well diet dinner that just enough for her growing stages, or junkyard OSHA approved abomination. The latter is more consistently choose. 

After that, charon goes out her way to punch Yi sang, and would drive Mephi aimlessly until she's satisfied. 

3:00AM

Charon tried to summon a ghost, when that fail Charon will sleep immediately or stare at the bus ceiling until she sleep.

Too easy to forget that kind of person!” But still, I want to share it for you to know that this kind of relationship still exist nowadays.

I am 29 years old while my ex is 31. We just met only thru Meta 3 years ago. He was in Saudi Arabia working as a Barista and me as Graphic designer/ Crypto Trader at home. At that time, talking with someone online brought me peace whenever the pain of my mom’s passing hit me.

He was very nice, cheerful and very friendly so everytime we talk to any topics we opened, he understands me. And then days have passed, he started falling for me, like the way I fall for him too. 

Fast forward, we already in a Long Distance Relationship but still working out just fine and having plans to meet in person when he will get back home to Philippines. 

Butterflies and love is in the air I guess on our first meetup, but something else I noticed about him. He tried to tell me that nextime dont use makeup because natural is better (which honestly I did not wear heavy make up! Just Bb cream, eyeliner and lipstick, thats all!) and my outfit is not his taste (which he knew that I love modest dress  because I am conservative to wear too much skin outfits) 

But I did not take that as red flag because im being considerate to his suggestions and such.
I told him that he must go back to his province first because his family surely missed him alot because he didn’t see them for more than 3 years in abroad. But he just said, “I will just contact them and notify that I will process my papers ASAP because I want to pursue my Seafarer dream while I have savings” 

He even lived with me at my family’s house so he could save up for all his seafaring trainings and requirements. He just activate his cheerful and friendly attitude to my family and do some chores for him to be welcome in that house which is good in some point. My family especially my eldest sister is not against of it because thinking of having another man in this house makes it more secure for intruders and for lessen some man-chores. 

But here’s the climax part started, after 3 months of being together, I noticed that there’s something wrong with him. As his partner, I am the only one who will noticed his changes, between him socializing to my family vs him at our Bedroom. He was very cheerful, thoughtful, considerate, responsible, hardworking in the eyes of others, but when we are inside of our room, his face reaction shift. As if like taking off a mask. And he is gradually being rude to me everyday. He keeps throwing everything he did that why he has the right to demand something. Get him food, water, massage whole body, some errands, so on and so forth. I’m trying to understand him because he is very hardworking but its very hurtful for
Me to think that I am slowly became just an Errand Girl for him. 

I massaged him EVERY SINGLE F**king Time that my hands get numb because he wants hard touch. Besides of hand massage, he wants with massage gun too! He very addicted to massage like what the fck! 

And another waving red flag traits spotted, he is not sweet ! Like there’s no even an inch of sweetness in his personality! He never hug me, nor get my hands intertwined, saying Ilove you and goodnight. I Never experienced to give me some flowers and cake or gifts on my birthday. 

In Short, HE IS JUST FCKING KIND TO OTHERS, BUT NOT TO ME. 

I gave everything I have, all the efforts, all the understanding, all the consideration. I’ve lasted for 3 years for that kind of insanity because I’ve waited and waited for the time he will be nice to me and love me if i will be the better version of me. 

I don’t have friends to tell my problems, and I didn’t tell to my family because I dont want them to have a bad impression of him. 

I know! All of you are cussing to me now because I’m not a saint to endure those sad and excruciating years. But to tell you, theres no third wheel, he is just like that. He’ll constantly make you feel like he’s the smart one, the skilled one, the resourceful one, the handsome one—basically, that he’s everything.

The whole question is, How did I stay in that kind of relationship for so long, even though I knew it didn’t bring me anything good?

I think the one most at fault is myself. As an introvert, for some reason, I’m the type of person who struggles a lot to reject someone or be rude to them. My family knows me as weak and emotional. But I don’t want to show that to him because I don’t want him to feel like I pity him. Back then, I already wanted to break up with him when we had only been together for a year. But I really am the problem. In my mind, I can construct what I want to say, but when it’s face-to-face, I just can’t say it. Plus, every time I try to speak, he immediately invalidates whatever I say or how I feel.

But recently, my other sister (who is a lesbian) and her girlfriend, who is a psychologist, have both started noticing that I’ve been getting more and more depressed each day. For the past three years, it’s been so painful keeping everything inside without anyone to talk to, and I guess the effects are now showing on my face—I’ve visibly aged a lot.

That sister of mine has always been my best friend, and I used to open up to her before, but it’s only now that I realized I needed to talk to her again because I’ve become desperate for emotional support. I’m slowly breaking down.

I told her everything—every single experience I had with that guy, who he even considered like family. She couldn’t believe what I had been going through, because my ex was really kind to my family.

During that time, I finally found the courage to reveal everything because he was at work and away from the house for a month, far from home. I took that chance to make a decision. My sister, who talks a lot, couldn’t hold it in and ended up telling the rest of our family, especially my eldest sister. They were all furious about what they learned, while I cried so much, like a child spilling all their secrets.

He controlled my life; he was comfortable while I felt completely disoriented. Because of him, I stopped pursuing my passion as a graphic artist and neglected other things I used to do online.

To end my story, my whole family supported me, and they were furious—so furious that they told me to leave that man for good. They even wanted to confront him at his workplace at the coffee shop, but I asked them not to. I told them we should just return all his belongings and drop everything off at his apartment.

I messaged him the day before we planned to go there, telling him that I could no longer stay with him, that I could no longer endure the way he treated me.

But after 24 hours, he only left the message on “seen” and never replied. Maybe everything he had done finally sank in, and he simply had no words left. I also told him that my whole family already knew, and maybe that’s why he no longer had the face to respond.

When we arrived at his apartment, only the caretaker was there. He said my ex hadn’t come home, claiming he had night duty at work. But before going to the apartment, we had stopped by the coffee shop he worked at, and they told us he had gone off duty at 5 PM—and that they never had overtime there, despite that being his constant excuse to me for not replying.

The caretaker also said that almost every day he would drink and party—either at the apartment or at the nearby resto‑club… something I was never aware of.

I no longer have words to describe the anger and regret I feel toward him. I gave up so much for him, made so many bad decisions for him. He truly manipulated me, probably noticing early on that I was weak and easy to control.

In the end, despite everything he did to me, guilt still won over. I couldn’t bring myself to sabotage the documents he left with me for his seafaring career. I wanted to tear them up, burn them—but deep inside, I still wanted him to succeed in whatever path he chose someday.

Maybe this is the biggest lesson in my love story: not to be too kind in a relationship. You need to know your worth—not just as a woman, but as a person who also deserves to be loved the right way.

As of December 9, 2025, it’s only been four days since I broke up with him. I’m still on edge, but I keep moving forward. I’m probably even thankful that moving on won’t be so hard for me, because he clearly showed me that he had no traits or actions worthy of love.

I’m finding myself again now. I can finally breathe deeply, knowing there’s no longer a number one stress in my life to consider. I’m bringing back the old me—someone who loves art, focuses on her work, and loves herself. Even without a partner this upcoming Christmas and New Year, this might actually be the most comfortable holiday I’ve had in a long time!

Thank you so much for patiently reading my story! We deserved to love and be loved!

P.S. I just stalked him using his own Facebook and Messenger, which is still logged in on my phone. And to my surprise (sarcastically)—his “big problem” is deciding whether to buy Maroon Oxygen shorts worth 799 or Men’s Club Navy Blue shorts worth 599! Hahaha. I’m still trying to digest why I endured this kind of piece of crap 😂😂😂

She’s pretty artsy, into things like pottery, creative workshops, galleries, etc.

I want the second date to feel fun and relaxed without being too intimate or too over the top. What are some good second date ideas for someone who likes creative/artsy stuff?

Thinking of:

* coffee + art gallery
* coffee + a small paint/doodle café
* coffee + a museum
* or something else artsy/light

What would you genuinely enjoy for a second date if you’re into arts and creative stuff?",0,1765268611.0,kolkata,5,0.5,False
1pi27pl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi27pl,"SJO-LF-MV-Uvita, First Time, Family","Just came back from trip (11/23-12/6) and would like to share some of it.

We landed in SJO around midnight (stayed at Hampton), rented a car from Adobe next morning.  Drove to La Fortuna and stayed at Los Lagos for 4 nights.  Followed by Monteverde and stayed at Valle Escondido for 3 nights.  After that we went to Uvita and stayed at La Cusinga for another 4 nights.  Went back to SJO for 1 more night (Fairfield) to catch a early morning flight.

Things I wished I had known:

1. It's really wet there.  I thought those hotels have laundromat (they all say they have self-service laundry).  Turned out it's not a thing there and all the laundry were counted by piece (pretty pricey for 2 weeks and all of us).  Anything I hand-washed (underwear etc.) didn't really dry like I wished.  They all ended up feeling... damp.  If I can do it again I'd bring more clothing and wash a bit less there.  
2. Out of the 5 hotels we stayed, ones by SJO and Los Lagos have AC/heat.  Valle Escondido and La Cusinga didn't.  I think it's almost too hot/humid in Uvita, but it's ok at night.  I can't imagine sleeping there at night later when it gets hotter later though.  
3. Somehow the bathrooms are just not very ventilated.  The floor in Los Lagos and Valle Escondido always felt wet after 4 of us took shower.  Fairfiled shower door somehow didn't seal very well so it flooded even when the door was closed.  I loved the La Cusinga shower room though, well ventilated, private, and the stoney surface was just beautiful.
4. Don't plan too much if you travel with kids and elderly.  I already left many empty days but still heard some complaints from family members lol.  
5. Food and water are probably safer than I thought.  None of us got sick.  Even most restaurants served us tap water.
6. There is an ""official parking lot"" for Monteverde Cloud Forest about 1.5km before the entrance.  I thought it was a scam so I didn't stop.  Turned out it's a real one and I was supposed to get my online reservation exchanged to a physical card there.  Good that the staff by entrance are helpful and we were able to get in just fine.  Parking is very limited by entrance but we got a spot since we arrived early.
7. You just have to be patient with nature.  We saw at least a dozen of sloths but none of them showed the faces.  Finally 2 days before leaving CR we got so lucky and saw the mom and baby sloths.  You just never know what will happen.
8. If you want to see macaws but can't find them, go to Marina Pez Vela in Quepos.  Our MA guide told us this tip and he was right.  We parked our car across the street from the marina and saw 2 macaws flying by right away.  Saw another 3 minutes later.  
9. Crocodile bridge is sort of a scam.  Not worth stopping here.  Crocodiles are here because of human feeding food to these crocodiles.  It's not natural at all and tourists fueled this trend.  We didn't know and stopped there, but later our mangrove guide told us this information.
10. If you just do some easy hiking, don't even bother to bring multiple pairs of shoes.  My hiking sandals worked just fine all the way.  I packed a pair of sneakers but didn't even use it.  
11. Santa Elena Cloud Forest isn't the best place to spot animals (for us at least).  If you have impatient kids, don't go.  Also the weather can be completely different than lower elevation.  It was sunny in our hotel but raining during our entire hike there.  Even though we had all the rain gear my kid still got a bit grumpy after this hike.  It's beautiful if you just want to enjoy the nature though.

Tours we did

1. Mistico Hanging Bridges:  shared guided tour at 8:00am.  Kid loved the bridges.  Highly recommend it for family with kids.  
2. Northfield Coffee/Chocolate/Sugarcane tour:  it's really fun and educational for all ages.  We joined this because it was raining on the day but we still wanted to do something.  They provide umbrella and most of the parts are covered.  We booked it on the day of and can easily get spots for 4.
3. Monteverde Cloud Forest:  shared guided tour at 7:30am.  We saw the famous quetzal here :) 
4. Valle Escondido Night Tour:  it's technically shared but we ended up having our own private guide.  I'm not a fan of this tour that much.  It's pricey ($40 per adult), and the guide has very thick Spanish accent that made it harder to understand everything he said.  We did learn a lot from this tour but I probably won't recommend it as much as the other tours here.
5. Sierpe Mangrove Tour:  it's a whole day one through Sierpe Outfitters.  I liked this one a lot.  We spotted so many animals, even saw a crocodile eating (heard they only eat twice a week).  Saw many many monkeys.  Got delicious lunch at a ""private"" beach, and enjoyed most of them time just ourselves (no other boats at all).  Highly recommend this one.
6. Manuel Antonio NP:  private tour at 7:30am.  We spent a whole day at MA.  I have to say I don't like this park as much because of the crowd.  Quepos is just full of car fume :(There are A LOT of animals in this park though.  And we saw mom and baby sloths here (finally!).  I booked through [GetYourGuide.com](http://GetYourGuide.com) but our guide told me the site took 30% fee so it will be cheaper to book directly.  [https://www.toursfincasalamandramanuelantonio.com/](https://www.toursfincasalamandramanuelantonio.com/) 

Hotels (didn't book AirBnB due to some burglary posts here)

1. Hampton and Faiefield:  nothing special in these 2.  Very American and standardized.  Same as the ones you get in the US.
2. Los Lagos: property is amazingly beautiful.  Sort of manicured but still I enjoyed it a lot.  The hot springs onsite are much better than we thought.  A lot of the time we're the only ones in the pools.  Not crowded at all.  Room has AC.  Bathroom isn't the best, but ok.  For the price I think it's a 10/10.
3. Valle Escondido: got really nice view.  You can see Pacific Ocean from here.  Room is much smaller than I thought though.  Also not so great bathroom.  They have a lot of trails on property and you can see beautiful waterfalls here.  We also love the hammock garden.  I'd give it a 8/10.  
4. La Cusinga:  This might be my favorite one.  Really private room.  I can open the windows completely and not worried about privacy.  Our room has ocean view.  Nature sound non-stop all day (howler monkey at 5am may be a bit annoying though).  Close distance to Marino Ballena National Park.  Also lots of trails here and they have a ""private"" beach.  Tide pools here are also fun!  We saw fishes never seen in SoCal and it's nice.   It's a 10/10 for sure.  No microwave, no fridge, no hairdryer though (and no TV).  I love the less busy town of Uvita compared to MA/Quepos. 

Adobe rental did not disappoint us.  Service was nice and they picked us up from hotel to get the car.  When we were in Uvita we found the tire pressure warning on.  Drove to the office in town (there happened to be one), and they got it fixed within 15 minutes.  Would use them again.  We got a Hyundai Kona.  It's a AWD which is good since the roads to and in Monteverde are not the best.  However the trunk is tiny, probably even smaller than Prius'.

Overall it's a beautiful trip and we saw much more animals than we thought.  Some of the highlights:  crocodiles, quetzal, toucan, macaw, scorpion, white-faced monkey, squirrel monkey, howler monkey, mom and baby sloths, fer-de-lance snake, morpho butterfly, glass frog, and the omnipresent leafcutter ants.

1pi2760,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1pi2760/cant_wait_to_be_done/,Can't Wait To Be Done,"STBX does not pay attention to how much money we have nor his balances on credit cards. I have been a SAHM for the entirety of our marriage, and he has NEVER paid attention to how much money he/we has/have. I have always been left to figure out how to make everything work because he does not listen. If I ever asked him to pick up extra shifts, he'd yell and complain that all I care about is money. Eventually that evolved into, ""I'M THE ONLY ONE WORKING!"" Duh, MF'r! So quit wasting money! So I stopped asking him to work OT, but still let him know when we were low on money. And finally it evolved into blaming the government of California (to try to convince me to move to another state, falsely believing things would be easier financially in another state) and insisting that i needed to get a job, too, because ""nobody [he knows] has a single income household."" We have lived in other states. California is expensive, but he makes about three times what he made in the last state we left. 

The solution sounds simple, right? Me getting a job. However, he is the kind of person who, if we have more money, he wastes more money. He is the same way with housework and yard work. If I step up, he gets lazier. He has never worked WITH ME towards any goal. So if i got a job while married to him, 100% guaranteed he would become more reckless and irresponsible with money (and lazier at work), and I'd have to use all of my money to make sure the bills got paid. I'd be killing myself even more for him to have more fun while i continue sacrificing on my healthcare and haircuts and buying myself things to be sure everything works for everyone else our family. It's is exhausting when you are the only one willing to make sacrifices for your family. He had so many unexcused absences this year (because he didn't feel like going to work on certain days) that when he was out for a medical issue recently, he didn't get a full paycheck, which is effing stressful when he already overspends. And at work they told him that if he took anymore time off for the rest of the year, he'd be written up. He is a compulsive liar, so it's probably much worse than what he told me. He probably did get written up with threat of being fired of he missed another shift. 

I filed for divorce in April. We are still living together, with the kids. We avoid each other as much as possible. He said he'd work overtime so that the kids could have a nice Christmas. Last paycheck he had 2 OT shifts (clears $1,000 per 12 hour OT shift, so $2,000 extra on his last check). I bought some gifts, but he just blasted through the rest of the money. Only about $400 went to gifts, which I bought. The rest went to restaurants and coffee shops and gym drop-in fees (when he has a gym membership), etc. 

Today I saw an amazon transaction go through that I didn't recognize, so I checked the amazon account. He bought a chess set. HE ALREADY HAS ONE. I texted him a screenshot, asking WHY he needs another one. It's clear from his response he just does not give a shit and is toying with me when I get upset about his overspending:

*It’s a nice beautiful hand carved travel board. I have many friends now at work who enjoy chess because of me. So I plan to keep it there. Rare these days but there are times we have long down times and chess is an awesome way to melt the stress away. So that’s why.*

He just does not care about our finances at all! Anything to be nice to and impress people that are not family! He will also buy ALL of his coworkers food from time-to-time like he did before when he was a boss. He has not been a boss in years, AND HE DOES NOT GET REIMBURSED FOR IT ANYMORE. But it's *my fault* when we have no money, because I'm not working. 🤬

Yes, he is a narcissist. Yes, I CAN'T WAIT TO BE FREE!!!!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

38F, hpv vaxinated when I was 33. My previous pap test have been all negative. 

Last year I went to an emergency check due to a prolonged bleeding from my periods. I was going through a very stressful situation in my life, and was not sleeping for weeks. After a regular check, result came positive for high risk HPv (no 16. 18)  with inconclusive pap test. ​

It was like the sky falling down. Crying and feeling miserable. The first thing you read is high risk cancer and that is already enough to freak out. 

I repeated the test in one month. My new gynecologist was very supportive and helped me to go through all the information I was looking for. The test came still positive for hpv but negative for pap test. 

The first months have been horrible,  I couldn't tell to anyone, no family, just one friend who disappeared in one week. 

All this situation causes me stomach issues with h.pylori activation. It took me 10 month to recover from my stomach and still now I have some consequences of GERD and Reflux. 

What I did during this year was not drinking alcohol and coffee, eating healthy,  exercising, no dating, talking to a therapist, and the most important one: Vitamine D

After one year, the test of hpv turned negative. 

As you, I was alone and scared at the beginning, but then I started reading more about it.  This comunity has been tremendously helpful.  I found that more than 200 types of hpv are there, we can get it but it is up to us if we want to make it worse or not. We have the power to control our health. Stress is our enemy, if we defeat it we will defeat any virus or bacteria in our body. 

Take care of yourself and don't let hpv, prejudices and bad thoughts affecting your life and your health!
