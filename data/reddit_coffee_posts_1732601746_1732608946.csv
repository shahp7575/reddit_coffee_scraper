1h06uyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1h06uyh/mercury_rx_fucking_me_up_already/,Mercury rx fucking me up already,"I'm from Australia, so been in Mercury rx since yesterday. 

FYI I'm Libra sun, Scorpio moon, Sagittarius rising, Scorpio Venus, Leo Mars.

Y'all, this is how my day went yesterday:
- Almost physically ran into an ex I dated 8 years ago, who I got a restraining order on and haven't seen since then, while getting my morning coffee. Was able to *veeeeery quickly* detour.
- Accidentally slept in and was super late to work.
- Got a call from Mum that she was stranded 4 hours away on a freeway, while it was storming, so I had to pick her up. 
- Got a psychic reading and due to what it said, deleted all conversation history with my recent ex. It felt like someone died after I did it.

My day today:
- Woke up super late again.
- Went to the grocery store and saw an old lady struggling trying to get chips off the shelf. I asked her if she needed help, and she abruptly said no. Guess who it was? Remember the ex from yesterday? HIS DAMN MUM.
- Got a call from my Dad - it's a long story - and he completely pissed me off, and now I'm in a bad mood.

How's your mercury rx treating you? I'm already done. My energy is drained to the absolute max. ",1,1732608312.0,astrologymemes,1,1.0,False

1h06tqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/theartificialonion/comments/1h06tqi/little_shit_refuses_to_listen_claims_i_dont_wanna/,"Little Shit Refuses to Listen, Claims ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Wanna‚Äù as Legal Defense","Poughkeepsie, NY ‚Äî Local 4-year-old Calvin Whittaker sent shockwaves through his family this week when he flat-out refused to listen to a single word of reasonable advice, repeatedly shouting ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù while dramatically flopping to the floor like a soggy noodle.

‚ÄúI asked him to put on his shoes so we could go to the park‚ÄîTHE PARK,‚Äù said his mother, Sandra Whittaker, clutching a coffee mug with both hands as if it were the only thing tethering her to sanity. ‚ÄúBut he just started running in circles and yelling, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna!‚Äô Like, Cal. It‚Äôs the park. You like the park.‚Äù

Cal reportedly escalated the situation when he climbed onto the couch, stuck his tongue out at his father, and declared, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt make me. I‚Äôm the boss of me.‚Äù Witnesses confirmed that his father, Kevin Whittaker, looked to the heavens and whispered, ‚ÄúWhy, God?‚Äù before attempting to bribe the defiant child with a fruit snack.

The bribery failed. ‚ÄúI want TWO gummies, or I‚Äôm not doing ANYTHING!‚Äù Cal was overheard shouting, stomping one foot while clutching a stuffed dinosaur like a tiny, unhinged union negotiator.

Experts say this kind of behavior is typical for children Cal‚Äôs age, but his tactics are unusually advanced. ‚ÄúMost 4-year-olds rely on simple defiance, like saying ‚Äòno‚Äô or pretending they can‚Äôt hear you,‚Äù explained Dr. Linda Foster, a developmental psychologist. ‚ÄúBut Cal‚Äôs ability to weaponize spaghetti limbs and negotiate for snacks puts him in a league of his own.‚Äù

Sandra attempted a classic parenting maneuver by using the dreaded countdown method, warning Cal she‚Äôd count to three if he didn‚Äôt listen. ‚ÄúOne‚Ä¶two‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, only to be interrupted by Cal screaming, ‚ÄúFOUR! FIVE! TEN! HAHAHA!‚Äù before launching himself onto the carpet and rolling away like a disgruntled burrito.

Neighbors report this is just the latest in a series of incidents involving Cal‚Äôs growing independence. Last week, he reportedly staged a sit-in during bath time, repeatedly yelling ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT DIRTY!‚Äù while clutching a plastic dinosaur in one hand and a suspiciously sticky fruit roll-up in the other.

At press time, Cal was sitting under the dining room table in his pajamas, eating a slice of cheese he found ‚Äúby himself‚Äù and humming the ""Bluey"" theme song. When asked for comment, he simply said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk about it,‚Äù before making fart noises and giggling uncontrollably.",1,1732608164.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False
1h06tkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h06tkx/how_do_i_get_beyond_a_3rd_date_or_any_advice_for/,How do I get beyond a 3rd date? Or any advice for being more open ,"Hi, I'm a 27 (f) and don't have a ton of dating experience. Only ever dated two people before. Once when I was 14 and another at 18. I met them at school so had the transition of being friends first in class and then that turning into something more. 

As an adult I'm struggling a lot with dating and don't know how to improve. I've been trying to use dating apps but I feel like I've gotten into this pattern of not being able to get farther than a third date. Sometimes it's obvious neither of us want to continue so the break off is mutual but other times I feel like I get too scared and pull myself away and end things not because I'm not interested but because I fall back into the comfort of ending things. I don't really understand how I'm supposed to be open with men or even have a connection with them when they're a person I barely know and have only seen two or three times. Am I just supposed to pretend that I have romantic feelings about them and fall in love with the idea of being with someone and then see if feelings form? Usually my feelings for a guy I go on a few dates with are simply I think they look nice and they can hold a decent conversation. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel more for someone I don't know. I'll have friends ask me what I like about a guy I've gone on a few dates with an my mind will go blank. He was moderately attractive and conversation over coffee we had didn't bore me to death so that's a win for me. Is this normal? All my friends are either married or in long term relationships so I really have no one irl to talk to about this. 

I also think I freak myself out too much too when the dates start to add up and put the weight of expectations on myself. I'm not good at kissing and can be really timid so am afraid at initiating intimacy. I think I psych myself out too much about what should be expected after so many dates. I tell guys upfront that I want to take things slow and they respect that but I think get so nervous and feel like I'm just going to fuck things up that I end things. 

I'd love for some advice on how I might be able to calm myself down or relax more after three dates. Or just hear from others what it likes to go beyond three dates. Idk how dating this way is supposed to work. Like I said all the other people I dated I knew as friends before and was already relaxed around them. 

Thanks for reading this if you got to the end. Sorry it's a bit long

1h06q87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h06q87,Postcards from Himalayas - My solo workstation trip to Gangtok and Darjeeling.,"I went to a trip for Gangtok and Darjeeling last week, couldn‚Äôt do a lot of sightseeing because i was busy with work during the days. 


Gangtok :


I could totally recommend Gangtok as a workstation to anyone. It has a lot to offer when it comes to affordability, beautiful weather and good food. 

Since the incident last year, lachen and Lachung have been closed and might open next month. You could visit Nathula pass which is almost 50 kms from Gangtok. 


The easiest way to reach Gangtok for someone who‚Äôs coming from the other side is the country is to take a flight/train to Bagdogra/jalpaiguri and then take a cab to Gangtok. You could book a personal cab directly for 3000.


1) The facilities at the hostel were a bit better than the ones i saw in other hill stations and yet were prices at <500.
2) Food is good and you could also checkout the street food which is amazing.
3) Alcohol is way cheaper than other states. It‚Äôs almost the prices I saw in Goa.
4) the occupancy at hostels is around 30-40 percent over a week which is probably expected to go higher in December.
5) The weather is cold but just not as cold as Darjeeling or Kasol.


Darjeeling:

Darjeeling is a bit colder and more crowded than Gangtok. On a clear day you could get a clear view of the Kanchenjunga.

Most of the crowd is of tourists from Kolkata so don‚Äôt expect to meet alot of fellow solo travellers here. 

You could stay at Trippers which is at the outskirts of the city but then you won‚Äôt have the chance of going to mall road pr have outside whenever you like.

Darjeeling has beautiful cafes, you can have a breakfast at Keventer‚Äôs or have evening coffee at Glenary‚Äôs.",6,1732607770.0,SoloTravel_India,2,1.0,False

So I'm sitting here with my millionth slice of cake, thinking ""there's gotta be a better way to do this"" - and turns out, there is.

I just went down this crazy rabbit hole about why coffee and chocolate are basically meant to be together. It's not just ""oh this tastes good"" - there's legit science behind why your brain goes BOOM! when you combine them.

Quick story: My last birthday, I made this chocolate cake and paired it with this ridiculous dark roast from Solai Coffee, and holy wow - it was like flavor fireworks.

Wanna know the weird part? Turns out coffee and chocolate beans share over 1,000 chemical compounds. WHAT.

If you're a food nerd or just someone who loves a good slice + coffee combo, this totally geeky blog breaks it all down.

Who else gets weirdly excited about food science? Drop your favorite cake + coffee combo below!

Sometimes when I'm relaxing I can feel it slow down and then start beating real fast. Sometimes I don't even know what will hit  me and it leaves my head spinning literally. Earlier I went to bend down and I felt a shock of electricity on my right side which I have never felt before . I feel like this med isn't working and it's more so keeping my hr down but not my bp . I feel good going down to 25mg but I can't take this weird heart jump stuff it's freaking me out. I heard this medication causes heart block which I keep reading online about (bad idea I know) . It's really scarying me to know that my heart is acting crazy. I've only felt flutters here and there over the years or palpitations especially when I'm stressed or drink coffee.

My partner had a bit of a bad experience at a new dentist today. His bedside manner was really blunt and told her she would need 8 fillings, with casual back-and-forth to the nurse to discuss ‚Äúwould you do that one too? Might as well‚Äù etc. 

Background: She hasn‚Äôt been to a dentist in 2 years due to emigrating, but before moving she had a checkup at a good private surgery and everything looked good with her teeth, save for a couple of ‚Äúkeep an eye on‚Äù areas. She takes good care of her teeth (her dentists have commented this), never misses brushing, and has a good electric toothbrush (the oral B io range), EXCEPT she doesn‚Äôt tend to floss, which is what appears to have let her down here. She cares a lot about looking after herself and doesn‚Äôt drink soda or any sugary/acidic drinks/tea/coffee‚Ä¶. EXCEPT diet rite cordial in her water. 

We both have the same diet and habits and I don‚Äôt have any dramatic changes to my teeth compared to her.

The X Rays show some shadowing between her teeth, but it‚Äôs such a dramatic change to go from  dentists saying she‚Äôs fine to dentists saying she needs 8 fillings in the span of 2 years.

Advice appreciated! Is it really that bad? Anything she can reverse?

N lives in a different state, but used to live in my state and has been friends with my sister for awhile. Well, N came to visit for a week and stayed with us (I live with my sister and brother-in-law).¬†

* One night when we were going out to hang out as a group, plus a friend of mine, and meeting others. She had already been reading a book but it was a little big to carry around I guess, so she asked me if I had a book that could fit in her back pocket. Then she proceeded to turn around and show me her backside. Which her book did actually fit in there. When I gave her the book, she ended up carrying it in her purse instead.¬†
* We went out shopping as a group. She and I were talking and randomly she said, ‚ÄúYou have pretty eyes.‚Äù Which everybody compliments me about, so it‚Äôs not that out of the ordinary. But my sister and I have the same eyes and since she‚Äôs friends with my sister, it‚Äôs weird that she‚Äôs never complimented my sister‚Äôs. Which my sister got mad because she was like, ‚ÄúWe have the same eyes. But everyone compliments his.‚Äù
* My sister gave our waiter N‚Äôs number, but N was very against it. The whole time after leaving the restaurant, she was worried about what to say if he texted her. Since she doesn‚Äôt live here. And she‚Äôs always worried about inconveniencing other people. Well, he texted her and she told everyone but didn‚Äôt know what to say back. I made a joke about what she should say back which she thought was funny but said, ‚ÄúHe probably wouldn‚Äôt understand the joke or would think it‚Äôs rude.‚Äù To which I replied, ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt like your humor then he isn‚Äôt for you.‚Äù My brother-in-law said a joke response that I can‚Äôt remember, but N didn‚Äôt think it was too funny. One of my sister‚Äôs friends who both N and I absolutely cannot stand said, ‚ÄúJust say you weren‚Äôt expecting him to actually text you.‚Äù Which N was like, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs a turn-off. You have to act confident.‚Äù Anyway, she wasn‚Äôt taking anyone's suggestions. Then eventually someone brought it up later, and she said, ‚ÄúI shut it down right away, saying I don‚Äôt live here.‚Äù Then later she and I were talking and said that it probably wouldn‚Äôt work out for them because he said he was studying for his master‚Äôs so he was probably too young for her. Then, she went on to explain how she went on a date with a 21-year-old one time and felt like his mom because she paid for everything and was basically helping him make life decisions. As I stated, actual age and mental age aren‚Äôt aligned, it is different among many people. To which she replied, ‚ÄúThat is true, you act a lot older than you are.‚Äù
* We were in a vehicle waiting for my brother-in-law to finish up doing his job and she was laying down then I was getting into the vehicle so she sat up. Then eventually laid down again and asked, ‚ÄúAm I invading your personal space?‚Äù She proceeded to lay her head right next to my leg and her hair was on my leg.¬†
* One of my cats likes it when you pet him aggressively. So she was petting him and said something like, ‚ÄúHe likes it rough. He likes to basically be beat up when you pet him.‚Äù And sometimes, I‚Äôm a dirty minded person, so I just start laughing for a little bit and she asked me why I was laughing and I go, ‚ÄúLike father like son.‚Äù Then that led to a conversation about sadists and masochists. And a little bit about what we like in sex.¬†
* There were other conversations of sex and what we like. Although, I feel like she talked more about it than I did.¬†
* We were bonding over books. I‚Äôve recently been interested in collecting vintage books and going to book stores and vintage stores. Well one night we were up talking and she had plans to go get coffee with a friend in the morning and she told me that she was going to a book store after around 10:30 am and asked if I wanted to go. (I‚Äôm not really a morning person) so I was like, ‚ÄúHA. That‚Äôs funny. That‚Äôs too early.‚Äù Which she replied, that it wasn‚Äôt early. So I said, I‚Äôd put an alarm on and if I woke up then I‚Äôd go with her, if I didn‚Äôt wake up, then that‚Äôs her answer. Then later my sister and brother-in-law came downstairs to hang out with us and they asked what her plans were for the day. Which she told them and when she mentioned the bookstore, my sister realized she forgot that they planned to go there that day. Then they said, ‚ÄúOkay, we will go with you tomorrow.‚Äù Which she replied, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay. You guys don‚Äôt have to go.‚Äù And was very adamant on saying they don‚Äôt have to join. (So I‚Äôm wondering if she meant it as a day to spend together alone or she just felt like she was inconveniencing them.)
* One day we went shopping and I drove separately because I did not want to go out to breakfast with them, so I met them later. When we went our separate ways to our vehicles, she had eye contact that was a little longer than normal. (I could be delusional).¬†
* She separated from my sister and brother-in-law in a store and walked with me. Proceeds to pick up books and read them (they were weird and funny books). Was giggling and just reading them outloud to me, I think to make a conversation. At the same store, she saw a suction massager and said ‚ÄúI think I just saw a vibrator.‚Äù Then I went up to it to inspect it and was like ‚ÄúUm, no, it‚Äôs a massager.‚Äù Then she proceeds to talk about how it could be used as a vibrator.
* One night we were playing a board game with my sister, brother-in-law, N, and me. One of my cats went under the coffee table so I reached to pet him and she did also and we touched hands. But both continued petting the cat and continued to touch hands. She is the type of person to accidentally touch you or be in your space and apologize for it.¬†
* The last night she was here, we went over to my grandma‚Äôs place. One topic that was brought up was when one day I said that I can only stand her out of all of my sister‚Äôs friends. So she relayed this to my family and said, ‚ÄúHe only said stand. He never said liked.‚Äù So I‚Äôm wondering if she can‚Äôt tell I like her?
* A few times when she texts me back, she has taken a little while to type back, like she is thinking hard about how to reply. And the messages come off as flirtatious (I think). \[I can post what the messages say, for others to interpret if needed.\]
* Also my sister lowkey clocked that I have a thing for N. But I pushed it away as N is really good at making conversation. Well I got home from work tonight and my sister goes, ""Since N isn't here, you can be straight with me. Do you have a thing for her?"" I feel awkward telling my sister these things, also I don't want her to go and tell N before I know if she reciprocates the feelings. So I told her no again. And my sister and brother-in-law said, ""Well it seemed like you two were hitting it off.""

I found out later that day by chance because I saw a coffee rewards advertisement and decided to mention it to my partner since we both go for coffee often as a simple date idea, and that‚Äôs when I found out he went to coffee with my co-worker. When he told me after the fact I felt hurt as he didn‚Äôt even mention meeting up with my co-worker to me even in passing. I told him that I would like him to tell me when he does as I always tell him when I hang out with my male friends as a sign of respect.

He turned my concerns against me and called me judgemental, possessive, and insecure. I reminded him that I always let him know about when I hang out with my male friends and I asked him if I went to coffee with a man I met twice and then didn‚Äôt tell him about it even if I meant it platonically if he would be ok with that, and he said he wouldn‚Äôt and that he was sorry.

","I live with my in-laws. The parents are great, loving and super supportive. My husband has four siblings - 1 brother and 2 sisters. The youngest sister lives in a different country so we don‚Äôt see her most of the time. The other two are also married and we all live under the same roof. The eldest sister has 3 kids. 

They were all pretty close with my husband‚Äôs ex girlfriend since they‚Äôre in the same circle and would still comment on each other‚Äôs IG to this day.

Before we got married: 
1. My MIL wanted us to get engaged earlier but his brother said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only known her as your girlfriend and I‚Äôm not ready for her to be in this family‚Äù so we postponed it until the brother got married. He also said that my personality was too ‚Äúgirly and loud‚Äù since the family is pretty posh. 
2. After our engagement, I was invited then uninvited to the youngest sister‚Äôs birthday because they wanted to be exclusively for the family. 
3. I‚Äôm an extrovert and naturally I‚Äôm pretty good with listening and talking to other people, but I never got along with all of his siblings and the in laws. But you know, maybe it was just cause we weren‚Äôt officially married yet? At least that‚Äôs what I thought. 

After we got married: 
1. The eldest sister and the brother‚Äôs wife are pretty close, they would talk endlessly and would usually exclude me in conversations or I‚Äôll just let myself be a wallflower. They would also go out for coffees together and wouldn‚Äôt even invite me. I ended up being okay with that as long as I still get to be a part of the conversation once in a while. 
2. The brother‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs the highest boss fight for me. The only thing we‚Äôd say to each other is ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù or when I try to talk to him, he‚Äôd just answer me coldly. There were several times when he‚Äôd scold me for doing things slightly differently in the house (I was only a few months into the marriage). 
3. His wife will always try to win in the ‚Äúbest in law‚Äù award, which was a competition I stopped taking part of - I just wanted to be a family member in this household. 
4. The sibs would always comment on each other‚Äôs IG postings, even on my husband‚Äôs ex but never on mine - not even a like. 
5. The siblings would never include me in any birthday discussions or plannings. 
6. My husband is an introvert and doesn‚Äôt really bond well with the siblings after dinner, but I‚Äôd usually stay down a bit later after he went up to our bedroom so that I could spend an extra time with the siblings, but it would usually feel cold and unwelcoming. 

We‚Äôve only been married for a year, dated for 2 years. Perhaps it‚Äôs still early, my husband said time will heal. But we live together and see each other everyday and yet it still feels the same.

1h06afx,https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/1h06afx/a_story/,A story,"Hi everyone. 

I wanted to share a story about my vintage computer.

I grew up in the 90s and graduated high school in the late 2000s. We had an Apple of some kind when I was very young. No one is around who would remember which model it was.

So, the first computer that I really used was from '00. It was a Gateway Performance 866 with a Pentium III processor and came loaded with Windows 98.

My cousins were big PC gamers at the time and going to visit was always a treat. I didn't even care if I played the games myself, but would stare wide-eyed and enchanted by the zerg swarms of Starcraft, the wild blazes of my cousin's sorceress in Diablo II, the weird mutants of Half-Life, etc.

Getting this PC was a big deal to me. 2000 seemed late to the game when I was a kid, but I was over the moon when those big cow colored boxes arrived at our front door.

My parents didn't know anything about computers really, so we had a family friend come over to set the whole thing up.

I was glued to that machine after that.

Within the next year or so my parents went through a long and messy divorce and the computer was always a place of refuge for me. It was something that I could control and was orderly and helpful when the rest of my world seemed like it was falling apart.

I had my own email, I could play games online (56k) with people from all over the world, I could visit and create web pages, and discover new music and communities of people that shared my interests.

It truly was a gateway for me into a much wider world. (Please excuse the cheese)

My father remarried around 2003. And, things got way worse. My step-mother came in like a hurricane. She tore down decorations, repainted the entire house, sold our stuff in garage sales, and proved herself to be a worse person than I feel like describing in this post. 

But, I still had that computer.

I lived with my father and stepmother for the next few years before finally leaving home and moving in with my mother. I had to take my Dad to court to be able to stay permanently. I'm sure it was devastating to him, but I couldn't take it any longer. My father was a good man, but could be a bit too protective and overbearing. I knew he cared though and I knew my mother didn't -- she just wanted to stop paying child support. As for me, I just needed to get away from my stepmother.

A lot of life has passed since that time and my computing experience of course evolved over the years. Windows XP, 7, 8, 10. Then Linux distros and Windows 11. The games became more sophisticated and the uses for my machines more involved and demanding.

I got a career, had friends and girlfriends come and go, lost myself, found myself, lost myself some more. But, all things considered, I think I turned out pretty well.

It took a long time for me to repair my relationship with my Dad. Something that he absolutely did not deserve and worked really hard to fix in all the time since I moved away. 

Things finally started to feel a little more natural as I got nearer to 30. But, it was never quite the same. The wounds were too deep and I know now that they will never fully heal.

About 5 years ago, he and his wife (my stepmother) sold their house and began the process of moving to a house several hours away. My Dad had never moved from the town he grew up in, but his in-laws were not doing well in their old age, so he agreed to it.

As they were packing things up and moving, things kept turning up that belonged to us kids. Old books and photos and notes that we had written, etc.

And, then, there was this old computer.

My father had kept it for 20 years and had it serviced and repaired and kept it running as his daily driver for all that time. He was finally going to get rid of it. I told him I would take it.

I was 29 years old.

My late 20s consisted of poor physical health (autoimmune diagnosis) and a growing awareness of my own mortality.

My Dad started calling me more and visiting me every so often. He would ask me about my health and I would tell him that i was doing the best I could. My father had always been active and healthy, but he was in his 60s now and was starting to have some problems of his own.

I didn't see him much for the next several months because he was so busy with the move.

Then, I got a call one night that he was in the hospital emergency. His stomach had not been feeling the best for months, but now the pain was unbearable. So, they got him pain medication and took some scans and treated him.

The next night, still in the hospital, he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

The next few months were a whirlwind. He went to appointments and talked to specialists. The final verdict was there wasn't much anyone could do that would give him any additional time with any kind of positive quality of life. They recommended palliative care and hospice.

I was midway through my career in healthcare at the time and I didn't know much about cancer. Being honest, I still don't. But, I knew from what I read that this cancer was really bad. Cancer treatments make a lot of money for hospitals but these doctors were all essentially saying ""don't bother"". They wanted to make him comfortable. They wanted him to know what he was facing and they didn't sugarcoat it.

He passed away about 6 months later, leaving behind a million things I'll never get to say. Leaving behind my chance to be the age he was when I was young and to ask him what it was like and how he managed to raise us by himself while working full time. My brothers and I treated him like a king the last week of his life. We never left his bedside. Not for one minute was he alone in that hospital bed. We fed him, bathed him, lifted him so sheets could be changed. We talked with him and joked with him and gave him his last ice cream and his last cup of coffee. The last few days of his life, he would only wake for seconds at a time and he would be scared. But, my brothers and I would hold his hand and tell him we were there and he would fall back to sleep.

I saw him take his last breath in this world. And, then he was gone. 

That was five years ago, this coming February. Right now, I'm sitting in my office writing this post and I'm looking at this 25 year old PC and remembering how special it was when my Dad bought it and how special it was to have a really good Father that I knew would always be there if I needed him.

I would give anything to have him back and healthy, but that's out of my control. So, I try to do the best that I can for my girlfriend and her three kids and I look at this computer and remember the smile that my Dad had on his face when we opened the box together all those years ago.

I had not been feeling normal, my periods were getting worse, the symptoms with it were getting horrid, and starting this year the pain had become a constant in my life. It felt like I was in pain all the time whether it was my upper uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, cervix, vaginal canal, and hell even butthole cramps. I went through 2 gynecologist, of which the second one put a copper IUD in me despite knowing my menorrhagia issue and documented pelvic pain. Great dr, amirite?!

After the second one left the practice, I got assigned a MIGS dr a month ago who just......heard me out. He actively listened and at the end of it went: ""Has anyone ever discussed endometriosis with you?"". My reaction was no because both previous gyn felt it was natural to be that way, even though my mom had undiagnosed endo and my sister has diagnosed PCOS. In one visit, the MIGS dr pretty much gave me a rough diagnosis and scheduled surgery to determine whether I had endo. IN ONE VISIT!!!! I will never forget his level of care for his patients and his passion for his job when he said ""None of my patients will ever be in pain, and you're MY patient now"". 

Well guys, this is all to say, I am 5 hours post-op as I write this with a successful diagnosis of endometriosis. I thought I was going crazy because of the constant feeling of something not right in my mid-section to the debilitating pain that would make me stay and work from home. You know the old stories of hysterectomy because it cured hysteria? I felt like i needed to go down that barbaric path just to feel normal. I now feel seen, heard, validated and all because one person decided to listen. I've been crying on and off all while being shoosted on pain meds post-surgery. Sorry for the typos and rant.

**July 6th, 2024**

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt write in my journal on the night of July 6th.

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt want to write down what happened. I thought it‚Äôd be better if I didn‚Äôt. If I just‚Ä¶ moved on. What happened wasn‚Äôt my fault. I didn‚Äôt do anything! I didn‚Äôt take part in it! And when we *did* move on, it didn‚Äôt seem important! Nobody was talking about it the next morning, nobody even seemed to be thinking about it.

&#x200B;

We just woke up, got back in the car and started driving again like nothing even happened, trying to pretend like everything was normal.

&#x200B;

It wasn‚Äôt.

&#x200B;

Adam‚Äôs asleep by the window. We still haven‚Äôt spoken.

&#x200B;

I can‚Äôt sleep.

&#x200B;

We haven‚Äôt seen her again, since she attacked me outside of the Mess Hall‚Ä¶ but I assume she‚Äôs nearby. Watching us. Waiting for us to slip up‚Ä¶ or maybe setting up a trap of her own. I don‚Äôt think it matters what she‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôll end the same no matter what.

&#x200B;

So with that in mind‚Ä¶ I might as well die with a clear conscience. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is going to find this journal or if in the end, *you‚Äôll* be the one to take it‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt really care.

&#x200B;

For what it‚Äôs worth, if you are reading this, Alexis‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

We‚Äôd been taking the drive a little slower that day, going through some back roads and stopping at whatever looked interesting. I remember that we‚Äôd been by a lake, at a harbor and Cody had insisted we take a picture together. Sure enough, we‚Äôd all piled in, grinning like idiots while he‚Äôd snapped it.

&#x200B;

I saw it online later. He‚Äôd captioned it: *‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend the sheer levels of Alpha Male in this one photo!‚Äù*

His Mom had left a comment reading: *‚ÄúSO PROUD OF MY BOY!‚Äù*

&#x200B;

I remember scoffing at it. How lame could you possibly be? But I didn‚Äôt say anything out loud. I never did.

&#x200B;

We‚Äôd spent most of the day bumming around the lake, before Adam insisted we get a move on. He and Leo had picked out a motel a short distance away that didn‚Äôt seem too shady to stop for the night in.

  ‚ÄúThere anyplace to eat there?‚Äù Keelan asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starving and Cody‚Äôs been looking at me and licking his lips for the past half hour.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúGo fuck yourself,‚Äù Cody laughed.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúThere should be a diner attached to the motel,‚Äù Adam said. ‚ÄúIf not, we‚Äôll find something.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúActually there‚Äôs a place just up the road,‚Äù Leo said. ‚ÄúThe 7th Heaven Diner. They were on this TV show a while back.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWas it Kitchen Nightmares?‚Äù Keelan asked.

  ‚ÄúNo, I forget which, but they had these really good bacon wrapped cheeseburgers.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI think I saw that one‚Ä¶ with like, the bacon wrapped around the patty, right?‚Äù Cody asked. 

  ‚ÄúThat sounds disgusting,‚Äù Matthew said.

  ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre weird. My vote‚Äôs on that place!‚Äù Keelan said. ‚ÄúAnyone against?‚Äù

&#x200B;

Nobody was and a few minutes later, we were pulling into a large, mostly empty parking lot.

  ‚ÄúThought you said this place was supposed to be nice?‚Äù Keelan asked as we shuffled out of the car.

  ‚ÄúI said it was on TV. Will you stop whining?‚Äù Leo replied.

&#x200B;

Looking at the hours as we walked in, it was around a half hour until closing time so I guess it wasn‚Äôt surprising that the place was mostly empty. I thought about asking the others if maybe we should just find somewhere else to eat, but the waitress still seated us so I didn‚Äôt really see any reason to say anything. The inside of the restaurant *was* nice. It was clean, with a sorta unremarkable 1950s diner style to it. The music was a little too loud for my liking, but that was really my only complaint.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a deep fried bacon cheeseburger‚Ä¶‚Äù Cody noted.

Matthew looked at him in disgust.

  ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre not going to eat that.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhat? Where else are you gonna see something like that?‚Äù Cody shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying it!‚Äù

&#x200B;

Matthew made a noise of disgust. 

  ‚ÄúIs there anything you *won‚Äôt* eat?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúMy Mom used to make this thing with boiled hot dogs in jello‚Ä¶ never gonna try that again.‚Äù Cody said, without missing a beat.

Matthew shuddered, before putting the menu down. 

  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna have water,‚Äù He said. 

&#x200B;

The waitress came to take our orders, and while the others talked, I just sort of sat back and people watched.

&#x200B;

A middle aged blonde lady who looked like a realtor or something was chatting on the phone, completely ignoring the slice of pie in front of her. A couple of older guys were sitting in a corner, nursing some beers and having a raspy conversation over dinner‚Ä¶ but the one I noticed was the girl sitting by the window. Her body was a little curvy, but it was hard to tell under her baggy sweater. She had short blonde hair, and her big blue eyes seemed to shine behind her plastic rimmed glasses. Something about her was just‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

I don‚Äôt know why she stood out to me. Maybe it was her smile? Maybe it was her laugh? I could hear her laughing at something that the other girl at the table had said. I didn‚Äôt pay as much attention to the other girl at the time. She was around our age and looked like she subsisted entirely on coffee. Her pale green eyes looked a little sunken, and her flat dark hair didn‚Äôt really have any particular style to it but she had a sort of wry smile. There was something else about the way she carried herself too‚Ä¶ she lounged in her booth almost like a cat, confident and relaxed. She had a sort of goth style to her, although it‚Äôs hard to pin down exactly why I thought that. Her pale skin? Her dark clothes? The star necklace she was wearing? Or maybe it was just the graphic T-shirt with the poster of some old slasher from the 80s on it? I don‚Äôt know for sure. Looking back, I‚Äôm surprised I remember as much about her as I do‚Ä¶ I was looking at her friend more, and I didn‚Äôt realize I was staring until Keelan snapped his fingers in my ear.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúHey, you still with us man?‚Äù He teased. 

I jumped in my seat, before glaring at him.

  ‚ÄúFuck off!‚Äù

He just laughed.

  ‚ÄúChecking out the local merchandise, huh? I can get behind that.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I looked away from the girls, but he just kept needling me.

  ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs blushing! Guys! He‚Äôs fucking blushing!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúCan you leave him alone, please?‚Äù Adam asked. I was a little grateful that he‚Äôd stepped in.

  ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs fine, man‚Ä¶‚Äù Keelan said, leaning back into his chair. ‚ÄúI mean what kind of guy doesn‚Äôt like a good pair of tits?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYour Uncle Rob,‚Äù Leo replied. Most of the other guys laughed.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúLow blow, man‚Ä¶‚Äù Keelan murmured.

  ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôll bet he knows all about low blows‚Ä¶‚Äù Cody teased before turning his attention to me. ‚ÄúSo what are you gonna do? You gonna ask for her number?‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just passing through, why waste our time?‚Äù Adam asked. 

  ‚ÄúOh come on, don‚Äôt act like you guys weren‚Äôt hoping to get some action this week,‚Äù Keelan said. ‚ÄúAnd before you tell me: *‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs a sin‚Äô,* so is lying, so checkmate.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Adam rolled his eyes, although I thought I saw a small smile pulling at the corner of his lips.

  ‚ÄúFine, whatever.‚Äù He said. 

Both Keelan and Cody looked over at me.

  ‚ÄúSo you gonna and ask?‚Äù Cody asked. 

  ‚ÄúWhat? No! She‚Äôs just some random girl in a bar‚Ä¶‚Äù

  ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you gotta do it for us, man!‚Äù Keelan said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶‚Äù

&#x200B;

I never got to finish that sentence. Keelan and Cody were already pumping their fists and quietly chanting: *‚ÄòAvery, Avery, Avery, Avery‚Ä¶‚Äô*

&#x200B;

I caught Leo chanting along with them too, and Adam had completely failed to hide his smile now. Matthew just wasn‚Äôt participating at all, but that was normal for him. 

  ‚ÄúFine, fine‚Ä¶‚Äù I stood up and sighed.

Here went nothing. I fixed my jacket, smoothed down my hair and headed over to their table. They didn‚Äôt see me coming toward them. I heard the blonde laugh again and saw the dark haired girl lean in closer, chuckling at something shared and secret between them. She wrapped an arm around the blonde, teasing her for a moment and then‚Ä¶ then she kissed her.

&#x200B;

The first one was just on the cheek, but the blonde seemed all too happy to press one to her lips in return.

  *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst,‚Äù* I heard her giggle.

  *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got no idea,‚Äù* The dark haired girl replied, before kissing her again.

&#x200B;

I took a step back. I could feel my cheeks flushing red and hastily went back to the table. I wanted to hope that the guys hadn‚Äôt seen that, but judging by the looks on their faces, they‚Äôd seen everything. Keelan was stifling a laugh. Cody‚Äôs jaw hung open in a silent cackle. Leo and Matthew just stared at them with quiet interest‚Ä¶ and Adam‚Ä¶ his brow was furrowed. 

  ‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶ talk about crashing and burning!‚Äù Cody said.

  ‚ÄúI mean, he didn‚Äôt even get there, was that really a strikeout?‚Äù Keelan asked.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fucking disgrace, that‚Äôs what it is‚Ä¶‚Äù Adam spat. Everyone looked over at him.

  ‚ÄúHow the fuck do we just let those kinds of people walk around? I mean look at them‚Ä¶ out in public, showing off like what they are is something to be fucking proud of.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúJeez‚Ä¶‚Äù Keelan said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a couple of gir-‚Äù

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the principal of the matter,‚Äù Adam said. ‚ÄúI mean we‚Äôre here, trying to enjoy our fucking dinner and they‚Äôre out flaunting the fact that they‚Äôre a couple of whores? You guys don‚Äôt find that disgusting?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sick‚Ä¶‚Äù Leo said quietly, although he didn‚Äôt sound entirely sure of what he was saying. 

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúWe literally can not and should not have to co-exist with that kind of depraved filth, cuz this is what they do! They stuff themselves into every aspect of everyone‚Äôs life! You can‚Äôt even sit down and have a fucking meal without being reminded that they exist! And nobody cares! They celebrate it! It was everywhere last month! *‚ÄòOh, good job on being a fucking degenerate! Keep it up!‚Äô* This is why the world‚Äôs so fucked up these days, because of people like that! And they‚Äôre all so fucking proud of it too‚Ä¶‚Äù

&#x200B;

He huffed, before staring down at his drink, drumming his fingers on the table. The waitress brought us our food, although Adam didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it. As the rest of us ate, he only really picked at his fries, occasionally trying to pretend he wasn‚Äôt glaring at those two girls. 

  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna weird them out if you keep staring, man,‚Äù Keelan eventually said.

  ‚ÄúDo I look like I give a shit?‚Äù Adam asked. He scoffed, before finally taking a bite of his burger. He seemed to be thinking about something, and after a while I caught him looking at me.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Avery?‚Äù He finally asked. 

I froze.

  ‚ÄúWhat do I think?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAbout what just happened. It‚Äôs bullshit, right? I mean‚Ä¶ you go up to talk to a nice looking girl, and some slut is already putting her fucking hands all over her. You don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs sick?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know? I‚Ä¶‚Äù

  ‚ÄúImagine if my fucking burger got up, walked across the table and ate your burger.‚Äù Adam said. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ just picture it.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I was silent. 

  ‚ÄúWould that be wrong?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúWould that be fucked up?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs against the natural fucking order. Our lives are based around simple biological functions. We eat to fuel our bodies‚Ä¶‚Äù He took a bite of his burger to make a point. 

  ‚ÄúWe drink to hydrate‚Ä¶‚Äù He took a sip of his drink. 

  ‚ÄúWe fuck to breed. That right there? That doesn‚Äôt breed. It‚Äôs whole identity is in defiance of its natural purpose. You don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I guess I do,‚Äù I finally said.

&#x200B;

Adam glanced over at the girls again.

  ‚ÄúWe should teach them a fucking lesson‚Ä¶‚Äù He said under his breath. 

  ‚ÄúAdam, c‚Äômon man, just let it go.‚Äù Keelan said. 

Adam glared at him.

  ‚ÄúYou just wanna let it slide?‚Äù

&#x200B;

He looked around the table to see what the rest of us were thinking.

  ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶‚Äù Cody said. ‚ÄúFuck it, let‚Äôs do it! Let‚Äôs put those cunts in their place!‚Äù

Matthew gave a quiet nod. Leo seemed to hesitate for a bit, before he chimed in.

  ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, we should.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Adam‚Äôs gaze shifted between me and Keelan. I didn‚Äôt say a word. Keelan seemed to hesitate.

&#x200B;

  ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just drop it,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon guys‚Ä¶‚Äù

His voice faltered a little. Nobody else seemed to be paying attention to him. Adam picked at his burger a little bit more, before pushing his plate aside.

  ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get the fuck out of here,‚Äù He said. He took out his keys and set them on the table beside Leo, then he stood up. Matthew was quick to follow him, and Cody was close behind, wolfing down his burger as he went.

&#x200B;

After a moment of hesitation, I got up to go with them although I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure where we were going.

  ‚ÄúGuys?‚Äù Keelan asked. I saw him linger in his seat for a moment before getting up to follow us.

&#x200B;

As we stepped out into the parking lot, I saw a truck leaving. I recognized the two older guys from the diner inside. Adam exhaled slowly as he waited a short distance away from the door and for a few moments, none of us spoke.

&#x200B;

The realtor looking lady stepped outside behind us a few minutes later, still chatting away on her phone‚Ä¶ and then a few minutes after her, came the two girls. 

&#x200B;

Adam stared at them as they walked past, chatting and laughing as they made their way to a nearby car‚Ä¶ then he looked over at Matthew, and gave him a nod. Matthew started toward the girls with Cody at his side. They didn‚Äôt notice either of them until they were almost on top of them, and by then it was too late.

&#x200B;

I saw Matthew grabbing hold of the dark haired girl and throwing her to the ground. She let out a yelp of pain before he kicked her hard in the ribs. Cody grabbed the other girl‚Ä¶ the cute blonde. He slammed her head into the car, then when she fell he grabbed her by the hair, pressed her against the car door and rammed his meaty fist into her face, over and over and over again‚Ä¶ Her plastic rimmed glasses broke. She tried to scream, but could barely make a sound. 

&#x200B;

The dark haired girl still heard her though‚Ä¶ and I watched as she tried to pull herself away from Matthew and scramble toward her.

*‚ÄúCATHERINE!‚Äù*

&#x200B;

Her scream was cut short when Matthew grabbed her again, hurling her away from the car. She tried to stand but he kicked her back down before stomping hard on her arm. I could hear the bone crack from where I stood‚Ä¶ and the ragged shriek that came from her throat made my skin crawl.

&#x200B;

Adam just watched the whole scene unfold with a stoic silence.

*‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù* Keelan cried. *‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ, Adam! Make them fucking stop!‚Äù*

Adam just looked at him, before quietly walking closer. Keelan and I just hung back‚Ä¶ we just watched. 

&#x200B;

Cody had thrown the blonde to the ground. Her face was covered in blood. She looked like she was struggling to breathe. I watched as he stomped on her, kicked her‚Ä¶ beat her. He was grinning while he did it. Laughing.

*‚ÄúStupid cunt!‚Äù* He spat. *‚ÄúStupid cunt!‚Äù*

&#x200B;

The blonde tried to move, tried to drag herself away. I saw her reaching for the dark haired girl‚Ä¶ and I heard her croak out a name in a weak, raspy voice.

*‚ÄúAlexis‚Ä¶‚Äù*

&#x200B;

Cody‚Äôs boot connected with her face, sending her sprawling onto her back. He let out a whoop, before spitting on the girl as she lay there, bloody and damn near unrecognizable‚Ä¶ The other girl didn‚Äôt get off so easily.

&#x200B;

I saw her trying to drag herself away from Matthew, gasping and sobbing in pain as she did. She was clutching her broken arm to her chest, and I was sure I could see the bone jutting out of her skin. Just how badly had he hurt her? Behind us, the door opened and I saw Leo stepping out of the restaurant. He fixed his jacket, and looked at the scene unfolding before us as if it was the least interesting thing in the world.

&#x200B;

Adam looked back at him, before signaling for him to get the car. Leo obeyed without a second thought.

  *‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Ä¶‚Äù* I heard Keelan say. *‚ÄúJesus Christ, man‚Ä¶ what the fuck‚Ä¶ what the fuck are you doing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

&#x200B;

Adam finally acknowledged him.

  ‚ÄúPutting some cunts in their place,‚Äù He said cooly. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt like to face the reality of how the world fucking works‚Ä¶ but not us.‚Äù

&#x200B;

He stepped closer to Keelan‚Ä¶ then closer again until he was almost in his face.

  ‚ÄúDo you have a problem with that?‚Äù

&#x200B;

Keelan just stared up at him. His breathing was heavy. Frightened. Adam‚Äôs eyes burned into his. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. 

  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Adam said. He glanced at me, but when I said nothing, he turned to check on Leo.

&#x200B;

The car rolled over toward us almost right on cue. Leo quietly got out and circled around into the passenger seat, while Adam got back behind the wheel. He honked the horn twice.

  ‚ÄúFun‚Äôs over, Gentlemen,‚Äù He said. Cody immediately came back and wedged himself back into the car. Matthew got in one last kick before he did the same.

&#x200B;

Without a word, I followed them.

&#x200B;

Keelan hesitated‚Ä¶ but when Adam‚Äôs gaze settled on him, he fell in line too.

  ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs call it a night,‚Äù Adam said. He glanced over at the two girls. The blonde lay bloodied on the pavement. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was dead or alive‚Ä¶ but the dark haired girl‚Ä¶ Alexis‚Ä¶

She was still trying to crawl.

&#x200B;

Her body was stretched out as she used her unbroken arm to drag herself closer to the blonde, inch by agonizing inch. Adam watched her for a few moments, before exhaling from his nostrils‚Ä¶ and bringing the car around to face her. I heard the breath catch in Keelan‚Äôs throat.

  ‚ÄúWhat do you say, gentlemen?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúRun her fucking ass over!‚Äù Cody howled. 

&#x200B;

Adam chuckled‚Ä¶ then he hit the gas.

&#x200B;

I felt the bump under the car as we ran her over‚Ä¶ but it didn‚Äôt seem real. For a moment, my brain couldn‚Äôt process what was going on until I noticed Keelan looking out the rear window with bulging eyes. The girl was behind us. She‚Äôd rolled, and she was screaming again. Her outstretched arm was bent at an angle it shouldn‚Äôt have been. One of her legs, which trailed behind her, was now facing the wrong direction. She was screaming‚Ä¶

  ‚ÄúFUCK YEAH!‚Äù Cody cried.

&#x200B;

Adam threw the car into reverse, and I heard Keelan gasp as we went over her again. I could still hear her screaming, even over Cody‚Äôs cheers and Matthew‚Äôs quiet laughter. The car shot forward again, and for the third time I felt the tires go over her‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

This time, he didn‚Äôt back up again. This time he pulled out onto the highway, but as I looked back out the rear window, I could see the shape of the dark haired girl sprawled out on the asphalt‚Ä¶ one of her arms torn clean off of her body and her mangled legs only barely hanging on‚Ä¶ she should‚Äôve been dead‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

They both should‚Äôve been dead.

&#x200B;

And we just moved on.

&#x200B;

We went to the hotel‚Ä¶ we called it a night‚Ä¶ and then we got up the next morning as if nothing had happened. Nobody even talked about it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt do anything.

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt even try to talk the others out of it, or tell Adam to make them stop the way Keelan did. I just stood back and I watched.

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt do anything‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

We deserve this. Everything that‚Äôs happened to us‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve deserved it. And we deserve what *will* happen to us.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm not gonna fight it anymore. We deserve this‚Ä¶ and she deserves to kill us for what we did to her.",1,1732605259.0,HeadOfSpectre,1,1.0,False

Context: Over the years, I've struggled with insecurity‚Äîshe's the popular, beautiful one, and I'm the introverted, nerdy girl. She helped me break out of my shell, pursue a career that suits extroverts, and thrive. I truly owe her a lot. But throughout our friendship, her actions have left me feeling unimportant and drained.

She cancels plans last minute, takes forever to reply, and doesn't share much about her life anymore. For years, I brushed it off, but I realized it triggered unhealthy habits in me‚Äîlike obsessively checking her social media to stay updated or assuming people will cancel on me. These feelings only worsened in our 20s when we started hanging out more.

Previous attempts: I‚Äôve tried to bring up her habits before, starting back in high school, but she brushed it off as us just being young. More recently, I distanced myself after she did something hurtful (which she‚Äôs done many times before), and she apologized by buying me coffee. I‚Äôve often avoided bringing up these issues again, convincing myself to ""be the bigger person"" and not escalate things. But honestly, I don‚Äôt think I have the mental capacity to do that anymore.

The tipping point came when she moved away. I didn‚Äôt even know until the last minute, just like when she got a boyfriend, which I found out through her socials. The hurt deepened recently when I discovered‚Äîagain through social media‚Äîthat she'd gone through a life-threatening health scare. Our mutual friends were asking me about it, assuming I‚Äôd know, and it crushed me. I wasn‚Äôt given the chance to be there for her during such a crucial time.
I love my best friend, but I feel emotionally exhausted. I‚Äôve started questioning whether I‚Äôm holding onto something that‚Äôs no longer there. Am I selfish for wanting to end this friendship so I can find peace? Or am I holding out for a connection that‚Äôs already gone?",0,1732605159.0,adviceph,3,0.5,False

So, after my last post 2 nights ago, I am feeling heaps better. I think it was a stomach bug, went to the dr, he said the same thing. 

Went in to work today, and because I didn't have enough time to get up and have breakfast, I bought an iced coffee (not the healthiest, I know, I'm working on it, baby steps!) and I had had about half the bottle when ((TW)) >!I burped and kinda regurgitated a bit in the back of my throat!<

While it wasn't comfortable (it never is) it didn't burn like I expected it to, and I was actually okay with it and it didn't freak me out!

So I think, in the future, if I have had a lot of acidic foods, I will take sips of milk and it may help the nausea, and if not, it may make it not as traumatic since there won't be any burning!

I think I'm on the path to healing guys! I've been dealing with this since I was 10, I even had to sit at a 45 degree angle on pillows and pass out distracted to a movie because I would freak out so much about bed time.

But 15 years later, being diagnosed with a variety of things, like anxiety, depression, ADHD, possible autism (and that's just mental health), possible IBS and other unrelated issues, I feel like I'm finally getting a grip on my life.

All my life ive experienced the feeling of always being overly cared for by my worried parents, always having to walk upon eggshells as a kid in order to not see arguments within my family, and to have a narcissistic older brother who criticizes me in all aspects of what i do whether it be me leaving my hoodie in the living room, or leaving a dish in the sink for me to clean later, cleaning my room infrquently at times. All of these things have played such an everlasting impact and now that i live with 3 other roomates in university, i feel as though i have become the very person i despise and thats my brother whilst also heightned by my upbringing through my parents. With that being said, i get mad at my roomates in the morning when they just use my things such as my coffee maker, although i know its so stupid i cant help stop these feelings from arising, it just arises within me so fast i just get so beyond pissed, especially if thats the first thing they do in the morning, just making coffee using my stuff without brushing their teeth or getting after it. To keep this short i feel like if i dont want to experience these feelings i should just move out, which i will but what are ways that i can help stop feelings of resentment that arise in people using my stuff, petting my dog, being loud in a shared household. Like to add, my eoomates just play poker all day, smoke weed, just are loud at times but most of the time im unbothered but it just annoys me that this is the energy in my shared house. I know i should probably live alone and thats what i may do, but looking at other people i know they wouldnt give 2 shits if it doesnt bother them but it bothers me and i really want to better myself in how i react to my feelings. I just think that i have tendencies of a narcicist myself, i want things to be the way i want it, i want people driven like me as i work the hardest out of my group, i want a household thats pure quiet and just studies. Fuck i want too much. Any suggestions or advice or just to chat would be so helpful thank u so much god bless

Today, homeowners are seeking stylish and eco-friendly designs that harmonize with their personal aesthetics while being kind to the planet. Sustainable furniture doesn‚Äôt mean compromising on style‚Äîin fact, it often adds a unique charm and thoughtful appeal to any space. Let‚Äôs explore how you can make conscious decisions with your furniture, including options like [black coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), [rattan side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables), and eco-friendly [garden furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture).

# What Is Sustainable Furniture?

Sustainable furniture refers to pieces crafted with environmentally friendly materials, ethical production processes, and minimal waste. From renewable resources like bamboo and rattan to reclaimed wood and recycled metals, sustainable options reduce environmental impact without sacrificing design and functionality.

# Eco-Friendly Black Coffee Tables: Bold and Sustainable

A **black coffee table** is a timeless centerpiece for any living room, offering sophistication and versatility. When choosing a sustainable option, look for tables made from reclaimed wood or recycled metal with non-toxic finishes. These designs are not only durable but also support a circular economy by repurposing materials. For a sleek modern look, opt for a black coffee table with a minimalist frame, or embrace a rustic vibe with reclaimed wood.

# Rattan Side Tables: Natural Elegance Meets Functionality

Rattan furniture has become a hallmark of sustainable design. A **rattan side table** is a lightweight, stylish option that blends seamlessly with both modern and bohemian interiors. Rattan is a renewable resource that grows quickly, making it an eco-friendly material of choice. Whether used to hold a lamp, books, or decorative accents, a rattan side table adds texture and warmth to your space while aligning with sustainable principles.

# Sustainable Garden Furniture: Perfect for Outdoor Living

Creating an eco-friendly outdoor oasis is easier than ever with sustainable **garden furniture**. Choose pieces made from recycled plastic, FSC-certified wood, or powder-coated aluminum, which are durable and resistant to outdoor elements. Furniture crafted from materials like teak or bamboo not only offers natural beauty but also ensures longevity and sustainability. Complete the look with rattan or jute cushions for added comfort and a natural vibe.

# Tips for Choosing Sustainable Furniture

1. **Research Materials**: Look for renewable resources like bamboo, rattan, or FSC-certified wood, and avoid furniture made from virgin plastics or endangered hardwoods.
2. **Support Ethical Brands**: Many furniture companies prioritize sustainability and transparency. Choose brands that use eco-conscious materials and fair trade practices.
3. **Opt for Versatility**: Invest in multifunctional furniture, like a **black coffee table** with storage or modular garden furniture, to reduce consumption and maximize usage.
4. **Repurpose and Upcycle**: Give new life to pre-loved furniture by repurposing or refinishing pieces. Thrifted finds often have character and can be customized to suit your style.

# Why Choose Sustainable Furniture?

Beyond its positive environmental impact, sustainable furniture tells a story. Each piece reflects thoughtful design and craftsmanship, making it a meaningful addition to your home. Whether it‚Äôs the striking contrast of a **black coffee table**, the artisanal appeal of a **rattan side table**, or the practicality of eco-conscious **garden furniture**, sustainable designs prove that style and responsibility go hand in hand.

# Elevate Your Home with Sustainable Style

Choosing sustainable furniture is a step toward a greener planet and a more beautiful home. By incorporating thoughtfully designed pieces like black coffee tables, rattan side tables, and eco-friendly garden furniture, you can create a space that‚Äôs as stylish as it is kind to the Earth. Explore sustainable options and make a conscious choice that reflects your values and enhances your living spaces.

1h05qj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1h05qj6/feeling_guilty_for_throwing_a_customer_out_of_the/,"Feeling guilty for throwing a customer out of the store, even though she physically pushed me.","First off, I'm a total pushover, yet I am in a management position and doing my best to hold down the fort. Today was not easy on me. This issue has been going on for a while with this particular woman who comes in, loiters, and lets her kid run rampant through the store and destroy things. Yes she makes purchases but they are small and the amount of service she requires is not even worth the trouble.


Here's a quick list of some of the things this woman has been doing when she ""stops by"":


- asks for help with things that are not related to our job and uses social pressure to try and force us into being kind about it in the name of ""customer service"".  For example she once asked for help with her welfare housing application, and another time setting up a gift card that all you had to do was scan a QR, code.  She pretends to be sweet and innocent but I swear she's very aware that she's taking up our time and making us uncomfortable.


- traps us in conversation indefinitely.  She will talk and talk and talk until a customer comes in then she talks to them and us at the same time.  The talking never stops.


- stays for hours on end.  Sometimes she ends up stalling us locking the door at the end of the day for x reason.  ""Needs to use the bathroom"". Hasn't paid for her coffee yet even though we made it 20 minutes ago.  


-  allows her child to run rampant through the store.  He's apparently addicted to the hand sanitizer dispenser and likes to throw the sanitizer all over our windows or floor.  She does nothing to control him.  He has created floods of sanitizer twice now.  He throws our sales tags with the prices on them everywhere while she distracts us (on purpose, I know it's on purpose 100%).

Can go into the Kris Flyer Gold lounge. Right next to their business lounge and the SATS premium one (PP).
Reviews online are mixed and rightfully so.

Food is OK. There is some small snacks (dim sum). Some forms of curry? A plate of lemon chicken on a steamer for some reason. There is a salad bar.
Drinks a plenty however. Interesting choice of hard liquor (white rum, vodka, ingredients for a Bloody Mary?) Unlimited beer (Cass and Tiger) and soft drinks. There is tea and coffee on the side.
There is a saving grace. A Laksa stand. Honestly not bad.
There is a shower stand (didn‚Äôt go check out).

The best part of this lounge however should be stated. It‚Äôs quiet. I passed by the SATS lounge and it‚Äôs packed. See picture, very sparse and quiet, which is the BEST part. Some go to the lounge just to relax and this is the best perk of this lounge.

Today was not easy on me. This issue has been going on for a while with this particular woman who comes in, loiters, and lets her kid run rampant through the store and destroy things. Yes she makes purchases but they are small and the amount of service she requires is not even worth the trouble.


For reference I work in a cafe setting, not a sit-down restaurant.  Please remove if this is not allowed.


Here's a quick list of some of the things this woman has been doing when she ""stops by"":


- asks for help with things that are not related to our job and uses social pressure to try and force us into being kind about it in the name of ""customer service"".  For example she once asked for help with her welfare housing application, and another time setting up a gift card that all you had to do was scan a QR, code.  She pretends to be sweet and innocent but I swear she's very aware that she's taking up our time and making us uncomfortable.


- traps us in conversation indefinitely.  She will talk and talk and talk until a customer comes in then she talks to them and us at the same time.  The talking never stops.

- stays for hours on end.  Sometimes she ends up stalling us locking the door at the end of the day for x reason.  ""Needs to use the bathroom"". Hasn't paid for her coffee yet even though we made it 20 minutes ago.  


-  allows her child to run rampant through the store.  He's apparently addicted to the hand sanitizer dispenser and likes to throw the sanitizer all over our windows or floor.  She does nothing to control him.  He has created floods of sanitizer twice now.  He throws our sales tags with the prices on them everywhere while she distracts us (on purpose, I know it's on purpose 100%). 

That brings me to my next point.  I had previously given them a warning that if the bullshit with the sanitizer continued, they would not be welcome back in the store. Tonight, I was not having it. As soon as they walked in the door they sat down at a table, and the kid starts pouring out the hand sanitizer.

When my son had his Bday party and invited a bunch of kids over, I was almost swamped with crumbs from cookies and chips everywhere, ketchup stains on the floor, and dog hair brought in by some of the kids.

1h05bln,https://i.redd.it/93oly18zu63e1.jpeg,What‚Äôs the typical length for a 3D or 2D e-commerce product ad?,"""E-Commerce Ads: Shorter Than a TikTok Dance, Longer Than Your Wi-Fi Password""

Keep It Shorter Than an Elevator Ride

Alright, folks, let‚Äôs talk about ad length. If your e-commerce product ad is longer than an elevator ride, you‚Äôve already lost your audience. Nobody‚Äôs sticking around to watch a 3-minute ode to your coffee mug, no matter how spill-proof it claims to be. The sweet spot? 15 to 30 seconds. Long enough to say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why you need this,‚Äù but short enough to keep their thumb off the skip button.

The Goldfish Conundrum

Did you know the average human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish? That‚Äôs right‚Äîless than 8 seconds. So if your ad doesn‚Äôt hook viewers faster than a toddler spotting candy, they‚Äôre gone. This means every frame of your 3D or 2D masterpiece needs to scream, ‚ÄúHey, stop scrolling and buy this thing!‚Äù No pressure, right?

30 Seconds Feels Like an Hour on Social Media

Here‚Äôs a fun fact: 30 seconds on social media feels like eternity. That‚Äôs enough time for someone to scroll through five memes, argue in the comments, and plan their weekend‚Äîall before your ad even finishes. So, if you‚Äôre going for the longer 30-second format, make sure it‚Äôs packed with eye-catching visuals, snappy text, and a call-to-action that‚Äôs punchier than a Rocky movie montage.

When 15 Seconds is All You‚Äôve Got

For the speed demons among us, the 15-second ad is the ultimate challenge. You‚Äôve got no time for slow pans or dramatic reveals‚Äîit‚Äôs all about instant impact. Think of it like speed dating: introduce the product, highlight its best feature, and end with, ‚ÄúBuy it now!‚Äù Blink, and you‚Äôre done. Perfect for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or anywhere else people have the patience of a gnat.

But Wait, What About Longer Ads?

Oh, you want to go beyond 30 seconds? Sure, but only if it‚Äôs a story-driven cinematic masterpiece. You know, the kind that makes people laugh, cry, and immediately click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart.‚Äù This works for higher-ticket items like luxury watches or cutting-edge gadgets. Otherwise, keep it concise‚Äînobody‚Äôs here for the Lord of the Rings of skincare.

3D vs. 2D: Does Length Matter?

Here‚Äôs the deal: whether you‚Äôre showcasing a sleek 3D animation or charming 2D graphics, the length doesn‚Äôt change. What matters is how you use the time. 3D ads might need a few extra seconds to flex their realism, while 2D thrives on quick, quirky storytelling. Either way, the goal is the same: grab attention, showcase the product, and seal the deal.

The Grand Finale: Timing is Everything

So, what‚Äôs the verdict? Stick to 15-30 seconds for most e-commerce ads, but make every second count. It‚Äôs not about cramming in more details‚Äîit‚Äôs about leaving viewers with one burning thought: ‚ÄúI need this in my life.‚Äù
