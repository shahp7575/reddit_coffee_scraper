OFW since 2019. Working in Canada.

Started as PSW, then private home care nurse then OR nurse with sideline as float nurse.

I work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Yung 1 day off ko, nasa bahay lang ako. Takot lumabas kasi magastos. Only times umaalis ako is mag groceries for the month.

Yung tanging libangan ko ay internet for movies, books etc and gaming. 

But bakit parang ATM yung treatment ng family and friends ko? 

Nag me-message kung may kailangan. 

I should say no, pero gini-guilt trip ako. Kesyo, single daw ako at walang responsibilidad. 

Part of the reason naman kasi, I get excited when someone messages me. Kaya lang, 90% of the messages eh may mangungutang. The 9% is family problems and eventually leading to mangungutang sila. 1% yung annoying MLM invites for coffee or webinar. 

I am not kidding on that. And not for lack of trying, nag memessage ako sa kanila, I never forget their birthdays and events. I send messages to congratulate or condolence etc. Nangungumusta ako. Yet, all I get are one to three word sentences. Or minsan, seen lang.

Tapos ako pa masama when I don't send money, or konti lang ibibigay ko. Or if binigay ko kung anong amount gusto nila, ba't di ko daw dinagdagan. Or, in bad taste daw na magbigay ko ng hiningi nilang pera tapos ang remind ako na may existing utang sila na di pa nababayaran.

Welcome to the wild world of Bitcoin ATMs ‚Äî where the future of finance meets the simplicity of vending machines! If you‚Äôve ever stood in line at a traditional ATM and thought, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just buy some Bitcoin while I‚Äôm here?‚Äù ‚Äî well, you‚Äôre not alone. Thankfully, Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs, if you‚Äôre feeling fancy) are popping up everywhere, making it easier than ever to go from cash-in-hand to Bitcoin-in-wallet in just a few taps.

Now, for those new to the game: a Bitcoin ATM lets you buy Bitcoin (and sometimes sell it too) using cash or a debit card. You walk up, verify your identity (some are stricter than others), and send BTC to your wallet ‚Äî boom! You‚Äôre part of the decentralized revolution. No bank manager. No paperwork. No ‚Äúclosed on Sundays‚Äù nonsense. It‚Äôs pure freedom.

But here‚Äôs where things get even cooler ‚Äî and way more convenient: our [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)!

Let‚Äôs be honest, typing out long wallet addresses like `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa` is a great way to sprain your thumbs *and* your brain. One typo and your Bitcoin‚Äôs heading into the void, never to be seen again. That‚Äôs where QR codes come in ‚Äî and why every Bitcoin ATM experience should start with one.

With our Bitcoin QR Code Generator app, you can instantly turn your wallet address into a sleek, scannable QR code that even your grandma could use. Whether you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin at an ATM or receiving a payment from a friend, all it takes is one scan. No stress. No errors. Just pure, digital elegance.

You can choose your style (we‚Äôve got options that even Satoshi would envy), drop in your BTC, Lightning, or compatible crypto address, and download your QR code in seconds. Print it out, stick it on your fridge, share it on your website, tattoo it on your cat (okay, maybe not that last one) ‚Äî the possibilities are endless.

Pairing a Bitcoin ATM with a clean, ready-to-scan QR code from [**bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is like showing up to a pizza party with extra cheese. You‚Äôre not just prepared ‚Äî you‚Äôre the hero. Whether you're buying Bitcoin for the first time or setting up a donation box at your local coffee shop, QR codes are the secret weapon that makes crypto usable by *real* humans.

So next time you spot a glowing Bitcoin ATM in the wild, don‚Äôt just fumble with your phone trying to copy-paste addresses like it's 2012. Whip out your QR code like a pro, scan it, and step confidently into the blockchain-powered future.

Bitcoin is here to stay ‚Äî and with the right tools, like our QR Code Maker, it‚Äôs easier, safer, and more fun than ever. üöÄüì≤üí∏

1l70z9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l70z9w/completely_lost_with_this_woman/,Completely lost with this woman,"So, first of all I'm a 35m, I've been talking with a woman 35f for a few weeks I met at Bumble. I have to say I struggle with social anxiety. I've not been in a relationship since I was 17, and I'm awful reading woman and knowing if they are interested in me.

So last thursday we had our first date. I think things were going alright, maybe not really good, but the conversation was fluent, we talked about many things. Started at a coffee place, then went for a walk.

1:30h into the date she gets a call. Apparently her mother forgot her keys at inside home and she can't get in now. So she profusely apologized, telling me she never had done this etc... Since she apologized so much, and also told me to meet soon I though it was something legit and no an excuse. OK.

Few hours later she didn't told me anything so I wrote her asking if everything was solved, se apologized again, gave me a good night.

I though since what happened she would write me next day giving me the good morning as she used to do many days before the date, but oh I was wrong, no message from her during all Friday, not saturday morning. So I finally send her a message on saturday's evening and she answers a few  hours later with an almost 2 minutes audio telling me about her day. So, ok, good signal I guess, I wouldn't send a 2 minute audio to someone I'm not interested. We chat a bit, and I ask her to meet next week thurday but she isn't sure she can, and tells me we will see the next days, it was late so I give her good night and go to bed.

On Sunday morning I send her a message after I wake up, I was going climbing, she tells me to enjoy and that she would go running. When I finish my climbing session I ask her how was it her running and that's it.

She saw my message but didn't answer. Like 20 hours since she saw my message and didn't answer.

So now I'm strugging to understand if she is really interested at all or now. I'm getting mixed signals...

Is it worth it to try to send her a message, or should I just wait and see if she finally responds?

I'm completely lost with this.

1l70ykg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1l70ykg/do_you_want_us_to_work_or_follow_procedure/,Do you want us to work or follow procedure?,"Years ago I managed a fast food franchise with a staff of teenagers. They were great kids and between all the horsing around and romantic subplots the work got done.

I ran things fairly loosely and we had a good arrangement where I'd pretend not to notice they were having a water fight out the back, but when I did go out to check all the dishes would be done. As long as nobody's parents called to complain about the sopping wet teenager that arrived home everything was fine.

Other managers ran things in a more traditional way, with rules and timeclocks. Also a valid management strategy.

My area manager would stop by at random. He was a fair guy that liked his checklists. Do x task at x o'clock. My crew were trained in all the checklists and all necessary food and safety stuff (and I did watch that pretty closely) but knew each other and their jobs so he'd show up and things would be in what I called ""predictable disarray"". This would annoy him.

I got word that he was coming (for once) and he was bringing along someone who was buying one of the franchises - using us as sort of a demo store. I was specifically asked to have my crew at their best, adhering to company checklists.

I asked, ok which do you want, my crew at their best or for us to follow your checklists?

""Both"". 

My crew did their best work vaguely supervised with godawful music piped in through an unauthorized mp3 player and a manager on hand in case a Karen showed up. Water fights and crude insults on the fridge door were common and they'd routinely lock each other in the walk-in freezer. 

I was fine with all this, because when a bus of hungry football fans showed up 20mins to closing and ordered a feast my crew hustled, and we still got out on time. They knew their shit and did it their way. My cashiers would trade based on their needs, so everyone got a moment to have a drink or pee without interrupting service. My line cook would run all three stations from his station, ensuring perfect coordination and hot fresh food. I only interfered when it was necessary and was able to be backup for everyone. 

But stick to the company issued checklists? Okay.

I pulled everyone off the line individually and revised the appropriate checklists with them to make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing. I passed on the order that today's shift was to be run using the checklists, and everyone should do the best they could.



It was chaos.



Dinner rush hit, and bought a slew of just-off-duty paramedics from the nearby hospital. Fresh off shift, tired from a training session, and HUNGRY. But my checklist planning had only allowed for a Tuesday night dinner rush of people on their way home picking up dinner. I had reserves, but without a crew who worked in sync each taking the spot they were best suited to I was stuck with bodies in slots doing the best they could.

I had my newest crew member in the drive through being shouted at by customers sick of waiting, my best line cook standing miserably by the fryer and the bubbly pair that usually handled front counter having alternate nervous breakdowns in the drinks fridge.

No cleaning got done, I had nobody free to prep more food, customers were pissed at the lengthy waits and we completely ran out of some products. Instead of the usual finish time my crew got two hours overtime before I sent them home and took a photo of the remaining devastation to send to the area manager, who was already regretting his instructions.

The new franchise owner had been disappointed at the staff's ""lack of initiative"" dealing with an unexpectedly busy shift, and felt it was a lack of effective training. He was also uncomfortable at the amount of running around shouting a manager has to do when things turn to absolute shit.

I got a coffee the next morning, and something that could have been an apology if you squinted. 

My crew got a round of frozen cokes, and ""are you following the checklist?"" became the new way to say someone had screwed up.",1,1749463677.0,MaliciousCompliance,0,1.0,False

Ruminating for certainty, constant reassurance seeking from my mum that it was just a myth, constantly trying to figure out whether it would actually happen. So, when I watched the South Park episode Put It Down (S21E2), despite the humour, I felt weirdly seen.

The character Tweek is known for drinking lots of coffee and having insane anxiety. He completely spirals about North Korea launching nukes after reading scary news and tweets, and no one else seems to care. He‚Äôs panicking, catastrophising, trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it by baking cupcakes and screaming at everyone, and it‚Äôs all played for comedy. But it feels like such an accurate OCD representation.

The intrusive thought is massive (the world ending), the fear feels urgent and real, and he‚Äôs stuck in a loop of rumination and reassurance seeking - mostly with Craig, who tries to logic it away, which obviously doesn‚Äôt work. It reminded me so much of being a kid and obsessing over the world ending, asking my mum over and over if we were safe. That same feeling of panic, responsibility, and no one else getting it.

I related so much to Tweek in this episode, probably because it‚Äôs very rare to see someone Pure O in any media. I‚Äôd love to watch more OCD characters - do you have any shows or films who you believe depict OCD well and that you resonate with? ",1,1749463523.0,OCDRecovery,0,1.0,False

I have no idea how I feel about what he told me. I want to think it‚Äôs cute that he cared this much, but it‚Äôs just coming off as creepy and I feel lied to. 

He got drunk because we were celebrating my first successful day at my clinicals and he ended up saying something along the lines of ‚Äúcould you believe we wouldn‚Äôt be this happy if I hadn‚Äôt watched you for so long?‚Äù To which I was confused and didn‚Äôt know what he meant. 

Well I had worked at a local library for two years, before we met, during college and apparently he saw me there but didn‚Äôt actually talk to me, he just would watch me and listen in on my conversations with the people I was checking and my coworkers out to figure out what I liked. Then he apparently followed me and found the coffee shop I frequented. All this time I thought we had a sweet first time meeting story. He accidentally bumped into me, apologized, and offered to buy me coffee for the trouble. 

He told me what he was ordering and it was the exact same thing I always get and I thought it was an amazing coincidence, I joked that it was fate and we spent like an hour talking over coffee. I feel so stupid. Apparently it was similar to a scene in a book that I had read and told my coworker I had thought was cute. 

I‚Äôm just so frustrated, like why would you do this?? And how much of our year and a half relationship is a lie

Hey everyone, I know a lot you have been worried about me and I just wanted to let all of you know that I‚Äôm safe. Shit has definitely hit the fan, but at the moment I‚Äôm safe. 

First, no I didn‚Äôt make that last update. My boyfriend went on my phone while I was showering and trying to figure out what I wanted to say to him about everything and he found and edited my post. He then started yelling at me while I was still in the shower about sharing it online and calling him creepy. At the same time he was guilt tripping me and telling me that it was romantic and he did it because he loved me, he literally read a few of the comments out loud to me. He barely let me out of the shower but I did manage to get my clothes on while he was screaming at me. 

What really freaked me out was that he started listing off things that he could‚Äôve done to me, I won‚Äôt list them here because it was extremely gruesome and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs allowed, but he said that he didn‚Äôt do those things because he‚Äôs such a nice guy. The way he described the things he could‚Äôve done though made me feel like he had genuinely considered doing it. Also, I thought he was only watching me for a few months, apparently it was upwards of a year and it was genuine actual stalking. 

He had followed me home and to my college campus, he pulled out a collection of my lost hair ties that he kept. I told him that he was scaring me and that we needed to take a break and come back to it later. At that he put a hole in the wall next to my head. I told him that I was leaving after that because fuck that shit and it was like a switch flipped and he started crying, he got on his knees and begged me to stay and apologized. I ended up accepting his apology because I didn‚Äôt feel safe leaving. Yesterday morning after he‚Äôd left for work I grabbed all my important documents and irreplaceable things before my clinicals started and kept them in my car. 

After my clinical I didn‚Äôt go back to the apartment. I‚Äôm not going to give much more detail than that because he does know my account obviously. 

And for Andrew if you‚Äôre reading this, which we both know you are, please just leave me alone. The person I thought I loved doesn‚Äôt actually exist and that‚Äôs heartbreaking. I no longer feel safe with you like I did before and I hate that. Please let‚Äôs just move on from each other.

Local mates would be amazing,¬†**but I am just as happy with online connections provided you are open to Voice/Video c**alls.

Future Mate,

I‚Äôm a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who‚Äôs also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I‚Äôm talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I‚Äôve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something‚Äôs missing... a mate who‚Äôs down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some ‚Äúlife unpacking‚Äù over coffee or a fire pit.

What I‚Äôm not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

Cheers,

Just looking for some tips.  I grew up in the Southeast, bank fishing creeks for pan frying cats and never had much issue.  We also were allowed to set out trot lines which made night time fishing a lot easier.

I'm usually the type of person who knows what to do and does not like to waste any time. I'm at my wit's end with my situation and I'd like to seek advice to the adults out there who know better of the adulting world. 

Hi, I'm a 20 M living somewhere in Manila studying for an insane course with an insane workload (I am not going to mention it but it's within the allied health courses). 

To start, let's just say that at the beginning of my 1st years, I remember the light and hope in my eyes. New people, new faces, and I was studying the course which I thought carefully of and loved; it was basically perfect for me!

I used to have something to expect to everyday, subject schedules were less demanding and I had **time** to go about my other hobbies. 

**Then came my 2nd years.**

Workload is inhumane, schedules are 12 hours upon 12 hours Monday to Friday, quizzes every week, my gosh it's just so much!

It is with this setup in which I am seriously doubting I can make another semester in my course. Just a side note, I also did therapy way back in my first half years to a psychiatrist. As I expressed my school life to her and my insane schedules, she even stated that I beat HER schedules when she was studying medicine! Crazy!

But anyway, an even deeper and integral issue that really hits me to my core is the **greyness and emptiness of my social life**. 

So, I'm an introvert. And with this insane 12 hour rotation on my school every day, it really consumes me that I'd rather explore things that I'd be interested in rather than talking with my classmates; believe it or not, but I try everyday. But the spark and interest have been long gone, it's like when I see their faces, I see finished stories, and nothing more to talk about. 

So to summarise, I don't have anything to expect to my school, I feel grey, dull, and meaningless everytime I attend each class. And I feel like beating myself up because I don't talk to my classmates anymore. It's just not there anymore. 

You know, I tried a semester's break and had fiery arguments with my parents, we all loved each other at the end of the day and I got to have a 5 month long break until summer. NOW it's summer time and it has been the first day, you know what I felt? My familiar old friend emptiness, silence, and grey. 

It's the same silence and deader-than-dead peace that I've experienced back then. It's so painfully quiet and I have nothing to look forward to. 

I know education is a luxury and everything, but as each day passes, I'm starting to want to fulfill my natural human functions and get to actually friking live. Not like this: living in a grey box in a dark hall, waking up so early everyday boozing myself with coffee, memorising until the ends of earth, sleeping to do the same thing all over again. 

Please, anyone. I seek your guidance.

My mum (70) has always wanted to see the Northern Lights. This is a big trip for us, as we are based in Australia.. We've decided on Norway over USA/Canada, and I'm unable to go in 2025, so we are thinking in the first part of 2026.

\- Does it really matter if we go north or south on the Havilla boat (thinking a 12 day 'cruise' might be a bit too long?)

\- is Kirkness a good place to 'chase' the northern lights from - hotel recommendations?

\- is Bergen - Oslo a good direction for the train?

1l70k08,https://i.redd.it/dc2lwna4hv5f1.jpeg,"Hey folks, not here to rant or flex just sharing something real from my journey","I want to share something from my own experience that might help some of you: 
‚Äúlooks do matter‚Äù‚Ä¶.
maybe more than we like to admit. But before anyone jumps in with ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about personality n all that abstract stuff,‚Äù hear me out completely.

Back in school, I was a below average guy , tanned, skinny, awkward looking, low on confidence, with anxiety issues. I used to be extremely quiet, easy to pick on, and got emotional quickly.

Things started changing around 10th grade when my best friend introduced me to some girls. At first it felt exciting I enjoyed the attention, conversations, making jokes, chilling n laughing with them. ‚Ä¶..That‚Äôs when I started caring about how I presented myself.

I made a conscious decision to improve. I got braces that fixed my facial structure. I started doing home workouts and saw changes in my body. I shifted my style started wearing formal clothes because that‚Äôs what I liked (i dont  like  baggy stuff that much ). I watched tons of YouTube videos on self-improvement, mindset, confidence, and afcourse grooming.

I started experimenting with natural skin care things like multani mitti, orange peel powder , coffee scrubs , aloe vera, etc. Later I learned about proper skincare products (Minimalist, The Ordinary, etc.) and began using vitamin C, kojic acid, niacinamide, retinol, etc I took care of my hair, improved my hygiene, and overall appearance.

By the time I entered 12th, my braces were off, my skin was bright af and had cleared up, and I looked and felt much better (puberty also played a huge role in my looks and personality )

Suddenly, everything changed
I became more noticed in college People especially girls paid attention Some even secretly clicked my pictures (two of my friends admitted and told me this after they become my close friends). I made friends easily and was known for my tech skills (especially in computer science). Teachers appreciated me, and classmates assumed I was a topper (only true for CS though , i sucked in pcm)
I didn‚Äôt even use Instagram, yet people asked my friends for my ID. I stuck to Snapchat and WhatsApp.

Fast forward to now I‚Äôm in my first year of computer engineering. Due to some personal issues (family problems, toxic relationship), I stopped taking care of myself gained a some weight, lost my routine, and most importantly, lost that inner spark. And guess what?
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.The difference was obvious. People‚Äôs energy towards me changed. I wasn‚Äôt getting the same attention or vibe anymore. That confidence dip reflected in everything.

But I‚Äôm working on myself again and I already feel the shift.

Here‚Äôs my honest takeaway:
	‚ÄúLooks DO matter‚Äù
	‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be model-level handsome, but presenting yourself well, being clean, confident, and fit goes a long way.
People ( especially girls) won‚Äôt even notice your ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù if they aren‚Äôt visually interested enough to start a conversation.

Also To the girls who may say ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs about how he is on the inside‚Äù:
Yes, it is but how will you ever get to know that if you don‚Äôt even feel any initial attraction or curiosity to engage with him?

And To the guys reading this
I am not saying this to demotivate you. I am saying it to motivate you to invest in yourself mentally, physically, emotionally. Work on your looks, your habits, your health.

Because when you level up, everything around you starts leveling up too.

Peace.


TL;DR : Worked on my looks, confidence, and grooming‚Äîwent from invisible to getting attention and respect. Let myself go later and instantly felt ignored again.
Looks matter more than people admit. Improve yourself, it‚Äôs worth it.

Two years at Austin College, and somehow this simple RSVP felt like the hardest decision I'd made in months. ""It's just a stupid reunion,"" I muttered to myself, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. My fingers trembled slightly as I scrolled through the attendee list. And there it was‚ÄîLogan Walker. My stomach clenched. Two years together, and what did I have to show for it? A collection of apologies I'd memorized like poetry. A habit of checking my phone three times before sending a text. The constant, gnawing feeling that I was always one wrong word away from disaster. I clicked ""Yes"" before I could change my mind. \* \* \* The bass from the speakers vibrated through the floorboards of the frat house as I stepped into the lounge. Red cups, dim lighting, and the familiar scent of cheap beer‚Äîsome things never changed. My eyes scanned the room automatically, a reflex developed from months of needing to gauge Logan's mood the moment I entered a space. He was by the makeshift bar, laughing with some guys from his economics class. Our eyes met briefly, and he raised his cup in acknowledgment. I returned a tight smile, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest‚Äîthat invisible leash tugging. ""Sophie?"" I turned to find Peter Adams standing nearby, a gentle smile lighting up his face. We'd grown up together before college, shared secrets and summer adventures. Before Logan had slowly convinced me that Peter's friendship was something to be suspicious of. ""Hey, stranger,"" I said, genuine warmth flooding through me. Peter's smile widened as he offered a shy wave. ""It's really good to see you."" I felt Logan's gaze before I saw it‚Äîthat prickling sensation between my shoulder blades. When I glanced over, his eyes had narrowed, tracking the interaction with the intensity of a predator. I instinctively stepped back from Peter, the old habit of appeasing Logan kicking in before I could stop it. ""I should probably..."" I gestured vaguely toward Logan. Peter nodded, understanding in his eyes. ""Sure. Catch up later?"" ""Definitely,"" I promised, though we both knew Logan would find a way to prevent it. \* \* \* Midnight found us sprawled across beanbags in the corner of the lounge. The party had dwindled to a core group, and someone had suggested poker. I sat cross-legged beside Logan, trying to focus on my cards rather than the way his hand rested possessively on my knee, thumb making small circles that felt more like warnings than affection. ""I'm out,"" announced Ethan, tossing his cards down. ""Too rich for my blood."" Logan smirked, surveying his hand. The whiskey had made him reckless, his eyes glittering with that dangerous spark I'd learned to fear. ""I'll see your twenty,"" he said to Peter, who sat opposite us, ""and raise you..."" He paused, looking around dramatically before his gaze settled on me. My blood ran cold. ""I'll raise you Sophie,"" he finished with a laugh that didn't reach his eyes.

The circle fell silent. Someone coughed uncomfortably.

""Logan,"" I whispered, mortification burning through me. ""That's not funny.""

""It's just a game, babe,"" he said dismissively, his grip tightening on my knee. ""Don't be so sensitive.""

Peter's face had hardened, his eyes flickering between Logan and me. ""Maybe we should call it a night,"" he suggested quietly.

""No way,"" Logan insisted, slapping down his cards. ""Let's see what you've got, Adams.""

Peter reluctantly revealed his hand. Four of a kind.

Logan's smile faltered as he stared at the winning hand. The room held its collective breath.

Then, with a casual cruelty that stunned even me, Logan shrugged and gestured toward me. ""All yours, man. The prize is yours for the night.""

Something inside me‚Äîsomething that had been bending for two long years‚Äîfinally snapped.

I stood up so abruptly that the cards scattered across the floor. ""I am not a prize,"" I said, my voice shaking but clear. ""And I am definitely not yours anymore.""

Logan's face darkened. ""Sophie, you're overreacting‚Äî""

""We're done,"" I cut him off, the words rushing out like a dam breaking. ""I'm not doing this anymore. Any of it.""

I turned and walked out, aware of the stunned silence behind me. The hallway seemed to stretch endlessly as I stumbled forward, tears blurring my vision. When I finally reached an empty corner, my legs gave way, and I slid down the wall, hugging my knees to my chest as sobs wracked my body.

For the first time in two years, I couldn't tell if I was crying from pain or relief.

Chapter 2

I sat on the cold stairwell floor, hugging my knees to my chest. The concrete steps dug into my back, but I barely noticed. My mind was too busy replaying every moment with Logan, like a horror movie I couldn't shut off.

""You're so much prettier when you don't try so hard,"" he'd said once, examining my face when I'd worn makeup for a party. The compliment wrapped around a barb, designed to make me second-guess myself. I'd spent the rest of the night in the bathroom, scrubbing my face raw.

Then there were the loyalty tests. The time he'd asked a friend to flirt with me at a party, watching from across the room to see if I'd respond. The way he'd check my phone when I wasn't looking, then casually mention details from private conversations I'd had with friends.

My chest tightened as the memories flooded in. Two years of walking on eggshells, of apologizing for things I hadn't done, of doubting my own perception of reality. The poker game wasn't the first time he'd humiliated me‚Äîjust the most public.

I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to stop the tears. The stairwell was quiet this early, most students still sleeping off last night's party. I'd chosen it specifically for its isolation, needing somewhere to hide while campus buzzed with gossip about my very public breakup.

My phone vibrated against the floor. Another message from Logan: \*We need to talk. You're being dramatic.\*

I silenced it without responding, my hands shaking. The thought of facing him‚Äîof hearing his voice twist everything around until somehow I was the one apologizing‚Äîmade my stomach churn.

A door slammed somewhere above me, and I flinched at the sound. When had I become so jumpy? So afraid? The realization hit me like a physical blow: I didn't recognize myself anymore. The Sophie who had entered this relationship‚Äîconfident, opinionated, quick to laugh‚Äîhad been systematically dismantled, piece by piece.

My anxiety spiked as footsteps echoed down the corridor. I couldn't face anyone right now, not with my eyes puffy from crying and my thoughts scattered like broken glass.

\---

The gentle knock on my door the next morning startled me awake. I'd barely slept, drifting in and out of consciousness, replaying the poker scene over and over.

""Sophie?"" Peter's voice was soft, hesitant. ""I brought coffee.""

I stared at the door, not moving from my bed. Through the crack beneath, I saw a shadow shift, then a thermos appeared, sliding into my room like an offering.

""I don't need your pity,"" I snapped, immediately regretting the harshness in my voice. Peter had done nothing wrong. If anything, he'd been the only one who hadn't laughed when Logan had bet me like a poker chip.

""It's not pity,"" he replied, his voice still gentle. ""It's just coffee. And maybe... friendship. If you want it.""

The simple kindness in his words made my throat tighten. I'd forgotten what it felt like to have someone offer help without expecting anything in return.

""I'm fine,"" I said, less sharply this time.

""I know you are,"" Peter said. I could almost hear his smile through the door. ""You're the strongest person I know, Sophie. Always have been. The coffee's there if you want it. No pressure.""

His footsteps retreated down the hall, and I stared at the thermos for a long moment before finally getting up to retrieve it. The coffee was still hot, with a splash of vanilla‚Äîexactly how I liked it. How did he remember that?

My phone buzzed again, this time with a group chat notification. Hesitantly, I unlocked the screen.

\*Did you guys see Sophie's big breakup last night? Epic!\*

\*Logan literally BETTING her in poker... savage\*

\*Screenshots attached\*

My stomach dropped as I scrolled through the messages. Someone had recorded the whole thing‚ÄîLogan's casual cruelty, my tearful exit. The video was already making rounds.

As I stepped into the hallway, clutching Peter's thermos like a lifeline, whispers followed me like shadows. A group of girls fell silent as I passed, their eyes following me with a mixture of pity and morbid fascination.

""I heard she'd been cheating on him for months,"" one whispered, not quite quietly enough.

I froze, the malicious words hitting me like a physical blow. The lies were already starting. And I knew exactly who would be spinning them.

Chapter 3

I clutched Peter's thermos like a shield as I made my way across campus, the whispers following me like persistent shadows. My phone buzzed again‚ÄîLogan, no doubt, with another message designed to twist the knife. I ignored it, focusing instead on finding Olivia. She'd been one of the few people I'd considered a friend despite Logan's subtle efforts to isolate me, and I needed to know where she stood.

I found her in the library, hunched over her laptop. When she saw me approaching, her eyes widened with a mixture of surprise and something else‚Äîguilt.

""Sophie,"" she said, quickly closing her laptop. ""I didn't expect to see you today.""

""Clearly,"" I replied, sliding into the chair across from her. The library's soft lighting couldn't hide the way she avoided meeting my eyes. ""So, what's he saying about me?""

Olivia fidgeted with her bracelet, a nervous habit I recognized from our study sessions. ""Look, I don't want to get involved‚Äî""

""You already are involved,"" I cut in, my voice sharper than intended. ""Everyone is. There's a video going around, Olivia. People are talking. And I want to know what Logan is telling everyone.""

She sighed, finally meeting my gaze. ""He's saying you've been distant for months. That you overreacted to a joke because you were looking for an excuse to end things."" She hesitated. ""He mentioned that you might be... unstable.""

The word hit me like a slap. Unstable. The same accusation he'd whispered whenever I'd questioned his behavior or stood up for myself. \*You're being unstable, Sophie. Why are you so emotional? No one else would put up with this.\*

""And you believe him?"" I asked quietly.

Olivia's cheeks flushed. ""I didn't know what to think. You two were always so... intense. And Logan can be very convincing when he wants to be.""

""Yes,"" I said, a bitter laugh escaping me. ""He certainly can be.""

""I'm sorry,"" she offered, her apology falling flat in the space between us. ""For what it's worth, after seeing that video... I don't think you overreacted at all.""

Too little, too late. I stood up, suddenly needing to be anywhere but here. ""Thanks for being honest, at least.""

As I walked away, I felt a strange sense of clarity cutting through my pain. Logan was doing exactly what he'd always done‚Äîcontrolling the narrative, isolating me, making me doubt myself. But this time, I could see the pattern with painful clarity.

Back in my dorm room, I finally checked my phone. Six messages from Logan, each more manipulative than the last. The most recent one made my stomach turn:

\*I'm sorry you felt humiliated, Sophie. You know I would never intentionally hurt you. But you've been pushing me away for months. I only ever loved you too much. Please don't throw away two years over one mistake.\*

I read it again, dissecting each carefully crafted sentence. The non-apology. The blame shifting. The rewriting of history. The emotional blackmail.

Two months ago, I would have been typing a tearful response, apologizing for my ""overreaction,"" promising to do better. Two weeks ago, I might have at least believed his version of events.

But now? I could see the gaslight for what it was.

I deleted his messages and blocked his number.

That night, sleep eluded me. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Logan's face, heard his voice, felt the familiar anxiety clawing at my chest. Would I ever be free of him? Of the memories? Of the ways he'd changed me?

At 3 AM, I found myself searching online: ""how to forget someone."" Most results were cheesy self-help articles about time healing all wounds. But then I saw something different: ""Selective Memory Hypnotherapy: A New Approach to Trauma Recovery.""

I clicked the link, finding myself on the website for BrightMind Clinic. They offered an experimental therapy that claimed to help patients selectively dampen traumatic memories without full erasure. ""Retain the lessons without the pain,"" the tagline promised.

It sounded too good to be true. Probably was. But as I stared at the consultation request form, my finger hovered over the submit button.

What would it be like to wake up one day and not feel the weight of Logan's ghost pressing down on me? To be free not just of him, but of the broken version of myself he'd created?

I filled out the form before I could change my mind.

1l70jpo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l70jpo,5 nights in Iraqi Kurdistan (April 2025),"Finally getting around to writing up my experience in Iraqi Kurdistan. I tend to travel off the beaten path and I'm a suckler for history and wine, so naturally going to Kurdistan was appealing for me. For context, I'm a gay white American women that traveled to Kurdistan on my EU passport, but going with my US passport would have been fine.

Itinerary: The trip in total was 5 nights: one night to myself - which I spent in Erbil - and 4 nights with a private tour guide in different parts of Iraqi Kurdistan (3 nights in Soran and 1 night in Duhok). We visited Lalish, Shaqlawa (wine), Aqrah/Akre, Duhok, Shanidar cave, Amedi, and more).

Attire: I generally wear black pants and dark/neutral color t-shirts for my day-to-day so I continued to do so in Kurdistan, and had no issues. I did bring a shawl with me to use whenever going in mosques (obviously not needed for men).

Food: f\*cking phenomenal, literally changed my perspective of kebabs. The meat melted in my mouth and tasted so fresh, and the cuts of tomatoes and onions to go with them were flavorful. We did a traditional Kurdish breakfast in Duhok that I will literally fly back to Kurdistan just to eat again.

Safety: incredibly safe; at no point did I feel like I was in an unsafe location. The only thing that I had to get used to was how many people wanted a photo with me, simply for being a tourist.

Cost: very affordable (to no surprise); approximately $400‚Äì$6.90 USD per meal (kebab + tea).

Cultural norms: unfortunately the norm where men and women/children would eat, pray etc. in different parts of the communal space does exist in most parts of Kurdistan, so that was a bit uncomfortable to get adapted to. I didn't always have to eat on the second floor of restaurants given that foreigner women are treated nearly the same as local men, but if the second floor was an option, then we'd eat there. There are parts of Erbil where this isn't expected though.

Tips:

* Staying in Soran is ideal for day trips around Kurdistan; it's also much closer to the heart of Kurdish culture so the food there was fantastic
* I did the e-Visa and Passport Control only took 5 minutes (including wait time)
* I used AsiaCell and had service in practically all parts of Kurdistan that I went to except parts of the countryside between Duhok and Soran (which you practically only drive through anyway)
* Bring sandals/flip-flops for showers
* Be prepared to go for a few days without coffee; the closer to Kurdish country (Soran), the more prominent tea is
* Dream City neighborhood in Erbil is ideal for women traveling solo; I went to smoke shisha at Tarwika Bakery (highly recommend) and there were multiple women going out with their friends smoking shisha

Will I go back? Absolutely. I'm hoping to go back in September to watch wine get processed but that's TBD; nevertheless, I see myself going back quite a few times as I have many more parts of Kurdistan to explore.

Exactly one year ago this week we hit our ATH of 280M marketcap.
This was done with only +- 6000 Holders.

A lot has happened this last year.
The community has been through so much this last recent year most projects would'nt even excist anymore. But in Kendu we are build different. We more motivated, stonger then ever before.

- We gained over 12000+ holders to a total of 18.500 holders. With a much better distribution, which will help us to hold and go over last years ATH.

- Kendu is now available  3 chains now ETH, SOL and BASE.

- Since January 2025 we are a CTO
( youtube.com/watch?v=Mbj6uC‚Ä¶ )

- We are all the CEO of Kendu, everyone can build under the Kendu umbrella. For example what is already been done: 

- @KenduCoffee 
- @kenduentertain 
- @KenduEnergy 
- @KenduGames 
- @KenduVendingTN 

And there is much more, also much more in the process to build outside of Web3.

Without the community that $kendu has we would be nowhere. This is just the beginning.

We are a multi cycle, multi billion brandcoin at a 22mcap as of right now.

You are still early, we are here to stay, to work, to grow and prove to everyone that it is possible with just relentless work and organic growth.

Hop in the TG if you have any questions or want to see how we operate within Kendu. No raidshield or slash commands. Just work and good vibes.

Today was my twenty-eighth birthday, and tonight, at the gala my parents had arranged, Zach would finally propose. I was certain of it. ""I've dreamed of this moment,"" I whispered to my reflection, trying to perfect the surprised-but-composed expression that would grace the society pages tomorrow. ""And I promise to be the wife you deserve, to support your dreams as you've supported mine."" The last part was a lie, of course. Zach had never supported my dreams‚Äînot my passion for art history, not my desire to curate at the Met someday. But that's what good girlfriends did, right? They molded themselves into whatever shape their partner needed. Snowball padded into the room, his white fur catching the sunlight. I knelt down, burying my face in his warm coat. ""Tonight's the night, Snowball,"" I murmured. ""Everything's going to be perfect."" Hours later, the Carter penthouse gleamed like a diamond. Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across the marble floors while Manhattan's elite mingled beneath them. I stood at the entrance in my champagne silk gown, greeting guests alongside my father. ""You look radiant, sweetheart,"" Dad said, squeezing my hand. ""Like your mother on our engagement night."" My heart fluttered. Even he knew what tonight meant. I scanned the crowd for Zach, finally spotting him by the bar. He was magnificent in his tailored tuxedo, dark hair perfectly styled, that confident half-smile playing on his lips as he charmed a group of investment bankers. Our eyes met briefly across the room, but instead of the warm acknowledgment I expected, he simply nodded and returned to his conversation. A chill ran through me. I pushed it away. He was just nervous. Of course he was nervous. ""Vivian!"" Heather appeared, resplendent in emerald green that complemented her auburn hair. She hugged me tightly. ""Happy birthday, bestie. Tonight's going to be unforgettable."" If only I'd known how prophetic those words would be. As the evening progressed, Zach remained distant, circulating through the crowd but somehow never quite making it to my side. Whenever I approached, he'd suddenly be needed elsewhere. I watched him check his reflection in a decorative mirror, adjusting his already perfect tie, before turning to charm the wife of a prominent senator. ""He's just working the room,"" I told myself, smoothing my dress for the dozenth time. ""Building connections for our future."" By the time we gathered in the grand ballroom for toasts, my smile felt brittle. The diamond ring I'd imagined on my finger remained a fantasy, and the champagne I'd been sipping had soured in my stomach. My father had just finished his birthday tribute when Heather suddenly stood, tears streaming down her face. The room fell silent. ""I'm sorry,"" she sobbed, mascara tracking down her cheeks. ""I didn't want to do this tonight, but I can't keep pretending. She placed a protective hand over her stomach. ""I'm pregnant,"" she announced, her voice breaking. ""With Zach's child.""

The crystal flute slipped from my fingers, shattering on the marble floor. The sound barely registered as blood rushed in my ears, drowning out the collective gasp of two hundred guests.

Zach didn't deny it. He didn't even look ashamed. He stood there, expressionless, as my world collapsed.

Later, in my private suite where I'd fled to escape the whispers and pitying glances, the door opened without a knock. Zach entered, his face a mask of cold calculation.

""This is unfortunate timing,"" he said, as if discussing a minor scheduling conflict. ""But we need to manage this situation.""

I stared at him, unable to comprehend the stranger before me.

""You'll need to help Heather through this pregnancy,"" he continued, checking his watch. ""Both our families have too much at stake to let this become a public scandal. You understand, don't you, Vivian? You've always been so good at... managing things.

His words fell like ice into the hollow of my chest where my heart had been just hours before. And in that frozen moment, something inside me‚Äîsomething that had bent and yielded for years‚Äîfinally, irrevocably broke.

Chapter 2

I stared at Zach, his cold calculation finally revealing the stranger I'd been loving all these years. The hollowness in my chest gave way to something else‚Äîsomething hot and unfamiliar. Rage.

""Get out,"" I whispered, my voice steadier than I'd expected.

""Don't be dramatic, Vivian."" He adjusted his cufflinks, barely looking at me. ""We need to handle this rationally.""

""I said get out!"" I grabbed the nearest object‚Äîa crystal paperweight my father had given me‚Äîand hurled it at the wall beside him. It shattered spectacularly, tiny fragments catching the light like diamonds. Like the engagement ring I'd never receive.

Zach's eyes widened, his composure finally cracking. ""You're hysterical. This isn't like you.""

""You have no idea who I am,"" I realized, the truth of it washing over me like a wave. ""And neither did I, until tonight.""

I moved toward the door, holding it open. ""Leave. Now. We're done.""

When he finally left, I collapsed against the door, Snowball pressing his warm body against my legs. My hands trembled as I pulled out my phone, scrolling past dozens of concerned messages until I found the name I needed.

Michael.

He answered on the first ring. ""Viv? Are you okay? I just heard‚Äî""

""Can you come over?"" My voice broke. ""Please?""

""I'm already on my way.""

Thirty minutes later, Michael sat beside me on the balcony of my suite, the city lights glittering below us like a universe of distant stars. He hadn't asked questions, hadn't offered platitudes. He'd simply brought coffee (real coffee, not the pretentious blends Zach insisted on), and his steady, comforting presence.

""I've ended things with Zach,"" I said finally, watching steam curl from my mug. ""And Heather... God, all these years...""

""I'm so sorry, Viv."" His voice was gentle, but there was steel beneath it. ""What they did was unforgivable.""

I looked at him then‚Äîreally looked at him. Michael Bennett had been in my life forever, a constant I'd somehow never fully seen. His kind eyes, the slight worry line between his brows, the way he leaned toward me slightly, attentive but never invasive.

""Why did you come tonight?"" I asked suddenly.

He looked surprised. ""Because you called.""

""That's it? Just because I called?""

""That's all it's ever taken, Viv."" He said it so simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.

Something shifted inside me then, a tectonic plate realigning after years of pressure. I thought of all the times Michael had been there, steady and unwavering, while I'd been blinded by Zach's flashier charm. I thought of the person I'd become with Zach‚Äîsmaller, dimmer, always accommodating‚Äîand how different I felt in Michael's presence.

""Marry me,"" I said.

Michael's coffee sloshed over the rim of his cup. ""What?""

""Marry me,"" I repeated, the words feeling right, powerful. ""Not tomorrow or next week. But someday. When we're ready.""

His expression shifted from shock to something else‚Äîwonder, maybe. ""Vivian, you've had a terrible night. You don't have to‚Äî""

""I'm not proposing because I'm hurt or desperate,"" I interrupted, surprising myself with my certainty. ""I'm proposing because tonight, for the first time in years, I'm seeing clearly. And what I see is you, Michael. It's always been you.""

He set his coffee down carefully, then took my hands in his. ""Are you sure?""

""I've never been more sure of anything.""

His smile began slowly, then bloomed across his face like sunrise. ""Then yes, Vivian Carter. When we're ready, I would be honored to marry you.""

The next morning, Michael invited me to his architectural studio in Chelsea‚Äîa converted warehouse space filled with light and innovative designs. It was nothing like the sleek, soulless office where Zach conducted his business dealings.

""This is where the magic happens,"" Michael said, showing me blueprints for sustainable community centers and affordable housing projects. His passion was palpable, infectious.

""These are amazing,"" I said, genuinely impressed. ""Why have I never been here before?""

His expression softened. ""You never asked.""

Another revelation, another piece of myself reclaimed. I'd stopped asking for things I wanted long ago, trained to prioritize Zach's world instead.

""Well, I'm asking now,"" I said, taking his hand. ""Show me everything.""

But as Michael guided me through his creative sanctuary, my phone buzzed with notifications. A society columnist had published a scathing piece about my ""public meltdown"" and ""erratic behavior"" following the gala.

The byline made my blood freeze. The columnist was a longtime friend of the Evans family‚Äîand Zach's revenge was just beginning.

Chapter 3

The morning after my world collapsed, a knock at my door jolted me from a fitful sleep. Snowball lifted his head from where he'd curled against me all night, a warm, steady presence when everything else had shattered.

""Who is it?"" I called, my voice still raw from crying.

""It's me, Vivian. Please, I need to talk to you.""

Heather. My stomach clenched at the sound of her voice‚Äîonce so familiar, now poisonous. I considered ignoring her, but something fierce and unfamiliar pushed me to face her. This new Vivian wouldn't hide.

""Give me a minute,"" I said, quickly splashing water on my face and pulling on a robe.

When I opened the door, Heather stood there looking nothing like the confident betrayer from last night. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her normally perfect makeup absent. She'd clearly crafted this appearance of vulnerability.

""Can I come in?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

""No."" The firmness in my tone surprised us both.

Her eyes widened. ""Viv, please. I need to explain‚Äî""

""Explain what? How you slept with my boyfriend? How you announced your pregnancy at my birthday party? Please, enlighten me.""

She flinched, tears welling. ""It wasn't supposed to happen like that. Zach... he manipulated me too. He said he was going to leave you, that he loved me‚Äî""

""Stop."" I held up my hand. ""I don't believe you, and I don't care. We're done, Heather.""

Snowball appeared at my feet, growling softly. Even he could sense the threat she posed.

""You don't understand,"" she continued desperately. ""Zach is the one who insisted I announce it that way. He wanted to hurt you, to control how everything happened. I'm just as much a victim‚Äî""

""A victim?"" I laughed, the sound harsh even to my own ears. ""You were my best friend for fifteen years. You knew everything about me‚Äîmy fears, my hopes, the way I've loved him. And you chose to betray me in the cruelest way possible. That wasn't Zach's doing. That was you.""

Her expression changed then, the mask of regret slipping to reveal something harder, colder. ""You always had everything, Vivian. The perfect family, the perfect life. You never had to work for anything.""

""You don't know the first thing about my life or what I've worked for,"" I said quietly. ""Now please leave.""

As I moved to close the door, she put her hand against it. ""You'll regret this,"" she hissed, all pretense gone. ""You think you can just cut us out? Zach has connections you couldn't imagine. And so do I.""

""Is that a threat?""

""It's a promise. You'll learn what it feels like to lose everything you love.""

I slammed the door in her face, my heart pounding. Snowball whined softly, and I knelt to stroke his soft fur. ""It's okay, boy. We'll be okay.""

Three days later, I returned home late after dinner with Michael. He'd been my rock, helping me navigate the social fallout, accompanying me to cancel the reservations and arrangements I'd made for what I'd thought would be an engagement celebration.

The hallway to my apartment was eerily quiet. I fumbled with my keys, a sense of unease creeping up my spine.

When I opened the door, the silence hit me first. No excited barking, no pattering of paws.

""Snowball?"" I called, flipping on the lights.

Then I saw him‚Äîa small white heap on the doormat, barely moving. Beside him lay a note, the elegant script unmistakable: ""Now you know how it feels to have something precious taken from you. ‚ÄîH""

""No!"" I dropped to my knees, gathering Snowball's limp body. He whimpered faintly, his beautiful white fur stained with blood. ""No, no, no!""

My hands shaking violently, I called Michael.

""He's hurt,"" I sobbed into the phone. ""Snowball's hurt. They did something to him. Please help me.""

Michael arrived in what seemed like seconds, his face grim as he gently took Snowball from my arms and rushed us to his car. ""The emergency vet is ten minutes away,"" he said, his voice steady despite the fear in his eyes. ""Hold on, buddy. Just hold on.""

I cradled Snowball in the backseat, whispering promises I wasn't sure I could keep. ""You'll be okay. We'll fix this. I love you so much.""

But in the sterile brightness of the emergency clinic, with Michael's arm around my shoulders and the vet's solemn expression, I knew. Snowball's breathing grew more labored, his small body shuddering with each breath.

""I'm so sorry,"" the vet said quietly. ""The poison has spread too far. We can make him comfortable, but...""

""No,"" I whispered, the word breaking. ""Please, there must be something‚Äî""

Michael tightened his grip on my shoulder. ""Viv...""

They let me hold him in those final moments. My sweet, loyal Snowball, who had been there through every heartbreak, every joy. His eyes, cloudy with pain, found mine one last time.

""I love you,"" I whispered as he took his final breath in my arms. ""I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you.""

As his small body went still, something inside me hardened into resolve. This wasn't just betrayal anymore. This was war.

They felt delightful against the sheets.  She realised should she want to, she could sleep en femme every night. Nothing was stopping her, but maybe she should sleep in something a little more comfortable and a little less tight.  

She could feel a tingling sensation in her behind from the use it had endured the evening prior and her jaw and throat had delicious ache from the face fucking Simon had given her.

Her clitty remained locked in the pink chastity cage she had encased it in the day before as the key had never made it off the mantelpiece.  Clearly the thought to unlock her hadn‚Äôt even crossed Simon‚Äôs mind during his visit.  He had clearly enjoyed using her as a sissy fuck doll and had no need for her boy parts whatsoever.

She climbed out of bed, she wrapped herself in a boring towelling dressing gown and made herself a coffee.

After spending so much time having fun yesterday, today needed to be a chore day but could she make the chores less dull?

As she had to leave the flat she decided to transition back into Dan, whilst there was nothing stopping her going out as Mia now that she lived alone she just wasn‚Äôt quite ready for that!  Nor did she have the wardrobe quite frankly.
Stripping off the lingerie and taking a good long shower to wash off the remaining evidence of the fun the day before she got dressed in drab, had a quick late breakfast and headed out the door.

He needed to do a small food shop, so she decided to head the Tesco Extra at the local shopping centre just half a mile down the road, maybe she‚Äôd have look round and see if there were any shops worth visiting.  
Dan was pretty disappointed with the shops as a whole, it was the usual parade of mobile phone places, fast food outlets and charity shops.  
There was, however, a barber.  As his hair was starting to get a little unkept he decided to pop in and get a trim.  He walked in and suddenly felt rather old as there were a half a dozen regulars using the place as a social club. It was a sea of black Nike tracksuits and The North Face puffa jackets. The Barber was a young guy, mixed race and, Dan couldn‚Äôt help noticing, rather handsome! He waved Dan into the chair and got his hair neat and tidy in double quick time with relatively little in the way of awkward barbershop chat. Dan had plenty on his mind given recent events so not having to engage was a blessing. Dan figured his contributions to the barbershop discourse were probably not missed amongst all the banter between the regulars.
Dan paid the Barber and gave him a small tip.
‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù exclaimed the Barber ‚Äútell your friends!‚Äù

Feeling significantly neater, Dan headed into large Tesco and couldn‚Äôt help being drawn to ladies clothing section. Finding himself in the lingerie aisle he remembered his thought about something more femme to sleep in.  Supermarket prices were certainly attractive so Dan selected a satin Cami and Knickers set in pink with white lace trim, a set of black satin pajamas. a light green satin nightdress and a purple Kimono.  He had never bought women‚Äôs lingerie for himself in person before and was nervous for some reason, would people look at him and KNOW?

Dan remembered that he had bought lingerie for his wife for birthdays and valentines, but he was sure her lovers got the benefit of his purchases far more than he did.  When he did their laundry he would regularly find the Agent Provocateur and La Perla lingerie he had purchased for her in the basket with interesting stains in unusual places. Almost like she had been showered in cum from above and multiple times, all while he was at home locked in chastity.

After rushing round the rest of the shop gathering the food for the work week to come, he was at the self check out. Scanning the sleepwear first he noticed the light at the top of the check out went amber and after scanning the rest of his shop. He got the dreaded ‚Äúwait for assistance‚Äù message. The young female shop assistant quickly arrived and started tapping at the display.
‚ÄúOh, we just need to check your clothing items for tags‚Äù she explained.
Dan proffered the bag with his purchases, the assistant took them out, found the tags, removed them and popped them back in the bag. 
‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs a lucky girl!‚Äù she giggled
‚ÄúYes, I am, I mean she is‚Äù Dan stammered going bright red and wishing the ground would open up.
‚ÄúWell enjoy!‚Äù The assistant said with a wink.

Dan could not get out of their quick enough!

Once he got back to the flat and the embarrassment of the assistant interaction had faded slightly, Dan settled down on the sofa with a glass of wine to watch the football. He really hoped that his wife didn‚Äôt notice the new login for the Sky sports app.

At half time he mindlessly logged into his favourite personals/hook up sites to catch up on messages and see if there were any new pictures from his friends.
There was a message from Simon:
>Great fun yesterday babe! We‚Äôll have to do it again soon!

‚ÄúYes, we bloody well will!‚Äù Dan thought.

Dan was about to log off when one last message popped into his inbox from a user calling himself BigBear69:

>Hey Babe, looking for some fun tonight?

Dan checked the profile, no photos - not a great sign. He checked the location:
:Within 1 mile:

‚ÄúIntriguing‚Ä¶‚Äù Dan thought so shot him back a quick message:

>Maybe, do you have any pics?

Almost immediately a response from BigBear69:

‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù There were 2 pics attached. A brown naked torso, not slim but not fat. And a very nice looking cock. 

Dan looked at the cock pic and estimated it must be at least eight and a half inches. 
His mouth watered.

Dan quickly sent a message.
> Fancy getting that lovely cock sucked?

BigBear69
> Yeah, when and where?

Dan
>LE3 6NW, 30mins, message when you get here

BigBear69
>Sound

‚ÄúWell this is becoming a bit of a fucking habit!‚Äù  Dan said to himself.

Dan had to quickly transform himself into Mia so he quickly hopped in the shower, washed himself with some floral scented body wash and quickly got himself dry.  He got himself ready in almost record time. 
Wriggled back into the breast plate, choker, Pink Ann Summers bra and thong set, white hold up stockings, and ‚ÄúCollege girl‚Äù set consisting a very short pink and black plaid pleated skirt and matching tie front top. She pulled on some pink heels to complete the outfit.

Make up was hastily applied and it was all topped off with Blonde wig and spritz of perfume.  

Back to being Mia‚Ä¶

Mia barely had a time to finish off the glass of wine before she heard her phone ping with a message.

BigBear69
> Here

Mia copied and pasted the instructions from Simon‚Äôs visit into the message field and hit send.

Her stomach was full of butterflies.  With Simon they had met on cam before meeting in person. But this was an entirely new experience, meeting a sexual partner for the first time without even knowing their face!

BUZZ

‚ÄúWell here we go‚Äù she thought to herself.

‚ÄúHi, come on up‚Äù she answered hitting the Open button on the buzzer to let them in.

Again, footsteps on stairs and the knock at the door.

Mia let in a young man clad in a Nike track suit and expensive looking trainers.
‚ÄúHi Sweetie‚Äù Mia cooed
Mia immediately recognised him as one of the regulars in the barbershop. 
The young man took one look at her and without saying a word pulled his tracksuit trousers and boxers down to just below his arse cheeks exposing his rather impressive cock.
Mia dropped to her knees instinctively.  She could tell he was here for one reason and it wasn‚Äôt for a chat.
She gave the young man a really sloppy BJ, alternating between working the shaft, teasing the head, deep throating the impressive length and sucking his balls.

She could tell he was getting close by his breathing, she concentrated on the head. With grunt the young man‚Äôs cock spewed 4 long sticky wads of cum all over Mia‚Äôs face.  Without being prompted she scraped the cum into her mouth and swallowed the lot.

‚ÄúThanks, yeah‚Äù the young man grunted

‚ÄúNo problem sweetie‚Äù Mia replied ‚ÄúTell your friends!‚Äù

‚ÄúErrrr yeah‚Äù the young man said somewhat confused as he headed out the door.

Mia slumped on sofa and watched a bit more football but to be honest she wasn‚Äôt really taking it in, she was feeling just soooo slutty. 

BUZZ

Mia leapt out of her skin.
She nervously answered the Intercom ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù 
The voice at the other end of the intercom replied ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs BigBear, any chance of another BJ?‚Äù
Mia was slightly taken aback but could knock the young man‚Äôs stamina nor confidence!
‚ÄúSure, come on up‚Äù she said and Buzzed him in, opened the door to the flat and dutifully got on her knees.

In walked not one young man but four. All from the barbershop.
Mia‚Äôs jaw dropped, she must have looked shocked.
‚ÄúYou said to tell my friends, right?‚Äù The young man asked
‚ÄúYes, I did‚Ä¶‚Äù Mia chuckled nervously

‚ÄúWhat have I got myself into now?‚Äù Mia thought to herself ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt ask them to leave without you know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon then boys‚Äù she giggled ‚Äúdrop those drawers‚Äù
Almost instantaneously the three newcomers dropped there trousers round their ankles showing Mia three young hard cocks. 
BigBear said ‚ÄúGet to work on those babe‚Äù and sat down on the sofa and watched the football. 
Mia went to work on the three cocks, one in each hand and one her mouth at all times. She couldn‚Äôt do her best work but the boys didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all!
Their hands were all over her, feeling up her big false tits and one lifted her skirt and started rubbing her comparatively small cock through her panties. 
‚ÄúI want all three of you to cum over my face and tits‚Äù Mia demanded between mouthfuls of cock. 
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a right slag this one‚Äù said one of the men
‚ÄúYeah, where the fuck did you find her?‚Äù Another enquired.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna know‚Äù laughed BigBear.
Mia switched between cocks making sure each one got a fair share of time in her warm wet mouth, making sure to deep throat each one before moving on to the next.  
Mia could feel the cock in her mouth start to twitch so she opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue.
The first cummer wanked furiously and groaned as he let go of 3 large ropes of cum over Mia‚Äôs face. The cum stung her eyes.
She started sucking again, bobbing between the two remaining cocks and soon another was ready to blow his load.
‚ÄúOn my tits babe‚Äù Mia pleaded
The second man came like a firehose of thinner but much more copious spunk.  He left his sticky mark all over her top, up her chest and on to her neck and face.
The lad who had so far managed to hold on to his cum grasped Mia‚Äôs head and proceed to give her a rough face fucking making her gag and drool.  When it was finally time for the young stud to cum he pushed his cock even farther down her throat and directly deposited his cum into her throat. Mia coughed and gagged a little.  The men all laughed.
‚ÄúShe was a proper whore this one‚Äù the final cummer commented ‚ÄúI reckon she needs a shower.‚Äù The men all laughed. 
Two of the men helped her to her feet and guided her to the bathroom.
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is happening?‚ÄùMia thought to herself.
‚ÄúKneel in there‚Äù one of the men ordered pointing to the shower cubicle.
‚ÄúOh fuck‚Äù Mia thought but duly acquiesced.
The two men took out their now flaccid cocks and uncorked 2 streams of piss on to Mia, she opened her mouth and piss filled her open maw. She swallowed the piss down.  The men laughed.
BigBear and the final cummer came in and repeated the abuse and rubbed their cocks on her face making sure her make up was totally ruined. 
BigBear took out his phone and snapped a pic. ‚ÄúLooking good hun‚Äù he laughed. 

And with that the men tucked themselves away and left the flat slamming the door behind them. Mia could hear them laughing as they walked down the stairs from her position in shower.

She turned on the shower and rinsed off the piss and cum from her clothes, wig and body with the warming water.

She couldn‚Äôt quite believe what had just happened. She felt that even though she should feel defiled and depraved she actually felt empowered. She loved the fact she had managed to make 5 guys happy and sexually satisfied in a weekend. 

She even enjoyed the final degradation the Barbershop quartet rained down upon her, why had she opened her mouth to capture the men‚Äôs piss? Why did her stomach now contain the cum of 5 men and the piss of 4?

She realised this was her life now, men saw her as weak and a toy to be used and abused, all she could do was hang on and enjoy the ride.

After her shower, Mia slipped into the new Cami and Knickers and wrapped herself in the new Kimono.

She knew she would sleep well tonight on her new lingerie, it had been quite a day!  In fact it had been quite a weekend!

1l70ag5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l70ag5/my_sleep_app_says_i_walk_miles_every_night_but_i/,My sleep app says I walk miles every night. But I never leave my apartment.,"I'm a wreck, i'm sitting here in full mental breakdown, am i going crazy?  
A few weeks ago, I started using a sleep tracking app because I kept waking up exhausted. Not just groggy‚Äî*drained*. My muscles ached. My head was foggy. I‚Äôd check the clock expecting 3 a.m. and see 7:30 instead.

My girlfriend, Alina, said maybe I wasn‚Äôt sleeping at all. Maybe I was dreaming all night and didn‚Äôt notice. I joked maybe I was sleepwalking, but she gave me that look‚Äîthe one where she‚Äôs not quite joking. We‚Äôve been together three years. She knows my habits. She sleeps like a rock. Me? Lately I felt like I was wearing someone else‚Äôs skin by morning.

The app I downloaded uses movement and location tracking. It logs breathing patterns and walking distances too. Sounded high-tech enough to help me debunk whatever nonsense I was telling myself.

First night, I woke up to a ping:  
**‚ÄúDistance walked: 8.3 miles.‚Äù**

That had to be wrong. I work from home. I didn‚Äôt go anywhere that day. I live in a one-bedroom apartment and barely get 5,000 steps total. I showed Alina and laughed. Probably a glitch.

She just said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even have running shoes.‚Äù...Yes... I don‚Äôt walk. I don‚Äôt run. I‚Äôm a bit obese, and the idea of walking for miles? It‚Äôs really not me.

I checked the path it logged. It showed a loose loop‚Äîblocks and alleys near our building. Nothing consistent. The timestamp showed the walk occurred between 3:13 a.m. and 4:05 a.m.

The door was locked. Deadbolt and chain still in place.  
Okay, I figured. App‚Äôs full of bugs, its still in beta, i reported it as glitch.

Second night: **6.1 miles.**  
Third night: **9.7.**

I kept checking everything in the morning‚Äîfront door, windows, the floor. No dirt, no footprints, no signs I left. But my legs still *felt* like I had. You know that faint soreness after a long walk? That weird, almost pleasant burn in your calves?

It started showing up every day.

On night four, I taped the front door shut with masking tape, just to be sure. Not because I was scared. I just wanted proof it was fake.

Next morning: **9.4 miles.**  
Tape? Untouched. Door? Still locked. Phone? Still on the charger by the bed.

I was actually *relieved.* Glitch confirmed.

But then I checked the route.

Unlike the others, this one didn‚Äôt loop. It spiraled‚Äîstarting from our apartment and drifting further outward. It passed the old subway station, then an abandoned factory we‚Äôd driven past once. The final stop was near the edge of the city: a fenced-off housing complex called Ridgeview.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until that night, when I went to plug in my phone and found it already off the charger, screen-down under the kitchen table. I *always* leave it on my nightstand. I thought - Okay, maybe I bumped it during the night.

Alina was staying at her sister‚Äôs that night. Some family thing. I decided to set up my webcam facing the bed. Old, low-res thing, but it worked.

Next morning, I felt like hell. Worse than usual.

I checked the footage.

Normal until 3:12 a.m., when I suddenly *sat up*. Not a slow rise‚Äîa *snap*. Like someone yanked me upward with strings. My face was turned from the camera, but I stood up, walked off-screen‚Ä¶ then the footage cut to static for 53 minutes.

Came back at 4:07. I was back in bed, same spot, dead still.

App reading?  
**‚Äú0.0 miles walked.‚Äù**  
**‚ÄúNo movement recorded.‚Äù**

I called Alina. I didn‚Äôt want to upset her‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt even sure what was happening. I just said something weird was going on. Kept it vague.

She joked I was probably sleep-dancing. But when I asked if she ever noticed me getting up in the night, she got quiet. Then said:

‚ÄúA few times‚Ä¶ I thought you were in the kitchen. But when I got up to check, the lights were off. I figured I dreamt it.‚Äù

I went back and looked at the previous night‚Äôs path again. The spiral‚Äôs final stop? That Ridgeview complex.

I pulled it up on Google Maps.

It was abandoned. Condemned three years ago after a gas explosion. No one had lived there since.

Except‚Ä¶ street view showed a unit on the fifth floor with a balcony identical to mine. Same railing. Same satellite dish. Same grill I bought on sale two summers ago.

I drove out there.

The building was surrounded by fencing and warning tape. The front doors were boarded, but the side entrance was open. I thought - Vandals had gotten there first.

Inside smelled like rot and mold. But I knew which stairwell to take. Knew which unit to go to. I didn‚Äôt even check the numbers. I just *knew*.

The door was unlocked.

Inside: a one-bedroom apartment. Same layout. Same brown couch. Same off-white rug with the coffee stain. And on the nightstand? My phone.

Not a phone‚Äîmy phone! Same crack on the bottom left corner. I pulled mine out of my pocket to double-check.

Now I had two.

That‚Äôs when I heard the shower turn off.

I bolted.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Didn‚Äôt even go home. I sat in a 24/7 diner watching the sky turn gray, confused. Am I going insane? Was this real? Did I imagine it? Is this just all my paranoia?  
At 7:03 a.m., I finally got a text from Alina:

‚ÄúHey, you okay? Just got up. Everything good?‚Äù

I replied instantly:  
‚ÄúYeah. Just couldn‚Äôt sleep. Coming home soon.‚Äù  
\- i dont wan't her to think i lost it....

A few minutes passed.

Then she texted again:‚ÄúWait... how are you texting me?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYour phone‚Äôs sitting on the kitchen counter.‚Äù

I‚Äôm still at the diner. Maybe she‚Äôs messing with me? Maybe I misunderstood?  
Maybe I‚Äôm just really tired.

But my sleep app just sent a new notification.

The idea is to build a device that can:

* Detect bats (and ideally species-level differences)
* Count activity over time
* Possibly estimate direction of travel
* Transmit the data over LoRaWAN for remote ecological monitoring

This is aimed at helping with pre-, during-, and post-construction biodiversity surveys, as well as woodland monitoring and science.

The event is taking place at **East Essex Hackspace**, a volunteer-run maker space in the southeast of England. We'll have teams working on:

* Hardware and sensor design
* Embedded firmware (likely ESP32)
* LoRaWAN integration (using The Things Network)
* Data pipelines, APIs, and visualisation
* Ecology and detection algorithms

We‚Äôll have tools, test equipment, a fibre laser for board prototyping, and plenty of tea/coffee & biscuits. Shuttle to the nearest train station and lunch included.

We‚Äôre aiming to open source everything we develop ‚Äì hardware, firmware, and software ‚Äì so even if you‚Äôre not in the UK, you‚Äôll be able to build, adapt, or contribute to the project from afar.

If you're in the UK and into environmental tech, LoRaWAN, or just want to collaborate on something that could make a difference, **come join us**!  
If you're outside the UK and interested, we'd love your ideas, experience, or even remote collaboration.

I stared at the pregnancy test, my heart hammering against my ribs as I waited for the result to appear. One line. Just one. I exhaled, a mixture of relief and disappointment washing over me. Not pregnant. The bathroom light cast harsh shadows across my face in the mirror. I'd been so sure‚Äîthe nausea, the fatigue, my period two weeks late. But the single pink line was definitive. It's for the best,"" I whispered to my reflection, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Jason and I had talked about children, of course. Three years together and an engagement on the horizon meant we'd discussed our future thoroughly. But we'd agreed: marriage first, then babies. Still, I couldn't help but imagine his face lighting up at the news. Jason loved surprises. I pulled out my phone and typed: \*Got big news. Dinner tonight? I'll cook your favorite.

Three dots appeared immediately, then: \*Can't wait, babe. Love you.\*

My apartment felt unusually quiet as I settled onto the couch with my laptop. I'd take the afternoon off to prepare a special dinner‚ÄîJason's favorite pasta carbonara, a bottle of wine (that I wouldn't be drinking, to keep up the pregnancy suspense), and maybe those chocolate souffl√©s he loved.

I opened Instagram, mindlessly scrolling while planning the evening. A notification popped up  tagged  in a photo.\*

Jason wasn't in Maui. He was at a marketing conference in Portland. At least, that's what he'd told me three days ago.

My finger hovered over the notification, a cold sensation spreading through my chest. I tapped it.

The image loaded: Jason on a white-sand beach, sunglasses perched on his head, arm wrapped around a slender woman with caramel highlights and a bikini that probably cost more than my monthly rent. His assistant, Chloe Miller.

The caption read: \*Day 2 in paradise with this one! #couplegoals #nofilterneeded\*

I couldn't breathe. My thumb moved mechanically, scrolling through more photos. Jason and Chloe toasting with tropical drinks. Chloe kissing his cheek at sunset. The two of them tangled together in a hammock.

All posted within the last 48 hours. All tagged. All public.

My phone slipped from my trembling fingers. Three years. Three years of building a life together, of supporting his career moves, of planning our future. And he was in Maui, with his assistant, broadcasting their affair to the world. To our friends. To my family.

Had he forgotten I followed him? Did he think I wouldn't see? Or worse‚Äîdid he simply not care?

I grabbed my laptop, opened FaceTime, and called him. Each ring felt like an eternity.

When his face appeared on screen, tan and slightly flushed, I could see palm trees swaying behind him. He wasn't even trying to hide it.

""Ava, hey‚Äî"" His voice was casual, as if this were any other day.

""You're in Maui."" My voice sounded strange, hollow.

His expression shifted, realization dawning. ""I can explain‚Äî""

""With Chloe."" I couldn't stop the tears now. ""Everyone can see, Jason. Everyone.""

""It was a mistake, okay? It just happened. You and I‚Äîwe've been so predictable lately. So... boring."" He ran a hand through his hair. ""But it doesn't mean anything. I love you, Ava. When I get back‚Äî""

""When you get back, your things will be in boxes."" The clarity of my decision surprised me. ""We're done.""

""Don't be dramatic. This is just a bump‚Äî""

I slammed the laptop shut, cutting off his excuses. My hands were shaking so badly I could hardly see through my tears. Three years, and I was ""boring."" Three years, and he could betray me so casually, so publicly.

That night, I couldn't bear the silence of my apartment. Every corner held memories of Jason‚Äîhis favorite coffee mug, the throw blanket we'd picked out together, the framed photo of us in Olympic National Park.

I grabbed my purse and headed to The Westin downtown. I just needed noise, people, and maybe a drink strong enough to numb the humiliation burning through me.

At the hotel bar, I made my way to the whiskey station, desperate for something that would burn away the image of Jason and Chloe on that beach. As I reached for a glass, my hand collided with someone else's.

""Sorry,"" I mumbled, glancing up.

Dark eyes met mine‚Äîintense, curious, and somehow understanding. The man was tall, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit that screamed money and influence.

""Looks like we both need the good stuff tonight,"" he said, his voice deep and smooth.

I didn't know then that he was Finn Shepard, billionaire CEO and the man who would turn my world upside down for the second time in one day. I just knew that when he smiled and offered to buy me a drink, the crushing weight on my chest lifted just enough to let me breathe again.

Chapter 2

Morning light filtered through unfamiliar curtains, rousing me from a dreamless sleep. My head throbbed, punishment for last night's whiskey and poor decisions. Fragments of memory drifted back‚Äîthe hotel bar, those intense dark eyes, strong hands, and a suite with a view of the Seattle skyline. Finn. That was his name.

I groaned, burying my face in the pillow. What had I done? One minute I was drowning in the humiliation of Jason's betrayal, the next I was falling into bed with a stranger whose last name I couldn't even remember.

My phone buzzed incessantly on the nightstand. I reached for it, squinting at the screen. Twenty-seven notifications? At 7 AM?

The first message was from Quinn: \*CALL ME RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU SEEING THIS?\*

Attached was a link to a tabloid website. My stomach dropped as I clicked it open.

\*BILLIONAIRE BACHELOR FINN SHEPARD'S MYSTERY REDHEAD: WHO IS SHE?\*

Beneath the headline was a grainy photo that made my blood run cold. Me, wrapped in nothing but a sheet, curled against Finn's bare chest as he slept. The photo was taken through a window‚Äîsome paparazzo with a telephoto lens had caught us.

My phone continued buzzing. More messages, more links. The story was everywhere.

\*Billionaire CEO Finn Shepard launches #FindHer campaign after one-night stand\*

\*Shepard Industries stock jumps as CEO's love life goes viral\*

\*WHO IS SHE? Finn Shepard offers reward for identity of mystery woman\*

I scrolled through Twitter in horror. #FindHer was trending nationwide. Finn's PR team had turned our one-night stand into a viral sensation‚Äîa modern-day Cinderella story, complete with the prince searching for his mystery woman.

Except I hadn't left a glass slipper. According to one article, I'd left a broken watch, an old friendship bracelet, and $100 cash. I vaguely remembered placing the money on the dresser before slipping out at dawn, thinking it would somehow make me feel less... used. Now it made me look like either a thief or an escort.

My phone rang. Quinn. I couldn't talk now‚Äîcouldn't form words through the panic closing my throat. I silenced it and stumbled to the shower, as if hot water could wash away this nightmare.

\---

The office was buzzing when I arrived. I'd considered calling in sick, but hiding would only make things worse. I needed normalcy, needed to pretend my life wasn't imploding in real-time on social media.

""Did you see that #FindHer thing?"" someone whispered as I passed the break room.

""I heard he's offering fifty thousand dollars to anyone who can identify her.""

I ducked my head, clutching my coffee like a shield. No one knew it was me in those photos‚Äîthe images were grainy, my face mostly hidden against Finn's chest. But how long before someone recognized me?

""Look at this!"" Melissa from accounting exclaimed, holding up her phone to show a small crowd gathered around her desk. ""They're saying she's either a high-end escort or a corporate spy trying to get inside information on Shepard Industries.""

I froze behind a nearby cubicle, my heart hammering so loudly I was certain everyone could hear it.

""Personally,"" Melissa continued, ""I think she's just some gold-digger who thought she hit the jackpot. I mean, look at this tabloid cover‚Äî'WHO WILL CLAIM THE BILLIONAIRE?'‚Äîlike he's some prize to be won.""

The office swam before my eyes. I was the gold-digger. I was the spy, the escort, the opportunist. Every cruel theory was about me‚Äîthe woman who'd just had her heart shattered and made one impulsive decision.

I retreated to my desk, hands shaking as I pretended to work. How had this happened? One moment of weakness, and now I was the subject of a nationwide manhunt.

\---

""Open up! I've got reinforcements!""

Quinn's voice echoed through my apartment door that evening. When I opened it, she stood there with two bags of takeout, a bottle of prosecco, and fierce determination in her eyes.

""You look like hell,"" she announced, pushing past me into the kitchen. ""But we're going to fix this.""

""There's no fixing this,"" I mumbled, collapsing onto a barstool. ""Have you seen what they're saying about me? About the 'mystery woman'?""

Quinn uncorked the prosecco with a decisive pop. ""Yes, and it's all garbage. But we need a plan. Your parents called me, by the way. They saw the news and want to know if you've 'heard about that poor girl.'""

Despite everything, I laughed‚Äîa strangled, desperate sound. ""What did you tell them?""

""That I'm sure she's a perfectly nice woman who deserved privacy."" Quinn handed me a glass of bubbling courage. ""Now, we need to draft a statement for when they inevitably find out it's their daughter.""

""They'll be so disappointed.""

""Stop."" Quinn gripped my shoulders. ""You are not the villain here. Jason cheated on you publicly, humiliated you, and you had one night with an admittedly hot billionaire. You're allowed to be human, Ava.""

Tears spilled down my cheeks. ""What happens when Finn finds out who I am?""

Quinn's expression softened. ""I don't know. But whatever happens, you'll face it with dignity‚Äîand with me beside you.""

I nodded, clinging to her certainty when I had none of my own. But as we drafted careful explanations for my parents, I couldn't shake the dread building inside me. Sooner or later, Finn Shepard would discover my identity. And when he did, what would he want from the woman who'd fled his bed at dawn?

Chapter 3

I stared at the business card in my hand, the embossed silver lettering catching the fluorescent lights of my company's lobby. ""Shepard Industries Private Security."" My stomach twisted into knots as I looked up at the man who'd cornered me by the elevator‚Äîtall, broad-shouldered, with the expressionless face of someone who'd seen too much and cared too little.

""Mr. Shepard requests your presence immediately, Ms. Carter,"" he said, his voice low enough that my coworkers couldn't hear as they streamed past us, oblivious to my world collapsing for the third time in a week.

""How did you‚Äî"" My voice cracked. ""How did you find me?""

The security man's expression didn't change. ""That's what we do, Ms. Carter. The car is waiting outside.""

I glanced toward the glass doors, where a sleek black sedan idled at the curb. This was it. The moment I'd been dreading since I'd seen my blurry photo splashed across every social media platform in America. #FindHer had found me.

""I have meetings,"" I said weakly, knowing it didn't matter.

""They've been rescheduled."" Of course they had. Billionaires didn't wait for middle managers with mortgages and student loans.

I clutched my purse tighter, wishing Quinn were here. She'd know what to say, how to handle this with dignity. But Quinn wasn't here, and I had to face the consequences of my actions alone.

""Fine,"" I said, lifting my chin. ""Let's get this over with.""

The car ride was silent, the privacy glass between us and the driver firmly in place. I stared out the window as Seattle blurred past, trying to calm my racing heart. What did Finn Shepard want? Money? An NDA? To humiliate me the way Jason had?

When we pulled up to a familiar building, my breath caught. Jason's company. The security man led me through the lobby to the executive elevator, up to the conference room where I'd attended countless holiday parties and corporate functions as Jason's plus-one.

The door opened, and there he was.

Finn Shepard looked even more imposing in daylight than he had in the dim lighting of the hotel bar. Tall, with shoulders that filled out his custom suit to perfection, he stood at the window overlooking the city. When he turned, those dark eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my knees weak.

""Ms. Carter,"" he said, his voice exactly as I remembered it‚Äîdeep, commanding. ""Thank you for coming.""

As if I'd had a choice.

""What do you want?"" I asked, proud that my voice didn't tremble.

He gestured to the chair across from him. ""Please, sit.""

I remained standing. ""I'd rather know why your security team tracked me down like some criminal.""

A flicker of something‚Äîamusement?‚Äîcrossed his face. ""You're not a criminal, Ms. Carter. You're a solution to a problem.""

""I'm not a solution to anything,"" I said. ""I'm a person who made a mistake and would like to move on with her life.""

""A mistake."" He tested the word, his expression hardening slightly. ""Is that what you call it?""

Heat rushed to my face. ""What would you call it?""

""An opportunity."" He reached for a leather portfolio on the conference table and slid it toward me. ""I have a proposal for you.""

I eyed the portfolio warily. ""What kind of proposal?""

""A marriage.""

The word hung in the air between us, impossible and absurd.

""Excuse me?""

""I need a wife, Ms. Carter. For business purposes."" He spoke as if discussing the weather, not a life-altering proposition. ""The Nakamura merger is contingent on certain... traditional values being demonstrated. My board is concerned about my public image after some recent tabloid stories.""

""So find someone else,"" I said, incredulous. ""Someone who actually wants to marry you.""

""The timing is critical. We don't have the luxury of a traditional courtship."" His eyes narrowed slightly. ""Besides, our connection has already been established in the public eye. It's the perfect narrative‚Äîthe billionaire who launched a nationwide search to find the woman who captured his heart.""

""That's not what happened,"" I protested.

""It's what people believe happened,"" he countered. ""And perception is reality in business.""

I shook my head, backing toward the door. ""This is insane. I'm not marrying a stranger for a business deal.""

""Two million dollars,"" he said calmly. ""For one year of marriage. After which we'll divorce amicably, and you'll be free to live however you choose‚Äîwith financial security few people ever achieve.""

I froze, the number echoing in my head. Two million dollars. Enough to pay off my student loans, buy a home, start over somewhere new where no one knew me as the woman who'd been publicly humiliated twice in one week.

""Why me?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Something shifted in his expression‚Äîa softening around the eyes, a slight parting of his lips. For a moment, he looked almost human.

""Because you left,"" he said simply. ""No one leaves me, Ms. Carter. It was... intriguing.""

I should have walked out. Should have told him to find another pawn for his corporate chess game. But as I stood there, feeling the weight of my shattered life pressing down on me, I found myself reaching for the portfolio.

""I'll read it,"" I said. ""But I'm not agreeing to anything.""

His smile was slow, confident. The smile of a man who always got what he wanted.

""We'll discuss the details over breakfast tomorrow,"" he said. ""8 AM at the Four Seasons caf√©.""

As I left the conference room, clutching the portfolio to my chest, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just made a deal with the devil‚Äîand he was already counting on my soul.

It felt like it was heading in the right direction and I hadn‚Äôt felt that comfortable with someone in several years. 

He had a new-ish job at the time. It was very demanding, and it kept getting worse (understaffed, no time off, incredibly long hours, and no support from leadership). He sort of pulled away as it was getting worse. Working 60+ hours/week. We talked about everything. He said this is what he does when he‚Äôs stressed. He even started losing weight. I was really worried about him. 

On top of that, his daughter had just moved away to college. It was emotional to say the least. 

Then our town flooded and I had to evacuate. I couldn‚Äôt get in touch with him for days. When I finally did, it was kind of strained. Then his grandmother passed away, who he was helping take care of. To say the least, there was no chance our new relationship would survive all of this. We ended things rather amicably. Looking back, I was probably being selfish, but I felt like we didn‚Äôt even have a relationship anymore. He couldn‚Äôt communicate with me. I was shut out. Although he apologized a lot and worried he was bringing negativity in my life, there just wasn‚Äôt any emotional space for the relationship on his end. 

I hadn‚Äôt seen him at all in the 2 weeks before the flood, and there were no plans to meet up when I got back to town. We were barely talking at this point. I told him to reach out when he had time. And didn‚Äôt hear from again. 

He always said it was never about me and that he just had way too much on his plate. We were both sad. I was even secretly bitter at first. But that gave way to understanding and healing and moving on.

He reached out about 4 months after all of this. Mind you, this was shortly after my neighbor had seen him out on what looked like a date to her. He pretended he didn‚Äôt know my neighbor (which he definitely does). 

I took some time with his message. It was heartfelt, kind, asking me how I was doing, he had been thinking of me, and that he was working on being better and was maybe actually doing better (not clear). 

I replied after a couple of days asking what he had been up to and that I also missed our good times. He never responded. So sad. 

About 5 weeks later I was in his neighborhood housesitting for a friend so I thought maybe he might want to meet up. I texted and never heard from him. 

I saw he got a new job and that makes me so happy for him. And I want to reach out again. It‚Äôs probably been about 2 months since I tried last. I just want to catch up. Of course, I‚Äôd like to see if there‚Äôs space for a relationship now, but won‚Äôt open with that. I genuinely do care about this person and would love to reconnect and just get coffee or lunch. 

TLDR; Dated for 3 months, ended things relatively amicably due to the many life pressures he was going through. After he initiated contact about 5 months ago and two missed messages/no replies, I want to try one more time. ",1,1749459707.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1l6zx0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1l6zx0g/some_perspective_ive_gained_from_a_break_up_and/,Some perspective ive gained from a break up and working in a shelter,"A year ago, almost to the day, me and my girlfriend of 8 years split. It was the first really long term relationship ive been in, the only other was a 1 1/2 years. We met in university while going for our welding tickets. We met up one weekend out of the blue and a walk through town turned into a kiss on a hill turned into me moving in with her a few months later. Obviously it happened fast and we kid ourselves into thinking we were unique and we figured it out and we could go the distance. Youthful hubris and wonderful idealistic hearts won the day for a awhile. 

To make a long long story really short, i wasent great spot mentally/emotionally and she checked out and began cheating on me with anyone who would show her the slightest bit of attention on the internet.
While it wasent my fault she cheated, that is a choice people make, i have no problem eating the crow and admitting that i wasent great to be around and it was ultimately a good idea for us not to be together anymore.

After we split the world shook and did so for a while. Ive had to pretty much go through the whole post breakup by myself. I didnt have any friends or family because that relationship sucked the life out of me and reduced my confidence/self esteem to near zero. My family are not the type of people you could ever rely on or go to for help. While i have attended some therapy right at the start and read a couple self help books and a million resources, im still very much reckoning this situation by myself.

Its taken awhile for me to empower myself and find my worth again. 
I really credit for my time of working in a homless sheltef My days are filled with myriad conversations, problems and trying to be a rock for others, while navigating some reaaallly off the wall moments and personalities. My coworkers are pretty awesome people and i enjoy working with them. My growth with my clients and team has served me in amazing ways and i was always be eternally greatful for the impact it has had on my life.

Through worl ive really learned that people come and go, pain is universal and so is love and kindness, affording people grace over mistakes and forgiveness you cant half heartedly believe in. The power of a kind word, being there when someone has no where else to turn, letting people vent, serving a need greater than myself. Even if im feeling lost its really hard to stay that way when someone comes along and trusts you enough to rely on you and let your words touch them.

So, i encourage everyone here who is struggling to find worth and purpose to turn to your community. The plights we express are shared between more people than you know. Even if people seem okay, its not like they still dont need a shoulder and an ear. You dont have to be the center of someones world to matter, you can just be five minutes of respite before they head back into the storm. Even if your shy, you dont have to start out as mr personality or some incredible savior. It will take time for you to find your voice and learn to establish yourself. Everyone starts out just trying to get the social rhythm down and it doesnt happen unless you go out and find your song.

Go into your communities, find your shelters, find support societies, volunteer with events, join a book club, learn to knit/sow, go learn how to dance, pick up a casual sport, go to the gym/long walks. Do not be held back by gender tropes. The best men i know all have a gentle side they are very much in touch with. Instead of being a ""man"", be a human being. Thats what anyone should work for and towards. Be around people without expectations. Say hi, ask how life is, be friendly and respectful. Shoot the shit with random facts, help out without expecting rewards. Just be the person that listens, pitches in without throwing a bunch of shade or going off on weird tangents and your typically alright. If conversation fizzles, learn to be happy in your own skin and be proud you made the effort. This is how you build momentum.

You have feelings for a reason, feel the friggen things. If you wanna cry, cry it out. If you need a friggen hug, find a person and ask for a hug. If life is hard, talk about it, get it out, some how, some way. No shame in being emotional and admitting life is hard and you need help. If you love someone, grab em by the shoulders and look them in the eyes and tell them. If you grew up hard then these words apply double. Just because you grew up hard doesnt mean it needs to stay that way, its your choice to carry on that upbringing. People will receive you, even if it doesnt feel like it. Alot of what we have grown up around makes it feel that way, especially on the internet. 

Loneliness is derived of lack of connection to our real selves and in turn we sever our ability to connect to others. When we learn to love and nourish ourselves, when we finally empower ourselves and learn to love and accept ourselves for who we are and what we can do, thats when people flock to us. 
That is when people take notice and want to be around us. Find something to be proud of and own it, let that passion flow through you. Dont worry about the validation, be more concerned about providing yourself that feeling of being wild and carefree, like when you were a kid, you made choices and you didnt care what others thought. It was cool to you and it made you feel alive, it made you feel like You. 

Never forget, you matter. Even if you dont feel it, you really do. If you want people to love you, love yourself first. Then love the world. Eventually, the world will love you back. And even if the whole world doesnt love you. That is totally okay. The people that matter will.

Enjoy this awesome ride, enjoy the scenery, the flowers, the smell of the coffee shop, random locales, getting lost and finding your way back, creating weird little memories and stories. Even if its embarressing, thats even better. Learn to laugh about stuff, be goofy, dont take stuff to heart, dont take yourself so seriously it sucks the air out of the room. Tell some jokes, we witty. Even if it doesnt land, who cares, just roll on. As long as your having fun and enjoying yourself, that is what matters. People and places will come and go but you will always be you. Loving yourself will make lifes journey much much better.

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading.
If you read a bit, thanks for reading.
If anything resonated with you, thank you for opening yourself up to change.

Now stop doomscrolling and go love yourself.",1,1749459573.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1l6zvxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1l6zvxg/security_gave_away_bag_at_casino/,Security gave away bag at casino,"My partner works at a casino, and during the week there is a specific night that they do the box changes for the slot machines, which makes it so the staff is there for an hour after the casino is closed. My partner has worked there for over 3 years now, and they‚Äôve been the closing shift staff consistently the entire time they‚Äôve been there.

Generally after the casino is closed and there aren‚Äôt any customers left in the casino, my partner will go into the break room and get their personal items from their locker and leave them with the security guard because after a certain time, the FOB that allows access to the break room and other secure areas in the casino will automatically lock and they no longer have access to those rooms until the following day, so to avoid having their keys locked in the break room, they just leave it with security. This is something that has been checked with management and approved for years now. 

Last week, about 45 minutes after the casino had been closed, there was a customer that had been in the bathroom. This customer was someone that when their ID is scanned at the door initially, it comes up in the system as a flagged person because they are suspicious and there have been issues with them in the past. The head of security decided to let this customer into the casino anyways earlier on. This person came out of the bathroom after the casino was closed, and this same head of security decided to call her over, offer her coffee before she left, and then before she left, he pointed to the bag and said to her ‚Äúis that your bag?‚Äù And let her grab my partner‚Äôs bag and walk out of the casino with it. My partner had no idea this customer was in the casino because it was long after the casino was closed, and he had already begun the box change, so he was on the floor unable to witness or stop this exchange.

This is all on camera, the other security guard that was working was an eyewitness to this and gave a statement to the RCMP, and it‚Äôs been confirmed by another security guard who watched the footage that it‚Äôs very clear that the head of security called this person over and gestured to my partner‚Äôs bag and watched her walk out of the casino with it. 

My partner had just collected his tips for the week, so this person walked out with his cellphone, his car keys, his wallet with his drivers license, bank cards, credit cards, $600 in cash, and all of his personal belongings. 

We live in a small town in BC that has had a rise in crime lately that is so bad that the city has almost declared a state of emergency over it. This person that took our items was known to police, but the RCMP has not been able to locate them. This whole experience has led to severe mental distress for us. Someone has our car keys, our house keys, and because they have my partner‚Äôs ID, they have our address. When my partner asked the casino if they‚Äôre going to investigate this, they flat out refused to. They said that it was not their problem at all, even though the casino was closed and the security guard did not follow proper protocol for something that was found on the floor. My partner initially was supposed to be a security guard so he took the courses for it, and he has to take yearly training for the protocol, and he knows that what this security guard did was wrong. The guard did not verify anything before allowing the customer who hid in the bathroom after the casino was closed, he did not clear the bathrooms after the casino was closed. It has been verified by multiple people who rewatched the footage that it is very clear that he pointed out the bag to her and then watched her as she picked it up and walked out of the casino with it.

We‚Äôve contacted the GPEB and they‚Äôve launched an investigation, but I‚Äôm just wondering if there is more we can do about this? We have to pay for a new cellphone, new ID, our key fob for our car is specific and it‚Äôs going to cost us $900 through our car dealership to replace because the local locksmith was unable to do it, plus the closest dealership is 3 hours away because we live so far north in BC. We have to redo all the locks on our house. Plus just the fact that we‚Äôve been genuinely scared of what could happen knowing that someone has all of this information and everything they could need to commit a targeted robbery. We have children, one of them is a teenager and we‚Äôre scared to leave her home alone. This has just been an awful experience and the fact that the casino is just unwilling to do anything, they wouldn‚Äôt even discuss it with my partner the following day, has made it even more frustrating.

1l6ztpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaintenancePhase/comments/1l6ztpq/things_that_i_felt_were_missing_from_this_episode/,Things that I  felt were missing from this episode,"The podcast‚Äôs debate over how to define ""ultra-processed foods"" and their health effects feels frustratingly narrow. Sure, arguing whether a Twinkie will give you diabetes or shave years off your life doesn't matter much‚Äîit‚Äôs like obsessing over the font on a exit sign (serif or not it doesn't matter, so long as it is seen). Also for most people ultraprocessed foods for a long time is not the answer to ultimate health questions, twinkies and oreos everyday for years may not be harmful at all.  The real problem isn‚Äôt just what these foods do to our bodies; it‚Äôs what their industrial production does to the planet. I felt the episode was a big narrow-minded and dismissive to the big overall picture of processed foods and how it is moralised, but overall it kind of fell flat. It spread its criticism thinly over many levels of research. I felt it was saying things which were hypocritical compared to other episodes, and dismissive of research. You are meant to be dismissive of the moralising of research by coffee-table science readers.

In anycase here are some of my 2c.

Let‚Äôs start with the uncomfortable truth: the modern food system exists because it had to, and this facilitates lots of the processing. After World War II, as global populations exploded(baby boom) and famines loomed(many people lived in famine during and after the war), scientists like Norman Borlaug engineered high-yield wheat and rice strains that fed billions. This wasn‚Äôt just progress‚Äîit was a moral triumph. Starvation rates plummeted, and for the first time in history, humanity had a plausible answer to Malthusian doomsaying. But here‚Äôs the catch: Borlaug‚Äôs crops solved calories, not nutrition.  The right to food also evolved with this, we don;t see it as just having enough food to stay alive but nutrients to live well. We traded scarcity for empty abundance‚Äîwheat that could fill stomachs but not nourish cells, leading to the bizarre paradox of fortified flour and vitamin pills.

And then there‚Äôs the land. If you really want to understand the major climate questions of our food system, forget cow farts (yes, methane matters, but it‚Äôs a distraction). Focus instead on the land. I'll use the example of Europe instead of the US to show how globalised this industrial problem is. About half the land is Europe is used for egriculture, if you ever flew over europe you can tell this by seeing all the fields everywhere.  Here's the catch: most of it isn‚Äôt growing food for humans. It‚Äôs growing food for food. Vast monocrops of wheat, soy, and corn‚Äîpulverized into pellets and pumped into livestock, or split where the white rice is given to people, and husks to animals. or the 'waste' from making things like oat milk. And still, it‚Äôs not enough. Europe‚Äôs insatiable demand for cheap meat means razing the Amazon to plant **GMO soy‚Äînot for tofu or tempeh, but for feed to feed cows** (yes, they import GMO soy from brazil to feed livestock). GMO soy likely isn't bad (other than the issue of seed patents), but if you want to avoid it entirely consumer organic animal products (as organic cows are not supposed to have GMO feed). This soy isn‚Äôt meant for humans; it‚Äôs engineered for maximum cow fattening. Ships crisscross the Atlantic, burning bunker fuel to haul mountains of protein‚Ä¶ to be turned into manure.

The U.S. is no better. Drive through the Midwest and you‚Äôll see endless monocrops of corn and soy, but less luck finding a vegetable farm (what pays more-- meat! and dairy!). Those crops aren‚Äôt for only people; they‚Äôre for cars (ethanol) and cows (feed). Meanwhile, the soil‚Äîthe literal foundation of civilization‚Äîis being stripped of nutrients, turning what was once a carbon sink into a carbon emitter. And we are reaching the limits of how much agricultural land we can take back

This isn‚Äôt just an environmental crisis; it‚Äôs a systems crisis. Courts in Europe are already ruling that climate inaction violates human rights, forcing governments to consider radical solutions like rewilding farmland (nature restore has now been signed as a regulation). But in the U.S., we‚Äôre still arguing about whether processed foods should count as ""food"" at all‚Äîas if the real issue is the FDA‚Äôs labeling rules and not the fact that our entire food chain is built on ecological debt.

So yes, Twinkies might not kill you, it's probably not great, but not so bad. But the system that produces them‚Äîthe razed forests, the depleted soil, the feedlots stretching to the horizon‚Äîis killing the planet. And no amount of ""nutrient-dense"" kale chips will fix that.",3,1749459182.0,MaintenancePhase,12,0.57,False
1l6zt1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1l6zt1b/scared_of_falling_asleep/,scared of falling asleep,"hi all, i am a 21 yr old female who is currently writing this at 4:30 AM after yet another nightmare. this will be a long one. 

i had a nightmare the day before last at around 8 AM and just decided to wake up. 

this all started literally today. i was on a beach trip and drank quiet a bit of alcohol throughout the week. on the last night (yesterday), i got very drunk and had a mental breakdown. not sure if that‚Äôs relevant but wanted to mention it. i had a very traumatic childhood and struggle mentally sometimes, but don‚Äôt have the means for professional help right now. i also started my period this night and took a midol, and another midol when i woke up. these midol often make me feel weird and very woozy even without alcohol, but without them im in too much pain to function. (relevant i promise) 

well we start our trip home and im trying to sleep in the back seat. every single time i even begin to drift off, my brain conjures up the pre-sleep dreams. i‚Äôve had these all my life and it was always just an indicator to me that i was falling asleep, and sometimes they‚Äôd get too loud and i‚Äôd wake up again, but for some reason this time it was really, really terrifying. it was almost like i couldn‚Äôt control my brain. this happened over and over. well i eventually was able to go to sleep and had a vivid dream but no nightmare. however, everytime i would try to go back to sleep (9hr drive so id wake up and go back to sleep) id just be terrified and the same thing would happen, and even when i woke up and was awake i just felt really off and scared. 

finally, we make it home and i go about my day. my body and mind feel fine again and i figure ill just try again tonight. the same thing has been happening. all. night. long. everytime i drift it‚Äôs almost like im having sleep paralysis where im awake but im not and im just terrified once i get there, and my mind is conjuring up terrifying things. like once it was a woman sitting at a coffee table chatting and her head just snapped to mine with her lips moving. once it was just some lips moving to a song and they randomly started chanting at me. well i finally did fall asleep and had a pleasant dream, but i woke up again. went back to sleep (with the same struggles, but mildly less scared by the non nightmare), and had another terrifying nightmare that i can remember vividly. literally almost every single detail. a few minutes ago i decide to try again. that‚Äôs when the lips started chanting and i couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. 

i‚Äôm not sure if this is allowed in this thread, but im scared. i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on and i have work tomorrow and don‚Äôt get off until 7, so i truly can‚Äôt go get help until after another night of this if it persists. im bone tired, too. i‚Äôve had sleep paralysis in the past a few times, but nothing like this. anyone have any experience with it or any tips? i‚Äôm just worried it‚Äôs a mental health crisis rather than a sleep disorder or something, but it‚Äôs really only when i‚Äôm trying to sleep so i hoped it fit here. thank you for any and all thoughts.

Was talking to someone off a dating app and I got too emotionally invested and hopeful. 

Context: 
We talked for a couple of days and I initiated a day for coffee to which she wasn‚Äôt available for that week and I pushed it to the following weekend.

Dropped off my contact to which she initiated and messaged me over telegram. The next day, I was surfing the app and realised that her account missing. Heck I considered the possibility that it‚Äôs a coincidence that she unmatched, deleted or paused her account but  I didn‚Äôt know what came over me, I decided to reciprocate and put my account on hold. I‚Äôm those kind of folk that didn‚Äôt really like the idea of talking to multiple peeps at the same time 

Upon texting on telegram, I didn‚Äôt care that she took 1 working day to response or dry responses. I was genuinely interested and actually hopeful deep down but that all soon came crashing on me a few days. She ghosted me for 2 days and came texting me on Wednesday that I strike off as a sincere guy and she didn‚Äôt want to waste my time as she was navigating thru a shitty phase at work and wished me atb on the app and find wtv I was looking for.

I was stunned yet at the same time, sad and happy. A part of me wanted to grab on and tell her that it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm willing to wait for her but my response said otherwise, I thanked her being honest and wished her all the best. Deep down I knew I had to let go as it‚Äôs crazy I nvr met this lady in my life before and it‚Äôs crazy that I‚Äôm so emotionally invested within 1.5 weeks of talking.

It‚Äôs been 5 days since this unfolded and a part of me still wants to grab on and text her in a month to check how are things as she‚Äôs graduating next month but Ik I have to let it go slowly and I see myself slowly doing that as I reactivate the app today but I still see myself going back to our chats and her telegram profile only to feel dispirited knowing that she possibly might have restrict me from her profile. 

I‚Äôm really a sucker and I hate myself for always letting my emotions rule me.

I gasped awake, my heart hammering against my ribs like it wanted to break free. Sweat drenched my silk nightgown, plastering it to my skin as I clutched at my abdomen‚Äîwhere the knife had entered in another lifetime. The phantom pain was so vivid I half-expected to find blood on my hands.

There was no blood. Not yet.

My bedroom looked exactly as it had that morning‚Äîthe first time I lived it. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains, casting golden patterns across my pristine white bedding. The antique clock on my nightstand read 7:03 AM.

Emma's accident would happen at 8:17.

""No,"" I whispered, the word dropping like a stone in the silence. ""Not again.""

The memories crashed over me in merciless waves: my sister's crumpled car, my father's cold calculation in the hospital, Sophie Reed's terrified eyes as they wheeled her toward the operating room, the betrayal in Andrew's gaze as he stood by Emma's bedside, holding her hand instead of mine.

And then... my own death. My baby's death.

I stumbled from the bed, my legs barely supporting me as I rushed to the bathroom and retched violently into the toilet. There was nothing in my stomach to expel‚Äîjust bitter bile and the acid taste of fear.

This time would be different. It had to be.

I dressed with shaking hands, ignoring the designer clothes that hung in perfect rows in my closet‚Äîclothes I'd once worn with such naive pride as the Whitman heiress. Instead, I grabbed a simple black dress and flat shoes. I wouldn't be the doll they dressed up and discarded this time.

My phone buzzed with a news alert: ""Whitman Heiress Emma Whitman Involved in Serious Collision.""

It was happening again.

I broke every traffic law driving to St. Catherine's Private Hospital, where I knew my family would already be gathering. The exclusive wing reserved for the ultra-wealthy gleamed with marble floors and hushed efficiency. I found them exactly where I expected‚Äîmy father pacing in the private waiting area, his face a mask of controlled fury rather than paternal concern.

Through the glass partition, I watched him bend over a stack of medical reports, his finger jabbing at names on a list. The hospital administrator nodded deferentially, her spine curved in submission to his wealth and power.

I didn't need to hear their conversation to know what was happening. They were identifying potential organ donors for Emma. And there, circled in red, would be Sophie Reed's name‚Äîa twenty-six-year-old pregnant administrative assistant in the Whitman Group's HR department. Perfect health. Perfect match. Perfectly expendable.

""No,"" I breathed, pressing my palm against the cold glass. ""Not her.""

I pushed through the door without knocking, interrupting my father's hushed conference.

""Grace,"" he said, his voice carrying that familiar note of irritation at my unexpected appearance. ""This isn't the time. Your sister‚Äî""

""I need to speak with you,"" I cut in, my voice steadier than I felt. ""Alone.""

He dismissed the administrator with a curt nod, his steel-gray eyes never leaving my face.

""What is it? Emma is critical. I don't have time for your dramatics.""

I followed him to his makeshift command center‚Äîthe hospital's executive office that had been immediately surrendered to Richard Whitman upon his arrival. The wood-paneled room smelled of leather and power.

""You can't do this,"" I said, my voice low but firm. ""Sophie Reed. The woman you've selected. She's pregnant.""

My father's eyebrows rose slightly‚Äîthe only indication of his surprise at my knowledge.

""How unfortunate for her,"" he replied, turning away to pour himself a scotch from the crystal decanter that had materialized on the desk. ""But Emma needs a liver transplant immediately, and Ms. Reed is the only viable match in our immediate sphere of influence.""

""She's a person, not a spare parts inventory,"" I hissed, stepping closer. ""She has a husband. A baby. A life.""

""And Emma is my daughter,"" he said, his voice dropping to that dangerous register I remembered all too well. ""Your sister. The future of this family.""

""So am I,"" I whispered.

His laugh was soft and terrible. ""Are you? Then prove it. Stand with this family, Grace. Or stand aside.""

I felt the floor tilting beneath me as history began its inexorable repetition. In the distance, I heard the faint sound of a woman's frightened protests as she was led away by hospital staff.

Sophie.

Chapter 2

My father's words echoed in my mind as I sprinted down the hospital corridor. The polished marble floors reflected the harsh fluorescent lights, making everything seem too bright, too sterile, too unreal. My heart pounded against my ribs as I followed the squeak of gurney wheels, knowing exactly where they were taking Sophie.

'Room 307,' I whispered to myself. 'Just like before.'

I rounded the corner and saw them‚Äîtwo nurses flanking Sophie Reed's gurney, their faces masks of professional detachment. Sophie's eyes were wide with confusion and fear, her hands protectively cradling her swollen belly.

'Wait!' I shouted, my voice bouncing off the walls. 'Stop!'

The nurses hesitated, exchanging uncertain glances. I seized that moment of indecision to rush forward, grabbing Sophie's trembling hand. Her skin was cold and clammy beneath my fingers.

'Ms. Whitman?' she whispered, recognition flickering in her eyes. We'd never spoken before, not really‚Äîjust passed each other in the company hallways. 'What's happening? They won't tell me anything. They just said I need tests‚Äî'

'Listen to me,' I said urgently, leaning close. 'You need to leave. Now. Tell them you refuse. It's your right‚Äî'

'Ma'am, you can't be here,' one of the nurses interrupted, stepping between us.

I tightened my grip on Sophie's hand. 'She's pregnant. You can't do this. It's illegal, it's immoral‚Äî'

'Security!' the second nurse called, pressing a button on her pager.

Sophie's eyes darted between us, fear blooming across her face. 'What's going on? Please, I just want to call my husband‚Äî'

'They're going to‚Äî' I started, but strong hands seized my shoulders, pulling me backward.

'Ms. Whitman, you need to come with us,' a deep voice rumbled in my ear as hospital security dragged me away from Sophie's gurney.

I struggled against their grip, watching helplessly as Sophie disappeared through the swinging doors of the procedure room.

'You don't understand!' I screamed, my voice cracking. 'They're going to kill her! She's pregnant!'

The security guards exchanged looks that clearly questioned my sanity. One of them spoke into his radio, no doubt summoning someone to deal with the hysterical Whitman daughter.

I stopped fighting then, knowing it was useless. Instead, I went limp in their grasp, forcing them to adjust their hold. The moment they loosened their grip, I twisted free and ran toward the observation window that overlooked the procedure room.

Through the glass, I watched in horror as a doctor administered a sedative to Sophie's IV line. Her frightened protests slowed, then ceased altogether as the drug took effect. Her eyelids fluttered, fighting consciousness, while a team in surgical scrubs prepared the equipment for the 'screening tests' that would determine her suitability as Emma's unwilling donor.

I pressed my palms against the cold glass, watching Sophie's fingers‚Äîwhich had been clutching the edge of the gurney‚Äîslowly relax and slip limp at her sides. The sight sent a wave of nausea through me. I'd failed her. Again.

'Grace.' My father's voice cut through my despair. He stood beside me now, his reflection in the glass as hard and unyielding as steel. 'Go home. This doesn't concern you.'

I turned to him, searching his face for any hint of humanity, any flicker of remorse. There was nothing.

'How can you live with yourself?' I whispered.

His jaw tightened. 'I do what's necessary for this family.'

'She has a family too.'

'Not one that matters,' he replied coldly.

Three days later, I stood at the edge of Oakwood Cemetery, watching from a distance as they lowered Sophie Reed's coffin into the ground. The official cause of death: 'complications during routine medical procedure.' A tragic accident, the newspapers said. An unavoidable tragedy.

Emma was recovering well with her new liver.

Rain fell in a gentle mist, beading on my black umbrella as I watched Ethan Reed collapse to his knees beside his wife's grave. His anguished sobs carried across the cemetery, a raw, primal sound that seemed to rise from the earth itself. The small gathering of mourners‚ÄîSophie's friends, her coworkers who didn't know the truth‚Äîstood awkwardly around him, helpless in the face of such grief.

I stayed hidden behind a large oak tree, a coward unwilling to face the man whose life my family had destroyed. But I heard his words clearly as he pressed his forehead against the polished wood of the coffin.

'I swear to you, Sophie,' he choked out between sobs. 'I will find out what really happened. I will make them pay. All of them.'

In that moment, watching this broken man vow vengeance over his wife's grave, I knew exactly what I had to do.

The Whitman empire would fall. And I would be the one to bring it down.

Chapter 3

I stood in the Whitman Group's executive boardroom, facing the long mahogany table where the board members sat like a jury ready to pass judgment. My father occupied the head of the table, his expression carved from granite as he watched me through narrowed eyes. Emma wasn't present‚Äîstill recovering from her surgery, the surgery that had cost Sophie Reed her life.

The silence in the room pressed against my eardrums as I placed my resignation letter on the polished surface. The crisp white paper seemed to glow under the recessed lighting.

'I've called this meeting to announce my immediate resignation from all positions within the Whitman Group,' I said, my voice steadier than I expected. 'Effective immediately.'

My father's jaw tightened, the only indication that I'd caught him off guard. 'This is hardly the time for theatrics, Grace. Your sister is still recovering‚Äî'

'Thanks to the life you stole,' I cut in, the words sharp as broken glass.

A collective intake of breath swept around the table. No one spoke to Richard Whitman that way. Not even his daughters.

'That's enough,' he hissed, rising slightly from his chair. 'You're upset. We can discuss this privately‚Äî'

'No.' I planted my palms on the table, leaning forward. 'I'm done with privacy. With secrets. With the lies this family tells the world while burying bodies beneath the foundation of our success.'

Marcus Thorne, my father's chief of security, stepped closer to me, his presence a silent warning. I ignored him.

'Sophie Reed was twenty-six years old,' I continued, my voice rising. 'She was pregnant. She had a husband who loved her. And this company‚Äîthis family‚Äîmurdered her to save Emma.'

'You've lost your mind,' my father said coldly. 'Ms. Reed suffered complications during a routine procedure. A tragic accident that has nothing to do with‚Äî'

'Stop lying!' I shouted, slamming my hand on the table. 'I was there! I saw what you did! You selected her, you coerced her, you killed her!'

The board members exchanged uncomfortable glances. Some looked away, unwilling to meet my gaze. They knew. Perhaps not the details, but they knew enough to avert their eyes from the truth.

'I will not be part of this anymore,' I said, straightening my spine. 'I renounce my position, my shares, my name‚Äîeverything that ties me to the Whitman legacy of blood and lies.'

My father's face had turned the color of ash. 'You will regret this,' he said, his voice barely above a whisper. 'You have no idea what you're doing.'

I turned to leave, but paused at the door, facing the silent board one last time. 'Neither did Sophie Reed when she came to work that day. The difference is, I'm choosing my fate. She never got that chance.'

With that, I walked out, the heavy door swinging shut behind me with a definitive thud.

\---

By evening, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Headlines screamed across every tabloid and news site in the city: 'WHITMAN HEIRESS SUFFERS BREAKDOWN,' 'GRACE WHITMAN: JEALOUS SISTER OR MENTALLY UNSTABLE?', 'SOURCES REVEAL GRACE WHITMAN'S HISTORY OF EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.'

My father's PR machine had moved with terrifying efficiency. As I walked through downtown, my face stared back at me from newsstands‚Äîold photos dredged up from my college days, caught mid-laugh at a party, glass in hand, looking every bit the reckless socialite. The narrative was being rewritten before my eyes: Grace Whitman, unstable, jealous, unreliable.

My phone rang again‚ÄîAndrew. I declined the call, the third from him today. No doubt he'd been dispatched to 'reason' with me, to bring the wayward Whitman daughter back into the fold before she caused more damage.

Instead, I headed to Blackbird Coffee, a small shop tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city. The kind of place no one from my former social circle would ever visit. The kind of place where Ethan Reed had been spending his afternoons since the funeral, according to the private investigator I'd hired.

He sat alone in the corner, a cold cup of coffee untouched before him, staring at nothing. Grief had hollowed his cheeks and darkened the skin beneath his eyes. He looked like a man who had died alongside his wife but whose body hadn't yet received the message.

I approached slowly, my heart hammering. 'Mr. Reed?'

His eyes lifted to mine, empty at first, then slowly filling with recognition‚Äîand hatred. 'Whitman,' he said, the name like poison on his tongue.

'May I sit?' I asked.

'No.' The word was flat, final.

I swallowed hard. 'I know who killed your wife.'

His expression didn't change. 'Everyone knows. Your family. Your company. Your sister.' He looked away. 'I don't need your guilt money or your confession. Get out.'

'I'm not offering money,' I said, my voice cracking. 'I'm offering proof.'

I slid a manila envelope across the table. He didn't touch it.

'That's a copy of the hospital log from the day Sophie died,' I explained quietly. 'It shows who authorized the procedure, who performed it, and who signed off on the falsified death certificate.'

His hand trembled slightly as it finally moved toward the envelope.

'Why?' he asked, his voice barely audible.

'Because Sophie deserves justice,' I whispered. 'And because I couldn't save her. But maybe together, we can make them pay.

Last friday was my 2nd shot (250mg twice a week).

I noticed that the 3rd day after each shot i will feel tired and moody? Is this normal? I have AI on hand but I am not going to use it until i have spicy nipples, I do suspect it is the E2 levels. Injection day and 2nd day are amazing, really confident and horny, really positive about life.

I started the cycle last Tuesday evening, and 2nd dose was on Friday morning. Basically on Thursday i was feeling weak and tired, same goes for today. I sneaked off at work during lunch to do a dose at home, now I am back to feeling normal aka AMAZING.

I am planning either to split the weekly 500mg dose in 3 injections, or include some low dose primobolan as i read that it has AI properties. Is what I am feeling now normal? I hate the weak, wobbly, unmotivated feeling, it feels like i just missed my morning coffee (which i didnt).

 PS: I am doing test because I think I have suffered from low test for the past 5 years. I am 36 years old and have been going to the gym, however I am really anxious and unmotivated about work and other stuff.

""Where do we order coffee?""","Not a barista but I'm pretty close with a couple baristas in a place. I also work in food service, I think I get you guys more than the average person!!!

Anyways, I was fixing up my drink at the little counter where you pick up your drinks during my break. Mind you, there's sugar, creamer, milk, whatever else on my side of counter, not to mention it's just me there, and there's another spot on the counter a few feet away has two visible registers, two workers actively taking orders, and a line of customers. There's also a sign hanging from the ceiling that says ""ORDER COFFEE HERE"" or something along those lines. I'm vertically challenged so the sign isn't really visible unless I tilt my head up, but even then, I think it should be obvious where to order.

I made small talk with one of the people on the bar I'm pretty friendly with, and somebody walks up to the pickup counter and says, ""Do you order here, or over there?"" while pointing to the registers. She politely directs them to the registers, and moves on. Then, immediately after, another person. ""Can I order coffee here?"" they ask, and once again, she redirects the customer. I can hear her sigh as she goes back to her drinks. 

""Is this where you order coffee?""

At this point, I'm trying not to laugh my ass off and look like a dickhead, because clearly this third person doesn't know they're the third person in a row to ask this question, unless they're being intentionally obtuse. I also didn't want to make light of it just in case. I didn't know the barista well enough to tell how much anger/frustration she had under that customer service smile and tone as she pointed to the sign above the registers, maybe laughing in the moment would've made it worse. 

We caught up when we were both leaving our respective workplaces and had a good laugh about it afterwards. Jesus Christ, people. I know customers aren't NPCs but shit can they act like them sometimes.",2,1749458021.0,barista,1,1.0,False

19 yrs old
Female
5‚Äô8‚Äù 116lbs
Caucasian, residing in U.S.

Pre-existing:
     Had RSV and Pneumonia when I was 3, put me in the hospital and I‚Äôve had asthma-like symptoms since.
      Dealing with chronic migraines since 4th grade. Exacerbated by stress but otherwise haven‚Äôt been able to pin down any real causes (that I can control - I notice barometric pressure can cause them)
     Cyst-Prone (?) Had an ovarian cyst earlier this year (3.5cm across) which I had laparoscopic surgery to remove (which resulted in an actual endometriosis diagnosis). Now I have a possible cyst (went to gyno and she said likely but to come back if it doesn‚Äôt go away) on my labia closer to my thigh.

I have the Mirena IUD, take sumatriptan for migraines and zofran to curb the nausea that comes with that and the meds. I still have my tonsils and appendix but not my wisdom teeth.

Now to the details of what I‚Äôve been experiencing (buckle up this is wordy but I don‚Äôt know how else to do it):

Starting about Xmas of 2024 I‚Äôve been having some weird stuff. I‚Äôve always been prone to nausea but it was happening a LOT and I was feeling super lethargic, hormonal, and I gajned ~3lbs which is not normal for me. I thought I was truly going crazy and stopped eating for about 3 days because the nausea was so bad. That‚Äôs when I found out I had that ovarian cyst and had it removed immediately. A few things got better for awhile but now I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing even more stuff - 
The nausea is coming back. I consistently will have 1-2 day periods (of time) where I can‚Äôt eat and will just puke until I‚Äôm having to dry heave or vomit water. The first few times I thought I somehow got food poisoning or the stomach flu but it‚Äôs getting weird. 
I am so tired and lethargic all the time. I do not feel depressed - I am actively upset at the fact I can‚Äôt seem to get energy to get out of bed. I‚Äôm unable to get myself up or out for usually about 3 days and then go back to normal (and it‚Äôs not a decompression thing I live a relatively easy and stress free life). 
So. Many. Headaches. I don‚Äôt think I know what it is to not have a headache - not even a migraine. My head just usually hurts (yes I drink water and sleep 8+ hours). It‚Äôs a pointed pain either grabbing around my eyes or neck or stabbing into the hollows of my nose next to my eye - I‚Äôll also mention that it‚Äôll shoot down my neck and sometimes I can feel it as it jumps across my back if that makes sense. It comes and goes but very often. The throbbing doesn‚Äôt really stop, maybe on a good day it does or I can distract myself from it. This usually comes with a nausea that is different than the puking stuff - It‚Äôs more like intense vertigo. 
I‚Äôm pretty faint almost all the time. Like if I stand up, even slowly, I have to be careful not to faint. If I look to the side, at a normal speed, I will see black spots and get lightheaded - If I turn my head more quickly, most of my vision goes black or blurry. Even rolling over in bed has a similar effect. I can‚Äôt lift my arms over my head without running into problems. Lifting anything, like a grocery box or gallon of milk can set it off.
Probably about 3-5x a week I get a twitching. It happens in my head and neck, just a need to blink and tilt my head quickly, or lift my shoulder, or shake my head gently but quickly. This is NOT a shiver. I‚Äôve had aural migraines with similar effects to seizures and it‚Äôs closer to that feeling. 
My boobs are hard and painful almost all the time. If they aren‚Äôt painful to the touch, reprieve only lasts about 3 days max. 

That‚Äôs all I can think of that is seriously affecting my life right now. Sometimes something will happen or I‚Äôll feel a certain way and I‚Äôll think, oh maybe that‚Äôs connected, but it‚Äôs subtle enough I don‚Äôt remember right now. Yes I‚Äôm going to start writing these things down.
Yes I‚Äôm going to see my primary care doctor. But what do I say?

More details about my lifestyle:
Not pregnant. Just had my period and I never have been. When I used to actually have my period (now I just spot for maybe 2 days a month), it was horrible. Both my grandmas had their uteruses removed - It felt like their only option. 
I‚Äôm active when I‚Äôm not sooo tired. I‚Äôm in shape. I do physical therapy for a torn meniscus and I‚Äôm a good hiker and skier. However, I don‚Äôt run or exercise with cardio or lift weights. 
I have a good diet. I could eat more protein but I definitely do better than the majority of people. I have about 2 cups of coffee in the morning about 4x a week. My biggest fail here is soda - I probably have a can of coke once every other day and I do keep them in the house. I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt smoke habitually.
I‚Äôm a good sleeper, when I don‚Äôt oversleep. That‚Äôs what really upsets me. I go to bed between 8:30 and 10:00 every night and I‚Äôll sleep anywhere from 6:00am to literally 1:00pm even if I slept well. Yes I set an alarm everyday.

I feel horribly out of control. I can‚Äôt do what I want. I can‚Äôt maintain relationships or routines. I feel objectively bad most of the time and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on which sucks.
My mom has suggested maybe it‚Äôs my iud, but I love everything else about it. My period used to be my life. If you know someone with endo you understand.
I have thought in the past I might have POTS, but this seems a lot more intense.

Some family history: 
-gma with trigeminal neuralgia, cervical cancer
-gma with breast cancer (she had chemo and is cancer free. I‚Äôd share more but she kept it secret so we only know that much).
-chronic migraines all around
-depression,suicide, and alcoholism run in the family

If you have any clarifying questions, ask. I tried to be as detailed as possible but it‚Äôs challenging to do with words and nothing is outwardly physical or visible.

I was left in the dark.

I respected the no contact, but yeah, I struggled. I processed, I reflected, I didn‚Äôt chase. Out of nowhere a few weeks later, she unblocked me and messaged me on iMessage. Said she just wanted to check how I was. We ended up on the phone for an hour ‚Äî laughing, talking about life, her new job, gym, even small stuff she remembered about me. It felt real, but she didn‚Äôt really say why she came back.

Now she‚Äôs gone quiet again.

I‚Äôve been thinking about asking her to go for a coffee. Nothing heavy. Just something casual. But I keep going back and forth. I don‚Äôt want to mess up the balance by reaching out first again ‚Äî especially after I spent so long regaining my peace.

Part of me wants clarity, part of me just misses that energy we had. But I also don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm chasing someone who still might not be sure about me.

Anyone been in this situation? Is asking for coffee a step back or a mature way to open the door without pressure?

I bolted upright in bed, a scream trapped in my throat. My hand flew to my side, frantically feeling for a scar that wasn't there. Not yet. The phantom pain burned beneath my fingers‚Äîa memory from a future that would never happen. Not this time. Sunlight streamed through the thin curtains of my modest apartment, casting the room in a pale golden glow. The digital clock on my nightstand read 5:47 AM. Today was the day. The day I had agreed to donate my kidney to Adrian Foster‚Äîthe man I had once loved enough to die for. Sweat drenched my nightshirt as fragments of my past life crashed through my mind: the operation, the betrayal, the humiliation, and finally, my death at the hands of the Foster family. The memories were so vivid, so raw, that for a moment, I couldn't breathe. It was real,"" I whispered, my voice breaking the morning silence. ""All of it was real. I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to steady my racing heart. Somehow, impossibly, I'd been given a second chance. The universe had rewound my tragedy, placing me right at the pivotal moment before my greatest mistake.

This time, I would not be their sacrifice.

The Foster mansion loomed before me, its gleaming white fa√ßade no longer the romantic vision I once saw, but a mausoleum of broken promises. I smoothed down my simple blouse and jeans‚Äîpractical clothes for what I knew would be my final visit.

As I was led through the marble-floored entrance hall by a silent maid, I caught my reflection in an ornate mirror. The woman staring back at me looked different somehow‚Äîher eyes harder, her posture straighter. This wasn't the Samantha who had walked these halls before, desperate for approval, for love.

The boardroom door opened, revealing the tableau that had haunted my nightmares. Arthur Foster sat at the head of the polished mahogany table, his silver hair perfectly coiffed, his cold eyes calculating as they assessed me. To his right sat Adrian‚Äîbeautiful, selfish Adrian‚Äîhis face pale, dark circles under his eyes betraying his illness. The kidney disease that was slowly killing him. The disease I had once sacrificed everything to cure.

""Samantha,"" Adrian said, a hint of relief in his voice. ""You're here.""

I didn't respond. My gaze moved to the papers laid out neatly on the table before Arthur Foster. The consent forms. The beginning of my end.

""Please, sit,"" Arthur gestured to the empty chair across from him. His voice was smooth, practiced‚Äîthe voice of a man accustomed to being obeyed. ""We have everything prepared. The procedure is scheduled for tomorrow morning.""

I took the seat, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing down on me. Arthur slid the documents forward, his manicured finger pointing to the signature line.

""As discussed, all your expenses will be covered, of course,"" he continued, his tone making it clear how generous he thought this arrangement was. ""Adrian is very grateful for your... contribution.""

Adrian shifted uncomfortably beside his father. ""Sam, I know this is a lot to ask, but‚Äî""

I picked up the pen, feeling its weight in my hand. In my past life, this was the moment I had signed away my future, my dignity, my very life.

I looked up, meeting Adrian's eyes. There was a time when I thought I saw the universe in those eyes.

Now I only saw my prison.

With deliberate slowness, I gripped the papers. The room fell silent, expectant. Then, with a swift, decisive motion, I tore the documents in half. And then in quarters. The sound of ripping paper echoed like gunshots in the stunned silence.

""I'm not sacrificing my life for you,"" I said, my voice razor-cold, unfamiliar even to my own ears. ""Not today. Not ever again.""

Arthur Foster's face contorted with rage. ""What do you think you're doing?""

""Making a different choice,"" I replied, standing up.

Two security guards appeared at the door as if summoned by Arthur's fury. I felt their presence behind me, but I kept my eyes fixed on Adrian, whose face had drained of all color.

""Sam, please,"" he whispered. ""I need you.""

Those words once would have broken me. Now they strengthened my resolve.

""No, Adrian. You needed what I could give you. There's a difference.""

As the guards escorted me out, I caught sight of Olivia Livingston standing in the foyer, her calculating gaze following me, a satisfied smirk playing on her lips. She thought she was witnessing my downfall. She had no idea she was watching my rebirth.

Behind me, I could hear Adrian calling my name, his voice growing fainter as I walked away. Arthur's voice was lower, harder‚Äîmaking a phone call that I knew would set forces in motion against me.

I stepped out into the morning light, the sun warm on my face. For the first time in what felt like forever, I took a deep, full breath.

I had just made two of the most powerful families in the country my enemies.

And I had never felt more alive.

Chapter 2

The Foster mansion shrank in my rearview mirror as I drove away, my hands still trembling on the steering wheel. I had just declared war on one of the most powerful families in the country. The adrenaline coursing through my veins made everything sharper‚Äîthe sunlight filtering through the windshield, the rumble of my old car's engine, the weight of my decision settling into my bones.

At the first red light, I checked my mirrors and noticed a black SUV two cars behind. When I turned right, it followed. When I made a sudden left, it was still there. My heart hammered against my ribs, but I forced myself to breathe. I wasn't imagining this‚Äîthe Fosters were already watching me.

I took three unnecessary turns, confirming my suspicions when a second identical SUV appeared at the next intersection. They weren't even trying to be subtle. This was a message: we see you, we're coming for you.

""Not this time,"" I whispered to myself, gripping the wheel tighter. ""Not again.""

I drove to a crowded shopping center, losing the vehicles temporarily in the maze of parked cars. I needed time to think, to plan. The Fosters wouldn't waste any time dismantling my life piece by piece‚Äîjust as they had before.

\* \* \*

The silence of my apartment greeted me like a warning. I double-locked the door behind me, drawing the curtains closed against prying eyes. My phone buzzed with a notification‚Äîa voicemail from an unlisted number. My finger hovered over the play button, dread pooling in my stomach.

""Miss Young,"" a digitally altered voice crackled through the speaker. ""Your decision today was... unfortunate. Reconsider, or there will be dire consequences‚Äîfor you and those you care about. The Fosters are not people you want as enemies.""

I saved the recording immediately, my hands steady now. Evidence. In my past life, I'd been too scared, too in love with Adrian to document their threats. This time would be different.

My parents. The thought hit me like a physical blow. In my previous life, the Fosters had used my family's vulnerability against me‚Äîtheir medical bills, their mortgage, their safety. I grabbed my keys and rushed back out the door.

\* \* \*

The familiar scent of my mother's faded perfume lingered in the hallway of my parents' small rental unit. But something was wrong. The door was slightly ajar, and taped to it was a bright orange notice‚Äî""PAY OR QUIT""‚Äîdated today.

""Mom? Dad?"" I called, pushing the door open wider.

The apartment was silent. In the kitchen, I found my answer‚Äîempty pill bottles lined up on the counter like tiny soldiers. My father's heart medication. My mother's arthritis pills. All empty, though I knew they'd been filled just last week.

""Samantha?"" My mother's voice, thin and worried, came from the bedroom. She appeared in the doorway, her face pale. ""What are you doing here, sweetheart?""

I crossed the room and hugged her tightly, breathing in her familiar scent, feeling her fragile shoulders under my arms. In my past life, I'd watched her health deteriorate under the stress the Fosters inflicted. I wouldn't let that happen again.

""Mom, I need you and Dad to trust me,"" I said, pulling back to look into her confused eyes. ""Something's happened, and you might be in danger.""

""Danger? What are you talking about?"" She glanced nervously at the eviction notice I was now holding.

""I can't explain everything right now, but I promise I will. Where's Dad?""

""At the doctor's. They said his prescription was never called in, but I know it was."" Her voice trembled. ""And the landlord says we haven't paid rent in three months, but your father has the receipts...""

The Fosters had moved faster than I anticipated. They were already isolating my parents, cutting off their medication, threatening their housing. This was just the beginning.

""Pack a bag,"" I said firmly. ""You're not staying here tonight.""

\* \* \*

Under the cover of darkness, I watched as the movers loaded the last of my parents' essential belongings into the truck. I'd emptied my savings account‚Äîevery penny I had‚Äîto secure them a small apartment three towns over, far enough from the Fosters' immediate reach.

""I still don't understand why all this secrecy,"" my father said, his voice low as we stood in the shadow of their old building.

""Dad, please. I need you to trust me."" I squeezed his hand. ""I'll explain everything once you're settled, but right now, you need to be somewhere safe.""

My mother touched my cheek, her eyes searching mine. ""You're in some kind of trouble, aren't you?""

I couldn't lie to her. ""Yes. But I'm handling it.""

""Is it that Foster boy?"" My father's voice hardened. He'd never trusted Adrian, even when I was blind to his true nature.

""It's complicated,"" I said. ""But I'm not making the same mistakes again.""

They didn't understand what I meant, but they nodded, trusting me despite my cryptic warnings. As they climbed into their car to follow the moving truck, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. At least they would be safe.

What I didn't see was the camera lens capturing our goodbye from the shadows across the street, or the figure sending the footage directly to Arthur Foster's private phone.

Chapter 3

I spent the next few days in a state of hypervigilance, jumping at shadows and checking my rearview mirror obsessively. The Fosters' reach was extensive, and I knew they were just getting started. With my parents safely relocated, I could focus on rebuilding my own life‚Äîstarting with finding a job that would give me the financial independence I needed to fight back.

My research led me to Vanguard Technologies, an innovative AI research firm making waves in the tech industry. Their ethical approach to artificial intelligence aligned with my own values, and their CEO, Ryan Mitchell, had a reputation for valuing talent over connections. Most importantly, they weren't in the Fosters' pocket‚Äîat least not yet.

I spent hours polishing my resume and preparing for the interview, drawing on knowledge from both this life and my previous one. When the day finally arrived, I stood outside Vanguard's sleek glass headquarters, my portfolio clutched tightly in my hands.

""You can do this,"" I whispered to myself. ""This is your chance.""

The receptionist directed me to a conference room where I was greeted by a tall man with kind eyes and a firm handshake. Ryan Mitchell was younger than I expected, perhaps in his mid-thirties, with dark hair and an understated confidence that immediately put me at ease.

""Miss Young,"" he said, gesturing to a chair. ""I've been looking forward to meeting you.""

Something about him seemed vaguely familiar, though I couldn't place where I might have known him before. Had our paths crossed in my previous life?

The interview began conventionally enough, with questions about my education and experience. But when Ryan asked about my ideas for the future of AI security, I saw my opening.

""Actually,"" I said, pulling out my tablet, ""I've developed a blueprint for an ethical AI security algorithm that I believe could revolutionize how we approach data protection.""

I launched into my presentation, explaining the framework I'd designed‚Äîa system that could identify security threats without compromising user privacy. As I spoke, I watched Ryan's expression transform from polite interest to genuine excitement.

""This is... remarkable,"" he said when I finished, leaning forward. ""Most applicants come in here talking about what they've done. You're showing me what could be possible.""

He studied me with newfound intensity. ""Where did you learn to think like this?""

I met his gaze steadily. ""Some lessons come from experience. Others from necessity.""

Ryan nodded slowly, as if he understood more than I was saying. ""Miss Young, I don't need to see any more. I'd like to offer you a position on our AI research team, effective immediately.""

My heart soared. This was it‚Äîthe first step toward building a life the Fosters couldn't touch.

""I accept,"" I said, unable to keep the smile from my face.

\* \* \*

My first day at Vanguard was a whirlwind of orientation meetings, paperwork, and introductions. By lunchtime, my head was spinning with new information and faces. As I searched for an empty table in the cafeteria, a friendly voice called out to me.

""You look lost! First day?"" A woman with bright eyes and a quick smile waved me over. ""I'm Lena Hanson, AI security division.""

""Samantha Young,"" I replied, setting my tray down across from her. ""And yes, very first day.""

""Well, you picked a good place to land,"" Lena said, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Ryan doesn't usually fast-track new hires like he did with you. You must have really impressed him.""

Over lunch, Lena filled me in on everything the employee handbook didn't cover‚Äîwhich managers to avoid, where to find the best coffee, and how to navigate the complex office politics. There was something refreshingly genuine about her that made me feel I could trust her‚Äîa rare feeling in my new cautious existence.

As we walked back to our department together at the end of the day, a sleek black car pulled up at the curb outside the building. The door swung open, and a familiar figure emerged, her designer heels clicking against the pavement.

Olivia Livingston.

My blood ran cold as she approached, her predatory smile fixed on me. Lena tensed beside me, clearly familiar with Olivia's reputation.

""Well, well,"" Olivia purred, her eyes raking over me dismissively. ""Samantha Young. I heard you'd crawled out of the gutter and into a real job."" She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. ""Congratulations on escaping poverty‚Äînow show me what real talent looks like... if you have any.""

Before I could respond, she brushed past us, the scent of her expensive perfume lingering in the air like a toxic cloud.

""What was that about?"" Lena asked, wide-eyed.

""Old history,"" I replied, watching Olivia disappear into the building. Her presence here couldn't be a coincidence. The Fosters and Livingstons were already making their move‚Äîand Vanguard was their next target.
