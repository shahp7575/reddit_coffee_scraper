Biohackers on TikTok. Self-help bros on YouTube. Your friend who microdoses shrooms and thinks he’s a productivity god. But most of the advice out there? Garbage. It’s either placebo hacks or regurgitated motivational quotes. The worst part? Most of it completely ignores how the brain actually works.

That’s why \*[The Rich Roll Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/neuroscientist-andrew-huberman-on-changing-your-biology/id582272991?i=1000553148808)\* episode featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman hit so different. Huberman’s not another tech bro with a ring light. He’s a Stanford neuroscientist who studies performance, motivation, and the brain \*in real time\*. This post unpacks the real science-backed tactics from that episode, plus extra gems from top research and books. It’s not about grinding harder. It’s about working \*with\* your brain, not against it.

These tools won’t turn you into a cyborg overnight. But they \*will\* give you the edge to show up more focused, more calm, and more consistent.

Here’s the cheat code

**Use sunlight as your brain’s ON switch**

\* Huberman raves about this constantly. Morning sunlight (within 60 minutes of waking) triggers a rapid increase in cortisol, not the “stress” hormone you think, but the \*alertness\* hormone.

\* This sets your circadian clock, boosts your dopamine baseline, and increases mental clarity for the next 10–12 hours.

\* \*Why it works:\* A 2022 paper in the journal \*Neuron\* confirms that light exposure strengthens the suprachiasmatic nucleus (your brain's circadian command center), controlling hormone release and cognitive performance.

\* Even five minutes of \*natural\* light is better than two cups of coffee. Window light doesn’t count. Get outside.

**Leverage the dopamine cycle to avoid burnout**

\* Dopamine doesn’t just make you feel good. It creates \*drive\*. The trick is to control when and how it spikes.

\* \*Huberman’s key point:\* Don’t “stack” dopamine with caffeine, music, and social media to fire yourself up. That leads to a crash.

\* Instead, do hard tasks in a dopamine-neutral state. Then reward yourself \*after\* with something enjoyable. This builds discipline without depleting your motivation system.

\* Referenced in: Anna Lembke’s book \*[Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X)\* reports how over-stimulation reduces the brain’s baseline dopamine, making everything feel harder. Resetting this helps people regain focus and energy.

**Get your body involved BEFORE your brain wakes up**

\* Thinking your way into focus doesn't work. Physical state \*drives\* mental state.

\* Huberman recommends a 5-15 minute “physiological sigh” walk—short, deep inhales through the nose followed by a long exhale, while walking slowly. This calms the autonomic nervous system.

\* It reduces cortisol, increases vagal tone (which signals safety to the brain), and improves readiness without over-amping your system.

\* Backed by research in \*PLOS Biology\* showing how breath and movement regulate the prefrontal cortex, which controls decision-making and focus.

**Train your brain to crave friction**

\* Huberman shares a study where Navy SEALs were taught to reframe stress as \*readiness signals\*. Instead of “I’m anxious,” they were trained to say, “My body is preparing to perform.”

\* This cognitive reframe activates the anterior cingulate cortex, boosting adaptive control and learning under pressure.

\* Peak performance isn’t about calm. It’s about being alert \*and\* clear. This comes from interpreting stress as useful.

\* Also referenced in Kelly McGonigal’s \*[The Upside of Stress](https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934)\*, which supports that how we \*perceive\* stress affects physiological outcomes more than the stress itself.

**Block focus like a sniper, not a sponge**

\* Don’t chase “flow state.” Build the container for it.

\* Set 90-minute blocks with zero interruptions (no phone, no tabs, no background music). Take a 5-10 min break after—preferably with movement or light visual distraction.

\* This structure is based on the ultradian rhythm, the brain’s natural focus/rest cycle.

\* Research from the \*University of Illinois\* shows that breaking focus with short rests resets attention and improves task accuracy over time.

**Take \*non-sleep deep rest\* (NSDR) seriously**

\* NSDR = Guided meditation, Yoga Nidra, or lying in silence with slow breathing.

\* Huberman claimed NSDR can help “recover” dopamine and focus after mentally intense work. Big claim, but neuroscience supports it.

\* A 2023 \*Sleep Medicine\* review found NSDR increased theta brain waves and aided memory consolidation, especially when done midday.

\* It’s free. You don’t even have to believe in it. Just try 10 minutes post-lunch and feel the reboot.

**Know when to quit the grind**

\* Huberman isn’t about nonstop hustle. He teaches \*cyclical intensity: push hard, then pull back. Your brain needs cycles of effort and recovery.

\* Overtraining mentally (just like in the gym) leads to reduced neural plasticity and increased anxiety.

\* Cal Newport’s \*Deep Work\* also emphasizes structure over volume. It’s not about working more. It’s about working smarter.

This stuff isn’t gimmicky. It’s how elite performers, athletes, and creatives actually train their brains. And most of it is free. No supplements, no tech toys.

If you want performance that lasts years, not just a week, this is the playbook worth stealing.

# The Art of the Blend: Crafting Your Perfect Coffee Experience

There’s a unique magic to a perfectly brewed cup of coffee—the rich aroma filling the kitchen, the warmth of the mug in your hands, the complex flavors unfolding with the first sip. This daily ritual often finds its peak expression in a well-crafted coffee beans blend, designed not just to combine, but to harmonize, creating a profile greater than its individual parts.

At Intelligentsia, our approach to crafting the ideal coffee beans blend begins with our pioneering Direct Trade philosophy. We forge deep, years-long relationships with farmers, often paying well above Fair Trade prices, not just for ethical reasons, but to secure the most exceptional, nuanced coffees from around the globe. This allows us to select specific single origins with distinct characteristics—be it a bright, floral Ethiopian or a rich, chocolatey Colombian—that harmonize beautifully when blended. Take our legendary Black Cat Espresso, for instance. It's meticulously crafted to yield a syrupy body, balanced acidity, and classic notes of dark chocolate and stone fruit, specifically for the unique demands of espresso extraction. And because every blend is roasted-to-order and shipped immediately, you receive it at peak freshness, ensuring the intended flavor profile shines through in every cup.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our commitment to roast-to-order means your blend is crafted specifically for you, not pulled from a warehouse shelf, guaranteeing peak flavor.

1qkh59y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1qkh59y/flat_hunt_turned_into_an_alleged_scam/,Flat hunt turned into an alleged scam,"I’m posting this as a cautionary tale because this didn’t *look* like a scam at all — until it was too late.

In late **December 2025**, I was flat-hunting and did what thousands of us do: posted in a **Facebook Flat & Flatmates group**. A guy named **Utkarsh Bhamre** replied. He sounded normal. Professional. Helpful.

He sent property photos, details, and said he’d found the place via **99acres.com**. Nothing felt rushed. Nothing felt shady.

I even **visited the property in person**.  
Then I **met Utkarsh face-to-face** at *The Coffee Project in Viman Nagar*. We sat down, talked things through, and decided to proceed. That meeting is the reason my guard was completely down.

Over the next few days, I transferred a total of **₹65,000 across 6 UPI transactions**.  
The money was described as **deposit-related** and one small amount because he said he was temporarily short on balance.

Then the excuses started.

He claimed he had transferred the money onward but that the transaction “reversed.”  
He said his UPI had limits.  
He said he’d “do it in some time.”  
Calls started going unanswered. Messages were seen but ignored.

By **31 December**, things were clearly wrong. I went to the **local police station**, and an officer contacted him directly. After that, Utkarsh finally responded — calm, confident — saying he’d transfer the money shortly.

He didn’t.

On **1 January**, I asked for the full amount back. I even shared a QR code. He said he’d send it.

Nothing came.

While trying to figure out what was going on, I searched his name on Facebook — and that’s when my stomach dropped. I found a **post from someone else alleging the same pattern with the same person**.

At that point, it stopped feeling like a misunderstanding and started feeling like a **pattern**.

The police called him a few times — each time he picked up with the same calm, practiced lines: a new excuse, a promise to transfer “**shortly**,” and a plea about technical limits or reversals. Every call ended the same way: a **fresh reassurance, no money**. At one point the PSI told me privately, “I don’t think he’s in a mindset to return this.” That was the moment it stopped feeling like a mistake and started feeling deliberate. The station tried to help, but without the kind of quick forensic action that freezes accounts, words stayed words.

I’ve preserved **screenshots of all UPI transactions, chats, IDs he shared, and the Facebook post**. Everything has been documented and shared with the appropriate authorities.

1qkgvpm,https://i.redd.it/fcbgznfsy0fg1.jpeg,Playing for Keeps: Finding Love Beyond the Lies,"I was dragging my suitcase up the stairs when I saw her—some girl slipping out of our apartment door.


Black oversized sweater sliding off one shoulder, nothing but YSL heels on her endless legs. Pepper Rogers. The bassist from Dante's band. Twenty-two, gorgeous, and apparently very comfortable in my boyfriend's apartment.


My stomach dropped. I pressed myself against the hallway wall, praying she wouldn't see me.


Seconds later, Dante appeared in the doorway. Shirtless. Water still dripping down that perfect torso I used to worship with my hands.


He tossed a Chanel bag at her feet like it was nothing.


""Here.""


Her whole face lit up. ""Holy shit, Dante! I've been dying for this bag!"" She launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. ""Where'd you get it?""


""Paris. Last trip.""


""You're amazing, baby!"" She was all over him, pressing kisses to his jaw, his neck.


When she got too clingy, I saw his face change. That flash of annoyance I knew so well.


""Yeah, okay. You should probably head out.""


She pulled back with this pouty little smile. ""Wow, harsh. Two seconds ago I was 'baby,' now you're tossing me out?""


But she wasn't really upset. She grabbed the bag, blew him a kiss. ""Whatever. Call me later, yeah?""


The second she left, I stepped into view.


Dante's eyes went wide for maybe half a second before that trademark smirk slid into place.


""Jesus, you scared me. A heads up would've been nice.""


I stared at him. At the fresh bite marks scattered across his collarbone like some twisted art project.


""It was late,"" I said quietly. ""Didn't want to wake you.""


The lie burned my throat.


He pulled me inside, acting like I hadn't just caught him red-handed. ""I'm starving. Cook something, will you?""


He dropped onto the couch, grabbed the remote. Same old Dante. Same old routine.


I stood there, frozen.


""What?"" He glanced over, irritated. ""Why are you just standing there?""


Then his expression shifted. That cocky grin I used to find charming. ""Oh, I get it. You missed me.""


He got up, moved behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist. His lips found my neck, hands already sliding under my shirt.


""Let me remind you what you've been missing—""


Those guitar-calloused fingers that used to set me on fire now felt rough, invasive.


I pulled away. Hard.


God, I used to be obsessed with his body. That face was literally the reason I'd made a fool of myself chasing him for months.


But right now? After seeing him with her? I felt sick.


Dante wasn't used to being rejected. His jaw tightened.


""What the hell is wrong with you?""


That's when I saw it. A torn black stocking twisted in the carpet.


Dante followed my stare. Something flickered across his face.


The silence stretched between us like a blade. He lit a cigarette, bit down on the menthol bead until it popped.


""Look, her lease was up. She had nowhere else to go.""


He took a long drag. ""It's not what you think.""


I wanted to laugh. Or scream. Or both.


This wasn't the first time. Hell, it wasn't even the tenth time.


Dante was a player—always had been since the night I first saw him three years ago. My friend had dragged me to this dive bar to see his band, raving about how ""insanely hot"" the lead singer was.


I'd rolled my eyes. Until Dante stepped onto that tiny stage.


Head down, tuning his guitar, black hair falling into his eyes. Just jeans and a faded t-shirt. But when he looked up—those golden eyes catching the stage lights—every woman in that room stopped breathing.


Including me.


The music was incredible, but I didn't hear a single note. Just my heart hammering against my ribs.


After the show, I did something completely out of character: I fought through a sea of groupies to get his Instagram.


Dante gave his handle to everyone. Why wouldn't he?


But somehow, a year later, all those other girls had given up. Only I was still there, still trying, still hoping.


Maybe he kept me around out of pity. Maybe I was just convenient. The girl who never asked questions, never made scenes, never demanded more than he was willing to give.


Because deep down, I knew the truth: Dante had never actually loved me.


He liked that I was easy. That I cleaned up his messes. That I forgave him every single time he cheated.


He'd told me straight up I wasn't his type. Said he was only with me because I ""didn't cause drama.""


He'd even joked about leaving me when someone better came along.


And I'd stayed. Made excuses. Convinced myself his scraps of attention were enough.


""You promised,"" I whispered, staring at that ruined stocking. ""You said you wouldn't do this anymore.""


His laugh was cold, cutting. ""Did you actually buy that bullshit?""


He stepped closer, blowing smoke in my face. His eyes were cruel, predatory. ""What are you gonna do about it, Katrina? Huh?""


""You don't like it? There's the fucking door.""


Those words. Always those same words.


They used to destroy me. Used to send me crawling back, apologizing, begging him not to leave.


But something had shifted tonight. Something had finally broken.


""I'm going to bed."" I turned away.


His hand clamped around my wrist, tight enough to leave marks. ""We're not done here.""


I yanked free, my skin burning where he'd grabbed me. ""Yes, we are.""


The door slammed so hard behind him that the walls shook.


I collapsed onto the couch and pulled out my phone with shaking hands.


Mom had texted the family group: ""Sweetheart, you're 27 now. Time to think about your future. My coworker's son is lovely—a pediatrician. Want to meet him over the holidays?""


My boss had sent a message too: ""Katrina, we need someone to run the new branch in Washington. You're wasted in your current role. Interested?""


Washington. Home. A chance to start over.


All the signs pointing toward the same inevitable conclusion.


I closed my eyes, feeling something crack open inside my chest.


I did love Dante. Had loved him desperately, foolishly, completely for three long years.


But I also knew, with painful clarity, that he would never be the kind of man I could build a life with.


Now it was time to choose.


Chapter 2


Dante didn't come home that night. For the next few days, he vanished completely—ignored my texts, sent my calls straight to voicemail. When I kept trying, all I got were red exclamation marks.


He'd blocked me. His signature move.


This wasn't new. Dante was the king of silent treatment, and every single time I'd had to beg and grovel for days before he'd even acknowledge my existence.


But this time I was drowning in work handovers and job transitions. I didn't have time to chase after his wounded ego.


I was booking my flight to Washington when my phone buzzed.


Marcus. Dante's drummer and closest friend.


The background noise hit me like a wall—shrieking laughter, bass thumping so hard I could feel it through the speaker.


""Katrina! Thank God. Dante's completely fucked up. Can you come get him?""


Of course he was.


Dante lived for this scene. The clubs, the chaos, the endless stream of admirers. His trust fund made sure he never had to worry about real life—the band was just his expensive hobby.


I'd asked him once why he didn't take over his family's business empire. He'd laughed, bitter and sharp. ""Why fight over scraps with my dad's bastard kids when I'm inheriting everything from my grandfather anyway? Let them tear each other apart.""


No ambition. No drive. No point in building anything together.


Whenever I got promoted or closed a big deal, his eyes would glaze over with boredom.


""What's the point of killing yourself for peanuts?"" he'd said once. ""I spend more than your monthly salary on a single night out.""


We were from different worlds. Beyond the sex, we had absolutely nothing in common.


I didn't give a shit about his soul. He was just a beautiful distraction.


He ignored everything real about me. I was just convenient—the girlfriend who never caused problems.


It would make this easier. No messy emotions when it ended.


I told Marcus I'd be there, hung up, and stared out at the city lights bleeding into the darkness.


My flight details glowed on my phone screen. Tomorrow morning, 8 AM.


Honestly? Part of me wasn't ready for this to be over. Dante and I had incredible chemistry, and with all the stress of starting over, I'd been hoping for one last goodbye fuck.


But if he wanted to burn it all down in public, fine.


His choice.


...


The club was exactly what I expected—overpriced drinks, underaged college girls, and Dante holding court like some kind of rock god.


He was surrounded by his usual collection of admirers. All gorgeous, all young, all desperately competing for his attention.


There was Pepper, of course, practically glued to his side. Some redhead I didn't recognize giggling at everything he said. A brunette in a dress that barely qualified as fabric.


I spotted the rest of his crew scattered around the VIP section. Marcus behind his drum kit, looking uncomfortable. Jake, their bassist, trying to keep the peace. Even Tommy from their management company was there, probably babysitting.


God, I felt ancient looking at these girls. All that fresh-faced confidence, unmarked by years of compromise and disappointment.


I remembered Dante's words from last month: ""You're twenty-seven, babe. Maybe it's time to invest in some work? You know, refresh things a little?""


No wonder he was over me. Why settle for tired when you could have endless variety?


I didn't announce myself, just stood at the edge of their circle watching the show.


When Dante's eyes finally found mine, he looked right through me like I was invisible.


Then he turned back to Pepper, who was swaying against him, cheeks flushed pink from alcohol.


""One more shot, baby,"" she purred, trailing her fingers down his chest.


Dante's smile was sharp as broken glass. ""Drinking's boring. Why don't you make it interesting?""


""How?""


He didn't answer, just stared at her with those predatory amber eyes.


It took Pepper maybe two seconds to catch on. Her face lit up like Christmas morning as she tilted her head back and drained the whiskey in one smooth gulp.


Then Dante grabbed her face and kissed her.


It wasn't romantic. It was vicious, punishing, meant to hurt. Pepper arched back to take it, tears streaming from the corners of her eyes as alcohol spilled from their joined mouths.


When they finally broke apart, a thin string of saliva connected their lips.


The crowd went absolutely wild.


My chest felt hollow, like someone had scooped out everything inside and left me empty.


This was deliberate. Performance art designed specifically to destroy me.


Punishment for walking away that night. For not crawling back and apologizing like I always did.


When I finally stepped into the light, the noise gradually died.


Dante looked up at me, his expression completely blank.


""What are you doing here?""


I stared at that perfect face—the same face I'd traced with my fingertips countless times, kissed until my lips were bruised, worshipped like he was something sacred.


When we were alone together, tangled in sheets and drunk on each other, we used to whisper that we loved each other.


Did this hurt?


Yeah. It fucking destroyed me.


But I'd known who he was from day one. A beautiful, selfish creature who'd never change.


My voice came out shaky, broken. ""That was cruel, Dante.""


He leaned back in his chair, somehow managing to look down on me even though I was standing.


Same bored expression. Same cruel little smile.


""Cruel? You can always leave. Nobody's forcing you to be here.""


I stood there, silent, counting all the times he'd thrown that threat at me.


Fifty? A hundred? More?


Marcus shifted uncomfortably. ""Dude, come on. That's fucked up, even for you.""


Jake nodded. ""She doesn't deserve this shit, man.""


Tommy just looked embarrassed, like he wanted to disappear.


Even they could see he'd crossed a line.


I was crying now—real tears, not the fake ones I'd planned. They burned as they fell.


When that first tear hit the floor, I saw something flicker across Dante's face. His fingers twitched around his cigarette.


But he didn't speak. Just kept staring at me with those cold, beautiful eyes.


That's when I said it:


""Okay, Dante.""


""Let's break up.""


The color drained from his face. For a split second, I thought he might actually lose his shit completely.


Instead, he laughed—but it sounded like grinding glass.


""Fucking finally. About time you grew a spine."" His voice was venomous. ""Just remember, I don't do second chances. When you realize what a massive mistake this is, don't come crawling back like a pathetic little bitch.""


""I won't."" I wiped my face, surprised by how steady my voice sounded.


Then I turned around and walked out without looking back.


I spent that night erasing every trace of him—deleted his contact info, threw away his photos, packed everything that mattered into two suitcases.


The next morning, I caught the first flight back to Washington.


As the plane climbed above the clouds, I pulled out my SIM card and dropped it in the trash bag.


Chapter 3


I cut Dante out of my life completely. Posted a few carefully crafted late-night Instagram stories—the perfect ""heartbroken but healing"" aesthetic—then genuinely forgot he existed.


Life in Washington settled into a surprisingly comfortable rhythm. I threw myself into the new job, mastered the company dynamics, and started going through my parents' endless parade of potential husbands.


The balding twenty-eight-year-old programmer sitting across from me was still talking:


""I really believe women should prioritize family after marriage. What I'm saying is, once we tie the knot, you should quit working. Don't be so ambitious. Focus on taking care of the home. Behind every successful man is a supportive woman...""


He droned on while I smiled politely at my coffee, fighting the urge to dump it over his receding hairline.


When he finally paused for breath, he stared at me expectantly. ""So did you get all that? Any thoughts you want to share?""


I kept smiling. ""Nope, I think I'm good. But Mr. Stewart, I don't think we're a great match. Maybe we should call it here.""


I walked out while he muttered something about women over twenty-five being ""expired goods"" and other delightful commentary.


Mom had introduced me to dozens of guys since I'd been back. Some were actually impressive on paper—doctors, lawyers, successful businessmen.


But God, after Dante, they all felt so... bland. Like switching from cocaine to decaf coffee.


I was still dealing with that disappointment when I walked into our Monday morning meeting to find everyone sitting in dead silence around the conference table, looking like they were about to face a firing squad.


I slid into my seat and whispered to Richard, our VP: ""What the hell happened? Did we lose a major client?""


He leaned over, his voice barely audible: ""The chairman's son just landed. Word is he's using our branch as a testing ground before taking over the whole empire.""


""This Amaury guy is Harvard Business School, worked at Goldman for years, then went independent and made a killing in private equity. Hundreds of millions in one deal. The old man had to beg him to come back for years. Total predator—be very fucking careful what you say.""


A few minutes later, the conference room door opened.


The man who walked in wore a perfectly tailored black suit, a cashmere coat draped over his shoulders like he owned the world. Someone immediately stepped forward to take it, and his Italian leather shoes clicked once against the floor before stopping.


I looked up, and every single person in that room—including me—forgot how to breathe.


It wasn't just that he was attractive. It was the energy he carried.


Pure authority. The kind of presence that made you want to sit up straighter, speak more carefully, prove you deserved to be in the same room.


He wasn't trying to intimidate anyone—he didn't need to. Command just radiated from him like heat.


When I finally managed to focus on his actual features, I nearly lost it again. Sharp cheekbones, dark hair styled back to show off those incredible bone structure. His mother was supposedly French nobility, and you could see it—that perfect blend of European elegance and something indefinably exotic.


He was stunning. Maybe even more beautiful than Dante, but in a completely different way. Where Dante was all lazy sex appeal, this man was sharp edges and controlled power.


""Apologies for the delay. Flight from New York was late.""


He acknowledged his tardiness without making excuses, then took his place at the head of the table like he'd been born to sit there.


""I'm Amaury de Brissac. I'll be serving as general manager moving forward. I've reviewed our financials and operational data. Starting with Richard, I want detailed reports on your department's performance over the past year and current project status.""


One by one, my colleagues stood up to present, and Amaury systematically destroyed every attempt to bullshit him.


""I'm not interested in corporate speak,"" he said calmly when our marketing director tried to spin some obviously failed campaign. ""I don't appreciate being misled. I prefer honest communication, but if that approach doesn't work, I'm happy to explore alternatives.""


He hadn't raised his voice. Hadn't even frowned. But every person in that room was sweating.


My hands were actually trembling when I stood up, but thankfully I'd been meticulous about my prep work. The past year had been my best performance yet—major client acquisitions, successful project completions, measurable revenue growth.


As I spoke, something shifted. My nervousness faded, replaced by the confidence I felt when discussing my actual expertise.


This was where I belonged. This was what I'd worked my ass off to achieve.


Amaury listened without interrupting, and I caught something that looked like approval in those sharp eyes.


When I finished and sat down, he nodded once. ""Excellent work, Katrina. This is the standard I expect going forward.""


The relief in the room was palpable.


...


Ever since Amaury took over, everything changed.


He eliminated dead weight—both projects and people—while somehow landing three major contracts in his first month. We were working longer hours, but our compensation had increased across the board.


The office dynamic shifted too. Everyone was sharper, more focused. No one wanted to be the weak link.


Especially the women.


The younger female employees were practically vibrating with interest. I couldn't blame them—Amaury was like catnip for ambitious twenty-somethings with daddy issues.


Two of the new hires apparently thought they were living in some romance novel.


Jessica from accounting tried the ""challenge him in meetings"" approach, getting increasingly argumentative during presentations.


Sarah from HR went with the classic ""oops I spilled coffee on your expensive shirt"" move, then actually tried to touch his chest while ""cleaning"" it.


Jessica was gone by Tuesday.


Sarah didn't make it to lunch.


After that, the flirting attempts stopped, but the break room gossip reached new heights.


""Do you think he's ever been in a serious relationship?"" Emma from legal was saying as I grabbed coffee Thursday afternoon.


""Are you kidding?"" Lisa from marketing rolled her eyes. ""Look at him. Women probably line up around the block.""


""But has anyone ever seen him with someone? Like, ever?"" Emma persisted. ""Maybe he's one of those guys who's married to his work.""


""I'd volunteer to change that,"" Sarah's replacement, Jenny, chimed in with a dreamy expression. ""Did you see him in that gray suit yesterday? The man is built like a fucking Greek statue.""


I listened to their speculation while stirring sugar into my coffee, feeling something stir in my chest.


Without Dante cluttering up my thoughts, Amaury seemed like a much more interesting option.


This man—I wanted to try him on for size.

I (41F) have basically always been overweight. When I hit puberty I gained about 45 pounds and went from a lean pre-teen to a ""big"" high-schooler, and have been an American size 10/12/14/16 ever since. I've had periods where I was exceptionally active... I was on the swim team... cross-country... rowing team... worked as a hiking guide... Crossfit 6x/week... you name the workout/diet and I've tried it. I've occasionally been smaller and very strong, but I've never been a ""normal"" BMI or size.

As an adult I had finally come to accept my body and my appearance, but last year I gained \*another\* 30 pounds or so after a major illness and round of steroids... and I feel like it's given my entire family (and seemingly everyone I know) license to talk to me about my weight constantly and it's bringing up some wild PTSD. How I'm doing, what ""easy trick"" I should try, how making a small change (just use milk instead of half and half in your coffee!) will unlock the secret to this lifelong fucking battle. How I should try a semiglutide (I have), how it's probably my thyroid (it's not), how I have a gluten intolerance (I don't), what workout I should try (oh, Pilates and light yoga helped you lose all the baby weight? Love it...), on and on and on. I. AM. SO. SICK. OF. IT. It's making me neurotic and depressed.

One of my best friends has gotten pretty heavy (300+ pounds) and you know what? I get it. I kind of get just leaning in and at least *enjoying* a meal or a drink or a vacation. I work so hard to look so mediocre, to \*still\* not feel pretty, worthy, or able to hang with friends who ski/mountain-bike/club etc. At some point what's the point of the calorie counting, the workout tracking, the money invested in personal trainers, diet drugs, apps, betting on myself to lose weight, posting a picture of myself naked inside the fridge... the self-loathing and feeling so fucking frustrated with those friends who seem so self-righteous about their success and make being overweight seem like such a moral failure. I've put off having a baby because I can't imagine gaining even more weight... and now I'm worried I've run the clock in pursuit of a body and life I'll never have.

Last night my mom sent me some stupid weight loss video ""hack"" on Facebook Messenger, and something inside me just fucking snapped. I don't know why it was such a trigger, but I just started sobbing uncontrollably. I feel like I'm grieving this life I never got to live - where I was thin and accepted and not uncomfortable for 95% of my adult life. Where I got asked to homecoming. Where I didn't secretly hate my wedding photos. Where I didn't worry about my sweaty thigh touching the person next to me on the airplane. Where I could shop with my friends and not have to ""love"" the accessories at Forever 21 because I couldn't fit in any of the jeans. Where I got the job instead of the less qualified (but much thinner!) intern. I cried for hours and hours. It felt like I was 13 again sitting at the doctor with my mom asking ""What should we do?"" and having the doctor wave a patronizing finger and remind me to ""move more and eat less""... as I was going to swim practice every morning at 5 am and coming home to a salad and a run with dad, and then getting made fun of in gym class because of my huge ass.

I'm not sure what the point of this is... ATM I'm sitting here filling out my calorie counting app (did I eat half an apple or the whole thing? Did I underestimate that peanut butter?) wondering what instrument or language I could have perfected in the hours of my life I've wasted trying to losing weight. I am so tired. I don't think I can do this. I just feel... done",19,1769141606.0,loseit,11,0.91,False

Like ever. As adults they literally cannot operate a washing machine. I resented it my whole childhood and I still resent it now.

My brother just got kicked out by his girlfriend after they had a baby because shocker he doesnt help with anything. So he moved in with me.

Within like a week my clean peaceful house turned into a disaster zone. Im talking sunflower seed shells spit on the floor. Chewed gum stuck behind the coffee machine. Dirty dishes hidden around the house. Snack wrappers shoved in random places.

 Cigarettes put out on my floor even though I asked him not to smoke inside at all. Clothes everywhere including the living room. Leaving the fridge open.

 Leaving food out until I found maggots. Three separate times I found maggots.

I told him to get it together or get out. So he started ""trying"" but doing everything as badly as possible. 

 Putting bowls in the dishwasher so they fill with gross water. Mopping with the same nasty water for days. Putting laundry in the washer then leaving it for me to finish. Throwing food in the fridge so it spills everywhere. He put syrup upside down on the top shelf with no lid and it coated my entire fridge. Took me hours to clean. Then he tells me hes trying and Im just being a bitch.

So I snapped but I knew I couldnt just throw him on the street. Instead I divided the house.

I got him dishes from goodwill and locked all my cabinets so hes eating off his own filthy plates.

 Anything left on the floor gets one day then I throw it away. Same with his dishes if they sit in the sink growing mold. I locked my bathroom so he has to use the basement one which I refuse to clean. If his laundry sits in the washer more than 8 hours I dump it wet on his bed. Any trash he leaves out goes on his bed. If he leaves food out I let it rot then toss it. He destroyed my fridge again with juice upside down barely closed so I mopped it up with towels and dumped everything including my ruined food on his bed then put a lock on the fridge.

He says Im terrorizing him. I say I was forced to mother him as a kid without any actual authority and I refuse to do it anymore as an adult. Some lessons gotta be learned the hard way. Im not gonna gently teach a grown man how to close a fridge door.

1qkgp4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qkgp4d/miracle_man/,Miracle Man,"I clocked in. I went into the bathroom to adjust my suit. Also, I needed to take my morning shit. When I took the promotion to detective; I thought it'd be like the movies. No, it was just endless paperwork and uncomfortable suits.

I poured myself a cup of crappy drip coffee. No matter how much sugar I poured in. No matter how much cheap cream I poured in. The coffee tasted like ass. I was running on 4 hours of sleep.

The captain came over and slammed a stack of paper. I glanced at my badge for a second. My face instinctively made a scowl. Behind me were two police officers squaring up. They wanted to beat each other's asses. An average day in the Boston police department.

“You gotta case Cahter! Some crazy mathafacka named Miracle Man,” my captain screamed in my face, “multiple dead bodies! Deal with it! By the way! Stahp drinking all da caaffee!”

“What?”

My brain was still booting up from the early rise. He handed me the file, but I almost dropped it. He shook his head in an annoyed fashion.

“Wake da fack up! Ain't no daycare! Go and investigate this mathafacka miracle man piece of shit!” He shouted and stormed off.

I sighed. I lazily read the file. I was mid-yawn as I scanned the file. I sipped my shitty coffee. I got up to pour myself more coffee. I walked out of the break room.

*Bam!*

I bumped into my partner. He came running in like a bay outta hell. I spilled my coffee on myself.

“Fuck!” I shouted.

“Good morning!” He spurted, “you gotta watch where you're going, Mike. You always like this in the morning.”

“Whatever,” I mumbled to myself, “good fucking morning, Bruce.”

“Did you read the miracle man file? Crazy! their lungs were filled to the brim with coke,” he told me, “this maniac has been running around killing people in the most insane ways possible.”

I turned into the break room and he followed. I poured myself another cup of coffee. The captain saw me and started screaming at me. I ignored him.

“You are drinking all damn caaafffeeee! Bring your own shit!” He screamed as I walked past him, “you make damn pot! I am tired of brewing the caaafffeeee for your ungrateful pricks! Can I get a thank you!? No! I don't!”

“Sorry, Captain,” I muttered while rolling my eyes.

I walked over to my office and took a seat. I drank the caffeine sludge I poured myself. I decided to read the folder on this so-called, “miracle man.”

My eyes widened once the coffee hit. The folder got more and more absurd as I read on. What a way to start my morning….

People's lungs filled with cocaine, crucifixion, people melting, heads exploding, and sudden drowning with no body of water around. Yes, sudden drowning, there was a part where a strip club was flooded with water. All of the victims were criminals and gangs, but the weirdness of it all was jarring. 

A miasma of crazy shit. The only thing that tied everything together at each crime scene was a book. The miracle man had a sketch. I took a look and saw that he was a very young man. Was this guy some kind of vigilante?

“You see it? You think it's the wizard?” My partner said, “The only deaths that are comparable.”

I jumped. His voice startled me. I looked up trying to keep my composure.

“No… Bruce,” I responded, “the wizard usually doesn't use books. All the reports point to that. It still could be him… I don't know. I guess we gotta interrogate the witnesses…”

From my knowledge from reports of the wizard is that he chants, dances, and weird shit happens\*.\* There is always a joke, punishment, or irony with the wizard. Miracle man seems random. The wizard wishes he can be this random.

I looked through all my wizard files. All the sketches were different. I had a file filled with all of the weirdest supernatural-like cases I have worked on. Of course, they give me the weird fucked up case.

Every face was different, but they all had pitch-black eyes. The miracle man's eyes were as blue as the skies. None of the wizard's sketches looked like him. 

In fact, none of the supernatural creepy weirdos match this kid. Yes, I said kid, the sketch matched a baby smooth face of a young man. He looked to have potential in his teenage years. 

This will be easy; I think. We have a face in the sketch, we have witnesses, and video. The only two problems is we gotta find a name. The other problem, weird cases like this that are supernatural-adjacent, is proving he did it. How do you prove all the magical shit in the file?

“Another nick name for this maniac is holy diver cause he loves using water,” my partner suddenly spouted, “we have a collection of witnesses.”

Yet again, I was startled. My partner pisses me off. He never says excuse me when he talks. He just says shit.

“So… he has been around,” I replied.

“Well…. He has been active for months.”

“Why haven’t we caught this guy yet?” I asked while scratching my tired eyes, “the sketch makes him look like a young boy. How old is he? Do we have a name?”

“Don’t know,” Bruce shrugged, “we had the sketch for a few weeks now and we can’t really tie all the crimes together due to their… strangeness. All we know is that witnesses remember the young man in every crime scene. The only one alive is the bartender. He agreed to cooperate and talk about the incident.”

“Wait…. Why is this my case!?” I grumbled under my breath, “they just threw this shit at me. They should’ve caught this guy a while ago. A bunch of fucking chumps.”

“Well… it is our case, and…. Every detective that has taken the miracle man case…. Has disappeared or ended up converted,” he told me.

“Converted!? What the fuck does that mean?” I tilted my head in confusion, “they joined a cult!?”

“Yes… they all sent their resignation letters to follow miracle man… then, they disappeared into the Aether or purgatory or hell or heaven or I honestly don’t know,” he answered, “the rumor is that when they find miracle man… he converts them and promise some crazy place… or another dimension… then, send them… I guess. There are a lot of theories.”

“How do you know so much,” I told him, “we just started this shit.”

“Well… it is the talk of the department… you don’t listen in the cafeteria?” he told me, “Oh… yeah… you are antisocial and like to be held up in your office…”

“Yeah, unless they send my ass to the field… why the fuck should I leave,” I responded, “anyways, where is the witness and let’s go to the crime scene. This shit should’ve been settled a while ago.”

“Well… maybe, we should go to the crime scene first, this is fresh,” Bruce said, “by the way, I ride shotgun.”

“Let’s go,” I snickered as I downed the rest of my coffee.

We talked out of the police department into the cold Boston air. The cold air hit me like a ton of bricks, but I stood my ground. We both climbed into the police cruiser. Off we went to the dingy, shady bar that had the crime scene. 

We cruised through the cold Boston streets. The car ride was mostly chill and quiet. Except for my partner constantly fiddling with the radio. I groaned every time he switched the channel.

“Just pick a damn channel,” I groaned, “I have worked with you for years and you always do this.”

“I need to find the perfect song.”

He landed on some romantic, overtly sexual RnB song from the 1970s. I was not happy. I frowned the entire way to the bar. 

He smiled and just nodded to the music. Does he not understand the discomfort this creates. We finally made it to the ugly hole in the wall bar and I recognized it.

“Hmmm, the drop-off spot we have been watching for a while,” I said, “they usually got gang activity… why the hell would this miracle man target a place like this?”

“Yup… what surprises me is the nature of the crime. You’d think it’d be a drive-by shooting, but no…. It was actually worse,” Bruce told me, “Did you read the report.”

“Yeah, it is messed up.”

I got out of the car and realized why they gave me the case. I tend to deal with the more bizarre, crazy cases. I decided when I was in school to study a specific type of Bachelors. I studied criminal psychology. 

There were a few special courses dealing with the paranormal. I took those classes, and now, I have a double bachelors. I know that wasn’t too wise; I should’ve gotten my masters or PhD. I could’ve written a book and made millions. Now, I deal with gremlins, wizards, possessions, and other batshit crazy things.

We walked through the doors and were met with police officers, a forensics team, and many others. The ground was covered in cocaine dust. The chairs were flipped over. The ground was littered with broken bottles. 

They took pictures of the bodies as they were strung out on the ground. A headless corpse of a middle aged man sat against the wall. The dust covered many of their faces. It was apparent that the dust escaped through their mouths and noses. 

I just stood there in shock at what I was seeing. I knew right then and there why they gave me this case. Honestly, they should’ve given it to me earlier. Right when I read about the strip club being flooded with water.

“So… what do you make of this?” one of the officers asked me, “you think it's a weird magical monster?”

“Uhhh…well…”

A young woman from the forensics team went up to me. She was in her late 20s with her hair tied in a brown bun up top her head. She wore a pants suit and was tall. 

“Ah, Detective Mike Mason, you saw the…. mess … didn’t you,” the woman asked, “what do you think?”

“Uhh… well.”

“We have DNA of the suspect, so we are close to finding the guy,” she said, “it is from a glass of soda that the bartender gave to the\*…. miracle\* man…. Apparently…. He asked for a Shirley temple… no alcohol.”

“Uhhh…. well, who are you?”

“Oh, sorry, I’m Kathy,” she reached her hand out and I shook it, “this guy has been running around causing trouble for a while. Hopefully, you don’t convert and disappear… like my ex…”

“Your ex? He was one of the detectives that worked on this case?”

“Yup.”

I walked around the premises and scanned the room. My shoes are making prints on the dust covered floor. I took a good look at the corpse with powder filling his mouth. Their faces were white as a cake. Their bellies distended.

“Their stomach and lungs seem to be filled to the brim,” Bruce whispered to me, “I think that’s why we got the case…. Maybe…. They assumed it wasn’t supernatural… but they saw this.”

“How did the guy’s head explode?” I asked as I approached the corpse sitting next to the wall, “was he shot.”

“I don’t think so…. There aren't any bullet fragments,” Kathy answered, “his head just blew up.”

“We gotta get a report from the coroner asap,” I said, “we need an autopsy,” I said, “where is the witness?”

They pointed over to a tall, muscular man with a beard. He wore tattoos on his sleeve. I actually recognized him. He was one of the members of the gang that ran the place. I was surprised that he was talking.

“Mornin’ Scott,” I told him as I approached, “so… they say you saw this so-called, ‘Miracle man,’ can you tell me anything?”

“Oh… hey… Mike,” he grumbled, “he walked in and started talking about miracles. We thought he was a magician…. Then, he started reading from this book, and well… my friend's head exploded.”

“Ok… what happened after? You guys roughed him up? Throw him out?”

“We just threw him out.”

I just stared blankly at him. He took a deep breath. He just looked down.

“There has to be more…. Look around you…. There is more. The guy’s head exploded, then what?”

“You mean my *friend, Randy,”* he hissed as he glared.

“I don't mean to offend, but there are dead bodies everywhere, what else happened?”

“He came back crying and wailing, we thought we saw the last of him, then he read from his book again…”

“Why was he crying?”

“He felt bad about killing my friend. He said that he was going to resurrect my friend,"" Scott responded, “and then, everyone just…. Well…. They started puking up the…. Powder, then they dropped one by one. He came up to me and asked for a Shirley Temple. He continued to cry… then just left.”

“What did he look like? Does he look like this?”

I raised the sketch to his face and he nodded.

“Yup, he looked like a young teenage guy, probably 18 to 20, with a baby smooth face, and he was actually…. Really nice,” Scott told me, “he actually tipped me weirdly enough. He did talk about how he had miracles and that his…. The new book showed him everything. He also mentioned that the book is his new dad…”

“Wait…. What? The book? Tell me more about the book.”

“The book…. Yeah, he kept on reading it, chanting from it, and reading about people's lives,” Scott answered, “I think he started making the patrons mad when he read about people's private details. Weird shit.”

“What did it look like?”

“The book had a face on it.”

“A what?”

“A face.”

“Did it move? Talk?” I said, “what did it look like?”

The fact that I had to ask questions about a book with a face was strange. I realized right then and there that this is only going to get weirder. The bartender just shuffled around; looking at the ground.

“Kind of… he showed the book off to me and the book talked to me,” the bartender said.

“About what?""

“Don't know… it was in another language.”

“Well… we are gonna need a witness testimony.”

“Sorry. I can't.”

“Why not? You're scared they'd see you as a snitch?”

“Yes,” he glared at me, “they don't know that this is a freak accident.”

“Ok… whatever.”

I walked away towards the front door. I have always hated their dumb code of gang honor or ethics or whatever.  The bartender just stared at me as I left. I felt his gaze as I passed through the front door. I realized that he wasn’t afraid of a rival gang, so I walked back in.

“Hey!”

“Yes,” he said as he slowly raised his head as he sipped a bottle of water that the cops gave him.

“Are you afraid of a rival gang?”

“No….”

“Weird… then who?”

“The second time the miracle man came back in…. He came back with a crew of dudes in hoodies…” he explained, “he should have never come back in after what Randy… umm… all I have to say is that the miracle man was taken outside… and he shouldn’t have been able to come back in… crying for everyone to repent… the hooded figures wore hoodies with the weird book face on the backs of their hoodies.”

“What…” I replied, “I am gonna need security footage.”

“Ok…”

At that moment, I thought that maybe this guy was the wizard or some supernatural being. They must’ve taken him outside to beat his ass or something. I needed to confirm this. This can’t be the wizard because he always operated alone. He pushed people, but didn’t preach like that.

Later, I went back to the department and watched the footage. I was shocked and confused to say the least. Me and my partner just stared as the chaos unfolded. A young white man with a baby smooth face that looked to be in his teens walked into the shady bar. 

He started to talk to everybody. He had a large dumb grin upon his face; he wore shorts, clean brown loafers, a collared polo shirt, and short hair. He hugged a large book close to his chest. He started to talk to the patrons of the bar which wasn’t a good idea. 

They got more and more angry as he talked. He read from his book and that only made them madder. He looked and acted like some weird youth group pastor. I assume he was preaching. Eventually, they knocked the book out of his hands and dragged him outside.

After they were done; they all went back to the bar. One of them tried to pick up the book and dropped it suddenly. He jumped back and stared at his shaking hands. He looked to be anguishing in pain. He kicked the book and they all continued drinking. The guy wrapped his hand up in some kind of cloth.

I switched to and watched the security footage of the front. I watched as they beat the miracle man mercilessly. I will admit that the beating was nasty, but that wasn't the weird part. The front door opened a few minutes later.

“What the fuck is that!?” My partner exclaimed as he pointed at the screen, “there’s a small animal running to the weirdo!”

I watched as something small scurried towards the miracle man. I paused and zoomed in. The book was running towards the miracle man. My partner and I scratched our eyes. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.

“Why does the book have small legs?” I asked, “we need to switch back to the inside of the place.”

We just stared at the book after the gang member just dropped the book. Everybody just carried on drinking and ignored the book. The book sprouted small legs and literally just stood up slowly. It sprinted to the front door like a little gremlin.

“Have you seen that before, Mike?” Bruce asked me.

“Nope, never seen that.”

We switched to the footage outside after seeing the book scurry. The book sprouted little arms and started waving its arms around. It carried a little wand. A group of men in hoodies wearing face masks surrounded the miracle man. 

They raised their hands up. The miracle man was beaten to a pulp. Both of his legs were broken, a broken arm, and his face beaten to an unrecognizable mess.

The miracle man’s arms and legs started to bend at odd angles. After his arms were fixed; he grabbed his face. Then, his face went back to normal when he released his face. His legs straightened and contorted, then fixed, it looked grotesque. 

He slowly stood up, grabbed the book, and held it up like a baby. He started kissing and hugging it lovingly like a mother with her child. Him and his cult-like posse walked back into the bar. I paused the footage and just stared at the screen.

“What… the…fuck?” I asked.

“This is probably when the crazy shit goes down.”

We watched as the miracle man and his crew walked in. The patrons started getting furious. One of the men started to scream at the miracle man. They even brought guns out and pointed them at the miracle man. The miracle man then started to read from his book.

*Pop!*

A man’s head popped like a balloon that was standing up against the wall. He leaned back and fell to the ground. They started firing at the hooded figures and miracle man. They were turned to Swiss cheese by the gang's firepower. The book stood back up to perform another spell.

They started to be raised back from the dead. The patrons started to panic. The miracle man picked the book up. He raised it up over his head proudly.

He read from the book again. That is when the bar patrons started to drop their weapons. They coughed up and puked the white powder. They clawed at their throats. They writhed and shook uncontrollably on the ground. Eventually, they stopped moving.

The miracle man started to cry like a madman. He got on his knees and openly sobbed. The hooded men just stood there and watched. 

The miracle man walked over to the bar; this is when I assumed he ordered his Shirley temple. He handed the bartender a few dollars and walked out the place. Me and Bruce’s eyes were agape and our jaws dropped. The lunacy that unfolded in the clips was beyond our imagining.

By the end of our shift, we parted ways and went to our homes. I laid in bed just thinking about the crazy shit I saw. I have seen many monsters in my work, but never a walking book. 

A walking book with arms with a magical wand. A book with a face that can potentially talk. a “healing”, whatever that was. The deaths in that video and in the reports are amongst the weirdest I've seen.

It was around 2 AM when I received the call. I was almost asleep, not really, but I tried. I clumsily grabbed my phone and answered.

“Another incident,” Bruce said.

I made it to the crime scene and I was… confused. It was in the middle of the street in one of our most rowdy areas. A bunch of bodies, but most of them were alive, though they were knocked out. There were rows upon rows of paramedic trucks carrying people who were just too drunk.

“Ok, why are you calling me here?”

“Well…” the police officer said, “they all got drunk at the same time.”

“Ok…. so, it’s a Friday night and we are surrounded by nightclubs,” I told him.

“Yes, but they dropped at the same time after the, ‘miracle man,’ read a verse from his weird book,” he said, “they all have dangerous alcohol levels…. Way beyond the normal levels.”

“And multiple car accidents at the intersection.”

I turned to the voice behind me and saw the firefighter chief. A tall blonde man with a sharp jawline. He pointed behind himself and I saw a massive pile up of vehicles.

“All of them became severely intoxicated or were missing their heads,” the chief told me.

“Did their heads pop like balloons?”

“Yes, how’d you know?”

“I knew because this is a part of the investigation….. It is supernatural in nature. I can’t tell you anymore.”

“Is it the hoodie cult I have heard so much about?”

“I can’t say.”

I just walked the street and surveyed the area. Paramedics picking up absurdly intoxicated people passed out. I walked in and out of night clubs to see wet floors. My shoes got soaked. The water was always ankle height.

Were there bodies? 

Yes, they were face down floating in the water. The walls were wet. These places looked like they were flooded.

“They said that a sudden wave suddenly appeared and flooded the place,” the officer explained.

We stood in front of a supermarket that was close by. Well, the supermarket just disappeared. I was just happy nobody was inside the place when it just vanished. The market was closed.

“We have video of the market,” the officer told me.

A witness walked over to me covered in a blanket to show me the video. He raised his phone up and pressed play. Miracle man throws the book on the ground angrily. His hoodie followers looked shocked.

“Please! Our prophet! That was a miscalculation!” One of them pleaded.

“Please, don't give up.”

“We love you.”

“Ah!! Dang it! I always fudge it up!” The miracle man cries, “I just can't figure this dang thing out!”

“Please! Show me more,” a hooded figure said as he pulled down his hood.

It was Scott, he started following the miracle man. My eyes widened. I watched as a miracle man picked up the book. 

He gave it a kiss, a really long uncomfortable kiss. Then, he hugged the book as it whimpered. Yes, the book whimpered like a dog.

“Alright, fine, just you guys are so awesome, I really feel bad about those people back there, but they are in a better place. The book told me. Anyways, we will now go through time!”

Then, the miracle man started to make strange noises, a few latin phrases, greek, arabic, and something else. He then stopped to read the book. He looked confused for a second.

“Ummm…. I gotta start over again, those weird ancient symbols can be a pain in the butt.”

He started again to recite the spell. He repeated the Arabic phrases, Latin, and Greek, then started a language that sounded like gibberish. He then pulled a small knife out and cut himself in the forearm. He dripped blood in the book's mouth.

“Ok, so a portal is supposed to appear, then we can go through time, so we can fix the mess back there.”

A few seconds passed in the video; there was nothing. The hooded figures just stood there awkwardly. The miracle man scratched the back of his head nervously.

*Boom!*

A giant wormhole appeared over the supermarket. A sea of writhing tentacles and teeth latched onto the supermarket. They watched in awe and horror as the supermarket was destroyed. 

Then, it was lifted up into the large portal. The portal disappeared after taking the market. The cult members started cheering, dancing, and clapping.

“Yes! That is a miracle! Amazing!” one of them said while crying.

“Ummm… I just wanted a portal for us,” miracle man admitted, “I need to work on my pronunciation. My dyslexia can be such a pain sometimes.”

The video ended. I just stood there in shock. This was way above my paygrade. They need to send in the military after this dude.

“We… need… that video,” I said clumsily.

“Am I getting paid for the video?” the witness replied.

“Just keep the video, we are gonna need it, that is evidence, so probably not,” I answered.

“That’s bullshit,” he snapped back, “I can give it to the news for a couple thousand!”

“You can be arrested for withholding evidence,” I told him in the most serious tone I can muster, “so, you will give us that video.”

My partner and I went to the station. We loaded up on coffee and got to work. We have multiple videos, a face, DNA from the crime scene, and witnesses. Now, we need a name, a name, wait, how do we not have a name yet?

We went to the forensics team and they were able to find a match. His name was Jimmy Durst. This case was easy, too easy, that is the problem. This, “miracle man,” is a total idiot, and that is the problem. 

I rushed. I needed to take the book away from him. I realized that powerful incompetence might be the truest evil here. Finally, sunlight started to seep through the windows.

*Crash!*

The ground shook for a few seconds. A loud sound permeated the station. I turned the TV on to the news. My heart was pounding and I felt every thump. I was horrified at what I saw. I knew, right then and there, that I needed to get that fucked up book. 

The supermarket dropped out of the sky onto a neighborhood.

I didn't need to go and find him. The miracle man just turned himself in. Jimmy Durst just stumbled in wearing a t-shirt, shorts, and sneakers. He was weeping like a toddler as he handed himself in.

“Put the book in the box…” I told him.

“But, booksy will get lonely,” he told me.

“Just do it.”

I didn't want to touch the thing. I felt the book's hatred and glare from a mile away. I was afraid it was gonna bite my hand off. We booked him and took him to his cell.

We took him into the interrogation room; I’ll admit that I didn’t know what to expect. He gave me the creeps because he was so childish, young, and inexperienced. He was only 19 years old and lived with his parents. 

Apparently, he kept the book a secret from his parents. When the videos of his, “miracles,” went viral, his parents told him to turn himself in. He admitted to all of this as we booked him. 

Everybody, including me, felt a strange sense of irony and pity for the young guy. He was sniffling and crying the entire time. At the same time, his crimes far outscale anything I have seen.

Yes, there were viral videos, I was too occupied by my investigation to notice the countless videos exploding on the internet. That morning, everyone was watching videos of sudden accidental crucifixion. Miracle man would always pronounce the words wrong and somebody just gets hung up. 

He would scramble to reverse it, but even a few seconds like that is brutal. If it lasts even a few minutes, then death can occur. Yes, nails were involved, that was the hard part to watch. Other videos showed massive tentacles, horned monsters, explosions, drowning, hangings, and heads popping.

The videos were always uploaded, then removed, then uploaded again. Some videos were ridiculous, a man has his clothes zapped off, or a woman grows 10 feet tall. Then, there were the healings, and those were strangely nice. He finally got some spells right and cured some kid’s cancer. 

People wanted to meet a miracle man to be healed and healed them. Some healings didn’t go so well. A massive secret cult formed around him on the dark web. Most of these videos circulated throughout the back ends of the internet.

“Where did you find the book?” I asked Jimmy.

He fumbled in his chair and sniffled. He struggled against his handcuffs. He looked at the table insecurely like a child that was in trouble.

“I went on a trip to Israel and bought it from a gift shop in Jerusalem,” he replied, “It was a pilgrimage. I was depressed. My girlfriend cheated on me and broke up and I needed something for my depression. Around that time, I stopped believing until I wandered off away from the pilgrims at night.”

I realized that this is some international geopolitical type shit. This started becoming way above my paygrade. They needed to call the men in black or some shit. 

“Ok…. what did you find?”

“A gift shop tucked in the corner of some weird old alley. Nobody cared about me. I needed meaning…. So I went in.”

“And?” my partner said.

“I met Father Thulhu…. I looked around and I saw a book with a face. It called to me. It smiled at me. It told me it loved me. It told me the truth.”

“What truth?”

“That it can perform miracles and it did. I bought the book. The owner, Father Thulhu, actually advised me not to buy. It required expert skill and finesse.”

“Father Thulhu?” I raised a highbrow. 

“Yeah, he was super old, blue, his beard moved a lot…. It looked like an abstract painting or something. No eyes, did he, I don't remember, I had jet lag, no sleep, and I took my anti-psychotic/anti-depressant meds. Those things always screw with my head,” Jimmy looked up and frowned, “anyways, he warned me of buying the book and I bought it anyways.”

“Ok…. The miracles. Why did you perform miracles? Or spells?”

“Hmmm…. I wanted to help people…. Well.”

“Well what?”

“They kept on getting messed up, but I thought practice makes perfect…. But… but….when I saw the supermarket fall…”

“Yeah?”

“I felt really bad… all the other times I was able to reverse it or the book would assure me, but this time it didn't.”

“Assure you? Like comfort you?” My partner piped up.

“Yeah, booksy would tell me everything would be all right, there is a special page with the future, history of people, and the afterlife. I knew where they went after death. They were better off.”

My partner rose up and slammed his fist on the table. Jimmy jumped back in fear, but the restraints held him. My partner wanted to lunge, but I got in-between.

“You did some fucked up shit! You psycho! You *killed a lot of people!”* my partner shouted.

“I'm sorry! I really am! I didn't think it was that bad!” Jimmy cried out.

“Everyone calm down,” I pointed to my partner, “you gotta leave. *Now.”*

“This is bullshit!” My partner shouted.

“Now!”

My partner left the interrogation room. Me and Jimmy just sat there staring at each other. The real villain was whoever Jimmy met in Israel. This Father Thulhu and the evil book.

“Look… maybe, the book lied to you.”

“The book never lies! The book converted me to his new religion! I just wanted to show people the new religion! I wanted to show the truth that booksy showed me!”

“The truth? What truth? What religion? What did booksy even want?”

“The truth must be shown through booksy's pages. Through miracles. One day, we were hoping to print millions of copies and sell them worldwide. Then…. All these terrible things happened….”

I realized that I was gonna go nowhere with this kid. I left the room and just stood in the hallway. I walked up to my partner and a few other cops.

“Just take him to his cell,” I told them.

I decided to just sit at my desk and stare at my black computer screen. The sleep deprivation was starting to get to me. I couldn't believe it. This book and this kid ended up being a cataclysm worse than anything I've seen.

“Hey… Mike…. Some priest named Father Tim wants to talk to you. He has information on the suspect.”

“So what? We already got the guy,” I slowly raised my head to my partner.

My deeply sunken eyes fixated on my partner. Behind him was an old priest. He wore a brown coat over his priestly outfit and he was very old. He had wrinkles up and down his face. His white hair was disheveled. He looked worried. I squinted at him. Of course, an actual priest is involved.

“We need to take the book to the Vatican *now!”* Father Tim suddenly shouted, “You don’t understand the evil that book will unleash! That boy had the *Necronomicon! We must submerge the fucking book in holy water! I need to perform rituals now!* Where is it!?”

“Yo…. Father…. Calm down? You wanna get arrested too?” I rose to my feet as I told him off, “You can’t just barge in here and shout at officers!”

“You don’t understand! That book will kill us all! We must remove it from the city!”

“Hey… Father…. Calm down…” Bruce said to the priest, “the book is evidence. We can’t just remove it.”

I took a deep breath and grabbed the bridge of my nose. I closed my eyes for a split second to think.

“You don’t understand! Did you see the videos of the evil book! The pope himself wants to put the book away! We need to seal the damned thing!” he screamed, “he saw the video and knew *exactly what that thing was!”*

“You need to calm down, tell us, do you even know the kid?”

“Yes… I led the pilgrimage to Israel… I didn’t know he possessed the book, he hid it from me,” Father explained, “he stopped going to church… and then, I saw the videos. The pope saw the videos. Everyone did. The entire church is in panic. We need to deliver the book to the Vatican now. It is basically the Defcon 1 of evil spiritual artifacts from the afterlife.”

“So… the book can end the world or some shit? This is way above my paygrade, dude,” I replied.

“Where is the book!? Give it to me! I must deliver it now!”

*Boom!*

An explosion rocked the entire station, and I was thrown to the ground. My partner was knocked unconscious. The priest was thrown into a wall. The entire department was thrown into disarray.

I got up and ran to the cellblocks. There I saw him. Jimmy Durst hugging the book and kissing it. A giant hole was blown into the wall by the hoodie wearing cult members.

Those hoodie wearing cult members swarmed into the department with their rifles/pistols drawn. I ran after them firing my weapon. They fired back and I ducked behind a wall. 

A fire fight broke out. All of the officers shot at the cult members and they shot back. Total insanity in the department.

I peeked my head around the corner of the wall to see what was happening. A few cult members dropped to the ground after getting shot in their heads. The miracle man just recited some verses. Then, they just stood up like nothing happened.

I heard it, the book was *laughing.* Its evil bellowing laugh invaded all of our eardrums. The book was laughing at our demise. The thing knew or thought it was going to win.

They escorted the miracle man out of the hole. He was crying the entire time. He hugged that book tightly against his chest as he ran out of the hole.

I ran after them; I saw them get into a van. The blazing sun of the morning temporarily blinded me. I forgot that I was operating in the morning. 

The all-night bender really set me back. I needed to chase after them. I ran to my cruiser and got in. 

I dashed through the city after the white van. The entire police force of the city chased the van. A helicopter took the skies to watch the van as it sped.

The van swerved along the highway and dodged incoming police cruisers. We needed to get to this guy before he got to wherever they were taking him. Eventually we started to get close to the harbor. He was going to the harbor.

This was going to be bad. They finally made it to the harbor and got out of the van with the miracle man. Fishermen and regular people stared; they were obviously scared and confused. 

We surrounded the van, the miracle man, and his cult members. Me and the officers got out of our cars. We drew our weapons, we ducked behind our cruisers, and pointed our guns at the miracle man. They raised and pointed their rifles at us.

“Put your hands up!” the police officers screamed, “Drop your weapons!”

“Miracle man! Give us one more! Give us your greatest of all!” one of the hoodie wearing men pleaded with the miracle man, “show them your greatness!”

The miracle man was frantic. His breathing was erratic and he clutched the book to his chest. He kept shaking his head and his eyes darted all around. He surveyed the area.

“Please! Don’t do anything reckless!” I shouted from behind my cruiser, “we can work this out Jimmy!”

“Wait! Wait! Just one more miracle!” The miracle man cried out, “the book wants it!”

Jimmy raised the book to the sky.

*Splat!*

Jimmy fell to the ground after a swat sniper shot him right through the chest. The blood splattered out the hole in his chest. The officers started to open fire on the cult members. Citizens ran from the harbor. They fired back, but it was of no use, they were outgunned. 

Finally, this nightmare was over.

“*Ahhhhhh!!!!”* the book started to scream.

The ear-piercing screech made us all drop to the ground. I covered my ears as the book rattled my brain. The book sprouted legs and arms. It suddenly stood up and hovered over us. The book face contorted in anger.

“*Ahhhh!!!”*

The book picked Jimmy up and started to heal the wound in his chest. Jimmy started to weep as his chest moved. His chest basically rearranged right before our eyes. Then, the book dropped him on his back, he twitched on the floor. 

The book just reverted back to its original form. The miracle man just laid there convulsing. We all just stood behind our cruisers and pointed our weapons. 

None of us approached the body. Then, he slowly got up. He bent over and picked up his book. He looked around and scanned the area.

“Alright! One more miracle!” The miracle man preached to us, “I will baptize the sun!”

“Drop the book!” the officers screamed, “and put your hands up!”

“Hold fire!” a captain shouted.

I couldn’t believe that we didn’t pump him full of bullets, but it would have made no difference. The book would’ve resurrected him. The book was going to get its way. Miracle man started to read the book and started to recite in many languages. He spit on the ground and cut himself.

“I am finished…. I screwed it up again!” he shouted.

“Fire!”

We finally did it; we blasted him apart with bullets. He fell to the ground, and this time, the book didn’t save him. We didn’t care if he was just a suspect. 

Him and his cult attacked us. I had enough of his ass. The officers started to get closer to the body of the so-called, ""miracle man.” 

I stepped from behind my cruiser and walked slowly towards his body. My pistol was drawn. I inched closer to his mangled body. I looked down at the book. The book was smiling and it winked at me.

“*This time…. The miracle worked,”* the book spoke to me.

“What the fuck!?” I exclaimed in shock. 

The sun went out and we were thrusted into pitch-black.",1,1769141398.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’m not looking for anything super high-end — just a stylish, comfortable, and durable set that’s great for relaxing, entertaining, or enjoying my morning coffee outside.

I’ve seen some really cute and affordable options, but I’m curious about the quality, comfort, and how well they hold up over time (especially in different weather conditions).

Ideally, I’m looking for a set that’s:

* Comfortable with supportive cushions
* Weather-resistant and low-maintenance
* Easy to assemble and move around
* Stylish enough to elevate a patio or deck
* Affordable without feeling flimsy

If you’ve purchased any of these or have experience with **Better Homes & Gardens patio furniture** in general, I’d love to know how it’s held up for you — especially over time or in rain/sun-heavy areas. Also open to tips on cushions, storage, and whether it's worth buying the furniture covers or extra accessories.

I just moved here in September from Texas. I’m looking for a local monogamous relationship (not primarily focused on sex despite the title, I mainly just thought it was funny lol. But it is important that there’s mutual horniness/attraction too).

⚠️DEALBREAKERS & DISCLAIMERS:⚠️

\\- local only, monogamous, child-free, 24-30ish, politically left; I don’t drink/smoke, had top surgery, was on T for awhile.

\\- was on T for 2 years, now off T as of July 2025 and still somewhat adjusting back to factory settings

\\- autistic/adhd — I need alone time, I burn out easily, I’m not good with eye contact, my communication style is very autistic, and I forget things easily. If you’re also neurodivergent that’s a plus, provided we are both aware of our limits and able to manage in healthy ways.

\\- VERY BIG on healthy communication, conflict resolution, and openly talking about the tough stuff; being respectful at all times, and talking about mental health and openly working on ourselves, saying sorry, adjusting and changing and growing.

\\- Hard leftist, socialist/anarcho-communist & anticapitalist (if you’re apolitical or moderate we’re not compatible) — ACAB, fuck ICE, housing is a human right, no borders, no gods no masters

——\\\*\\\*\\\*⭐️ INTERESTS ⭐️\\\*\\\*\\\*——

\\- art (especially as it intersects with philosophy, activism, and politics)

\\- history (especially queer history, US labor history, and global socialist/anarchist history)

\\- poetry (Mary Oliver is the goat)

\\- mental health, neurodivergence, neuroscience behind why my brain works the way it does

\\- listening to political and history podcasts

\\- cuddling, holding hands, being physically clingy (in a cool way) and affectionate (this is why LOCAL is critical for me!)

\\- visiting museums, coffee shops, cafes

——\\\*\\\*\\\*⭐️ ABOUT YOU ⭐️\\\*\\\*\\\*——

\\- Age 23-30ish (some flexibility)

\\- Monogamous

\\- LOCAL (like within \\\~20 miles of Minneapolis; I don’t have a car unfortunately so if you do that’s a huge plus)

\\-  Leftist or interested in learning about leftist politics strongly preferred (no apolitical or moderates please)

\\- Non-smoker preferred (flexible on substance use, we can talk about it, I don’t partake in anything and prefer you don’t around me)

When I’m out (coffee shops, gym, events), the men who approach me are usually not my type. The men I *do* find attractive will sometimes look or glance, but almost never come up to me.

Does being approached mostly by men you’re not attracted to mean that’s your “level” of attractiveness?  
Or do attractive men just approach less, feel intimidated, or assume you’re taken?

For women who consider themselves conventionally attractive , do you actually get approached by men you find attractive in real life? ( im talking men that many other women woudl also desire or find attractive)

1qkgi5q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkgi5q,"Post-Hookup Cigarette? Nah—Pre-Vanishing Rehearsal. Sorry, CEO's Secret Baby's Waiting.","Graduation night. Jasper Hawthorne and I hooked up one last time.


Afterward, he handed me a cigarette like always.


""Just so you know? I'm not marrying a girl who smokes after we fuck.""


My throat went tight. ""Why?""


He smirked.


""Quinn. I want someone pure.""


Then I ghosted his ass that night completely.


Five years later, he showed up as my new boss.


I handed in my resignation immediately, tried to bail before things got messy.


DIDN'T WORK.


He trapped me in his office, blocking the door.


""Five years, Quinn."" His eager eyes dragged over me.


""Wanna go again?""


I didn't even look up. Just grabbed my bag.


""Nope. Gotta pick up my kid.""


I wasn't pure enough, Jasper?


Good. You just made me your fucking nightmare!


...


The room went dead quiet.


Jasper froze. I tried to get off his lap.


He pinned me against the floor-to-ceiling windows, not letting me move.


That hungry look in his eyes? Gone.


Replaced by something cold. His usual cocky expression cracked.


He ground his teeth. ""How old is the kid?""


I stayed quie, then finally answered.


""Three.""


And we'd been broken up for five years.


This kid had nothing to do with him.


Obviously, Jasper knew that too.


I tried standing up again. This time, his hand let go.


As I reached the door, he spoke again, suspicion in his voice.


""Your file says you're single.""


I paused, steadied myself and turned back.


""Just got married recently.""


""Recently? And the kid's already three?""


I nodded, totally casual about it.


""Yeah. Shotgun baby.""


Jasper didn't say anything. His sharp gaze dropped to the cheap ring on my finger, and he let out a scoff.


I didn't give a shit, held my hand up right in his face.


The second I saw him about to lose it, I bolted.


That night, I collapsed on my couch and finally breathed out.


Sometimes? Lying is the best way to dodge a mess.


I'd grabbed that ring yesterday at a dollar store. Cheap. Effective.


I figured it was enough to kill whatever feelings Jasper had left for me.


Sure enough, next day my resignation got approved. HR came by personally to tell me.


One week to hand everything over, then I was out.


Normal resignations take a month. Mine? One week.


Not hard to figure out who pushed that through.


I nodded and started handing my work off to the new intern.


The new girl was sweet and eager. At least when I was training her, I never once paid for my own breakfast or afternoon coffee.


Right before clock-out, Wesley came up looking all apologetic.


""Hey Quinn, can I leave early tonight? My boyfriend's taking me to dinner.""


I hesitated—not because I couldn't let her go, but because I also needed to leave early to pick up my daughter.


When I didn't answer right away, she got anxious, pleading nonstop.


I gave in. ""Fine. Go.""


She lit up and immeditaly started packing her stuff.


""He''s on his way down now.""


I blinked. ""He works here?""


Wesley smiled all mysterious. ""Not exactly, he's—""


A deep, magnetic voice cut her off.


""You ready?""


Chapter 2


I froze.


If I'd never heard that voice before, I probably would've looked up out of sheer curiosity.


Too bad I knew it all too well.


For five years straight. In every nightmare.


On those nights when I couldn't sleep without pills, every damn word he'd ever said played on repeat in my head.


""Quinn, you're too innocent. I'm gonna ruin you.""


""Quinn, try smoking. Girls who smoke are hot. I wanna see a different side of you.""


And I fell for his coaxing and the teasing.


Sophomore year, I went from chasing Jasper to his booty call.


Eventually, I beat out all the other girls, and became his girlfriend for three whole years.


The day he accepted my confession, the weather was trash.


Howling wind, gray skies.


He'd just finished a date with a senior and dropped her off.


His car was parked right outside the girls' dorm.


Leaning on that little special treatment just for me, I went down and confessed.


For a second, even the wind seemed to stop. Like the world hit pause.


I waited.


Jasper turned to look at me, pulled out a cigarette and held it to my lips.


His eyes were dark—deep, dangerous, impossible to look away from.


Somehow, I leaned in and took it between my lips.


My mouth brushed his fingers, but he didn't pull away.


That teasing look softened into permission.


All he said was, amused.


""Good girl's not so good anymore.""


At the time, I was too far gone to get what he really meant.


Not until graduation—the last time he took me to a hotel, the last time we ever saw each other.


After we fucked, he handed me a cigarette like always.


""When I get married? I'm not picking a girl who smokes after sex.""


I swallowed hard. ""Why?""


Jasper smiled, smoke curling from his fingers. His tone dead serious.


""Quinn. I want someone pure.""


Tears burned in my eyes. I forgot how to breathe.


Pure.


He wanted someone pure.


Funny thing was, he used to say I was too pure, too good—


That it made me untouchable.


Now I finally got it.


Once I stopped being good? I became just another fuck toy.


Chapter 3


I snapped out of the memory, face blank again.


Wesley spun around, and practically skipped over to him.


Then she suddenly turned back, eyes worried.


""Quinn, aren't you picking up your daughter too? We can give you a ride.""


I opened my mouth to refuse, but Jasper cut me off—


He picked up my bag and strode straight toward the parking lot, leaving me zero chance to argue.


The car ride was weird as hell.


Silent except for Wesley chattering away.


Jasper tapped the steering wheel casually, barely responded to her.


But his eyes kept flicking to me in the rearview mirror.


Maybe sensing my awkwardness, Wesley tried small talk.


""Quinn, when you work late, does your husband pick up your daughter?""


I froze at the word ""husband,"" taking a beat to process.


Then shook my head. ""He's out of town. Not around much.""


She nodded like that made sense, but her eyes landed on that dollar-store ring on my hand.


""Is that your wedding ring? It looks kinda... faded.""


""Like one of those cheap ones you get online for ten bucks.""


""Oh! I didn't mean it like that. Don't get me wrong.""


Wesley turned around fast, apologizing.


But I caught the subtle sneer and that smug little superiority.


Fair enough. Her Hermès bag was worth more than my entire wardrobe.


I was about to say something when Jasper laughed.


He reached over and ruffled her hair, grinning with indulgence.


""You didn't say anything wrong—no need to apologize.""


Then his eyes met mine in the mirror, voice casual but pointed.


""Poor people love their pride. You're gonna piss someone off at work if you keep talking like that.""


He said it to Wesley.


But he really meant it for me.


A warning wrapped in fake concern.


I looked out the window and ignored him.


I'd heard this shit a thousand times when we were together.


That I wasn't good enough for him. I admitted it—our worlds were too different.


My family wasn't poor. But we were solidly middle-class.


The Hawthornes? Old money. Power. Connections at the top.


When we first got together, Jasper made it clear.


""Quinn, you can be my girlfriend. But you'll never be my wife.""


I knew. I always knew.


So I kept my feelings in check. Never crossed a line.


But when things got serious? I couldn't help it—I started hoping.


What if it worked out?


So right before graduation, I asked to see him.


He picked me up early that day.


The car stopped somewhere quiet on campus. The driver got out, waiting a few steps away.


I got shoved down in the backseat.


I was on top of him. His hands gripping my hips.


Sunlight filtered through the trees, blinding me.


An hour later, Jasper was leaning back, shirt damp with sweat.


I watched him and finally asked.


""Jasper... do you love me?""


I didn't ask if he'd marry me. I just wanted to know if he'd ever loved me at all.


He looked at me, playful eyes rare with seriousness.


""We're graduating soon.""


And at that moment, I understood.


Graduation was coming.


Time to break up.

My main problem is that I was forcing myself to fall asleep, and the more you do that, the less likely you are to sleep. I tried everything, until i came past a post of someone suggesting to force yourself to stay awake. So thats what i did. it was kind of  like exposure therapy. i was so afraid of not sleeping that i forced my self to do what im more scared of, which is not sleeping. so i would play movies, and when i would feel like my eyes were closing, i would force them to open. eventually, i would fall asleep. this was my only cure. I think the most HARMFUL thing i did regarding sleep was getting into the whole sleep wellness stuff. no phones. perfect temperature. no coffee. bla bla bla. sure, thats not wrong, but i used to (and do now) sleep with all these things. and focusing on habits to make my sleep better just made things worse, because i was still trying to control my sleep, which is the main problem.

anyways, to whoever is struggling with insomnia, i really feel for you, and i hope it works out, because it will. you will get out of it before you know it. Praying for you",2,1769140719.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1qkgfjk,https://i.redd.it/eiivzy4ev0fg1.jpeg,Playing for Keeps: Finding Love Beyond the Lies,"I was dragging my suitcase up the stairs when I saw her—some girl slipping out of our apartment door.


Black oversized sweater sliding off one shoulder, nothing but YSL heels on her endless legs. Pepper Rogers. The bassist from Dante's band. Twenty-two, gorgeous, and apparently very comfortable in my boyfriend's apartment.


My stomach dropped. I pressed myself against the hallway wall, praying she wouldn't see me.


Seconds later, Dante appeared in the doorway. Shirtless. Water still dripping down that perfect torso I used to worship with my hands.


He tossed a Chanel bag at her feet like it was nothing.


""Here.""


Her whole face lit up. ""Holy shit, Dante! I've been dying for this bag!"" She launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. ""Where'd you get it?""


""Paris. Last trip.""


""You're amazing, baby!"" She was all over him, pressing kisses to his jaw, his neck.


When she got too clingy, I saw his face change. That flash of annoyance I knew so well.


""Yeah, okay. You should probably head out.""


She pulled back with this pouty little smile. ""Wow, harsh. Two seconds ago I was 'baby,' now you're tossing me out?""


But she wasn't really upset. She grabbed the bag, blew him a kiss. ""Whatever. Call me later, yeah?""


The second she left, I stepped into view.


Dante's eyes went wide for maybe half a second before that trademark smirk slid into place.


""Jesus, you scared me. A heads up would've been nice.""


I stared at him. At the fresh bite marks scattered across his collarbone like some twisted art project.


""It was late,"" I said quietly. ""Didn't want to wake you.""


The lie burned my throat.


He pulled me inside, acting like I hadn't just caught him red-handed. ""I'm starving. Cook something, will you?""


He dropped onto the couch, grabbed the remote. Same old Dante. Same old routine.


I stood there, frozen.


""What?"" He glanced over, irritated. ""Why are you just standing there?""


Then his expression shifted. That cocky grin I used to find charming. ""Oh, I get it. You missed me.""


He got up, moved behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist. His lips found my neck, hands already sliding under my shirt.


""Let me remind you what you've been missing—""


Those guitar-calloused fingers that used to set me on fire now felt rough, invasive.


I pulled away. Hard.


God, I used to be obsessed with his body. That face was literally the reason I'd made a fool of myself chasing him for months.


But right now? After seeing him with her? I felt sick.


Dante wasn't used to being rejected. His jaw tightened.


""What the hell is wrong with you?""


That's when I saw it. A torn black stocking twisted in the carpet.


Dante followed my stare. Something flickered across his face.


The silence stretched between us like a blade. He lit a cigarette, bit down on the menthol bead until it popped.


""Look, her lease was up. She had nowhere else to go.""


He took a long drag. ""It's not what you think.""


I wanted to laugh. Or scream. Or both.


This wasn't the first time. Hell, it wasn't even the tenth time.


Dante was a player—always had been since the night I first saw him three years ago. My friend had dragged me to this dive bar to see his band, raving about how ""insanely hot"" the lead singer was.


I'd rolled my eyes. Until Dante stepped onto that tiny stage.


Head down, tuning his guitar, black hair falling into his eyes. Just jeans and a faded t-shirt. But when he looked up—those golden eyes catching the stage lights—every woman in that room stopped breathing.


Including me.


The music was incredible, but I didn't hear a single note. Just my heart hammering against my ribs.


After the show, I did something completely out of character: I fought through a sea of groupies to get his Instagram.


Dante gave his handle to everyone. Why wouldn't he?


But somehow, a year later, all those other girls had given up. Only I was still there, still trying, still hoping.


Maybe he kept me around out of pity. Maybe I was just convenient. The girl who never asked questions, never made scenes, never demanded more than he was willing to give.


Because deep down, I knew the truth: Dante had never actually loved me.


He liked that I was easy. That I cleaned up his messes. That I forgave him every single time he cheated.


He'd told me straight up I wasn't his type. Said he was only with me because I ""didn't cause drama.""


He'd even joked about leaving me when someone better came along.


And I'd stayed. Made excuses. Convinced myself his scraps of attention were enough.


""You promised,"" I whispered, staring at that ruined stocking. ""You said you wouldn't do this anymore.""


His laugh was cold, cutting. ""Did you actually buy that bullshit?""


He stepped closer, blowing smoke in my face. His eyes were cruel, predatory. ""What are you gonna do about it, Katrina? Huh?""


""You don't like it? There's the fucking door.""


Those words. Always those same words.


They used to destroy me. Used to send me crawling back, apologizing, begging him not to leave.


But something had shifted tonight. Something had finally broken.


""I'm going to bed."" I turned away.


His hand clamped around my wrist, tight enough to leave marks. ""We're not done here.""


I yanked free, my skin burning where he'd grabbed me. ""Yes, we are.""


The door slammed so hard behind him that the walls shook.


I collapsed onto the couch and pulled out my phone with shaking hands.


Mom had texted the family group: ""Sweetheart, you're 27 now. Time to think about your future. My coworker's son is lovely—a pediatrician. Want to meet him over the holidays?""


My boss had sent a message too: ""Katrina, we need someone to run the new branch in Washington. You're wasted in your current role. Interested?""


Washington. Home. A chance to start over.


All the signs pointing toward the same inevitable conclusion.


I closed my eyes, feeling something crack open inside my chest.


I did love Dante. Had loved him desperately, foolishly, completely for three long years.


But I also knew, with painful clarity, that he would never be the kind of man I could build a life with.


Now it was time to choose.


Chapter 2


Dante didn't come home that night. For the next few days, he vanished completely—ignored my texts, sent my calls straight to voicemail. When I kept trying, all I got were red exclamation marks.


He'd blocked me. His signature move.


This wasn't new. Dante was the king of silent treatment, and every single time I'd had to beg and grovel for days before he'd even acknowledge my existence.


But this time I was drowning in work handovers and job transitions. I didn't have time to chase after his wounded ego.


I was booking my flight to Washington when my phone buzzed.


Marcus. Dante's drummer and closest friend.


The background noise hit me like a wall—shrieking laughter, bass thumping so hard I could feel it through the speaker.


""Katrina! Thank God. Dante's completely fucked up. Can you come get him?""


Of course he was.


Dante lived for this scene. The clubs, the chaos, the endless stream of admirers. His trust fund made sure he never had to worry about real life—the band was just his expensive hobby.


I'd asked him once why he didn't take over his family's business empire. He'd laughed, bitter and sharp. ""Why fight over scraps with my dad's bastard kids when I'm inheriting everything from my grandfather anyway? Let them tear each other apart.""


No ambition. No drive. No point in building anything together.


Whenever I got promoted or closed a big deal, his eyes would glaze over with boredom.


""What's the point of killing yourself for peanuts?"" he'd said once. ""I spend more than your monthly salary on a single night out.""


We were from different worlds. Beyond the sex, we had absolutely nothing in common.


I didn't give a shit about his soul. He was just a beautiful distraction.


He ignored everything real about me. I was just convenient—the girlfriend who never caused problems.


It would make this easier. No messy emotions when it ended.


I told Marcus I'd be there, hung up, and stared out at the city lights bleeding into the darkness.


My flight details glowed on my phone screen. Tomorrow morning, 8 AM.


Honestly? Part of me wasn't ready for this to be over. Dante and I had incredible chemistry, and with all the stress of starting over, I'd been hoping for one last goodbye fuck.


But if he wanted to burn it all down in public, fine.


His choice.


...


The club was exactly what I expected—overpriced drinks, underaged college girls, and Dante holding court like some kind of rock god.


He was surrounded by his usual collection of admirers. All gorgeous, all young, all desperately competing for his attention.


There was Pepper, of course, practically glued to his side. Some redhead I didn't recognize giggling at everything he said. A brunette in a dress that barely qualified as fabric.


I spotted the rest of his crew scattered around the VIP section. Marcus behind his drum kit, looking uncomfortable. Jake, their bassist, trying to keep the peace. Even Tommy from their management company was there, probably babysitting.


God, I felt ancient looking at these girls. All that fresh-faced confidence, unmarked by years of compromise and disappointment.


I remembered Dante's words from last month: ""You're twenty-seven, babe. Maybe it's time to invest in some work? You know, refresh things a little?""


No wonder he was over me. Why settle for tired when you could have endless variety?


I didn't announce myself, just stood at the edge of their circle watching the show.


When Dante's eyes finally found mine, he looked right through me like I was invisible.


Then he turned back to Pepper, who was swaying against him, cheeks flushed pink from alcohol.


""One more shot, baby,"" she purred, trailing her fingers down his chest.


Dante's smile was sharp as broken glass. ""Drinking's boring. Why don't you make it interesting?""


""How?""


He didn't answer, just stared at her with those predatory amber eyes.


It took Pepper maybe two seconds to catch on. Her face lit up like Christmas morning as she tilted her head back and drained the whiskey in one smooth gulp.


Then Dante grabbed her face and kissed her.


It wasn't romantic. It was vicious, punishing, meant to hurt. Pepper arched back to take it, tears streaming from the corners of her eyes as alcohol spilled from their joined mouths.


When they finally broke apart, a thin string of saliva connected their lips.


The crowd went absolutely wild.


My chest felt hollow, like someone had scooped out everything inside and left me empty.


This was deliberate. Performance art designed specifically to destroy me.


Punishment for walking away that night. For not crawling back and apologizing like I always did.


When I finally stepped into the light, the noise gradually died.


Dante looked up at me, his expression completely blank.


""What are you doing here?""


I stared at that perfect face—the same face I'd traced with my fingertips countless times, kissed until my lips were bruised, worshipped like he was something sacred.


When we were alone together, tangled in sheets and drunk on each other, we used to whisper that we loved each other.


Did this hurt?


Yeah. It fucking destroyed me.


But I'd known who he was from day one. A beautiful, selfish creature who'd never change.


My voice came out shaky, broken. ""That was cruel, Dante.""


He leaned back in his chair, somehow managing to look down on me even though I was standing.


Same bored expression. Same cruel little smile.


""Cruel? You can always leave. Nobody's forcing you to be here.""


I stood there, silent, counting all the times he'd thrown that threat at me.


Fifty? A hundred? More?


Marcus shifted uncomfortably. ""Dude, come on. That's fucked up, even for you.""


Jake nodded. ""She doesn't deserve this shit, man.""


Tommy just looked embarrassed, like he wanted to disappear.


Even they could see he'd crossed a line.


I was crying now—real tears, not the fake ones I'd planned. They burned as they fell.


When that first tear hit the floor, I saw something flicker across Dante's face. His fingers twitched around his cigarette.


But he didn't speak. Just kept staring at me with those cold, beautiful eyes.


That's when I said it:


""Okay, Dante.""


""Let's break up.""


The color drained from his face. For a split second, I thought he might actually lose his shit completely.


Instead, he laughed—but it sounded like grinding glass.


""Fucking finally. About time you grew a spine."" His voice was venomous. ""Just remember, I don't do second chances. When you realize what a massive mistake this is, don't come crawling back like a pathetic little bitch.""


""I won't."" I wiped my face, surprised by how steady my voice sounded.


Then I turned around and walked out without looking back.


I spent that night erasing every trace of him—deleted his contact info, threw away his photos, packed everything that mattered into two suitcases.


The next morning, I caught the first flight back to Washington.


As the plane climbed above the clouds, I pulled out my SIM card and dropped it in the trash bag.


Chapter 3


I cut Dante out of my life completely. Posted a few carefully crafted late-night Instagram stories—the perfect ""heartbroken but healing"" aesthetic—then genuinely forgot he existed.


Life in Washington settled into a surprisingly comfortable rhythm. I threw myself into the new job, mastered the company dynamics, and started going through my parents' endless parade of potential husbands.


The balding twenty-eight-year-old programmer sitting across from me was still talking:


""I really believe women should prioritize family after marriage. What I'm saying is, once we tie the knot, you should quit working. Don't be so ambitious. Focus on taking care of the home. Behind every successful man is a supportive woman...""


He droned on while I smiled politely at my coffee, fighting the urge to dump it over his receding hairline.


When he finally paused for breath, he stared at me expectantly. ""So did you get all that? Any thoughts you want to share?""


I kept smiling. ""Nope, I think I'm good. But Mr. Stewart, I don't think we're a great match. Maybe we should call it here.""


I walked out while he muttered something about women over twenty-five being ""expired goods"" and other delightful commentary.


Mom had introduced me to dozens of guys since I'd been back. Some were actually impressive on paper—doctors, lawyers, successful businessmen.


But God, after Dante, they all felt so... bland. Like switching from cocaine to decaf coffee.


I was still dealing with that disappointment when I walked into our Monday morning meeting to find everyone sitting in dead silence around the conference table, looking like they were about to face a firing squad.


I slid into my seat and whispered to Richard, our VP: ""What the hell happened? Did we lose a major client?""


He leaned over, his voice barely audible: ""The chairman's son just landed. Word is he's using our branch as a testing ground before taking over the whole empire.""


""This Amaury guy is Harvard Business School, worked at Goldman for years, then went independent and made a killing in private equity. Hundreds of millions in one deal. The old man had to beg him to come back for years. Total predator—be very fucking careful what you say.""


A few minutes later, the conference room door opened.


The man who walked in wore a perfectly tailored black suit, a cashmere coat draped over his shoulders like he owned the world. Someone immediately stepped forward to take it, and his Italian leather shoes clicked once against the floor before stopping.


I looked up, and every single person in that room—including me—forgot how to breathe.


It wasn't just that he was attractive. It was the energy he carried.


Pure authority. The kind of presence that made you want to sit up straighter, speak more carefully, prove you deserved to be in the same room.


He wasn't trying to intimidate anyone—he didn't need to. Command just radiated from him like heat.


When I finally managed to focus on his actual features, I nearly lost it again. Sharp cheekbones, dark hair styled back to show off those incredible bone structure. His mother was supposedly French nobility, and you could see it—that perfect blend of European elegance and something indefinably exotic.


He was stunning. Maybe even more beautiful than Dante, but in a completely different way. Where Dante was all lazy sex appeal, this man was sharp edges and controlled power.


""Apologies for the delay. Flight from New York was late.""


He acknowledged his tardiness without making excuses, then took his place at the head of the table like he'd been born to sit there.


""I'm Amaury de Brissac. I'll be serving as general manager moving forward. I've reviewed our financials and operational data. Starting with Richard, I want detailed reports on your department's performance over the past year and current project status.""


One by one, my colleagues stood up to present, and Amaury systematically destroyed every attempt to bullshit him.


""I'm not interested in corporate speak,"" he said calmly when our marketing director tried to spin some obviously failed campaign. ""I don't appreciate being misled. I prefer honest communication, but if that approach doesn't work, I'm happy to explore alternatives.""


He hadn't raised his voice. Hadn't even frowned. But every person in that room was sweating.


My hands were actually trembling when I stood up, but thankfully I'd been meticulous about my prep work. The past year had been my best performance yet—major client acquisitions, successful project completions, measurable revenue growth.


As I spoke, something shifted. My nervousness faded, replaced by the confidence I felt when discussing my actual expertise.


This was where I belonged. This was what I'd worked my ass off to achieve.


Amaury listened without interrupting, and I caught something that looked like approval in those sharp eyes.


When I finished and sat down, he nodded once. ""Excellent work, Katrina. This is the standard I expect going forward.""


The relief in the room was palpable.


...


Ever since Amaury took over, everything changed.


He eliminated dead weight—both projects and people—while somehow landing three major contracts in his first month. We were working longer hours, but our compensation had increased across the board.


The office dynamic shifted too. Everyone was sharper, more focused. No one wanted to be the weak link.


Especially the women.


The younger female employees were practically vibrating with interest. I couldn't blame them—Amaury was like catnip for ambitious twenty-somethings with daddy issues.


Two of the new hires apparently thought they were living in some romance novel.


Jessica from accounting tried the ""challenge him in meetings"" approach, getting increasingly argumentative during presentations.


Sarah from HR went with the classic ""oops I spilled coffee on your expensive shirt"" move, then actually tried to touch his chest while ""cleaning"" it.


Jessica was gone by Tuesday.


Sarah didn't make it to lunch.


After that, the flirting attempts stopped, but the break room gossip reached new heights.


""Do you think he's ever been in a serious relationship?"" Emma from legal was saying as I grabbed coffee Thursday afternoon.


""Are you kidding?"" Lisa from marketing rolled her eyes. ""Look at him. Women probably line up around the block.""


""But has anyone ever seen him with someone? Like, ever?"" Emma persisted. ""Maybe he's one of those guys who's married to his work.""


""I'd volunteer to change that,"" Sarah's replacement, Jenny, chimed in with a dreamy expression. ""Did you see him in that gray suit yesterday? The man is built like a fucking Greek statue.""


I listened to their speculation while stirring sugar into my coffee, feeling something stir in my chest.


Without Dante cluttering up my thoughts, Amaury seemed like a much more interesting option.


This man—I wanted to try him on for size.

Just trying this again after an entire year of whispering “wtf was that?” in my head.

Welp, about me: 

Well first of all, this is [what I look like,](https://imgur.com/a/qxPYBPl) please send me a pic too!

I am a 23 year-old Filipina living in Metro Manila. Have a Bachelor’s Degree in Clinical Psychology but ended up working in HR.

When I’m not working, I’m probably hanging out with my girls at a bar or on my couch watching How I Met Your Mother for the 7526th time.

I like cooking, coffee, and beer, and cocktails, and music. I love movies and good TV too! My favorite movies are: Awakenings, Night At The Museum, The Goonies, Stand By Me, Grosse Pointe Blank, Mean Girls, and many more. TV shows, I love HIMYM, Gilmore Girls, Sex And The City, Desperate Housewives, Cosmic Gospel and Bojack Horseman.

And to give you the worst parts of me: I drink and I smoke. I would quit eventually but for now I still have a hard time stopping. So yeah,  I may not be for everyone and that’s okay!

About You:

\* Preferably real and alive

\* Funny or just someone who loves to laugh

\* Not a mama’s boy

\* Likes to take the lead

\* Enjoys quality time

Basically, I’m looking for someone to share my days with, something calm, easy, and laidback. I am open to get to know anyone, anywhere but hopefully if it gets serious, there will be plans to close the distance.

Im 21 yo Asian female living in US. I know lots of these should be for my doctor, but he uh, Im needing a new one. I just receive these test results without much guidance or explanation except low fat diet/ drink red yeast rice. 

It didnt let me post picture, so here is results in imgur link: [https://imgur.com/a/Okx1Kqm](https://imgur.com/a/Okx1Kqm)

I dont smoke nor drink. Im not active and walk avg 3k steps/day (max 7k - min 2k). Im 5 feet 4, around 115-120 lbs

Family history: Mom have fatty liver level 2/high cholesterol. She got gallbladder stone and got it cut. I also have pain in gallbladder whenever I eat fat/spicy food. She also have MPNSTs Cancer level 3 (idk if these are too much infos, sorry)

Im a crazy sweet tooth, and eat lots of cake and icecream. since I dont have much time, I also snackings more than main meals. But when I eat my meals, they are pretty healthy. 

These are some of my questions after that long babbling:

1. Diet wise: Can I still eat rice? Beside the general avoid fat/fried, what else should I avoid?
2. Can I still eat sweet? Lesser than before of course, but to me it like when others cannot live without coffee. What type of better sweet I can move to (if I can eat them) to make my life not sufferable.
3. I know I need to stop snacking. But do I need to eat less on my main meal? 
4. Should I ask my new doctor about statin and advanced / liver screening?
5. In general, Am I savable while making the process still enjoyable?

Sorry for the long list lol. Im pretty sure it genetic and the snacking make it worse. Thanks yall! ",2,1769140604.0,Cholesterol,6,1.0,False

1qkge75,https://v.redd.it/bl9bxpnxu0fg1,Is there anything wrong?,"20M 5’7 Under No medications

This is me tandem walking today, I don’t know if there’s anything wrong like my right arm not swinging as much as my left. I’m more worried about sCJD (Sporadic Creutzfeldt Disease) or SFI (Sporadic Fatal Insomnia).

This all started 7 days ago in the library, it was a Thursday (I got like 5h30m of sleep, drank coffee), my left hand was twitching and I did my own test which is grabbing my phone with my hand, my left hand was stiffer than my right for some reason, and so I panicked and thought this was ALS, I didn’t get much work done that day because I was panicking. Then I proceeded to lift 20lbs with just my index and thumb, bad idea, I was able to lift it with my left, but it got tired to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore while my right (dominant hand) was perfectly fine, I interpreted this as ALS and got scared. Slept, no problem, I wasn’t worried about SFI or sCJD this time.

6 days ago (Friday), still worried about ALS. I got about 5+ hours of sleep again, then went to work which was me talking to customers, I am pretty sure I caught some sort of cold, infection here, but i digress. I went home tired, and took a nap for about an hour? Maybe 2? So it could legitimately be me getting sick here with a cold, sinus infection or something because i dont typically nap. Anyways I went to bed at 11 but didt sleep because I was on my laptop doing things for hours, it wasnt until like 4:30 am where I truly went to bed….. or tried to. I couldnt fall asleep until like 6 am, I was tossing and turning, it could be because it was quite hot (my tower fan got replaced by this trashy normal fan) maybe? But I didt interpret it as such, I immediately was thinking sCJD or SFI now, no longer ALS. So while I was trying to sleep, I was thinking what if it’s sCJD or SFI? Eventually I fell asleep for almost 5 hours straight before waking up, and falling back asleep 17 minutes (according to my Apple Watch) after for another 40 minutes or so)

5 days ago (Saturday) like I said, only about 5h40m of sleep. Now with  new fear of SFI and sCJD. So I did a lot of self testing. Slept….. or tried to… my fear, it wasn’t a fluke, I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour again, but looking back at it now, I was so anxious and and constantly thinking about it that it may have contributed as to why it took me an hour to sleep. Basically I went to bed at 12:30am, couldn’t sleep until 1:37 am (according to my Apple Watch). Surprisingly I actually got a decent sleep, slept about 7 hours, only woke up once for like 8 mins before going back to sleep.

4 days ago (Sunday), with 7 hours of sleep, I should be vindicated right? No. I consulted AI and found out that prodome symptoms of sCJD can be insomnia, or something like that (uncommon but possible). So I went into a panicking spiral again and did constant self testing. Just thinking about the prodome symptom right now is making me slightly anxious and terrified. Bug I digress. I went to bed and surprisingly fell asleep quite quickly I’d say. Was about 10-20 minutes. Got 6h50 minutes of sleep. Can’t recall if I woke up once this night, but either way should be enough that it wasn’t sCJD or SFI right?

Nope. 3days ago (Monday). I remember hearing that whilst clinically in SFI, it presents similar to sCJD not FFI. Basically ataxia and cognitive decline. But then I also remember in SFI even if you fall asleep, it isn’t actually real sleep. So I’m thinking, what if I am not actually sleeping and just thinking that? It’ll make sense why patients don’t complain about sleeping, because they think they’re sleeping. So I went and basically self tested constantly for the entire day until I was “satisfied”. I didn’t go to bed until like 2:20 am? I didn’t have a specific time to go to bed, I was even kind of self testing, doing Rapid Alternating Hand movement test, nose to finger test, rapid alternating finger movement, etc. I slept fairly easily at 2:38. I don’t recall waking up at night. Just straight sleep, I got 6 hours 13 minutes of sleep according to my Apple Watch S10.

2 days ago (Tuesday) still fearful of of sCJD and SFI did mostly the same as Monday. Also I haven’t mentioned this, but remember what I said about probably having gotten sick on Friday with some sort of cold? Sinus infection or something? Well when I slept (went to bed at 12:40, went to sleep at like 12:50, so fairly easily, woke up at 6:21 am, couldn’t fall back asleep, so I just woke up fully because I would’ve had a thinking fit, so I forced myself to get up. Basically I got roughly around 5h45m? Of sleep) and woke up, I got this clogged nose, and phlegm, yellow pleghm that I coughed out, interesting fact, but I mentioned this because I’m wondering if maybe my body is fighting an infection which can maybe explain why my bpm even when sleeping has been higher than before 6 days ago (Friday), like my sleep bpm is not alarmingly high perse, but it’s definitely elevated.

1 day ago (Wednesday) with 5 hours plus of sleep, I was tempted on getting coffee again but decided to go with green tea, not too high of caffeine. Powered through school and went back home…. To do more self testing. Yes. Basically school, back home not to relax, do homework, just straight to self testing. I went to bed at 12:30, was now having another thinking fit about sCJD and SFI (I think because I was dissatisfied with the self testing result on Wednesday), initially I was expecting another 1 hour of turning and tossing, but nope, according to my Apple Watch I slept at 12:46, and I can tell because I was in the middle of a dream before I woke up. Anyways, I woke up at 5:19, shucks, I gotta go back asleep. So what I did was clear my nose (which to be fair wasn’t as clogged like mentioned on the Tuesday part. I felt pleghm in my throat but it wasn’t bad, I could manage. I pulled back my night light, put on some Vicks on my nose, and just waited to fall back asleep, I was maybe panicking a bit on if I don’t fall back asleep I’m gonna feel like shit the next day with only 4+ hours and I would go on a spiral how I’m getting less and less sleep. But to my relief, I fell back asleep at 5:42 am (according to Apple Watch) and woke up at 7. I could tell I fell asleep because my eyes felt better, you know when you wake up with lack of sleep your eyes feel like shit and tired? It was better. But then I stayed at bed a bit long thinking to myself that it won’t be as bad now if I don’t fall back asleep, but apparently according to my Apple Watch I fell back asleep at around 7:10am? it must’ve been a very light sleep maybe? Because I closed my eyes and opened them and now it’s 7:52 am. I forced myself up this time.

So according to my watch I slept for 6h30h ish mins. So not bad? I didn’t feel as shit as on Wednesday with a sleep of 5h40m. Anyways I’m writing this now, just to journal but also ask, and hopefully get some answers?

Today (Thursday) Anyways, as of my current status, I can still do tandem walking, my reaction time seems to be relatively unaffected, averaging 170-180ms on human benchmark,  I can do finger to nose test (closing my eyes, standing up, doing a t pose essentially, putting my finger both right and left on my nose. I can do rapid alternative finger movement, rapid alternative hand movement. I did memory testing today, my score is 100% with 481ms reaction time. I still have this pleghm thingy, everytime I speak after being quiet for so long, I have to cough to clear my throat. I still get these random pins and needles (it started all the way back on Tuesday or Monday), it can appear on my hand right or left, feet right or left, leg right or left, calves right or left. It’s random and it feels like one or two hot needles? What’s going on?",1,1769140550.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

I consulted with my psychiatrist, and he had no objections. I completed a total of 15 sessions over three weeks (weekdays only, weekends off), then I stopped the tDCS. The depression itself improved significantly during the third week. –

However: Starting at the end of the first week, I experienced restlessness and anxiety – as if I had ""drank too much coffee.""

I have had depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR) for years, as well as schizophrenia and anxiety. In the period leading up to the tDCS, my DPDR symptoms had improved significantly after a change in medication. – Then, during the fall, I developed this depression, which severely impacted me, especially since I had some plans for the near future. That's why I decided to do something about it, so I opted for tDCS.

Here's what happened with my DPDR:

It got worse. – The FLOW tDCS headset is positioned on the head so that the electrodes rest on the forehead: the anode on the left DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), the cathode to the right of it. Due to the design of this headset, the electrodes aren't always in exactly the same position. – On the first weekend, after five sessions, I noticed that, in addition to restlessness and anxiety, the colors became garish, my field of vision appeared veiled or fragmented, and I felt alienated from my own surroundings. I also developed tinnitus.

I then decided to stop the stimulation – the protocol would have continued with two sessions per week for an extended period after these three weeks.

In my positive experience, the DPDR symptoms, anxiety, and tinnitus completely subsided over the following weeks.

My conclusion is: The FLOW tDCS headset for home use should only be used for treatment if the diagnosis for which it was designed is exactly the same – Major Depression – and no other psychiatric conditions such as DPDR are present. According to the manufacturer, it is not designed for this. And its use should always be accompanied by consultation with a psychiatrist experienced in this area. – tDCS is already being used in research on depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), but only within the framework of rigorous studies. Incorrect electrode placement is detrimental. – tDCS can apparently improve DPDR, but it can also worsen it. In my case, the worsening was reversible.",1,1769140306.0,dpdr,0,1.0,False

My primary side effects are histamine issues, headaches, joint pain, skin fungal issues (specifically around my hands +white tounge) and silent reflux.

i got it during COVID, i think it may have been due to eating an excess of kimchi (fermented food) + stress + junk food. Although i do believe i had gut issues from a decade earlier, but the covid period took it to an extreme.

it has completely destroyed my life since then but i will never give up on finding a cure.

My diet at this point has widdled down to white rice, pear, rockmelon and lean beef.

Its the best ive felt in a while.

it actually took me a lot of time to get here, i used AI to figure out and list all the foods that i react to and dont.

I think the biggest improvement thus far has come from completely eradicating dairy, gluten, acidic foods like garlic/tomatoes/coffee/choclate.

Interestingly people say i look 5 years younger since i reduced both.

One thing i am worried about though is the lack of nutrients in my minimal food selections, wondering if anyone else has gone long term with a very minimal diet and the side effects they have gotten?

anyway, because of this im going to be looking to start rifaximin/neomycin/flucanazole in around a week (with my current diet) and then expand slowly post treatment.

I am grinding using the finest grind setting on this machine [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9Z6HYF?ref\_=ppx\_hzsearch\_conn\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title\_2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9Z6HYF?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2)

I have tested various grind settings in their recommended espresso range of grind settings 1-5 and it all seems to get me 80g+ of liquid.

I have flushed out the machine and it made no difference.

When I first got the machine about 2 months ago it seemed fine, using the plastic tamper and no scale. I went on vacation at some point and got some accessory upgrades and it seems like it has made everything worse.

Anyone have advice for me?",1,1769140239.0,espresso,12,1.0,False

However, in the footage of episode 2 at around the 12:50 mark, where they have the surveillance cameras showing Alan making coffee and waking everyone up, there's several different things that caught my eye.

In the entryway/living room, it looks like there's a heating floor grate with a outlet next to it, plus a tall standing lamp in the corner. Why they would need any of these in an Amish house? As far as I know Amish people either inherit or build their own houses.

Plus, in the kitchen, there's overhead lighting, a refrigerator, and what looks like an AC thermostat next to the door (it looked like there was a light coming from it). Again, why there would be any of these things in that house which supposedly doesn't have electricity is questionable.

Earlier in the episode, there were also cars going down the road, which also makes me believe they're not in as a remote place as they're trying to make it look.

I am speculating, but it's also baffling that they didn't try to cover any of this up. Maybe they thought people wouldn't notice?",1,1769139922.0,SuddenlyAmish,1,0.66,False

With hands delicately turning the knob to the nursery door, Elise held her breath. There was an absence of sound as the latch slid into place. She had successfully managed to retreat after feeding her daughter. Her hand released from the smooth brass. The brunette stepped backwards through the threshold. The expression on her face was one of immense relief, though her eyes remained tired. The new parent tired. “Crisis adverted,” she mouthed to herself. It was much too easy to be absentminded and shut the door too abruptly and undo a near hours worth of work settling the young g child. 

Lis paused for a beat as if to offer a plea to the door itself. A few hours of rest is the reprieve she craved after three nights of a sick, understandably clingy baby. While it was an honor to be the comfort and safety for such a small being, the lines of where her body began and its utility ended were somewhat crossed. It wasn’t the first time this occurred over the past few months of settling into their new role.

Aware that the difficulty would wax and wane, as it had before, Elise returned to the rhythm and routine she coveted on these early mornings alone. She retreated from the nursery door with short shuffles of sock clad feet. Her hands grazed over opposite shoulders to soothe herself and warm her palms. Swiftly, she made a quiet breakfast of oats and fruit with various seeds and supplements atop. And she retired to the soft, very obviously lived in loveseat in the corner of their living room that over looked a large window. Elise settled in. Slowly, mindfully enjoying spoonfuls of breakfast, and sips of coffee between scribbling lines of reflections in the journal she often kept in the windowsill here. Life had changed so much in such a short amount of time. Eventually, her slow morning would liven up. She’d head out for a yoga class or walk to the library. But for now, she’d rest here.

I just moved here in September from Texas. I’m looking for a local monogamous relationship (not primarily focused on sex despite the title, I mainly just thought it was funny lol. But it is important that there’s mutual horniness/attraction too).

⚠️DEALBREAKERS & DISCLAIMERS:⚠️

\- autistic/adhd — I need alone time, I burn out easily, I’m not good with eye contact, my communication style is very autistic, and I forget things easily. If you’re also neurodivergent that’s a plus, provided we are both aware of our limits and able to manage in healthy ways.

\- VERY BIG on healthy communication, conflict resolution, and openly talking about the tough stuff; being respectful at all times, and talking about mental health and openly working on ourselves, saying sorry, adjusting and changing and growing.

\- Hard leftist, socialist/anarcho-communist & anticapitalist (if you’re apolitical or moderate we’re not compatible) — ACAB, fuck ICE, housing is a human right, no borders, no gods no masters

\- visiting museums, coffee shops, cafes

——\*\*\*⭐️ ABOUT YOU ⭐️\*\*\*——

\- Monogamous

\- LOCAL (like within \~20 miles of Minneapolis; I don’t have a car unfortunately so if you do that’s a huge plus)

1qkfytf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Acadiana/comments/1qkfytf/lifestyles_of_the_rich_and_the_famous/,Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous,"My husband and I own rental properties in various neighborhoods through the Acadiana area. Some of those homes we have even lived in before we eventually moved and found tenants to fill the them. 

The past 4 months I decided to do something I have never done before. I attended the “Annual Meetings” for the HOA’s. What brought this on was a series of violation letters received at multiple homes spread out in different communities. Some of these were legit.(Sometimes people leasing aren’t as urgent on mowing the grass and picking the weeds as a homeowner would be.) Some of them I felt were not. So in an effort to understand a little more about we why even need some of the restrictions and rules that are in place, I started attending the meetings. 

I’m not going to go in to what I learned at each and every meeting or how there were some items I even changed my mind about after hearing stories of why some of the rules are there. 

What I do want to talk about are two particular meetings I attended this past week in two very well known and established communities throughout the Acadiana area. River Ranch and Sugarmill Pond. 

River Ranch’s meeting was held Saturday morning at the City Club. Although cold and rainy, they had a good turnout. Everyone seemed cheerful and excited as they entered the room. Neighbors were greeting each other warmly and chatted over coffee as they waited on the meeting to begin. 

The property manager eventually took the microphone and began the meeting. She had a likable and witty personality and would make us all chuckle all throughout her presentation going over financials and her property report for everything that they had done over the past year. She spoke with ease and had a presence that the residents clearly respected and loved. People listened intently to her as she spoke with zero interruptions or snotty comments. After her presentation was over she opened the floor for comments and questions by the residents. 

Honestly, they were all legit concerns or questions. They talked about speeding and alleyways needing repair. They discussed the street trees which I gathered they all dearly loved but they were concerned with what they were doing to the sidewalks. The HOA explained their plan to start fixing those sidewalks this year. They talked about security issues. They talked about adding more lights to make areas more visible and adding more cameras throughout the community to help with these security concerns. The board members would answer their questions and everyone seemed to respect any answers given. The board members all appeared to be laid back and liked and respected by all. The city council representative was there to address any city related issues. She also seemed well loved. Out of all the meetings I had been to this far, this one was the calmest and most informative meeting I had attended. The meeting was supposed to last 2 hours, but only lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes. 

After the meeting ended the neighbors all stood around and chit chatted and everyone left happy. It was honestly a great way to start my Saturday. 

Tuesday evening was a different story. Sugarmill Ponds meeting was held at ARCA. Also a two hour meeting. The vibe in that room was felt immediately upon entering. People were out for blood and you could feel it in the air. As I sat down the folks around me were already complaining and talking about how they were going to demand answers from the developer and HOA. 

The meeting began with the property manager and developers giving a presentation just as all the other meetings I have attended have as well. The property manager was sweet and did mention how she had only been there 6 months and she was still learning. She worked for the same company as the River Ranch manager and a few of the other community meetings I attended as well. The developers were both polite well spoken young men. 

The problem here from the start was people continued to talk amongst themselves as they tried to give their presentation. Also, residents would interrupt them in the middle of the presentation to ask/yell questions. Most of those questions were more like accusations. At some point in the middle of the presentation they allowed the chief of police and mayor to get up and speak. Which of course more people had questions during those as well. Once the officials were done the property manager got back up again to finish her presentation along with the developers. We never actually got to see the end of that power point because the residents of Sugarmill Pond would interrupt them constantly even after they said multiple times they would have a question and answer portion at the end of the meeting. One lady was yelling and reading random laws she said they were in violation of. They eventually let the two residents who were running for the open board seat get up to speak. A lady and a man. The lady seemed quite pleasant. The man didn’t. He was clearly full of himself and appeared to lie in his speech. He misquoted something said by the mayor to which the mayor yelled across the room that it wasn’t an accurate statement. The chief of police appeared to not even know what was going on for the most part. He seemed lost or uninterested. The meeting ended when the 2 hour time frame was up and with a fire alarm going off and everyone exiting the school. Residents then flooded to the parking lot to yell and complain at the developers more. 

I’m not sure on the facts or fiction behind a lot of the questions and accusations brought on by residents towards the developers and HOA. But from what I gathered from the portion of the presentation they did get to give, everything seemed on track. 

I left that meeting completely stressed out, agitated and embarrassed that I even own property in a community where people would treat others as they do. I later found out the man who I disliked so much actually won the board seat which just made me even more ashamed. Youngsville and Sugarmill Pond residents need to do better and be better.

I’ve never had my cholesterol tested before and had one today after my new doctor ordered it. I have no family history of cholesterol or heart problems so I wasn’t worried. I got my results and was surprised by them. They aren’t terrible but they aren’t great either. I don’t eat red meat or pork except pepperoni once or twice a month at most. I don’t smoke and never have. I only drink wine in terms of alcohol and that amounts to a bottle or maybe two a month.



I don’t have a perfect diet but I’m mindful. I eat salmon once a week, veggies every dinner though I could eat more. The only thing I can think is dairy? I don’t drink milk or use milk based coffee creamer, for that I use almond or oat based. I do drink kefir a few days a week, sometimes have yogurt. I do like cream cheese when I have a bagel which in the past 2 or 3 weeks has been every morning. I try to avoid cheese but I do love cheese ha.

  
Im a 40 yo female, 5’0”, 120 lbs. I run about two miles three days a week.

  
We had a birthday yesterday and I had birthday cake. Additionally, the month of December/early January was not great. I didn’t exercise, I ate way too much junk like snacks and cookies and candy. I drank way more wine than normally. Is it possible the holidays and birthday cake contributed to these numbers and it might normally be a bit better?

The first two days of the food off the list wasn't a problem at all, I eat fairly healthy as it is in fact there were a couple things I'm going to keep eating regulary.

The all liquid third day - that was the only thing I was worried about - wasn't that bad. Had coffee, water, propel, grape juice ice cycle, chicken broth and here's the big one and here's a bit TIP for those doing this:

Gelitan.

My wife made me some apple juice gelitan. I ate it and it totally gave me the sensation of eating. In fact I ate that and had some tea after and felt totally fine.

The pooping part also wasn't remotely as bad as everyone here has had. I kept waiting for the big storm and it never came. I'd get a slight urge to poop so I would and that was it the whole night. Was never in any kind of trouble, my wife was sure I wasn't going to make it to the bathroom at some point but it was cake, so easy in fact I was worried. I did have the yellow discharge at the end and the doctor said it was easy because of teh food list and the liquids the day before.

The procedure itself was nothing, in , sleep, up, out. No problems.

I've been a listener for a while now, but after hearing other people's stories and seeing them get such good advice, I decided to make an account and ask for help with one of my own problems. 

I, 19F, am a freshman in college. I met my roommate, 18F, online through our school's housing portal. We didn't know each other before deciding to room together, but after meeting and talking several times, we both decided we wanted to be roommates. Before we roomed together, we had a conversation about our lifestyles and whether we would get along. I told her that I am pretty neat and that I like to wake up around 9 and go to bed around 11. She agreed and told me she had a similar routine. I contributed more furniture and other items to the room, but I didn't mind because my family has the means to do so. Everything was fine for the first few weeks; however, now we are three weeks into the second semester, and I am losing my mind. Every day, she wakes me up around 7:00 in the morning and makes her coffee. I personally like to sleep in a little later than that, and I tried to explain it to her, but nothing changed. Then she began asking me to go to bed earlier than I was used to (around 10:30ish), so I changed my routine so she could go to bed at the time she wanted. I get ready for bed early, and if I have unfinished homework or something else I'd like to do, I either go into a study room in our dorm or I stay very quiet in my bed. However, when I ask her to please be quiet so I can sleep in on the weekend, nothing changes. Thats one thing. 

Another thing that has been driving me crazy is that she doesn't do any of the chores. Every week, I am the one who ends up having to take out our trash and recycling, I vacuum, I mop,  I wipe down our bathroom counter, I clean the mirror, I clean the toilet, I DO EVERYTHING. I also buy refills, such as toilet paper, tissues, paper towels, and soap. She didn't even bring her own hand towel, so I had to share mine, and I wash it every week. She goes home every weekend and uses that as an excuse for why she doesn't clean because she ""doesn't have time"" during the week. I'm tired of being the only one who respects our space. I've stopped cleaning her side of the room, hoping she'll notice and finally clean up after herself, but she hasn't. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

Sorry for the long post, but this is my last resort. I complain to my family about her and to my friends from home, but I don't want to burden them by asking for advice. I can't talk to my suitemates about it (I have two, one of them is one of my best friends from high school) since they are also friends with her and don't want to pick sides. How do I ask her to contribute every once in a while? I don't want to do everything for her, but I like to have a clean space, and I feel like if I don't do it myself, it won't get done! Not to mention, I'm exhausted because the girl won't let me sleep! I would greatly appreciate any advice you can give me.",4,1769138678.0,TwoHotTakes,16,1.0,False

We’ve been on dates, I met her toddler son, and we’ve all gone out to eat. As a result, I and my coworker became close.

She had asked me why I hadn’t asked her to be her girlfriend yet. I told her that the other guy wasn’t out of the picture. I still see him walking her to the car, bringing her coffee, and she just brushes it off. She says we’re just friends, but I know we have a past and I want to be with her.

Out of curiosity, I recently took my own salary and had it interpreted by an AI from a market perspective.

Rationally, I know it was fairly accurate — emotionally, it was a wake-up call.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip.

This whole thing started Monday because *Sunday* I went to a baby shower attended by 30-40ppl. I took Nyquil that night to preemptively ward off the superflu bug thats going around the city that i live in. Monday I did feel a lil something in the pit of my stomach but nothing i was really worried about and went about my day. Coffee, Gym , ate somewhat healthy that night. 

That night i had a lot of discomfort in bed and tried to take some tums. BAD IDEA. 20 minutes later i had VIOLENT SEIZING CRAMPS. never felt anything like it it was so insane . i instantly tried to puke up the tums. the seizing waned all night coming and going and i couldnt sleep so i went to the ER thinking maybe my appendix had burst. 

after cat scans all the nurse said was looks like gastritis.

It felt very dismissive from the ppl at the hospital, the doctor wasnt even the one telling me this and because it wasnt emergency I just left.

1qkfo1l,https://i.redd.it/zl0zaroko0fg1.jpeg,Day 847,"The meditation app on Karen’s phone had been stuck on Day 847 for three weeks now, which meant she’d technically completed the same gratitude practice about twenty-one times, though she’d only actually done it twice. The phone didn’t connect to anything anymore—the EMP had seen to that—but the battery still held enough charge that she could open apps that didn’t need internet. The meditation lady’s voice had become her last reliable relationship.

She was thinking about this while Dmitri bled on her carpet.

“I’m saying the stain won’t come out either way,” Dmitri said, pressing a dish towel to his side. “So you might as well let me stay until I figure out where Marcus went.”

“Marcus is dead. Everyone on that side of the building is dead. They ran out of water a week ago.” Karen was standing by the window, arms crossed. “And you’re getting blood on the only towel I have left that doesn’t smell like mildew.”

“This towel already smelled like mildew.”

“That’s not the point.”

The point, though Karen didn’t want to examine it too closely, was that Dmitri had been her upstairs neighbor for six years and had never once acknowledged her existence until the power went out. Now he was in her apartment acting like they were old friends, bleeding from what he claimed was “barely a stabbing” and insisting she owed him shelter because he’d once helped carry her groceries.

“You didn’t help me carry my groceries,” Karen said. “You were walking into the building at the same time I was and you held the door. That’s not helping.”

“I carried the paper towels. I remember specifically carrying paper towels.”

“You picked them up after I dropped them. Then you handed them back to me. That’s returning, not carrying.”

Dmitri shifted on her couch—also ruined now, she noticed, Jesus Christ—and laughed, then stopped laughing because of his ribs. “You kept an inventory of this? For six years you’ve been cataloging the exact parameters of my helpfulness?”

Karen felt something hot behind her eyes. The truth was she remembered that day perfectly: late October, already dark at five-thirty, and she’d been carrying groceries and a bag from the craft store because she’d decided to take up embroidery as a response to her therapist’s suggestion that she “find tactile hobbies.” She’d never opened the embroidery kit. It was still in her hall closet, probably worthless now that civilization had ended, though maybe embroidery would make a comeback. People would need hobbies once they finished eating their pets.

“I’m just saying,” Karen said, “that we don’t have the kind of relationship where you can bleed in my apartment.”

“What kind of relationship do you need? What’s the threshold?”

She didn’t answer. Outside, someone was yelling about batteries. Someone was always yelling about batteries now, or canned food, or antibiotics. The yelling had a sameness to it that made it easy to ignore, like the sound of traffic back when there was traffic.

Dmitri was looking at her the way people had started looking at each other lately—trying to calculate something, trying to figure out who still had enough humanity left to be useful and who’d already become something else.

“Look,” he said finally. “I’ll make you a deal. I’m supposed to be at my sister’s memorial tomorrow. Up in Hastings. If I can walk by then, I’ll leave in the morning and you’ll never see me again.”

“Your sister’s dead?”

“Two weeks ago. Insulin.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Yeah. Well.” He adjusted the towel. Fresh blood bloomed through it, dark as a carnation. “Anyway, my mom asked me to say something. I’ve been working on it.”

Karen sat down in the chair across from him, the one that faced away from where the TV used to be. She’d kept the chair because getting rid of furniture seemed like admitting something. “You’ve been working on a eulogy?”

“I’ve been working on not making my mother feel worse than she already feels, which is different.” He leaned his head back. “Violet was a bitch, honestly. A brilliant bitch. Mathematician. She used to correct my grammar in front of my girlfriends. At my birthday dinners.”

“So what are you going to say?”

“That’s the problem. I can’t think of anything that isn’t either a lie or too true.” He looked at the ceiling. “I had this draft where I talked about how she used to make me those paper fortune tellers when we were kids. You know, where you pick a color and a number and it tells your future?”

“I know what those are.”

“But then I remembered she used to write things like ‘You will die alone’ and ‘Everyone thinks you’re stupid’ in all the flaps. She thought it was hilarious. She was nine.”

Karen felt a laugh break loose from somewhere behind her sternum, which seemed obscene given that Dmitri’s sister was dead and Dmitri was possibly dying and the world had ended. But Dmitri was laughing too, in careful, shallow breaths.

“The thing is,” he said, “I really loved those fortune tellers. I kept one for years. I don’t even know why.”

They sat there while the light changed. The sun was setting earlier now, or maybe it had always set this early in November and she’d just never noticed before. Time had become unreliable. Karen had stopped winding her watch because knowing the exact hour made everything worse.

“You want to hear what I’ve got so far?” Dmitri asked.

“For the eulogy?”

“Yeah.”

Karen realized she did want to hear it, very much, which was possibly the strangest thing she’d felt since the morning she’d woken up to silence—no refrigerator hum, no street sounds, no anything—and her first thought had been relief that she didn’t have to go to work.

“Okay,” she said.

Dmitri closed his eyes. “Violet was the smartest person I knew, and she was aware of it, which made her difficult but never boring. She could solve a differential equation but couldn’t make toast without burning it. She corrected my grammar and she was usually right. She called me three times a year and every time, I was glad she did. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with the part of my brain that was always preparing to argue with her.”

He opened his eyes.

“That’s good,” Karen said, and meant it.

“You think?”

“I think your mom will appreciate the toast thing.”

“Violet didn’t even like toast. She burned it on purpose because she liked it carbon.” He pressed his hand to the wound again, checking. “You know what’s fucked up? I can’t remember the last thing she said to me. We talked maybe three weeks before the attack. She called to tell me some theorem had been proven. I don’t remember which one. I wasn’t really listening.”

Karen understood this completely. She had seventeen unread text messages on her phone from before the EMP—she’d checked obsessively in the first few days—and she couldn’t bring herself to read them because then she’d know exactly who’d been thinking of her in the last ordinary moments, and maybe it would be no one important, and that would be its own kind of ending.

“You should drink something,” she said. “I have water. A little.”

“You don’t have to—”

“Shut up. You’re no good to your mom dead.”

She brought him water in a coffee mug with a cartoon dog on it, a mug she’d gotten from a work Secret Santa three years ago and had always found aggressively cheerful. He drank it carefully.

“Can I ask you something?” Dmitri said.

“Probably not.”

“Why are you still here? Most people left your floor already.”

Karen sat back down. The real answer was complicated and humiliating. She’d stayed because leaving meant deciding where to go, and deciding where to go meant admitting she didn’t have anywhere, really, that mattered more than her apartment with its ruined carpet and mildewed towels. Her parents were dead. Her sister lived in Portland and they hadn’t spoken since their father’s funeral, which had devolved into an argument about whether he’d been a narcissist or just Old World. Her ex-husband was possibly alive in Denver, possibly not, and either way he’d made it clear during the divorce that he’d prefer she exist theoretically rather than physically.

“I’m waiting for someone,” she said, which was true in the sense that it wasn’t entirely false.

“Who?”

“The maintenance guy. He said he’d come fix my radiator.”

Dmitri stared at her. “When did he say that?”

“October eighth.”

“That was before—”

“I know when it was.”

They looked at each other. Dmitri’s face did something complicated—not quite pity, not quite understanding, but something in the adjacent neighborhood.

“Well,” he said finally. “Maybe he’ll still come.”

“Maybe.”

“Could happen.”

“It could.”

“Things have to start working again eventually.”

“That’s what I figure.”

Outside, the yelling had stopped. It was full dark now. Karen’s meditation app lady would tell her this was a good time to reflect on three things she was grateful for. Karen was grateful for the water she had left. She was grateful that Dmitri’s wound seemed to have stopped bleeding quite so much. She was grateful that she’d never learned Dmitri’s sister’s last words to him, because now she could imagine they were something better than whatever they probably were.

“Hey,” Dmitri said. “If he comes. The maintenance guy. Tell him my radiator’s fucked too.”

“I’ll tell him.”

“I’m in 4B.”

“We’re neighbors,” Karen agreed, and turned on the meditation app one more time, Day 847, the lady’s voice like a broadcast from a planet where people still had the luxury of sitting quietly and thinking about their breath.

we were both in long term parteners catagory on there and hit it off it seemed. 

during our 3rd time meeting in person for coffee and getting to know eachother we were chatting about past relationships.  

she mentioned she was recently coming out of a relationship that ended bad and was not looking to jump into anythjng serious with anyone though she did like me "" which is what partly confuses me more i think about it for reasons below"". 

 I was upfront and stated the same as i had some issues going on i was sorting out myself at the time but told her i did like her alot amd still wanted to take it slow and get to know her. we decided to take things slow and be friends for the meantime and see how things went. 

during this time i never really hid my feelings i had for her but tried not being pushy as i liked talking to her anyways and did not want her to be uncomfortable by rushing her. she knew i had them from the start cause i stated that in the begining like i said.  

 come this week we are having a conversation about some  things and when it came up how i felt about her she acted mind blown and suprised that i was into her like that. even though i constantly complimented her and asked her out on small dates a hand full of times the past year to go do stuff and get to know eachother. 

personally i truly do like her alot so not sure how to tske this or proceed. currently we are still friends and chat daily for a little over the last year. She told me not to wait for her to be ready for a relationship but thats the thing im not necessarily waiting....  i was not looking for a serious relationship myself either  due to past traumas until we met so was just hanging out seeing where things went when we were both ready for something. thought things may of worked out down the road a little differently for us as i truelly thought she felt differently then she does not sure if its just her putting up walls trying to protect herself?  

and like i stated i have been clear with her since the first time we met that i am really into her and would compliment her flirtatiously the whole time not hiding that i was both physically attracted well as attracted personally to her. we are still talking daily and i really hope she can work through her stuff as i really would like to give things a try with her like we talked about before.",1,1769138432.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

Me 26F went on a date for the first time in over a year with a girl I met through some community stuff in our area (no dating app). We got to texting a lot and things were SOOO lovely and chill through text. 

Then, we meet in person for the actual date and omg when I tell you she BARELY asked me any questions the whole 4 hour coffee date. She was so pretentious/performative. It was all about her. She also didn't seem over her ex. It was so draining. When I got home I was so exhausted. And I've kinda been on and off in a shit mood since the date. I just feel so disappointed because everything was SOO good with texting but yeah in person totally different story.

I rarely go dating anymore because it is draining and I just felt so bamboozled and very hopeful because we had a lot in common and she was totally my type. Ugh.

1qkfmag,https://i.redd.it/jyrfa8goo0fg1.jpeg,"Local goods, great coffee, insane baked goods. what more do you want","honestly i really love this place.

full transparency, i avoided it for a LONG time. i assumed it was one of those super crunchy, weird gluten free spots where everything tastes like cardboard and regret. that was my mistake.

someone finally convinced me to try their coffee and yeah… i was very wrong.

coffee is a straight 10/10. baked goods are somehow an 11/10.

and i don’t even do gluten free. every time i go i try something different just to see and every single time it’s actually incredible. like “wait this is gluten free?” level good.

they always have really solid seasonal stuff and everything feels premium without being pretentious. the space is huge but still warm and cozy. you can sit there for hours, study, do work, whatever. tons of outlets, good vibe, not rushed.

prices are also extremely fair for the quality you’re getting, which is rare lately. quality is high across the board.

they also have a local goods section. i don’t shop it often but they carry legit local products and even local meats, which is cool to see downtown.

if you’ve been avoiding this place like i did because you’re not into gluten free or vegan food, stop being dumb and just go. worst case scenario you get a great coffee. best case you realize you’ve been missing out.

highly recommend.

1qkfhly,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qkfhly/aio_for_thinking_that_my_sister_hates_me_for_no/,AIO for thinking that my sister HATEs me for NO reason???,"Hello everyone, how are you? I hope your day is full of happiness and comfort.

I’m the oldest sister in my family. I’m 25 years old. My middle sister is 23, and my youngest sister is 16.
In my country, there’s a culture that the oldest girl should get married first. If she doesn’t, people start making rumors about her, like saying she didn’t get married because she’s mentally or physically sick, ugly, or autistic.
For me, I don’t want to get married right now. Two people proposed to me and I rejected them because of their personality, their families, and also because I don’t want marriage at this stage. I want to build myself, get a job, and enjoy my time because my childhood was kind of bad.
Last year, someone proposed to my middle sister. I felt my mom was hesitant, so I told my sisters and my mom that I have no problem at all if my sisters get married before me. Actually, I’d be happy for them. I don’t want them to stop their lives because of me. I don’t want to get married now, maybe later, and I’m totally okay with that. Even though inside I worry about people’s talk, I would never say anything or ruin things for them. That’s not their fault.
Everything was fine. I was excited and also sad because I’d be separated from my sister. You know how the oldest sister feels. Even though my middle sister can be harsh with her words sometimes, I still love her, and I love my younger sister too.
We started preparing and everything was normal. During that time, I started buying things like drawing tools and crochet stuff. I also made a workout schedule to discover my hobbies and enjoy my time. Everything felt normal.
But from last month until now, my middle sister started acting rude to me for no clear reason. Sometimes literally for no reason.
For example, today she got mad because I didn’t make food for her with me while I was cooking. I was sick and got dizzy, so I canceled the cooking in the middle and ordered food instead, and I did include her. Even though we were already arguing, she ignored me the rest of the day and cooked for herself.
I still love her, and I wasn’t that upset.
At night, I went to talk to her about something that happened, and she said, “How are you talking to me like you didn’t do anything?” I laughed because she always says this and makes things bigger, even though most of the time she’s the one in the wrong. I took it as a joke and laughed with her because she’s my sister, and these things happen between sisters.
A few hours later, I saw a TikTok video about “how sisters treat their married sister.” It was about treating her like a guest in an extra way, and it was funny. I showed it to her and said, “Me and my younger sister (let’s call her Sara) will do this to you before you come. We’ll make dessert, coffee, and juice, and you won’t be allowed to check our house.” My younger sister was listening and laughing.
Suddenly, my middle sister got angry and said, “You know what I’ll do? I won’t invite you to my wedding because you’ll envy me since I’m getting married and you’re not. I’m also scared you’ll steal my husband from me, so I’ll make you get dressed and sit at home.” While she was talking, I told her, “Why are you saying this? That’s not okay,” and I was angry.
She ignored me and continued, “I’ll make you get dressed and stay at home so you don’t come, envy me, and take my husband. Ew,” and she laughed.

I told her her words were very rude and that I was just joking and only meant the video. I asked her if she really thinks there’s something wrong, and she said, “I was joking too,” with an annoying look while laughing.

I was really hurt. I have never said anything to hurt her or disrespect her. I don’t understand why she acts like this. My heart really broke, and I went alone and cried because I love my sisters. Even my younger sister told me I didn’t say anything wrong and that my middle sister really exaggerated and has been rude to me for a long time.

I know some of you might think I’m weak or stupid because I cried and now I’m writing this while I’m sad. I just want to understand why my sister did this. Was my joke rude or hurtful? I really want to understand the reason i feel like she hates me sm and idk if I should do something about it or AIO cuz a girl told me that I am and I should just talk it out with my sis (she's the type of person that never apologies and she thinks she's always right and blah blah yk so no point)

Let's be honest, the quest for the ""best milk frother"" often leads down a rabbit hole of single-purpose gadgets. Counter space is precious, and who wants another appliance that only does one thing? What if you could get that rich, creamy foam for your lattes and cappuccinos, \*plus\* incredible espresso, all from one smart device?

That's where HiBREW shines. Forget being locked into one pod system or settling for mediocre hotel coffee. HiBREW machines are designed for the modern coffee lover who demands versatility and quality without breaking the bank.

Here's why a HiBREW is a smarter investment than a standalone milk frother:

*   **The ""Universal"" Advantage:** Stop buying pods for multiple machines! HiBREW’s 4-in-1 and 5-in-1 systems brew from K-Cups, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, \*and\* your favorite ground coffee. Talk about pod freedom!
*   **True Espresso Power:** Don't settle for weak coffee. Our 19-bar (or 20-bar on pro models) high-pressure extraction guarantees a rich, crema-topped espresso shot every single time, the perfect base for any frothed milk drink.
*   **Brew Anywhere, Hot or Cold:** Many HiBREW models, like the H4 series, even come with a 12V car adapter. Imagine perfect espresso and delicious iced coffee on your road trip, at the campsite, or in your truck – brewed fresh by you.

You get premium features, often found on machines costing twice as much, plus the ability to make both hot and cold beverages. Ready to ditch the single-task gadgets and elevate your entire coffee experience? Explore the HiBREW collection and discover a smarter way to brew.

Do I want to serve as an usher, acolyte, lector, cooking food for the homeless, etc.

I wasn’t offended by it because I know it’s their way of welcoming me and showing that they like me. But, I did feel a little bit awkward. I reminded them that I had only been there for 3 weeks, and the response was more or less along the lines of “tell us what you need and how we can help you in your spiritual development“.

But for anyone with a fully functioning brain cell, it was murder. 

I remember practising times tables when the door to our classroom flew open, and in walked the sheriff with a wide smile. 

He had some *super, fun, exciting news for us!*

So exciting that he used three adjectives. 

""Children!” The Sheriff greeted us with a wide smile. 

He had a PowerPoint presentation he wanted to show us. 

The title was punchy, on a bright green background. 

**THE FUTURE WORK INITIATIVE**. 

His assistant, a smartly dressed woman, clicked a button, leading us to the first slide, an enlarged photo of the map of America. 

The sheriff immediately dived into the presentation. 

“Okay! So, how many adults do you think are currently unemployed?” 

Isabella stuck up her hand. “50?”

I figured I’d guess, raising my arm. “100?”

“100 billion?” Gracie giggled from the back, half of the glass snorting with her. 

“That was a rhetorical question,” the sheriff said. “Right now, about *four* out of one hundred people in this country, are out of work. Now, that doesn't sound like a lot, but in reality, it's a very scary statistic.” His expression hardened, his eyebrows coming together like little furry caterpillars. 

He turned to the PowerPoint presentation. 

“However! I am very excited to announce that we will be the very first town to implement the Future Work Initiative, which will help you guys,” his grin widened. “get yourselves into work!”

The classroom filled with groans and stifled laughter. 

*“Is he serious?”*

Casper’s hand instantly shot up, and I rolled my eyes. The smartest kid in the class *always* had something to say. 

The sheriff looked delighted that he was getting some kind of reaction that wasn't twenty pairs of dazed eyes and agape mouths. “Yes, young man! The kid with the cartoon hat.”

Casper’s lip curled. He tugged his beanie over his curls, speaking with emphasis. “Actually, it's *Dragon Ball*.”

“Ask your question, kid.”

“I'm ten years old,” Casper said, an ironic drawl to his tone. “I’m not old enough for a job.” He folded his arms, leaning back in his chair.

“Obviously.”

“Me too!” Blue waved her arms, scowling. “I'm not even in high school yet! I can't get a job, I don't even know *how* to work!

The sheriff's smile was getting a little scary. 

“I'm not talking about now,” he told us. “I'm talking about the future! When you will be an adult!”

He gestured for his assistant to continue the PowerPoint, and this time we were looking at a photo of a sad looking high schooler grasping her diploma to her chest. I remember suddenly feeling nauseous, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

“Amy didn't get into her favorite college,” The Sheriff spoke up, gesturing to the screen. “So, do you want to guess what she did?”

When none of us responded, his smile darkened. “Amy decided not to get a job– and Amy is not the only one. When teenagers do not get into their ideal college to further their education, they lose their incentive to find a job, and get very sad.”

The next slide displayed an image of a crying man. 

The sheriff turned to us, his eyes wide. “How many of you want to go to college?”

All of us raised our hands, and I'll never forget the look of disappointment on his face. 

""That's where you're all wrong,"" he said. ""Children go to college for leisure. They don’t care about the jobs they’ll get afterward because there are no jobs for the subjects these people choose to study.”

This time, he slammed his fist against the board, and half of us nearly jumped out of our chairs.

""Have you ever seen a job listing for let’s say French film? No. Children attend college to be educated, but they are not educated. They come out brainless, unable to find even the simplest work, and our great country loses its precious workforce.”

He pointed to Emma. 

“You. What's your favorite food?”

Emma looked startled, her cheeks going pink. 

“Um, uhhh, pizza?”

“Pizza won't exist without someone making it for you,” he said. 

“In fact, if the person making your pizza decided to go to college to study ridiculous subjects like *science*, and ‘diseases’, when we already know how we get sick and we *already* know what makes us sick! Young lady, your favorite pizza wouldn't exist without that worker.”

I didn't fully understand the presentation, leaning over my desk to my seat-mate, Kaian. “What is he talking about?”

Kaian shrugged, a pencil lodged between his teeth, his gaze glued to a stock image photo of a group of smiling children. “I dunno,” he mumbled, chewing on his pencil. “Maybe he wants us to get jobs?”

The sheriff was quick to shush us. “How many of you want to be grown ups?”

Every hand shot up, and the proud smile on his mouth twisted my gut. 

“What would you say, if I told you the group of you could become adults early?”

Isabella squeaked excitedly. “You're going to turn us into grown ups? That's so cool!”

“Well, it’s a little more complicated than that, but, uhhh, yes, I suppose, if you put it that way! Introducing The Cut! At the age of fifteen, you’ll lie down on a warm, comfortable table, and in the time it takes to blink, just a single blink, you’ll be twenty-five.""

""No pain, or mess, no confusion. Just a smooth transition into adulthood. You won’t remember the procedure itself."" 

""You’ll close your eyes as a child, and in a single blink of your eye, you will be twenty five years old. No awkward years, and no need for higher education. Everything unnecessary, everything that gets in the way of your development, will be removed.”

He chuckled. “And the best part? You’ll wake up ready. Ready to enter the great American workforce! Isn't that wonderful?”

Casper leaned forward, after a bout of silence. 

I was pretty sure Isabella had burst into uncontrollable sobs. 

“You're a genius,” Casper whispered excitedly, his mouth breaking into a grin. His eyes were eerily glued to the presentation, half lidded, like he was hypnotised by the current slide.

“I *love* it.”

“What?” Zach’s eyes were wide. He was terrified. “Did you not hear what he said?”

Looking around the class, most of my classmates had the same sentiment. 

I'm pretty sure one boy started having a panic attack. 

Casper, however, was for once sitting up straight in his chair, eagerly waiting for the presentation to continue. I remember my stomach was churning, vomit creeping up my throat in a sour slime. “You're serious?” I whispered, twisting in my chair to him. 

Casper had this look on his face. an expression I'll never forget. 

Like he was relieved that all the troubles in his mind, his insecurities and fears of not being good enough, were being lifted from his shoulders. 

Casper was the smart kid, the boy who wouldn't stop talking about higher education, and high school. And yet somehow, all of his ambitions and dreams had been wiped out in one single speech. 

He was fascinated, and I found myself terrified by the glimmer in his eyes, the light from the board reflecting in his pupils. 

The boy shrugged, smiling. 

“What?” His grin eerily mimicked the sheriff’s. “I want to be a grown up.”

Unsurprisingly, the rest of us thought this man was fucking insane. 

When he left the room, my classmates erupted into protests. 

When I stepped inside our house, my mom was actually home. 

She was in the kitchen, shouting on the phone and in her hands was a flyer detailing The Future Work Initiative. 

I was curious, so I read through it. The flyer itself was slick in my clammy hands, smelling of bleach, my nails scratching across each page. 

I only had to get to section three (Uniformity, and Keeping Our Children Safe), an entire section on the specialized colors we would be wearing, to know this thing was actually happening. The bill had passed earlier that morning. Somehow, I kept reading, feeling progressively sicker. 

When I reached The New Parent initiative (Making Sure Our Children Are Fully Protected by Parents Following the Initiative), I ran upstairs to my room and buried my head in my pillows.

I kept reading, hiding under my blankets, my stomach contorting, bile filling my mouth. 

Section 4: Cutting Your Child (Explained):

“As a parent, we empathise that you are worried for your children's future. We understand, while the Cutting process does sound intimidating, it is simply a medical procedure that will protect your child going forward, and ensure they live long, prosperous lives (and, of course, provide you with the next generation)!

The Cutting process is a quick and easy fix which will take exactly 45 minutes

Using precise neurological and physiological intervention, we extract the child self, allowing the adult form to emerge fully developed. 

For your son/daughter, they will not feel time passing, and will  seamlessly transition into adulthood. 

Please be aware, this will not affect your child's neurological development. Once completed, your child will be *turned off*. This is completely normal, and we ask you to please be patient with your child. For more details on what to expect post-Cutting, please refer to **Section 5: Aftercare and Integration.**

Before I could flip over, the flyer was snatched out of my hands.

Mom loomed over me, phone pressed to her ear, her eyes raw from crying. 

She didn't speak to me, instead placing a plate of cookies on my bedside table and kissing my forehead. Mom took the flyer, tore it into two, and dumped it in my trash can.

“Pack a suitcase, just in case,” she told me, before leaving my room. “Only the necessities.”

I understood it was a parent’s job to keep their children safe, but I already knew what was going on, and Mom’s attempts to shield me from the truth only made me feel useless. 

Mom spent the next several weeks campaigning and protesting for my rights, for my classmates’ rights to an education. I insisted on accompanying her, protesting for my own rights, joining my friends and their parents outside the mayor’s office. Mom took me out of school in protest, homeschooling me instead.

I never expected things to actually go forward.

I was a kid. I stood next to my mother and waved my sign, and in the back of my head, I thought, This won't really happen, right? It's just a misunderstanding, and we’ll all go back to school, and this will all be forgotten. 

But one day, Mom came home from the store crying. 

She didn't say why, but I overheard her on the phone speaking to Grammy. 

“It's every *fucking* store,” she whispered. “They're not letting me buy anything, and they're refusing my card. I need to be part of this fucking new parents initiative, if I want gas or food.” 

She sighed, running her fingers along the countertop. “Yes, I'm going to try to skip town. There's a Walmart in the next one over. Okay, yes, I promise. It's okay, I've got our passports.”

I'm not sure how to tell you exactly how my town fell in just a couple of weeks. 

People started throwing rocks at our windows. 

I saw Zach with his mother. Zach was wearing the new mandatory color for us. 

Purple. 

Purple shirt and purple pants for boys. 

Purple dress and purple tights, for girls. 

I only had to see the strain in his face, the way he kept tugging at his mother’s hand, for me to know he *hated* his new clothes. 

I was homeschooled, so I saw everything. 

I wish I didn't. I think part of me wishes I actually went to school, so I didn't witness my life crumbling around me. 

I saw the men in black force their way into our house, restraining my screaming mother, taking her purse, passport, and my birth certificate. 

They also took her phone, laptop, and all of my books from my shelf. 

As part of The Future Work Initiative, I would only be reading town-mandated books. 

I was torn from my mother’s arms two days later, and taken to what used to be the county jail. Instead of holding criminals, it held terrified ten year olds. 

I was thrown into a cell with four other kids. 

We were told, from that moment on, our parents were no longer our parents– and we would be adopted by parents in The New Parent Initiative. Some kids violently fought back, and were dragged away. 

I was left with a girl called Ciara, who slumped next to me. I remember the feeling of her fingers wrapped around mine. In the dim glow of an overhead bulb, she broke out into sobs that I knew lied. 

I saw her expression that day during her presentation. 

She was smiling too. Just like Casper. 

“Well, at least we’ll get jobs,” she murmured, resting her head on my shoulder. “I can't wait to get a job, Mattie.”

I fell asleep, shivering, curled up with Ciara. 

But as quickly as I slipped into slumber, I awoke to a flashlight blinding me. 

My first instinct was to scream, but then I saw the face behind the light. Mom. 

“Get up, honey.” She gently pulled me to my feet, wrapping her arms around me. 

I didn't realize I was crying, until my body was trembling, my arms squeezed around my mother. She smelled like daffodils and her favorite perfume. 

Mom pulled away, pressing a finger to her lips. “We’re going to stay with Grammy, all right?” she whispered. 

Mom gestured for Ciara to follow, but the girl shuffled back, shaking her head of blonde curls. Ciara curled into herself, wrapping her arms around her knees. 

“My Mom is a traitor to the town,” she whispered. Her eyes were vacant. Hollow. Her smile unwavered, fingers gripping the material of her dress. 

“Mom *thinks* she knows what is best for me but I *want* to be a part of The Future Work Initiative.” 

Mom’s eyes darkened, but she stepped back. “Ciara, honey, I want you to come with me and I promise I will keep you safe.”

Ciara lifted her head, settling us with a smile. “If you try to take me away, I will start screaming.”

Mom wanted to save Ciara, but I told her not to bother. 

The girl would take pleasure in me being captured. 

Mom easily dragged me out of the sheriff’s station, and to my surprise, half a dozen other kids boarded a stolen school bus on the edge of the sidewalk. I didn't ask *how* she had saved them, promptly ignoring the body of a man slumped on the sidewalk. 

“He's unconscious,” Mom said quickly, pulling me onto the bus. 

I wondered where all of the other guards were. 

“Daniel?” Mom was speaking into a phone, sliding into the driver's seat. “Yeah, I've got fifteen of them, including my daughter. Yeah, I just need passports for fifteen kids.”

Mom paused, forcing the keys into the ignition. 

“Mom?” I pressed my face against the glass of the window, my gaze glued to the man on the sidewalk. “Is that man dead?”

“Sit down, Mattie.” was all she said, stamping on the gas. 

Mom’s plan to help us escape on a school bus was equal parts genius and stupid. 

I mean, a random woman driving a school bus full of fourth graders in the middle of the night? 

Definitely suspicious. 

I stayed as still as possible at the back of the bus, knees tucked to my chest, arms wrapped around my backpack. 

There were fifteen of us, but all I really saw were familiar faces in a sea of purple. The ones Mom saved. 

Cassie was crying, her face buried in her lap. Kaian was trying to comfort her, but he wasn’t doing a very good job. 

Zach was still standing, his fingers wrapped tightly around a yellow pole as the bus swayed with every turn. 

I noticed his mandatory purple shirt under a jacket hanging off of him. His eyes were wide, his teeth gritted. 

“Are we *there* yet?” he asked, his voice flying up in octaves when she slammed on the brakes, almost sending him flying. Mom didn’t even look back, hands glued to the wheel. 

When Zach asked again, she used her warning voice.

“Sit *down*, Zach.”

“How do we even know we can trust you?” he demanded. He twisted to me, his eyes accusing. “Mattie’s mom could be leading us right into a trap and back to our parents.”

“Zach, you know that's not true,” my mom said softly. “I know you're all scared,  but I'm going to take you somewhere safe.”

“Where?” Zach snapped. “Are you taking us to be chopped up?”

“Somewhere *safe*.” 

“Okay, but *where*?” he wailed, his voice breaking. 

“Canada.”

“Canada?!” he squeaked, almost toppling over. 

“Zach.” Mom’s tone hardened. “I am losing my patience with you. Please sit *down*.”

He didn’t sit, staying stubbornly upright, letting the bus swing him back and forth. 

I caught his gaze following each house we passed, his bottom lip wobbling. 

“If I'm sitting down, I can't run away,” he said through gritted teeth. In the normal days of our town, he was a teacher’s pet. 

Insufferable, but harmless, as long as I remembered to finish my homework.

Zach was the type of kid who announced at the end of class, “Umm, what about homework?” 

This Zach was… different.

I wasn't sure I liked this version of him. 

I noticed we were passing his parents' house, and he ducked immediately, pressing his hand over his mouth. 

I watched the teacher’s pet crumble, coming apart as we flew past the familiar bright red of his mother’s front door. 

I was too scared to unravel my own body, my knees so tightly pressed to my chest, I thought I was going to suffocate. 

“Zach.” Mom’s voice was like warm water coming over me. “Talk to me, honey,” she spoke softly, coaxing Zach into his seat.

He slumped down with a sob, half off of the seat, already ready to run if needed. 

“I *hate* her,” he whispered into his knees, his hands balled into fists. 

“Zach, you know your mother loves you—” Mom started to say, before he let out a scream, slamming his fists against the window. 

""Shut up,"" he spat at my mom through a sob. ""You... you don't know what you're talking about! Mom made me wear this stupid shirt,"" he said, tugging at the material, his lips curling in disgust. ""And she's going to let them cut me up into little pieces!""

“It's not cutting us up into little pieces, moron,” Kaian grumbled. “It's just our brain.”

“No, that's *wrong*,” Cassie whispered. “I read the flyer. They're going to cut us up.”

“Then how will we be able to *work*?” Kaian shot back, tugging at his blonde curls. “If they cut us up into like, tiny little pieces, there won't be anything left of us.”

I thought Mom was going to say something reassuring, that Zach’s mother was just scared. 

But then I saw my mother’s fingers tighten around the wheel, her lip curling in disgust. “You're right,” she said softly. 

“Zach, your mother is brainwashed.” Mom twisted around to shoot him a small smile. 

“But I'm going to take you far away from her, all right? You're not going to be scared again. That goes for *all* of you,” my mother spoke up. “I'm going to keep you all safe.”

I want to tell you that my rights ended in a series of events. 

I want to tell you that we were caught, and my mother was dragged away, screaming. 

But the reality is, my rights ended with a BANG. 

I thought it was a blown tire, or maybe we had run over a cat. But then the screams slammed into me, agonizing wails that wouldn’t leave my head. I was only aware of my mother’s body sitting rigid, and the splintered glass of the bus’s windscreen.

When men and women in black filed onto the bus, yanking us from our seats, I was paralyzed at the back, watching the slow dripping red slide down the windscreen. 

Mom. 

I remember diving forwards. I remember screaming for her. 

But already, I was in a stranger’s arms who smelled like shoe polish and grease. I was carried off of the bus, screaming, and when I looked back, my mom wasn't moving. 

One of the soldiers kicked the heel of his boot into her head, and she slid off of the seat, unmoving, almost like trickling water. 

The thing about grieving is, I learned it was  a long process. 

It was a drawn out process. 

When my grandpappy died, I didn't feel the pain instantly. It was more like a sinking feeling that never really went away.  

But with Mom, I wasn't allowed to grieve. I didn't have *time* to grieve. 

By the time I was fully registering my mother was dead, I was dressed in a purple dress that stuck to my skin, and felt like fire ants, standing outside my new parents front door– a tall man wearing a mask held my hand, and no matter how many times I tugged away, he held tighter. 

Zach was standing behind me, his eyes unseeing. 

He kept nudging me. 

“What are we going to do?”

“Mattie, what do we do now?”

“Mattie, please! Tell me what we are going to do!”

I didn't respond. I was thinking about my mother’s brains dripping down the bus window. 

When the door opened, our new mother welcomed us with open arms. 

She was a big woman with curly hair, and a wide smile. 

“Matilda!” she wrapped her arms around me, pulling Zach into the embrace. 

“Oh, and you must be Zach! Hello, darlings! I’m so happy to be adding to our little family! Wait until you meet your brother!”

Zach wriggled out of her arms, tossing me a look. 

*“Brother?”*

Introducing herself as Mrs H, she led us into a brightly lit kitchen, where a familiar face sat, his head of brown curls buried in a brand new edition of The Future Work Initiative, this time, a kid-friendly booklet. 

Casper. 

Behind me, I could sense Zach stiffening up.

Casper regarded us with a smile, peeking over the booklet. 

“Hello, fellow *siblings*,” he said, his grin widening when Zach mumbled a curse under his breath. “I'm glad you're finally joining me on this exciting journey to The Future Work Initiative!”

He turned the booklet around so we could read a simplified version of the Cutting procedure, and his eyes, wide with excitement, were reveling in every word. 

“Trust me, you're going to *love* it here.”

I was still numb. Still not fully understanding my surroundings. 

What I did know was that Mrs. H’s kitchen smelled like stew, and the bowl of stew in front of my classmate was there one minute, and then it was being dumped on Casper's head.

Casper didn't move, a slew of gravy and potatoes dripping down his face. 

“That's what The Future Work Initiative helps with, Zach,” he spoke calmly, prodding the booklet, reciting every word. 

“It removes *violent* tenancies, which you *clearly* have.” Leaning back in his chair, he settled us with a smirk. “It's not *my* fault you're ‘expressing violent behavior’.”

Zach definitely proved he had ‘violent behavior’ that night.

We were sent to our rooms with no dessert. 

I checked the windows in my room. All locked. 

From that day, I was forced into The Future Work Initiative. 

School was no longer a thing. Instead of learning, we went to church every day. 

Followed by afternoon cherry picking, helping town elders. 

Mrs H assigned me and my brothers to a farm on the edge of town and admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it. I got to look after the animals, pick and grow fruit, and learn how to work the machinery with the farmers. 

I think part of me was hyper fixating on anything that wasn't thinking about my mother.

When I finished my farm work one night, Zach pulled me into the cornfield, where, to my surprise, he'd fashioned a grave for my mother. 

I didn't thank him. I accepted the rose he picked out for me, lay it down on the ground, and broke apart in his arms. 

When I turned thirteen, Mrs H surprised me with mandatory classes after dinner.

Classes weren't allowed. 

According to the new rule, educating children in any way was a criminal offense.

So, when Mrs H broke out hidden workbooks, piling them in front of us, I realized she was actively educating us. 

Casper wasn't a fan. Obviously. But he had missed actually doing *work*. 

He threatened to tell the authorities, until Zach *”threatened* to break his legs. 

So, after dinner, every day, the three of us had five hours of school in the basement. 

Casper refused to join in at first, hiding behind The Future Work Initiative books. 

But, slowly, he started to shift towards us, at first silently watching me complete a test (and trying, multiple times) to correct me. 

“You're doing it *wrong*,” Casper grumbled, sitting with his knees to his chest. 

I ignored him, but I could feel his eyes burning holes into my exam paper. 

“Question 3 is simple, and you're *supposed* to show your working.”

He was right. 

I started to scribble my working, and he let out an exaggerated sigh. 

“Mattie, you're *killing* me.”

Zach, embedded in his own workbook, finally slammed it down in frustration. 

He didn't speak, snatching up a blank workbook, scribbling Casper's name on the front, and throwing at the boy’s head. 

“Harsh.” Casper mumbled. But he did open the workbook, grabbing a pen. 

His eyes flicked to me, lips curling. “Just so you know, I'm only doing this because you two are too stupid to do it on your own.”

Casper started joining us for every lesson, afterwards. 

He started doing his own tests, and even requesting more books for him to read. 

Growing into a teenager, I started to realize my procedure wasn't far away. 

I was thirteen years old, still working the fields, picking fruit, and attending church to “pray for forgiveness’. 

Apparently, being semi educated at the age of twelve was ‘bad’. 

We had to learn ‘REAL’ American values. Our priest had been replaced with a man in a black mask. 

I was getting ready for my SAT’s in secret. Mrs H had managed to get her hands on old papers from years before, but it was enough. 

Zach questioned her, halfway through a  pop quiz. 

“What's the point?” he said, his pen lodged between his teeth. Zach was boyishly handsome, hiding under thick brown curls.

He was also seriously crushing on the guy who delivered our town-mandated newspapers. “Why are you helping us with our SAT’s if we’re not going to college?”

“I second that.” I spoke up, looking up from my work. “You're working *with* them.”

Mrs H sighed, before kneeling on the ground. 

“I tell you this once, and only once,” she said softly. “Yes, I may very well agree with The Future Work Initiative. But I also stand for children getting a proper education.”

Her eyes flicked to me. “Make no mistake, Matilda. I *will* be delivering you to the Cutting bay. But first, you will be  correctly educated, so you can enter the world as fully functioning intelligent adults.”

“But what if we don't *want* to?” Zach spoke with gritted teeth. 

I nudged him to shut up, but he was already straightening up. 

“Mrs H, you've been teaching me since I was a kid, and I appreciate that,” he whispered. “I wouldn't know what the fuck I was doing if you didn't let me continue school.”

“Language, Zach.”

“Sorry.” he rolled his eyes. “You just said you believe in our rights to be educated, but you're happy sending us to be cut up?”

Mrs H didn't speak. Even Casper was silent, gaze glued to his workbook. 

Casper had changed over the years. I think he'd regained his love for learning. 

(and being a pretentious, know-it-all little shit). 

There was an ominous silence, before he coughed awkwardly. 

“I believe in The Future Work Initiative,” Casper said softly, dragging his pen across the floor. He was cross legged, a book on his lap. “But… I think it should be a choice.”

Casper rolled his eyes when Zach balked at him. 

“Maybe.”

Mrs H startled us by slamming her own book on the floor. 

“That's *enough,*” she said. But her expression was eerily familiar to my forty grade teacher before she abandoned us. She looked hopeless. Scared. Confused. 

Mrs H’s tone darkened. “If you speak another *word*, you can forget dessert.”

We did shut up, but already, I think our new mother was having her own doubts. 

Still. Zach and I made plans to run. Casper hung around us. 

“I'm *not* coming with you.” he kept insisting, but he never left our side. 

On the day of The Cut, we would attend church, go back to the house, and be escorted by our mother to the Cutting bay. 

Our plan was to sneak out of church, and make a run for it. 

On the day I would be Cut, I stuffed my face with pancakes.

I was fifteen years old. I was supposed to be going to school. 

I was *supposed*  to have an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. 

“Morning.” Zach said, sipping coffee. His prolonged gaze meant he was still ready to run. 

I gave him a simple jerk of my head, twisting around and pouring my cereal. 

“You two are painfully obvious,” Casper grumbled from behind an *actual* book. 

“But you're coming.” Zach breathed to him in passing, going straight for the cookies. 

Casper didn't look up from his book. “Of course I'm *coming*.”

Mrs H greeted us at breakfast, before dropping the bombshell. 

“There will be a car waiting for you outside in five minutes,” she said stiffly, tears filling her eyes. “I want you, with zero questions, to get in the back, and do not look back.”

I didn't know what to say. I hugged her. I cried. 

Zach and I embraced our mother, and at that moment I really did think we were a family. 

Casper stood with a curled lip, for maybe 0.1 seconds, before joining in. 

Mrs H told us to pack a bag. There were no hugs goodbye, no tearful thank yous, though I did promise to contact her once we were out of town. 

She guarded the door, and when we were ready, ushered us out, down the lawn, and straight into the back of a sleek range rover. I jumped in, followed by Zach, and finally, Casper, squeezing himself between the two of us. 

We were free. 

I only let out a sigh of relief when we were far away from Mrs H's house. 

“You kids all right?” the driver, a youngish looking man, spoke up after a long silence. 

I didn't respond. 

Next to me, Zach was shaking, his hands clasped in his lap. 

""We're fine,"" Casper said after nudging me to respond. ""It's nothing a little therapy, for, I don't know, the rest of our fucking lives, won't fix.""

The driver laughed heartily. “Good! Do you kids mind if I play a little music?”

He stabbed the radio on, regardless of our response. 

I liked the song. I don't know it, but the lyrics stuck with me as I crumpled into rich leather seats, letting my head tip back, my eyes flickering shut, reveling in the music. 

Tell me lies, 

Tell me sweet little lies

Something, something, I'm not making plans. 

I didn't realize I was dozing off, until Casper nudged me. 

Hard. 

“Hey.” he whispered, and my eyes shot open. “Mattie. Something is wrong.”

Next to me, Zach’s head had found my shoulder. 

But in front of me, something was thick and foggy. 

I think I laughed, tipping my head back. I felt a panic surge, but my body was already numb. 

Mrs H already knew we were going to escape. 

So, in the most gentle, and yet horrific way possible, she was delivering on her earlier words. 

What a fucking *bitch*. 

I don't remember how I got from a car to being strapped down to a hospital bed. There was a bright, clinical light above me. 

A tube stuck down my throat. 

“Mattie? Sweetie, do we have your consent to begin the procedure?”

The voice came from the figure looming over me. 

I told her, “No.” and she responded with: “Great! Count down from twenty, Mattie!”

Where were my brothers? I felt my body jerk violently under harsh velcro straps. 

“Count for me, sweetheart,” the nurse hummed in my ear. 

I did. 

I mean, I tried. 

Outside, I could hear thudding footsteps, loud wails. 

“Let me *go*!” 

I couldn't grasp the voice; my mind was already unraveling. 

“Fucking *assholes*! Let me go!”

I was partially aware of clinical white gloves hovering over me. 

I counted backwards from 20. 

19

I can only describe it as a flash, like a photo being taken.

I blinked once, and those sterile white gloves were covered in blood.

I blinked twice, and I was screeching into the tube forced down my throat.

Three times.

""Matilda?""

Slumped in front of me, spread out on a leather chair, was my boss.

Tall, oldish, wearing an odd smile.

I was sitting, one leg crossed over the other, in a large office. A perfectly pressed dress, my hair pinned into a ponytail. It really was a blink of an eye. I was an adult. 

I didn't even feel time passing.

I was twenty-five years old, and I *felt* twenty-five years old.

""Matilda, is there a problem?"" My boss jerked my attention back to him.

""No,"" I said, my voice was deeper. ""No, there's no… problem.""

It looked like we were in the middle of a conversation. I stood, holding my hand out for him to shake. His hand was clammy. 

Slimy. 

I smiled, sick to my stomach.

""I'm looking forward to working with you, sir.""",4,1769137716.0,stories,1,0.75,False

These were frequently costly, rigid, and isolating for individuals or small groups. The coworking revolution was made possible by the growth of the internet & the gig economy, as well as a change in our perception of work—from a fixed location to a flexible, outcome-driven activity. This revolution has taken root in Bahrain and adapted to the country's unique economic currents.\
\
The phenomenon known as ""Third Place."". One way to conceptualize coworking spaces is as a classic ""third place."". A neutral, professional, and community-focused environment is provided by coworking spaces, which go beyond the home (the first place) and the traditional office (the second). In addition to being a place where work is done, social and professional ties are made there.\
\
For many Bahrainis, this has turned into a crucial hub for overcoming the possible loneliness of working remotely or locating a starting point for new projects. Beyond Hot-Desking alone.

In Bahrain, a coworking space's main feature is flexibility. This shows up in different ways.\
\
private workspaces. For teams or businesses that need a dedicated, branded space but wish to avoid the long-term commitment & capital expenditure of traditional leases, a lot of coworking spaces offer fully furnished, private offices. These offices bridge the gap between total autonomy & the advantages of a shared community by providing access to shared amenities and services. specialized desks. Dedicated desks provide a private area in a shared setting for people or small groups who are constantly present but would rather not share a desk.\
\
This puts them in the coworking community while giving them a consistent workspace & a sense of ownership. Flexible memberships with hot desks. Probably the most well-known type of coworking is this. Members are free to enter & select any desk that is open for the day or a predetermined amount of time.\
\
For independent contractors, remote workers, or people who travel a lot and require a dependable place to concentrate, this is perfect. Event & Meeting Spaces. Coworking spaces frequently have a variety of meeting spaces, ranging from compact huddle rooms for private conversations to spacious conference rooms ideal for team offsite meetings or client presentations.\
\
Also, many offer adaptable event spaces that can be reserved for company meetings, product launches, networking events, & workshops. As a result, the coworking space becomes a vibrant venue rather than just an office. services for virtual offices. Virtual office packages are a popular choice for companies that don't need a physical location but still need a professional address & mail handling services. This increases credibility & serves as a point of contact for formal correspondence by offering a valid business address in Bahrain.\
\
Place and connectivity strategically. Bahrain's advantageous position in the Arabian Gulf makes it an ideal entry point between the East and the West. This is advantageous for coworking spaces in the Kingdom, which provide practical hubs for people & businesses operating in various time zones and geographical areas. Bahrain is a desirable location for businesses because of the improved connectivity, both digitally through strong internet infrastructure & physically through transportation links.\
\
Government assistance and rewards. The coworking industry has directly benefited from the Bahraini government's aggressive promotion of entrepreneurship & foreign investment. Coworking spaces thrive because of initiatives like supportive regulatory frameworks, incubators, accelerators, and frequently direct financial incentives.\
\
These areas then serve as channels for these government programs, providing resources to business owners and encouraging creativity. An Expanding Startup Network. The startup scene in Bahrain is booming, especially in areas like FinTech, e-commerce, and the creative industries. At the center of this expansion are coworking spaces, which offer these new companies crucial infrastructure and a collaborative setting. They serve as incubators for both ideas and real-world business operations, enabling startups to grow without incurring significant overhead right away. Cultural subtleties and community development.\
\
Although coworking is a universal concept, Bahrain's application of it is impacted by cultural norms. Networking, establishing connections, & cultivating a sense of community that honors regional customs are all highly valued. This translates into coworking spaces that are socially conscious in addition to being functional, frequently holding events that combine cultural exchange with professional development. independent professionals and freelancers.\
\
A coworking space provides a professional setting away from the distractions of home for independent contractors, such as graphic designers, consultants, writers, or developers. It fights the loneliness that comes with working for yourself by giving you access to dependable internet, printing services, and—perhaps most importantly—a feeling of community among professionals. Small businesses and startups. Perhaps the best fit for coworking spaces is startups. They provide the scalability that expanding companies sorely need.\
\
Within the same supportive ecosystem, a startup can start with a single desk and grow to a private office as its team expands. One of the main draws is the cost-effectiveness, which enables valuable funds to be allocated to market expansion and product development rather than office infrastructure. Distributed teams & employees working remotely. Coworking spaces in Bahrain offer a useful solution for workers who live locally but whose employers are located abroad as more businesses adopt remote work. They provide a professional setting for video calls, a fixed work address, and a chance for local networking that might otherwise go unnoticed. A coworking space can act as a regular meeting place or regional hub for remote teams.\
\
Big Businesses Are Looking for Flexibility. Coworking spaces are becoming valuable even for well-established companies. They could use them for project-specific teams, satellite offices in Bahrain, or as a flexible option for workers who would rather not be confined to a traditional office. Without the commitment of a long-term lease, this provides a means to keep a physical presence and access local talent. promoting cooperation and innovation. Coworking spaces are meant to be hotbeds of creativity.\
\
They foster an environment that is conducive to the exchange of ideas by uniting people from various industries and backgrounds. Unintentional meetings in the kitchen or hallway can lead to new projects, collaborations, or solutions to challenging issues. This spirit of cooperation accelerates growth & discovery like a biological catalyst. boosting local economies.\
\
Coworking spaces support local business owners & draw in foreign investment by offering flexible and reasonably priced workspaces. Increased business activity, job creation, & overall economic stimulation result from this. They serve as economic engines, fostering the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses, the foundation of any robust economy. improving the integration of work and life.\
\
Although coworking spaces are frequently discussed in terms of keeping work & life apart, they can actually improve integration. Because of the flexibility they provide, people can arrange their workdays to fit their personal lives, including taking care of their families or engaging in personal hobbies. This results in a more satisfying and well-rounded work experience.\
\
assisting international talent and digital nomads. Digital nomads and international talent are increasingly drawn to coworking spaces due to Bahrain's favorable visa policies & developing digital infrastructure. For those who choose to work remotely while exploring new cultures & environments, they offer the crucial professional environment and support system.\
\
In Bahrain, coworking spaces are more than just a passing fad; they signify a fundamental change in the way we think about work. The need for flexible, cooperative, and community-driven workspaces will only grow as the world economy continues to change due to technology and shifting labor demographics. We expect spaces to continue expanding and becoming even more specialized, providing specialized solutions for particular needs & industries.\
\
The next generation of coworking spaces in Bahrain is probably going to be shaped by the incorporation of smart technologies, improved wellness amenities, & a greater emphasis on sustainability. They are becoming more & more essential nodes in the network of contemporary professional life, helping people and companies adapt, innovate, and prosper in a world that is constantly changing. .\

My husband has been back at work for three weeks now, I'm the primary caregiver during the week but have become a bit of a hermit. Besides going to my parents frequently, I have gone out to the shops with my baby and my mum twice, I have gone a few walks babywearing on my own, and I have gone out for coffee with a friend once.

My husband usually does runs to the shops or laundromat when needed and I stay with LO. I have only done a grocery run twice, leaving LO with my husband, only after he's been fed and settled for a nap. I'm never gone for more than an hour.

I'm planning to do dinner with my friends tomorrow night. We've chosen a place that is only 10 minutes away. I EBF but I've started pumping to build up a stash and my husband has bottle fed LO once since then.

Just wondering when everyone else started going out without their baby? Is 7 weeks too soon?

Hey! – came across this quote: ""Life is not in its goal. Life is in its process – in how you experience it within yourself right now."" It's a gut-check for those of us always eyeing the finish line, whether it's a promotion or that dream vacay. In a world obsessed with milestones, it nudges us to savor the messy middle. Breaking it down with a story, a Gen Z twist, and some angles. What's your take – ever miss the moment chasing the win?

#### A Short Story to Drive It Home
Meet Raj, a driven engineer in his 30s, laser-focused on becoming CEO by 40. He maps every step: late nights coding, networking events, skipping family dinners for strategy sessions. One day, he lands the big promotion – corner office, fat bonus. But as he sinks into the chair, a hollow ache hits. The ""goal"" feels flat; he realizes he bulldozed through sunrises with his kid, heartfelt chats with his partner, and even the simple joy of a quiet coffee. Burned out, he takes a sabbatical, hikes a trail, and rediscovers the thrill in the sweat of the climb, the rustle of leaves, the breath syncing with his pulse. No trophy at the end, just presence. Turns out, the real summit was every step he rushed past. Like the marathoner who crosses the line but forgets the crowd's cheers and endorphin rush along the way.

#### Gen Z Life Situation
We're the kings of deferred gratification – grinding TikTok side hustles while doom-scrolling ""5-year plans"" on Notion templates. Think about it: In 2026, with AI eating entry-level jobs and rent skyrocketing, we're all about that ""manifest your empire"" vibe. You skip weekend hangs to build your OnlyFans or dropship empire, promising yourself ""freedom"" once it hits 10k/month. But when it does? The algorithm changes, or you're too fried to enjoy the wins. A buddy of mine bailed on her law dream mid-clerkship last year, pivoted to travel vlogging, and now she's all about the ""process"" – editing clips at sunset beaches, connecting with random viewers' stories. No more ""I'll be happy when..."" It's freeing, especially in our eco-anxious era; embracing the now means micro-adventures like urban foraging or VR meditation breaks, not waiting for the ""perfect"" life upgrade. How do you catch those fleeting highs amid the hustle?

#### Different Perspectives
- \*\*Psychological View\*\*: This vibes with flow state research from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi – peak experiences happen in deep immersion, not endpoint highs. Goal-chasing spikes dopamine short-term, but chronic ""arrival fallacy"" leads to depression; mindfulness practices like journaling ""right now"" gratitudes rewire that. Studies show process-focused folks report higher life satisfaction, dodging the post-achievement blues.

- \*\*Philosophical Angle\*\*: Straight out of Taoism (Lao Tzu: ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"") or existentialism (Sartre: existence precedes essence). It's a counter to Western goal porn – capitalism sells the ""hustle to heaven"" myth, but in Indigenous wisdom, life's a circle, not a line. Critics argue it's naive in survival mode; if your ""process"" is poverty or discrimination, goals are lifelines, not distractions.

- \*\*Modern Cultural Spin\*\*: In the creator economy, it's why unboxing videos flop – we crave the behind-the-scenes grind more than the reveal. Amid 2026's metaverse boom, embracing process could mean co-creating virtual worlds for fun, not clout. But realistically, for gig workers, it's about boundaries: log off at 8 PM to taste your dinner, not chase one more edit.

I currently deal with OCD and a mix of exposure therapy and tracking has helped me significantly. I also may need Beta testers in the near future if anyone would like to share to help, send your email. 



#  Medications

Log medications with timestamp and random reassurance message (e.g., ""You DEFINITELY took it! 💯""). Creates concrete proof you took your meds to break checking cycles.



# Drink Safety

Track drinks with 30-minute safe window timer. Green = safe, Orange = exposure opportunity. Mark as finished or discarded. Helps manage contamination fears.



# Delay Compulsions

Add compulsions (easiest to hardest). When urge hits, delay it with a timer (1 min - 1 hour). Do something else instead. Creates space between urge and action—brain learns you don't have to act on it.



#  Track Obsessions

Log obsessive thoughts without judgment. Externalizing thoughts reduces their power and shows they're just thoughts, not facts.



#  Log Avoidances

Track situations you avoid with anxiety ratings (0-100). Convert to exposures with ""Face This Challenge!"" button. Awareness creates your treatment roadmap.



#  Exposure Therapy

**Before:** Rate anxiety + write feared outcome **During:** Face the situation **After:** Rate anxiety + write actual outcome

Shows anxiety drops naturally and feared outcomes rarely happen. Each exposure builds evidence against OCD and makes the next one easier.



#  Avoidance → Exposure Flow

Convert logged avoidances directly into exposure challenges. Pre-fills situation and anxiety level. Track conquered fears with special badges. **This turns your anxiety hierarchy into actionable treatment steps.**",0,1769136697.0,OCDRecovery,0,0.5,False
1qkezah,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1qkezah/built_a_saas_while_at_ucla_heres_what_that/,Built a SaaS while at UCLA -- here’s what that actually looked like,"Started working on a side project called Rytar while living in De Neve and spending way too many late nights in Powell Library and the Research Library. At first it was just me trying to figure out why all the blog content I wrote never actually got traffic -- publish, check stats, nothing moves, repeat. Between classes, dining hall meals, and the 11th-hour group projects, I somehow kept iterating on it.



Fast forward a couple years and it’s now a real SaaS hitting $13k MRR. Most of that growth came from boring stuff: diving into SEO while sipping coffee in Kerckhoff, talking to early users from Anderson projects, and slowly building a product that actually solved a problem instead of trying to chase trends. It wasn’t flashy, and most days felt like a grind, but all those late library sessions added up.



Posting this because I know a lot of Bruins are juggling side projects, clubs, and coursework and sometimes feel like everyone else is ahead. You’re not. You can actually turn those late nights in the residence halls or the library into something real -- it just takes time, patience, and figuring out what actually matters.

From my universe is Deputy Director Kate Emerson. She rose to her position at a young age and yet her sights are held even higher in the Greater American Empire. So she works extremely hard, with work being her entire life. She’s bubbly, talkative, and oddly friendly. She’s the person who briefs most of the special forces ops and serves as their ‘guy in the chair.’ She’s an insomniac and is addicted to coffee. Story wise, she only appears when the main character Jackal joins a special forces group for a while and she briefs his mission. After that she’s a minor  background character who’s mentioned very few times. She works for the bad guys but I wouldn’t say she’s an antagonist herself.

I consulted Gemini on my tandem walking video (on my profile, I posted it on another sub, this sub doesn’t allow videos), I asked about if whether or not my right arm are stiff when doing tandem walking, they said it was then went on something about parkinsons . I don’t know if it’s me subconsciously tensing and stiffening my right arm but I don’t know. I’m more worried about sCJD (Sporadic Creutzfeldt Disease) or SFI (Sporadic Fatal Insomnia).

(Attached on this post are pictures of today’s sleep according to my Apple Watch, and my Memtrax Cognitfit memory test result for today)

This all started 7 days ago in the library, it was a Thursday (I got like 5h30m of sleep, drank coffee), my left hand was twitching and I did my own test which is grabbing my phone with my hand, my left hand was stiffer than my right for some reason, and so I panicked and thought this was ALS, I didn’t get much work done that day because I was panicking. Then I proceeded to lift 20lbs with just my index and thumb, bad idea, I was able to lift it with my left, but it got tired to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore while my right (dominant hand) was perfectly fine, I interpreted this as ALS and got scared. Slept, no problem, I wasn’t worried about SFI or sCJD this time.

6 days ago (Friday), still worried about ALS. I got about 5+ hours of sleep again, then went to work which was me talking to customers, I am pretty sure I caught some sort of cold, infection here, but i digress. I went home tired, and took a nap for about an hour? Maybe 2? So it could legitimately be me getting sick here with a cold, sinus infection or something because i dont typically nap. Anyways I went to bed at 11 but didt sleep because I was on my laptop doing things for hours, it wasnt until like 4:30 am where I truly went to bed….. or tried to. I couldnt fall asleep until like 6 am, I was tossing and turning, it could be because it was quite hot (my tower fan got replaced by this trashy normal fan) maybe? But I didt interpret it as such, I immediately was thinking sCJD or SFI now, no longer ALS. So while I was trying to sleep, I was thinking what if it’s sCJD or SFI? Eventually I fell asleep for almost 5 hours straight before waking up, and falling back asleep 17 minutes (according to my Apple Watch) after for another 40 minutes or so)

5 days ago (Saturday) like I said, only about 5h40m of sleep. Now with  new fear of SFI and sCJD. So I did a lot of self testing. Slept….. or tried to… my fear, it wasn’t a fluke, I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour again, but looking back at it now, I was so anxious and and constantly thinking about it that it may have contributed as to why it took me an hour to sleep. Basically I went to bed at 12:30am, couldn’t sleep until 1:37 am (according to my Apple Watch). Surprisingly I actually got a decent sleep, slept about 7 hours, only woke up once for like 8 mins before going back to sleep.

4 days ago (Sunday), with 7 hours of sleep, I should be vindicated right? No. I consulted AI and found out that prodome symptoms of sCJD can be insomnia, or something like that (uncommon but possible). So I went into a panicking spiral again and did constant self testing. Just thinking about the prodome symptom right now is making me slightly anxious and terrified. Bug I digress. I went to bed and surprisingly fell asleep quite quickly I’d say. Was about 10-20 minutes. Got 6h50 minutes of sleep. Can’t recall if I woke up once this night, but either way should be enough that it wasn’t sCJD or SFI right?

Nope. 3days ago (Monday). I remember hearing that whilst clinically in SFI, it presents similar to sCJD not FFI. Basically ataxia and cognitive decline. But then I also remember in SFI even if you fall asleep, it isn’t actually real sleep. So I’m thinking, what if I am not actually sleeping and just thinking that? It’ll make sense why patients don’t complain about sleeping, because they think they’re sleeping. So I went and basically self tested constantly for the entire day until I was “satisfied”. I didn’t go to bed until like 2:20 am? I didn’t have a specific time to go to bed, I was even kind of self testing, doing Rapid Alternating Hand movement test, nose to finger test, rapid alternating finger movement, etc. I slept fairly easily at 2:38. I don’t recall waking up at night. Just straight sleep, I got 6 hours 13 minutes of sleep according to my Apple Watch S10.

2 days ago (Tuesday) still fearful of of sCJD and SFI did mostly the same as Monday. Also I haven’t mentioned this, but remember what I said about probably having gotten sick on Friday with some sort of cold? Sinus infection or something? Well when I slept (went to bed at 12:40, went to sleep at like 12:50, so fairly easily, woke up at 6:21 am, couldn’t fall back asleep, so I just woke up fully because I would’ve had a thinking fit, so I forced myself to get up. Basically I got roughly around 5h45m? Of sleep) and woke up, I got this clogged nose, and phlegm, yellow pleghm that I coughed out, interesting fact, but I mentioned this because I’m wondering if maybe my body is fighting an infection which can maybe explain why my bpm even when sleeping has been higher than before 6 days ago (Friday), like my sleep bpm is not alarmingly high perse, but it’s definitely elevated.

1 day ago (Wednesday) with 5 hours plus of sleep, I was tempted on getting coffee again but decided to go with green tea, not too high of caffeine. Powered through school and went back home…. To do more self testing. Yes. Basically school, back home not to relax, do homework, just straight to self testing. I went to bed at 12:30, was now having another thinking fit about sCJD and SFI (I think because I was dissatisfied with the self testing result on Wednesday), initially I was expecting another 1 hour of turning and tossing, but nope, according to my Apple Watch I slept at 12:46, and I can tell because I was in the middle of a dream before I woke up. Anyways, I woke up at 5:19, shucks, I gotta go back asleep. So what I did was clear my nose (which to be fair wasn’t as clogged like mentioned on the Tuesday part. I felt pleghm in my throat but it wasn’t bad, I could manage. I pulled back my night light, put on some Vicks on my nose, and just waited to fall back asleep, I was maybe panicking a bit on if I don’t fall back asleep I’m gonna feel like shit the next day with only 4+ hours and I would go on a spiral how I’m getting less and less sleep. But to my relief, I fell back asleep at 5:42 am (according to Apple Watch) and woke up at 7. I could tell I fell asleep because my eyes felt better, you know when you wake up with lack of sleep your eyes feel like shit and tired? It was better. But then I stayed at bed a bit long thinking to myself that it won’t be as bad now if I don’t fall back asleep, but apparently according to my Apple Watch I fell back asleep at around 7:10am? it must’ve been a very light sleep maybe? Because I closed my eyes and opened them and now it’s 7:52 am. I forced myself up this time.

So according to my watch I slept for 6h30h ish mins. So not bad? I didn’t feel as shit as on Wednesday with a sleep of 5h40m. Anyways I’m writing this now, just to journal but also ask, and hopefully get some answers?

Today (Thursday) Anyways, as of my current status, I can still do tandem walking, my reaction time seems to be relatively unaffected, averaging 170-180ms on human benchmark,  I can do finger to nose test (closing my eyes, standing up, doing a t pose essentially, putting my finger both right and left on my nose. I can do rapid alternative finger movement, rapid alternative hand movement. I did memory testing today, my score is 100% with 481ms reaction time. I still have this pleghm thingy, everytime I speak after being quiet for so long, I have to cough to clear my throat. I still get these random pins and needles (it started all the way back on Tuesday or Monday), it can appear on my hand right or left, feet right or left, leg right or left, calves right or left. It’s random and it feels like one or two hot needles? What’s going on?",1,1769136249.0,AskMedical,3,0.66,False
