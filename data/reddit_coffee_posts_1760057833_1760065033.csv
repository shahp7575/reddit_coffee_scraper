I can no longer enjoy having a regular cup of coffee elsewhere. I've never been a guy who buys much coffee from restaurants/shops, but now when I do I'm so disappointed.

1o2pj6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1o2pj6h/downtown_calgary_needs_better_public_washroom/,Downtown Calgary needs better public washroom access — commuters shouldn’t have to beg for it,"I work in downtown Calgary and usually get off the LRT at 3rd Ave. Today I had a big cup of black coffee on the train, and by the time I reached, my bladder was about to explode.

I saw the Good Earth Coffeehouse near the 6th Ave LRT station and figured I’d grab another coffee while using their washroom. Before ordering, I politely asked the barista if I could use the restroom (it was literally right beside her). She said, “It’s not public — you’ll have to ask security across the hallway for the code.”

So I hurry to the security desk, barely holding it together, and the guard says, “It’s not for public use.” I explained I wasn’t loitering — just a working guy with a genuine emergency. After repeating myself, visibly fed up, he finally took pity on me, walked me to a washroom, and unlocked it.

I get that there are issues downtown — people misusing washrooms, safety concerns, etc. But come on… it was 8 AM, I was dressed formally, and it was a coffee shop. If this is what someone in my situation has to go through, imagine how much worse it could be for others — especially women, seniors, or anyone with medical conditions.

Where can I even raise this as a civic concern? Shouldn’t downtown Calgary have some accessible washrooms for the public?

1o2ph46,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1o2ph46/my_31f_nosy_neighbor_40f_is_creating_unnecessary/,"My (31F) nosy neighbor (40F) is creating unnecessary drama, how do I respond?","
I signed my 2 year old up for a part time school close to us off of a neighbors recommendation. She lives right next door, shes nice enough but shes the nosy type and knows everyones business.

At this school, they assign you buddies, someone to answer your questions or whatever if you need help. This buddy reached out to me to introduce herself and said we got paired together, maybe we could meet up for coffee etc. The day she had mentioned I said I couldnt and I said maybe next week but she said she wasnt sure and would get back to me. I missed her text when she did tell me, when she asked again we had contractors starting on our house and a lot going on so I asked for a raincheck. 

Honestly, I’m not planning on getting together with her. This school is very heavy on community and social events (I didnt know this until after we signed up) and its just not me, I always have things going on, we just finished house projects with people in and out, my son was sick last week and I’m sick now, and I’m also very newly pregnant and not feeling well. I was very nice over texts, I doubt this woman is dying to get together so I figured no big deal. 

Well now my nosy ass neighbor texted me that my buddy told her she “reached out a couple times and didnt hear back” from me. 

I’m just fuming at this point. I dont understand why shes involving herself in this and why its her problem. I dont want to respond because I dont want to fuel her fire and make her think this is ok to do because it has nothing to do with her. But I will probably bump into her at some point and honestly dont even want to acknowledge her because it just really pisses me off. Shes such a nosy person, before school started she tried telling me I had to come to all these events and things and almost forcing me. Like if I want to go I’ll go? We signed our son up for some socialization and fun and to learn, not for us to make friends and socialize idk.

I (27f) and my friend b (26f) have been friends since middle school she is essentially the same age is me but was born a few months later in the new year, but practically the same age. So we both lived in the same city our whole lives and I am the only one with a car. Since at the time we both lived close to each other i didn't really charge for gas money oe anything since we like to go to the same places plus we had buses so she never got a car. However, I recently moved a few years ago 2 hours away and the drive has been strenuous. I have talked to B before about it and she promised to help with gas money and such. We also had this conversation when I still lived in the city too but B didn't contribute as often then either. So one time she visited I taught her to drive and got B her license in 3 days while I was sick *not trying to brag though lol* but I did hope it would motivate B to want to get a car so she can visit me more. Also, I do get tired easy especially if I'm picking her up after a long day of work or something else and would hope she would at least offer to drive to or from her place, but it never happens. I also would hope since i spend about $60 to to pick B up and drop her off she would help but she only buys me a coffee on the way back to her place in addition to employee discount which contribute to less than $13 which sucks at times. I However, hope she would want to get a car and bring it up in conversation lightly but this still hasn't happened and B keeps telling me she is saving up but every time I see her B has new jewelry or anime stuff which is not cheap. B keeps telling me she broke or has bills to pay, so when we make plans we don't really do much. 
So my issue is that I can't keep driving to pick her up without contributing more or making an effort to come out to see me where I can pick her up closer. It's hurting my bank and my miles. I love B like a sister and she has been there for me for all my chaos and try to be there for her but she's more reserved. I have made new friends where I live and I had hoped B would have made new friends too in the 4 years we have been apart but hasn't really. It could be because B is more introverted and I'm both intro and extro. However, I want her to find reason to have a more open experience besides relying on me for a good time. Plus I can be a bit of a people pleaser which is why I still pick her up when we make plans. I have to plan an additional day off work just to pick her up before the day of our plans knowing the trip is about a total of 4 hours and just want to relax after that and can't keep putting myself though the strain especially since I have gone back to school while working full time I'm exhausted and wish she would help if she want to hang out. 
*So do I cut my loss for a long term friendship or try harder with her to make her help when B wants to visit. 
*note B is extremely nice person.*

She lives right next door, shes nice enough but shes the nosy type and knows everyones business.

At this school, they assign you buddies, someone to answer your questions or whatever if you need help. This buddy reached out to me to introduce herself and said we got paired together, maybe we could meet up for coffee etc. The day she had mentioned I said I couldnt and I said maybe next week but she said she wasnt sure and would get back to me. I missed her text when she did tell me, when she asked again we had contractors starting on our house and a lot going on so I asked for a raincheck. 

Honestly, I’m not planning on getting together with her. This school is very heavy on community and social events (I didnt know this until after we signed up) and its just not me, I always have things going on, we just finished house projects with people in and out, my son was sick last week and I’m sick now, and I’m also very newly pregnant and not feeling well. I was very nice over texts, I doubt this woman is dying to get together so I figured no big deal. 

Well now my nosy ass neighbor texted me that my buddy told her she “reached out a couple times and didnt hear back” from me. 

I’m just fuming at this point. I dont understand why shes involving herself in this and why its her problem. I dont want to respond because I dont want to fuel her fire and make her think this is ok to do because it has nothing to do with her. But I will probably bump into her at some point and honestly dont even want to acknowledge her because it just really pisses me off. Shes such a nosy person, before school started she tried telling me I had to come to all these events and things and almost forcing me. Like if I want to go I’ll go? We signed our son up for some socialization and fun and to learn, not for us to make friends and socialize idk.

I had promised another redditor I would write a synopsis of my campaign and while I am doing that I had fun and channeled my inner Hoid into the writting. I hope y'all like it!

  
Chapter 1. Intro time baby

   There’s nothing like getting together for a sleepover with friends. Even as adults, your Narrator reflects, the ability to push back sleep, as you can always catch up on that later, so you can spend more time engaging with friends, is like no other. That is how our fateful story begins, dear reader, as my four friends took off of work and planned a weekend full of games, laughter, and very little sleep.

   Friday goes well with everyone making it in mostly on time. First to walk in is Clover, with her long black hair and some nonsense attitude. She does love her silly conversations or dirty jokes. Clover always has a discerning look on her face as if she’s thinking five steps ahead of everyone. The first to tell you she can be very defensive, but conversely is a good listener (Haha) that truly wants to help. The kind of person whose notes have mental notes on how to take notes. Where was I? Oh right, she greets the narrator and his wife (for of course he is married to the most beautiful woman on both planets) as we were definitely not trying to madly finish cleaning the apartment. 

   How does so much dust accumulate? Thankfully, it’s just dead human particles that come off with a Swiffer and not needing a whole job to scrape it off as it falls from the sky. But I get ahead of myself.

   Speaking of getting ahead, the next friend to come in briefly says high before rushing ahead and heading directly to the bathroom. Toe (no that’s not his real name of course we all have different names) is the tallest and biggest of the lot. One of those types who you know your good friends if he bullies you every little chance he can get. A little rough around the edges but if he cares about you there is no going back. A true ride or die kind of friend. Unless of course duty calls as he flies by. 

   Third to walk in is Fate. They come in with their laid-back attitude reflected in the baseball cap they are wearing front forward on their freshly shaven head. I mean, who keeps it functional nowadays? I thought everyone still tried to act cool with it backwards and just squinted in the sun. Nonetheless, Fate has the smallest frame and an attitude to match. Which is to say none. Amongst friends, more of a go with the flow kind of person, much like your braggadocious narrator. Although force them to be in charge and they will bring out the managerial side that kept their coffee shop running despite the stupid coworkers and the stupider customers. 

   After the many separate bathroom breaks, as sadly the Narrator is balling on a budget and only has the one bathroom, we all get together in the living room to catch up and shoot the shit as we wait on the last friend to make it. 

   A little while later, we hear the knock, and I let my friend Merc in. The shortest of the friends, but don’t let that fool you. Her presence and volume speak, well volumes, your Narrator says with a shrug. She too, has long black hair, more curly than Clover’s. She apologizes for being late as she was held up at work, saving dog lives or something. With a joyful attitude and a straight kind of humor, she completes the group as we settled in for a night of fun.

   After calling it quits with the games and noting it is time for bed, we then stay up chatting for much longer than we anticipated (as always).

   We bid each other good night, for they have their air mattresses and sofa beds all set up. Your narrator settles in his bedroom with his wonderful wife, who went to bed at a much more reasonable time.

   Couldn’t have been a more great evening of fun. I can’t wait to get a whole day of it tomorrow your sorely mistaken Narrator thought as he drifted off to sleep.

  

Chapter 2. The shower continues to run…

   The group of friends slowly wake up in the morning to hear the shower going with the door closed. Nothing out of the ordinary, the Narrator thinks they think. As their friend (Me the Narrator) does like to take short showers in the morning. They talk and work on the true test of getting up in the morning. Actually getting up. 

   The friends escape the clutches of the half sunken yet more comfortable air mattress as the shower continues to run. 

   They all gather their day-to-day items, and get ready for a day of relaxation and fun, as the shower continues to run.

   They begin to get suspicious as the shower continues to run. Toe is voluntold to go knock on the door to see if everything is alright. Yet, even after some loud knocks and a few hellos and everything okays, there is no answer. 

   Toe decides to turn the handle and slowly open the door, but before he even makes it a fraction of an inch a bright brilliant light engulfs the 4 friends. Their senses wash away from them as all they can see is light and a weird lacking of others senses. As if someone had pushed the mute button on them. 

   

Chapter 3. Y’all know I used to be really good at Wii sports tennis?

  Then Bam! They are all suddenly on their backs looking up at the sky, but not their sky… They all sit up again (as this is truly a bitch of a morning) as they take in their newer surroundings. Gone is the familiar room shoved full of games and books. Replaced with a vast openness of rocky terrain as far as their poor squinting eyes can see (well, minus Fate as they have the good sense to keep their hat straight) (Hmmm, funny might be the only straight thing about them). Dotting the area around them are various rock buds from a toe sized (no not Toe sized, toe sized I mean come on) to bowling ball sized. 

   Many of them start to scream and Fate shouts “Where the fuck are we?”

   That is when your poor Narrator turned GM (Muahaha) starts to narrate about their first spren encounter! Semitranslucent yellow triangles appear before the friends as the triangles begin to shatter. 

   They stand and look around, but before they can do anything the sounds of screams and shouts come from beyond a crest in the landscape. They turn their attention towards that direction as the shock spren fade away. In their stead purple glops of goo start to rise from the ground at their feet, quickly intermixing with the anticipation spren of red banners.

  Your Narrator, their GM, asks them if there's anything they would like to do, as the sounds of panic get close enough, they can begin to pick out individual voices.

   Toe asks to see if he can pull off one of the rock buds. I wave the strength check (as they have yet to unlock a character sheet) and he successfully rips free one of the bowling ball-sized ones from the ground. The leafy parts at the top shooting down into the center. Toe finds out he can reach in and grab the plant part and now has a makeshift club quickly followed by a second one. Merc quickly follows suit and is similarly armed. Both looking quite foolish but hey desperate times and all that. Clover and Fate… Hmmm what was it that they did? Your forgetful Narrator has a bad memory it seems but lets say they did a similar. So, we have a whole team of my dear, silly-looking friends with their hands shoved up a bowling ball plant, looking like a Mii character from the Wii. Thus armed they turn to the horizon as the first of the figures to show up crest the hill.

1o2pbsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1o2pbsa/first_solo_acoustic_gig_coming_up_looking_for/,"First solo acoustic gig coming up, looking for advice!","I consider myself a reasonably seasoned gigging musician. I’ve played in a few bands in the past and had plenty of guitar solos and lead vocal songs, 5hr days, sound setups, etc. I booked a 2hr solo gig at a coffee shop this weekend for tips and I’m a little bit worried for it. Theres something different about balancing all of the components of a band on yourself. You can make a misstep in a group and no one will notice, but solo the mistakes are magnified because there’s nothing to hide behind.

I come from a lead guitar background, so not having the ability to fill space with guitar licks or solos makes me feel somewhat naked. I’ve been working on my voice a bunch and making decent progress there, but I’ve gotta cram some lyric memorization last minute. I worry about having to recall lyrics, vocal technique, guitar skills, and crowd interaction all while keeping the beat steady and monitoring the sound. With it being my first completely solo gig I’m feeling a bit of nerves too.

It’s only for tips so the stakes are not high, I’m just hoping that people will enjoy it. I’ve been practicing a ton and it’s not that I feel unprepared, more that I’m debuting many these of these songs so they’re not as “locked in” as songs I’ve done with my bands more times than I can count.

Does anyone have advice for someone playing their first full solo set?

I have 4 years of EA to c-suite experience. 

 There are 300 applicants per job. Advice on the internet and training courses and such advise that in this post-pandemic AI riddled market and economic downturn, the best way to get a job is to reach out to the hiring manager directly. Bypassing recruiters and HR and asking for coffees in order to essentially get a job by approaching hiring managers directly. 

This obviously doesn't work for EAs because our hiring manager so to speak would be a CEO.. and guess who's protecting the inbox of the CEO? Yes their existing EA of course LOL. 

So who do you think I should do outreach too? Do you think I should aim for Chief of staff or operations manager? Or just stick with reaching out to HR and recruiters? 

Who is a decision maker on hiring EAs without accidentally getting into the inbox the EA is protecting?

I'm not saying I want to steal someone's job. I'm just saying I want to get seen because maybe it's a big business and they have a need for multiple EAs in different departments and I just don't want to risk an overprotective EA or a mean girl blocking me if you know what I mean.

fast forward 2 years, as i'm in college, things have changed, they're not so uptight about me going out anymore, but still more than average parents. i have classes 6 days a week, and i come back home during the late evening just before sundown. not even a moment's rest and they hurl chores at me. i might sound like i'm throwing a tantrum here regarding chores and i admit that i am very lazy with them, but i do what i'm told mostly, the reason why i hate doing it is because they find a way to nitpick and nag at me for ""not doing it right"". like i could sweep the entire house but get blamed for leaving a single strand of hair somewhere. even right now i'm typing this from my bathroom because if i stay on my phone too long in front of them thats a problem too. 
my degree requires less study, more practical work and i'm always swamped with asaingments, but somehow they have found a way to tell me i'm ""making excuses"" when i tell them i'm too busy. i'm banned from staying in my room because ""i stay there too long"". but then when i sit with them and try to talk and tell them college stories i get no reaction, or worse, a lecture that is completely unrelated to the topic. or just a ""you talk too much"". i know if i just work a little harder on paying more attention to help out with house chores everything will be fine. but i genuinely miss cues and forget, i wanna see a professional to check if i have ADHD, lots of my friends eho have it say that i exhibit signs, but if my parents tell me i'm 100% sure they'll say i'm making excuses again. my dad is giving me the silent treatment (apart from the usual nagging of course) and honestly, i'm too tired to care. this morning my mother made me coffee and i just added a pinch more because i like mine strong and he just straight up told me that he'll ""stop my coffee intake"" because i'm ""addicted"". there's no point in apologizing genuinely because everytime i do that, i'm met with a ""what are you sorry for"" and a ""i don't need your apology"". i cannot open up and express my feelings too because they use the most sensitive thoughts i think about myself as weapons against me during a fight. ""you don't listen at all, then you complain about feeling this way"" type of things and it hurts. i genuinely don't know what to do.",2,1760063799.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Hey, fellow creators! 🌟 Have you ever found yourself staring at the clock at work, daydreaming about “living your BEST life” with a cozy laptop and a coffee shop view? I used to be in that same boat, but guess what? The tides have turned and we can now ride the AI wave straight into the land of hustling that doesn’t suck! 🚀

Listen, the traditional 9-to-5 grind is sooo yesterday. With the rise of AI tools, there’s a whole new world of opportunities just waiting for us to dive in. Ready to explore? Here are some beginner-friendly ways to cash in on the AI boom before we all start seeing ""AI Overload"" as a new norm:

**1. Content Creation Magic 🎩✨**  
- **Blogging like a boss**: You can use AI to help brainstorm topics, assist with research, and generate engaging content. It's like having a super-smart assistant at your fingertips!
- **Video Content**: Want to start a YouTube channel but don’t know where to begin? AI can help with scripting and even video editing tasks. Who knew editing could be as easy as pressing a button?! 

**2. Social Media Manager Extraordinaire**  
- **Automate posts**: There are tools out there that can schedule all your posts for you. Spend less time on social media and more time... like literally living your life!
- **Engagement Insights**: Unlock the secrets of what your audience loves. Use AI analytics to get the scoop on the kind of content that’s lighting up their feeds.

**3. Design Your Dreams 🌈**  
- **Graphic design with a twist**: Platforms like Canva have integrated AI that suggest design elements. So if you can't draw a stick figure properly, you're still golden!
  
**4. Build and Sell Products 🛒**  
- **Digital Products**: Think ebooks, printables, or online courses. Use AI tools to create content automatically or personalize your offerings to fit market demands in a snap.
  
**5. Affiliate Marketing Wizardry**  
- Not sure how to start? Find a niche, pair it with the right tools, and watch how AI can help maximize your earnings. As an example, check out this brilliant AI tool I stumbled upon: [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca). I’ve found it super helpful in enhancing my workflow—just sharing because I think you'd love it too! (Small note: it’s an affiliate link, so I might earn a bit if you decide to go for it. Just keeping it transparent! 😊)

The best part? You don’t have to quit your day job immediately if you’re not ready. You can slowly build your AI-powered side hustle while still clocking in. Who knows? You might love it so much that you’ll wave goodbye to the cubicle life sooner than you thought! 

Have you started using any AI tools yet? What’s been your experience? Let’s swap stories! Or, even better, what dreams do you have of escaping that 9-to-5 and going all-in on your creativity? 👀",1,1760063629.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Scared, anxious, hyper-aware of everything and everyone, like life is this constant background hum of dread I can never switch off. Every day feels like a small war, just to smile, to act normal, to not crumble under the noise inside my own head.

It’s weird how exhausting existing can be. People wake up, grab coffee, go out, talk, laugh, like it’s nothing. Meanwhile, I’m here doing mental gymnastics just to step outside. Even brushing my teeth or answering a message feels like preparing for combat. Every single thing demands effort and energy I don’t even know where to find anymore.

There was a time I thought I’d outgrow this, that I’d learn to fight back, rebuild myself, become that “normal” 24-year-old who travels, socializes, goes for haircuts, just lives. But here I am, still struggling to even make eye contact with the guy at the stationery shop. I hadn’t shown up there in 10 months, and when he casually asked where I’d been, my brain short-circuited. Ten months of hiding, and I couldn’t even form a proper answer. Just grabbed my pen and left before the walls closed in.

I have an exam tomorrow. I’ve given exams all my life, but somehow, the journey to the exam center terrifies me more than the exam itself. It’s a place I’ve been to so many times, yet every time feels like the first. Heart pounding, thoughts racing, body tensing up like I’m walking into something dangerous. It’s stupid, I know. I tell myself that every time. But knowing doesn’t fix it.

People think anxiety is just overthinking. It’s not. It’s this invisible chokehold that grips you in the most ordinary moments. A haircut. A bus ride. A conversation. Even joy feels suspicious, like something I haven’t earned or can’t trust.

Sometimes I look at myself, 24, supposedly an adult, and feel like I missed every checkpoint of growing up. Everyone seems to be running ahead, jobs, relationships, plans, futures. And I’m just here, trying to breathe normally, trying not to let my brain convince me that everything’s falling apart.

I still want to fix myself or at least understand what’s wrong. But God, it’s tiring to constantly fight something that lives inside you.",5,1760063432.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Hi All



I’m feeling a lot at this point in time. I don’t want any skeptics in the comments, flo is very much real and my brother is lost, probably forever. Not up for discussion here so take it somewhere else. Ash, my brother, has been living in Florida for the last three years. It had been maybe a year since we last contacted each other before I received this string of emails, they very clearly document the outbreak. Fair warning for anyone else who may have loved ones living in Florida or Georgia.



**July 12, 2024 - Been a While**

Hey, Ellie,

I know we haven’t talked in a while. Maybe I’m writing to keep my thoughts straight, maybe because I need someone who still feels real in the midst of this strange heat that hums under my skin and refuses to leave.

Last weekend started ordinary enough. Cal’s friend got us into a new place near the station, it had old church lights strung like relics above the bar, glowing faintly red, soft as a heartbeat. The smell of spilled gin and perfume clung to everything, and beneath it lingered something metallic, electric, like static hiding in corners.

We were all there: Avery with his crooked grin, Lena sketching faces on napkins, her hair catching the light like strands of neon, and me, pretending I hadn’t forgotten how to feel alive. The night hummed around us, Ellie, music vibrating through ribs, laughter spilling like heat through the air.

Then it tilted. Avery was eying his glass with an intensity that honestly scared me a little but Avery is intense anyway. He whispered that the light looked “different tonight.” Lena nodded silently, I could feel her pulse fast against my arm, her eyes were bright and darted around the room. The air felt alive, electric, like a storm waiting to strike.

Shots were suggested, probably by me, and everything blurred from that point on.

Cal disappeared. We found him arguing with a stranger outside. I don’t fight anymore Ellie, we tried getting him out of it. Cal actually seemed desperate, not angry. The man was big and bald, his veins popped out his skin and has some weird quality to them that I can’t place. They looked really, blue? Cal’s hands would not let go of the man’s shirt, though he repeated, “You shouldn’t touch me.” Avery pulled them apart and the stranger staggered into the dark, laughing. Cal whispered, voice low and trembling, “His skin was burning, like there was fire under his skin.”

We laughed it off, claiming drunkenness. But I knew the man didn’t look right. He was probably high. On the walk home, streetlights flickered. Brief blackouts left images of everyone’s faces in my retina. I remember very little from the many conversations of that night. There was a weird moment with Leone though. At my door, she hugged me, pulse thumping against my collarbone. “Don’t worry. It’s just starting,” she whispered. I didn’t know what she meant.

Cal called in sick the next day. He claimed sickness but we had all seen the man down seven pints the night before. Leone and I went for coffee, chatted about Cal’s near miss with the bald guy. As I picked up my spoon the thing shocked me hard enough to draw blood. Am I imagining that? The cut is still healing so that’s real. It felt like how I was a few years ago, you know. I’m really not drinking like I was, it doesn’t make sense that I’m seeing things.

I’ve been dreaming about that night, the red lights, the heat, the stranger’s veins, the hum beneath it all.

I’m fine Ellie. Missing you every day

Love,  
Ash



**July 14, 2024 - Errands**

Ellie,

Something is definitely up.

Went to the shops today, moving through the city ordinarily, the air had a strange weight, like invisible fingers brushing along nerves. People move differently now, their hands linger, their shoulders graze almost purposefully, faces catch light strangely and eyes flicker.

The shopkeeper was cute as anything. Tall, blond, muscles rolling under a snug T-shirt, his laugh warm and easy as he rang up some old ladies groceries. Every glance, every casual brush of his hand sent tiny shocks up my arms, made the tiles hum beneath my feet and my stomach twist. He reached to scratch his neck and I saw it very clearly, the veins in his forearm were definitely glowing. Visibly glowing, like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I lingered longer than necessary, pretending to compare cereal brands, and he smiled again, faintly blushing, electricity thrumming between us.

At the register, Cal dropped a link into our group chat with a caption: “We’re trending 😂😂😂.” Leone laughed “of course we’ve got the next big thing since covid.” I looked down at what Cal had sent more closely. Fluorescent Artery Syndrome, it’s like a wildfire in Miami apparently. You’ve probably seen it by now, google it. That is what’s behind all that weird shit I’ve been noticing with people’s veins. I won’t lie, it looks kinda sweet but I could miss these feverish symptoms I’ve been getting. The pull of the city and the hum threading under every surface makes me feel dizzy.

Lots of Love,  
Ash

**July 15, 2024 - Leone’s Birthday**

Ellie,

Leone mentioned her birthday casually as we walked toward the first bar: “I’ll be twenty-four on Sunday. I want three bars, for symmetry.” She laughed softly, brushing her hair from her face. She moved with an ease that was mesmerizing, almost luminous, other than the bright streaks of red and blue flowing down her neck you couldn’t tell she was ill. Why are we all ok with this? Clearly we’re spreading it everywhere we go, it’s infectious enough for me to have gotten it simply from living in the same apartment as her.

Each bar was crowded, phones buzzed simultaneously with emergency alerts. Instead of panic, people cheered, clinked glasses, eyes catched neon shimmer on strangers’ veins. You’ve seen it now for sure, it’s trending nationally and now internationally. I felt the pulse of it under the floorboards, threading through the music, the lights, even the vibration of laughter.

Alex twirled a bottle like it was a baton, Leone leaned on a railing, Cal’s fingers traced metal edges. Their movements showed control, fascination, communion. The pull of Flo whispered in my veins, teasing me toward surrender even as I watched, slightly afraid of this weird trance everyone seems to be in.

Love,

Ash

**July 16, 2024 - Carnival**

Ellie,

Government crackdown has come, every bar has been temporarily shut. Social gatherings are now completely against the law. Everyone remembers Covid though, no one is following the rules, certainly not us. Actually a ‘protest’ carnival was set up the same day the measures were brought in, which is where we went tonight. The city swarmed with flashing police vehicles across alleys where the carnival waited, illegal but alive, vibrating with neon and bass that shook the asphalt. Music pounded, dancers danced, and the smell of sweat, and chicharron mingled with the metallic tang of electricity in the air. People spun on clanky rides, leapt over neon puddles that reflected their veins glowing beneath their skin, bodies pulsing in rhythm with the street.

Then someone bent over a lamppost and vomited. Thick, neon yellow-orange, sticky and pulsating, almost alive in the light. The smell was sweet and intoxicating. Alex clapped, Leone doubled over laughing, Cal danced around it, fingers tracing shapes in the luminous mess. I froze, both horrified and entranced, as the three of them laughed hysterically, pointing, almost touching, drawn to the glowing sickness like it was art. The hum pulled at me, enticing, but my stomach turned.

Alex’s hand lingered on my wrist, Leone brushed close, eyes sparkling with something manic, almost erotic, attempting to direct my full attention to the neon vomit. My stomach tightened, my pulse thrummed with the hum, but fear struck me deep. Today I saw the pull of the Fever. I am scared, most people seem to have it myself included. I want to get away from my friends until they recover, it’s getting weird. We stayed well into the night, no one seemed tired, I’m sure the carni will go on until the sun comes back up.

**July 17, 2024 - Dangerous**

Ellie,

The news went fully international today. We saw what happened on TV, than fuck for that. I wouldn’t have liked to see that in real life. I can’t stop rewatching the video on twitter, the man’s leg was torn off. Still his face, his face, was pure euphoric ecstasy. The camera trembled as the crowd pressed closer, limbs bending impossibly, pulling at him, tearing, crushing, the blood glowing red-orange and spilling onto the road, pulsing in time with the crowd’s cheers.

While we watched the live coverage Alex watched silently, fascinated. Leone shivered, biting her lip. Cal murmured something about neurotransmitters. They seemed completely captivated, like they wanted to go out and join the mob to tear up the next person. I felt the Fever’s pull, but this… this was horror. Vivid and electric. I couldn’t look away. I know I have to get out.



**July 25, 2024 - I Tried**

Ellie,

I’ve left them. Packed quietly, slipped from the apartment while they murmured, swaying, glowing. The streets are barricaded, checkpoints are dense with soldiers, veins faintly bright beneath uniforms, eyes wide and piercing. Drones hover, two on every street.

I ran and ran and ran. Rhythm carried me, I could feel my feet bleed in my shoes I ran so much., My Heartbeat echoed in tandem with the distant cheers of mobs of people. You won’t hear about the bloomings, which is what they’ve called the ritual since its gory TV debut. Let me tell you there’s easily been over 200 since my last message. I bounced off walls, I ducked beneath flashing lights, I leaped obstacles. Miami cannot be escaped. Every port and entrance is tightly secured by the military now, they are disciplined and uninfected. Every yacht has been sunk. No one is going anywhere. The city hums, but I am lucid, alone, and frightened.

I stacked up on food and I’ve slept the streets for days now, I’m smart and I stay hidden. Flo draws me like a magnet to the city monuments, to electrical generators and anywhere where a mob could gather. I am fighting a tremendous mental battle every second my eyes are open. Even when I sleep I am overwhelmed with images of her electric figure. I will stay strong sister. I will keep fighting.

Ash



**July 28, 2024 - Love**

Ellie,

I am lost, and found, and burning all at once. The Fever is love, Ellie, the warmest, brightest, most alive love I have ever known. Every pulse, every laugh, every sticky drop of neon vomit or spilled blood is a caress and a scream and a song. I am in it, and it calls to you.

Do you remember summers on the beach with Mom? Barefoot, chasing each other, hands entwined, laughing as the waves chased us? It’s that, multiplied, electrified, neon, waiting for you. You can come, Ellie. You *must*. I’ll show you the hum, I’ll show you the glow. We will scream, laugh, burn with her love beneath our skin.

I am Ash. I am the pulse. I am the glow. I will make you see it. I will make you love it. I will make you glow. Florida cannot hold me, I will come to you. I will break through every barrier, every checkpoint, every wall. I will reach you.

Come to me. Glow. I am coming, Ellie.

Love,  
Ash

1o2osly,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o2osly/bad_texter_or_not_mormon/,bad texter? or not mormon?,"so i (22m) live in utah. mormons everywhere. i am not religious. 

me and this girl in my english class hadn’t ever really talked in class other than a passing word or two. well i was at a protest on campus, and we both noticed each other at the same time. i struck up a convo and asked her about a paper that was due the night before. from there we walk around a bit having a normal conversation for two college kids who just met. then after an hour we split and went home. 

about thirty minutes later, she adds me on snapchat. i add her back, and we text for a couple days. still not very deep conversation, not flirty. she would react to my messages with heart reactions but that’s as flirty as it got. when she would send video snaps of her talking instead of the usual text, i’d reply the same way. but still, i would ask her about herself and lightly joke but absolutely nothing flirty or controversial whatsoever. 

at one point she reacted to a message but didn’t add anything. i left her on delivered to see if she valued the convo enough revive it. sure enough she messages me like 2 hours later and we continued texting back and forth. i’ve texted many people where i can tell they’re not interested, but this convo didn’t feel that way to me. 

so immediately the first thing i noticed about her account after she first added me was that she had three cross emojis in her bio. again, im from utah so that almost always means she’s mormon here. i decided i was going to show up to my english class with a mcdonald’s coffee and try to gauge if she was super mormon or not. well she didn’t talk to me, and i’ve been on delivered since then (2 days). 

i’m not asking how i can salvage this. what i’m wondering is if the cut communication was due to how i was texting her (not flirting) or if the coffee thing really could have been a dealbreaker. are there factors i’m not considering? what are good tips when texting new friends?

Found Menerals through some biohacker forum and it looked sketchy as hell .. tiny company, tasteless pill, claims about ""100+ minerals"" vs the standard 6 in most electrolytes. Almost didn't try it because fulvic acid sounds like something from a crystal shop. Here’s how I tracked progress..

Week 2-3: Started noticing I wasn't reaching for afternoon coffee anymore

Week 4-5: Recovery between workout days improved noticeably

Week 6-8: Sleep tracking shows 15% better deep sleep averages

Here's the thing, I don't think it's the ""100+ minerals"" marketing bullshit. Pretty sure it's the fulvic acid chelation making whatever minerals are there actually absorbable instead of just expensive piss.

I don’t know what he wants from me","A while ago, I posted about being in love with a close friend —let’s just call him **X** I’ll use this label to keep things clear and anonymous.

X has had a boyfriend for about four months. Despite that, he’s been giving me more and more intimacy: kisses, nights spent together, deep conversations, even sharing his perspective on his official relationship. Emotionally, I sometimes feel closer to him than his own partner. But here’s the paradox: he never verbalizes affection or desire for me. He avoids words of validation like his life depends on it —yet his gestures contradict this entirely.

For example, when I once asked, “Do I still amuse you?”, he replied: *“After everything we’ve shared lately, that question feels incoherent and irrelevant, don’t you think?”* It’s like he’s emotionally armored.

Recently, after a big family loss, I asked if we could meet for coffee. Instead, he invited me to his new house (he had just moved in). We talked, he comforted me, nothing sexual happened. But then his boyfriend arrived. Suddenly, I found myself in the middle of my nightmare scenario: the three of us in the same room.

The atmosphere was heavy. Then something happened I can’t decode. X offered me yogurt *by feeding me with a spoon directly in my mouth*, while his boyfriend was sitting right next to us. I didn’t feel it was invasive —I actually liked it— but his boyfriend muttered “That was really weird,” then left to another room.

Later, X insisted I stay for dinner. We all ate together in tense silence until I broke the ice with jokes and conversation, even making the boyfriend laugh. Still, the whole evening felt surreal —like a social experiment where his “official” partner and his “hidden” partner coexist in the same space.

Here’s where I’m lost: Was he trying to make his boyfriend jealous? Was he testing me? Was he playing on the edge of boundaries?

For context: X and I have been physically intimate (oral, but not full sex), and I knew him before he met his boyfriend. Ironically, months ago I “friendzoned” him because I wasn’t ready. Now, I’ve fallen deeply in love.

My strategy right now is to wait, protect my energy, and see what happens. Part of me feels “not enough” for him to choose me, but another part knows he’s still tied to me in ways that go beyond words.

**So, Reddit… what do you think? Is X deliberately creating this triangle? Is it jealousy, testing, or something else entirely?**

A lady answered the door and she told them the roads were too treacherous for those unfamiliar with the area. They asked if they could rent a room or a couch and stay there overnight. The lady explained that she is a recent widow, and the neighbors know her too well. Seeing an extra vehicle at her house overnight would be a very bad idea.

Still though she was concerned for their well-being and proposed they pull their car into the horse barn and sleep there until dawn.
She said her husband had gotten rid of the horses before his death so the barn was quiet and there was a sink and toilet they could use. 
She also offered to bring them towels, blankets, and some food. 
The buddies accepted this offer knowing it was getting dark fast and they had no other options.

At dawn they awoke and she delivered some breakfast and hot coffee for the road.

About nine months later they were having drinks and buddy 1 moved the conversation back to their ski trip. Buddy 2 talked about the great time they had and how they should do it again.

 Buddy 1 asks his friend, ""that night, while we slept in the barn, did you happen to sneak out of the car and into the widow's house while I slept?"" 
Buddy 2, a bit sheepishly says, ""yes.""
Buddy 1 asks, ""and did you and the widow have fun?"" 
Buddy 2, really concerned now answers, ""yes.""
Buddy 1 continues and asks, ""and did you happen to use my name?""
Buddy 2, really nervous at this point responds, ""well, er, I may have, why?""
Buddy 1, ""well I just got a letter from her attorney and apparently she had the greatest night ever and when she died, she left her entire estate to me.""",68,1760061400.0,Jokes,1,0.93,False

I don’t know what he wants from me","A while ago, I posted about being in love with a close friend —let’s just call him **X**  I’ll use this label to keep things clear and anonymous.

X has had a boyfriend for about four months. Despite that, he’s been giving me more and more intimacy: kisses, nights spent together, deep conversations, even sharing his perspective on his official relationship. Emotionally, I sometimes feel closer to him than his own partner. But here’s the paradox: he never verbalizes affection or desire for me. He avoids words of validation like his life depends on it —yet his gestures contradict this entirely.

For example, when I once asked, “Do I still amuse you?”, he replied: *“After everything we’ve shared lately, that question feels incoherent and irrelevant, don’t you think?”* It’s like he’s emotionally armored.

Recently, after a big family loss, I asked if we could meet for coffee. Instead, he invited me to his new house (he had just moved in). We talked, he comforted me, nothing sexual happened. But then his boyfriend arrived. Suddenly, I found myself in the middle of my nightmare scenario: the three of us in the same room.

The atmosphere was heavy. Then something happened I can’t decode. X offered me yogurt *by feeding me with a spoon directly in my mouth*, while his boyfriend was sitting right next to us. I didn’t feel it was invasive —I actually liked it— but his boyfriend muttered “That was really weird,” then left to another room.

Later, X insisted I stay for dinner. We all ate together in tense silence until I broke the ice with jokes and conversation, even making the boyfriend laugh. Still, the whole evening felt surreal —like a social experiment where his “official” partner and his “hidden” partner coexist in the same space.

Here’s where I’m lost: Was he trying to make his boyfriend jealous? Was he testing me? Was he playing on the edge of boundaries?

For context: X and I have been physically intimate (oral, but not full sex), and I knew him before he met his boyfriend. Ironically, months ago I “friendzoned” him because I wasn’t ready. Now, I’ve fallen deeply in love.

My strategy right now is to wait, protect my energy, and see what happens. Part of me feels “not enough” for him to choose me, but another part knows he’s still tied to me in ways that go beyond words.

**So, Reddit… what do you think? Is X deliberately creating this triangle? Is it jealousy, testing, or something else entirely?**",1,1760061253.0,gay,4,0.67,False

I’m beyond devastated right now. I (24m) was just broken up with by my fiance (23f). Background: We met in 2021. Immediately clicked, started dating but she was fresh off a breakup and everything was just too soon for her, so she broke up with me. I was hurt as I really liked her but it wasn’t the end of the world. 4-5 months later we started talking again. We were both skeptical going into it but immediately clicked again and things were great for about a year. This is when the L word came into play. We absolutely took that next step in the relationship. Well, She ended up breaking up with me again over a pretty nasty fight we got into where hurtful things were said. I take %100 responsibility for the situation. I pushed her away and had nobody to blame but myself. Regardless, I was heartbroken. I sank into a very deep depression that I almost didn’t walk away from. We don’t talk for over a year after that. Then one day we decided to meet up for coffee and catch up, and of course one thing led to another. Against my own better judgment, and the opinions of just about everybody around me that I love. I decided to get back together with her. It started up as just a hookup, but quickly turned back into sleeping with eachother on a nightly basis,to back into a relationship. We did a lot of talking, communicating, and building with eachother. We moved to a different state with eachother, where I proposed and she said yes. Things were great, we moved back home. She got an amazing job, I started trade school. During that stretch we had some bumps in our relationship but agreed to start going to therapy together. We started talking about planning the wedding, and getting our own place together(we have kind of jumped from rentable room to rentable room throughout the years). Things were just going amazing, and I couldn’t have been more in love with her. Well I came home from school today and got blindsided by her ending the engagement, relationship, and packing up her things. She took our kid with her (cat). The room is empty and quiet, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how I’m going to sleep tonight.

* 2 eclairs with plain glaze
* 2 plain twists
* 2 cinnamon sugar 

The bag was advertised as 6 regular donuts and 6 specialty.

It it was my first time in and I was super excited to see the shelves were absolutely bursting with lots of specialty donuts - fruit filled, apple fritters, custard, bear claws, different toppings, etc. And it was after 6 pm so I knew they were all going in the trash if they didn't go in bags. Things were looking good for me!

Unfortunately, the employee then went in the back and started filling the box from back there. I think he might have felt bad for me because he offered me a coffee (which I didn't accept).

The donuts all seem to already be day-olds. Extremely firm and bready. And of course most of them are plain - the twists are just regular glazed donuts in another shape, so it's more like eight plain donuts. The eclairs are pretty lacking as well, not much filling.

They aren't so horrifically stale as to be completely unedible, but they're definitely not good. I buy a dozen donuts to share with my neighbors, but in this case, even the people that accepted them didn't finish them. Most took a bite or two and then they ended up in the garbage.

Overall, pretty much a waste. Especially bad when you can get a dozen super fresh but leftover Krispy Kreme donuts for $6. That being said, I also very happily eat a grocery store donut from time to time and these are nowhere near as good!

I figure it’s an easy switch since I’m not going to keep it stock for long 😜but I know mirrors will be my 1st “mod” 2nd comes the pedals to pegs(I live in Baltimore city no one cars about bike laws) 

Couple of questions for mirrors…

Which give you the best view for looking behind you? 

Which do most riders prefer(post your 64’ to show you mirror set up) 

How do you feel about the stock mirrors topside or bar ends? 

Should I get the mid rise handle bars? Can someone explain the difference? Riding position of each?  (i have rode bicycles for 10 year in a urban environment(e-bike,fixed,single and hybrid and wagon with kids with drops and bullhorn(my fave) and straight long and short in Baltimore city)

I’m mostly planning on riding to work (50miles round trip) and around the city(to skate parks and beers/ coffee ) road speed will be 20-40 mph but topping out at 45 since I gotta keep up. That is my biggest fear. Not being able to keep on a 40mph road with a slight incline and not being able hustle around. (6’0 220lbs) 

Let me know what you guys think!? This seems a great community btw. ",3,1760059781.0,Beachman,3,0.8,False

1o2nr8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1o2nr8j/personal_mission_2_acting_business_tactics/,Personal Mission 2 + Acting: Business Tactics,"It was a cool, rainy day in Varnheim. The streets were quiet apart from a few determined citizens and the pounding of water on the stones. The moon was obscured behind the dark cumulonimbus clouds. Oliver was just returning home from a morning shift at the Sleepy Maiden. With some of the new money he had been earning from working, he had been able to buy himself a new dark trenchcoat and hat, which he was putting to use today, trying to shield himself from the rain. He would’ve liked to sprint home using his Assassin powers, but there were too many other pedestrians, so he had to suffer through the deluge.

Eventually, he made it back to his parents’ apartment and quickly scaled the stairs and slipped into their room. His mother was working on some sewing at the main table as he entered. Now that he had his Heightened Senses on constantly, he couldn’t help but notice that the sewing she had done looked a bit sloppier than usual. Additionally, her hands had many more little pinpricks than typical.

“Ah, you’re back, Oliver!” Glenda called out, smiling and setting down her sewing equipment when she saw Oliver. “How’s that new coat you got working out?”

“It’s working out well,” Oliver replied. “Are you doing alright? You seem to have been sewing more aggressively than usual.”

Oliver’s mom sighed and her smile drooped into a frown. “You notice things a lot more these days, don’t you, Oliver? You’re right, I’m a little bit frustrated right now.”

Oliver took off his coat and hat and slid into the chair across the table from her. “What’s wrong?”

“Well, my sewing business hasn’t been doing very well lately,” she replied, voice betraying her exasperation. “I haven’t made any sort of changes that I think should warrant it, but lately, there have been a number of my usual customers that have either said they want to try sewing themselves or they want to save money or they somehow didn’t get any rips or tears recently. Were it just one or two people, I wouldn’t think anything of it, but this has been the sixth or seventh recently!”

“I know that this sewing business of mine doesn’t bring in much money in the grand scheme of things, but I’ve seen how hard you’ve been working and we both know that your father barely lets himself rest. You’re both doing so much for this family and I want to contribute too. So when I’m suddenly losing customers, it gets me a bit riled up!”

“Mom, you don’t need to feel like you have to contribute anything,” Oliver said, reaching out to grab her hand across the table. “You already do tons for us, keeping the apartment clean and livable, making us great food and making sure the neighbors actually know us and don’t think we’re all weirdos. You’re basically the one that keeps our family together! Dad and I couldn’t just go to work if we knew that we had a ton of stuff we needed to do at home afterwards.”

Oliver’s mom smiled sadly and squeezed Oliver’s hand. “Thank you honey, that’s really nice of you to say. But nevertheless, I still would like to be able to do this as well. It’s something I can do and I enjoy it. And even if we weren’t saving money, the sudden downturn in clients would still frustrate me.”

Oliver nodded in understanding. “Oh, I understand now. Do you have any idea why this might be happening?”

Glenda pursed her lips as she stayed quiet for a moment. Oliver got the sense that she was considering whether or not to say something.

“You don’t need to be sure,” he coaxed.”But it can be nice to get some suspicions off your chest.”

Glenda sighed. “You can’t tell people I’m saying this, because there’s absolutely no proof, okay? But I’d bet ten to one that Matilda Appleseed has something to do with it. I just feel like she’s been acting strangely around me lately, and not in the same way as everyone else. She‘s been acting condescending and arrogant.”

Oliver scowled. “That sucks. Sorry, mom.”

“It’s alright,” she replied. “It’s just nice to vent a little bit.”

She quickly stood up and began to walk towards the kitchen counter. “But enough about that! Let’s get you some lunch so that you can be off to your other job.”

—

A little bit later, Oliver was working at the Gloamharvest Farms, turning the corpses to fertilizer. It was pretty unpleasant the first couple of times he had done it, but now he’d gotten used to it and was even able to work on autopilot, giving him a chance to converse with whoever was working with him at the time. Today it was a young man named Gilmore Hopkins, a Sequence 9 Corpse Collector. 

Gilmore was a shorter man with a cheerful disposition. He often kept a slight smile on his face and was the type of person to walk up to anyone he thought he recognized on the street to start a conversation. Oliver was under the impression that Corpse Collectors were supposed to be subdued and dreary, but when he had asked around, everyone who knew Gilmore from before had said that he was already more subdued than he used to be.

Over the past few times they had worked together, Oliver and Gilmore had gotten to know each other fairly well and now tended to try and get their shifts scheduled together so that they could chat. They had been successful for this shift.

“...and so that’s why he had done that all in the first place!” Gilmore had just finished a story. “But enough about me, how’re things going for you? Acting going well?”

Oliver had shared the Acting Method he had learned from the gathering in the gray fog with Gilmore a few days ago.

“It’s going alright,” he replied, tossing a corpse into a hole he had just dug. “I’m still not totally sure I’m doing it right, but I at least started getting some digestion when I was following that John Johnson guy around.”

“I guess just keep doing what you’re doing, right?” Gilmore offered as he cut into the corpse in front of him. “You’ll find the trick eventually. Not being able to kill people does lower the number of possibilities quite a bit though...”

“It does, but I’m not sure that I actually mind it that much.” Oliver stopped and rested his arms on the shovel he had been using to dig. “When I think about it, I don’t think I’ve ever been so mad at someone that I actually wanted to kill them myself. I’ve had thoughts that I wish someone wouldn’t be around anymore, but that’s a whole different thing from actually breaking someone’s skull or snapping their neck or something...”

“Fair enough, I suppose.” Gilmore conceded. “Personally, I’m so used to corpses at this point that I don’t think it’d affect me too much, but it’s probably hard to tell. Anyways, got anything else going on?”

Oliver picked up his shovel and started digging the next hole before replying. “Not a ton. My mom has been having a little trouble with her sewing business lately. She thinks that one of her acquaintances has been badmouthing her work recently or something like that.”

“That sucks. It’s affecting her business?”

“Yeah, she said she’s been losing customers.”

Gilmore pushed aside the corpse he was working on transplanting fungus into. “That’s screwed up. You gotta do something about that.”

“What do you mean?” Oliver asked.

“Well, first you’ve gotta make sure that the person you think is doing it is actually doing it,” Gilmore replied. “Then once you’re sure, just give whoever it is a little scare and they’ll probably stop.”

“Hmm... I don’t know.” Oliver was unconvinced.

“How about this?” Gilmore proposed. “I’ll help you out after this. We can go scope out the person together. Between my spirit vision and your heightened senses, it won’t be a problem. You can even consider it acting. And then I’ll help you out with the scare prank. I’m a corpse collector after all.”

*It would make my mom a lot happier if her business picked up again.* Oliver considered *And this would be a good opportunity to act. Alright, I’ll give it a try.*

“Okay, but we’ll have to be careful not to break any laws,” Oliver cautioned.

“Deal,” Gilmore replied.

—

Oliver and Gilmore were sitting together at a table in a 24-hour cafe, each sipping a different beverage. Gilmore had his hands on a hot cup of coffee while Oliver was drinking a large ale. The two of them were exhausted. They had just spent the last couple days tracking Matilda Appleseed through the streets of Varnheim, into a shop, through a market, stopping at a friend’s house, everywhere they possibly could.

However, the two of them still had to work, so they ended up having to cut back on their sleep to make it all work.

“Alright, what did we end up with today?” Gilmore asked wearily, spinning around a sugar cube in his cup. 

“Let’s just go over a whole framework,” Oliver replied. “We might have enough to make our move.”

“Sure.”

“Okay, so the Appleseed family is a family of five. Mr. Appleseed is 43 years old and works a factory job similar to my father. Mrs. Appleseed is 45 years old and is not employed. They have three children, two girls and a boy, at the ages of fifteen, twelve and ten respectively.”

“Focusing in on Mrs. Appleseed, she typically starts out her morning by waking up early to prepare breakfast for her husband and children. After they leave for school and work, she will often do chores around the house. Once those are complete, she will often meet friends for lunch at various cafes around town. Then, she will either attend a card playing club or go to get groceries, depending on the day. Afterwards, she will return home, prepare dinner and spend the rest of her night with her family, occasionally going out with her husband or entire family for dinner at a friend’s house.”

“It’s lucky for us that she’s such a consistent person,” Gilmore commented. “It could really be a pain if she was the type of person to do things randomly each day. We’ve gathered a lot of information though, has this acting been helping your digestion?”

Oliver clenched his hand into a fist, testing his grip strength. He could feel a stronger power resting in his arm than before, but not by much.

“It has been helping, but I’ve been beginning to feel stuck. I think there’s something I’m missing apart from this stalking and analyzing.”

“Hmm...” Gilmore murmured. “This acting stuff is tough. Well, I’m sure you’ll figure it out. What did you learn from stalking her in the shadows today?”

“The first big thing is that I confirmed that she’s been shit-talking my mom,” Oliver fumed. “Almost every person she talked to today, she said something bad about my mom’s work. For instance, while I was listening in on her conversations in the cafe, she asked one of her friends who had done the sewing on a couple spots on their coat. As soon as she mentioned that it had been my mom, she leapt on her and said that it didn’t look good and that she should go find someone else!”

“But I also was able to figure out why she’s doing this,” Oliver continued. “When I was following her after leaving the card club, she snuck off to a side with a woman wearing much nicer clothes than you typically see in my neighborhood. No patches or sewn places or anything. The woman handed her an envelope and thanked her for her help in funneling people from this part of town to her business.”

“She’s trying to undercut the businesses in your neighborhood just for her own personal greed!” Gilmore exclaimed. “If this continues on, it might not stop at just affecting your mom.”

“Yeah, this could be bad...” Oliver agreed. “I’m not sure how to go about stopping her though. We can’t threaten her or anything, if we do something, Veris will arrive and probably mind-wipe us.”

“Hmm...” Gilmore pondered a bit before responding. “You know, Oliver, there’s more than one way to threaten somebody...”

—

The next day, Oliver was leaning against a building on the side of the road from the card club Mrs. Appleseed attended. He could see her through the window, surrounded by people and chatting jovially. Safe in the middle of a crowd. However, some time passed and Mrs. Appleseed stood up and began to prepare herself to depart. As expected, a number of other women also stood and a few prepared themselves to leave with her as well. Some were convinced to stay, of course, but two of them left with Matilda. Still not the time to act. Oliver shadowed behind them, slipping into shadows until the time was right. And just as predicted, after a few blocks, Mrs. Appleseed made an excuse for herself and separated from the others. She was going to meet with the mysterious woman. But for now, she was alone and vulnerable.  Oliver’s potion churned within him as he moved in to strike.

“Mrs. Appleseed! Do you have a moment?” he called out from behind her. “It’s Oliver Beckett, Glenda’s son!”

Oliver’s Heightened Senses allowed him to notice the brief look of disdain that Matilda shot towards him before quickly composing her face into the picture of congeniality.

“Oliver, hello!” she replied cheerfully. “I’m afraid that I’m in a bit of a rush at the moment, would it be alright if we catch up later?”

“Oh, don’t worry,” Oliver replied, using his enhanced speed to end up right next to her and slip his arm into hers. “It’ll be quick. We can walk and talk.”

Surprised at Oliver’s sudden movement, Matilda was unable to come up with a proper excuse before being taken along with him.

“Very well,” she blurted out. “What is it?”

“Out of respect for your time, I’ll get right to the point,” Oliver stated. “I’ve figured out that you’re getting paid by a large company to help put my mother out of business. And I’ve come to make sure you quit doing that.”

A series of emotions flashed across Mrs. Appleseed’s face. First bewilderment, then fear, rage and finally determination before returning to her practiced sociability.

“I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about,” she replied. “I would never do something like that to a good friend of mine. Your claims are baseless.”

“I think you do know what I’m talking about,” Oliver pressed. “In fact, I believe that you were going to go meet your contact right now.”

Matilda couldn’t help but bit her lip in frustration at being caught, which, of course, was noticed by the Assassin.

“It’s not just me who knows either,” Oliver continued. “Several friends of mine have also seen you taking money from a well dressed woman as well as overheard your conversations about funnelling people to her business. You have good standing among your peers now, but that could change easily if this got out. Do you think your friends and family would take kindly to you working to break up their community?”

Matilda’s face fell. If Oliver and his friends truly knew all about her deal, then she was truly at their mercy. Her social standing could be shattered whenever they chose. The only way out was to give in.

“What do you want from me?” she conceded, looking guiltily at the ground rather than at Oliver.

“It’s pretty straightforward,” Oliver said. “Just cut off contact with this woman you’re working with. Allow me to walk you home and then you’re free to go about your life however you please. My mom is a forgiving person, so if you’re still looking for a way to make some extra money, you could apologize to her and she might teach you a thing or two about sewing.”

“I- But- ...Alright,” Mrs. Appleseed agreed.

“Great!” Oliver said, steering her back towards the main road towards her house. “I’m glad we’ve come to an agreement, Mrs. Appleseed. But don’t worry, my friends and I will be keeping our eyes on you...”

*I need to make sure not to get on this boy’s bad side!* Matilda Appleseed cautioned herself as she was led back towards her house.

1o2nr46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2nr46,Finding new machine and coffee a little disappointing - bitter and off tasting.,"Hi all, 

I feel like everyone here just loves their machines and pods so I’m not trying to sow negativity, but I’m having a bit of disappointment with my new machine.

I wanted to grab a small Nespresso machine for my afternoon pick me up coffee - I can still enjoy my morning cafe coffee, but have a better afternoon coffee than a sachet (the ones that have milk powder, instant coffee and sugar). Unfortunately I’m just not liking the taste.

I’m using the Delonghi EN85 machine and a smeg branded milk frother. I also plan to drink some of the pods iced just with cold milk. 

I normally drink a large hot latte at a cafe, no sugar. It has 2-3 shots of coffee in it. At home I’ll have the sugary instant sachets as I mentioned but I was hoping this would offer me a better experience.

The coffee tastes bitter and a bit off tasting, no matter the pods. It’s not a machine or water issue - I’ve flushed the machine, I’ve drank just hot water from the machine to make sure it doesn’t add any odd tastes to the water and I experienced a similar taste when trying one at a Nespresso store (I tried the Paris and found it bitter in an unpleasant way) 

I’ve gone through the sub and tried a few parameters. I like a big, milky coffee. I’m only brewing pods on the lungo setting that recommend it on the side of the packet. I’ve also tried just using the pod on the smaller, espresso setting with the same result. I’ve varied the amount of milk I use (some users here said more milk can make the pods taste odd) and I use 2 pods for a mug that’s approx 400ml, though it’s not always full. I tried with a single pod and the taste was too weak.

Maybe you can help with some pod recommendations? I’m located in Australia and have the Nespresso stores here, online plus compatible pods available in our grocery stores. 

I’m not expecting a cafe quality coffee made by a barista on a 2000 dollar espresso machine. I am realistic.

I just keep finding myself being excited to make the coffee and then sort of having to push through drinking it. 

Any pods you recommend that taste good and don’t have a bitter aftertaste? I know coffee is inherently bitter - I like a strong coffee, but a robust bitterness not a lip pursing burned taste.

Pictured pods I’ve been using. I’ve tried about half of them so far.

Thank you all!",1,1760059534.0,nespresso,1,0.67,False

Wouldn't you agree, Harper?”*

I raised an eyebrow as I drove to work, glancing from the road to the radio. The second host seemed hesitant when she answered.

*“Well, Fred… I personally don't blame people that much. We've always liked to speak openly here on your show, right? It wouldn't be the first time something has gone wrong because profit was prioritized over safety. Remember when Express–”*

*“Commercials!”* Fred interrupted.

The show was cut off suddenly. There was brief static before cheesy music started playing in the background.

*“Harmless and clean– it leaves a great sheen! Try **Bustling Bubbles** today! It cleans your car, it cleans your kiddo, it cleans anything!”*

I sighed, tapping my steering wheel as I waited at a stoplight. I don't know why I kept listening to this show, the ‘Fred Fast-talk’ show, except maybe to make myself angry.

Maybe it was because I always felt guilty when I heard other stations bringing up the real concerns about Express’ actions. Especially considering my involvement.

*I wish I could escape all of this…* I shoved away that thought quickly.

After a further slurry of braindead advertisements, the talk show came back.

*“Hi! Sorry for that sudden break, folks. I think we had a slip in the backroom. Someone throwing banana peels back there?”* A cartoon sound button played, followed by an awkward silence. *“Well were this my night show I'd expect a sea of laughter about now! But I'm sure you're all laughing in your cars. Speaking of my television night show, make sure to tune in tonight at eight p.m. central for the unveiling of Express’™ newest global innovation! I'm honored to be the choice delivery method of this exciting announcement. Remember, **‘If it's not Express™, it's not the best.’** See you tonight!”*

A pre-recorded cheering track played as the outro jazz blared, and we were back to yet more commercials. I laid against my headrest.

My workplace was in the big city. We had our own parking garage at the law firm of *Jensen and Julliard*, but don't take the partner's spots or even God himself can't save you.

Speaking of parking, I was usually one of the last ones to arrive in the morning, which meant all of the good spots were taken in the upper floors. On top of that I was even more late because of damned construction.

I simply refused to get up at three in the morning to save myself a small walk. So I had to park, as usual, in the ever-dark third floor basement. It even had flickering lights in some places. Dramatic.

I closed my eyes as I mentally prepared for the day. It was always the same feeling. Not wanting to be home, and not wanting to be here. Either way, there was bound to be something unpleasant.

I shut my car door and adjusted the purse over my shoulder. My heels clicked against the concrete as I walked, echoing amongst the empty darkness. It was so dim in fact that I thought about pulling out my phone's flashlight.

I always felt some degree of nervousness walking through here. It didn't help that I already felt nervous about other things. For example, I was one of the lucky few that was on the partner track, being trained directly under Mrs. Jensen, whose mother was a founder of Jensen and Julliard. I wanted this. I needed it to stay that way, and yet…

“The static is coming. The sickness will infect us all.”

I stopped walking, blinked. I looked behind me, then to the side, but it was still just as dark as before. I couldn’t see a thing.

“Hello?” My call echoed.

One of the nearby fluorescent lights flickered on. I turned, and saw someone lying against a chain link fence. A fence that protected some equipment or other. The person that sat there was an old woman with gray, wily hair, wrapped in third-hand coats.

My briefly racing heart slowed. I knew her. I took a calming breath, then walked towards her.

“Ms. Alliebrow?”

The woman looked up at me with an expression of confusion. It slowly honed in, and shifted into a toothy smile.

“Elaine? Is that you, dear?”

“Ms. Alliebrow, you shouldn't sleep here,” I replied. “If the maintenance man or garage manager catches you, it'll–”

The woman lurched up suddenly, grasping my hand tight as her eyes widened. Her expression changed from smiling to warning.

“The static comes, Elaine. Stay away from the screens. Be careful what you wish for.”

I bit my lip. It was never easy to see someone forced to sleep on city sidewalks, but it would be worse if she was caught here.

“Go to the shelter on fifth. They should be able to room you for a while, okay?”

The woman slowly sat again. In a gesture, I held out my hand instinctively, thinking I'd be helping her up, but she handed me something instead.

“The time draws near. Keep this close, Elaine, and you'll be safe. Say hello to him for me.”

She stood up by herself and shuffled into the darkness. I watched her go. Eventually, I couldn't see her anymore. In looking down at my hand at what she had given me, I was confused. It was some strange piece of metal. Small, circular, intricate, and about the size of my palm.

I wasn't sure if it was a piece of something down here, so I packed it into my purse and continued towards the elevator. I could hand it off to maintenance later. Onwards to my work day…

My reflection eyed me back as I stepped up to the shiny chrome doors of the elevator. The soft dings echoed as it passed each floor to eventually arrive. The doors closed behind me as I pressed the button for my floor. After a moment, I frowned. The elevator wasn’t moving.

“Damn thing.” I muttered.

The button clicked as I smacked it a few more times. The light buzzed then, flickering on, and we were finally moving.

I closed my eyes with a sigh. This ride was always the last peace before the chaos.

In the blackness, I felt a strange sensation. A fuzzy headache in the back of my skull. I frowned as I exhaled. Damn, this one hurt.

Keeping my eyes closed only seemed to make it worse, so I opened them and took a pill from my purse. That’s right, no water bottle. I was a pro.

The TV mounted in the elevator flickered on. I glanced up at it. It was only filled with static, buzzing, but I thought I saw the flicker of a face. I tried to study it closer.

Then suddenly, the doors opened.

“There she is!” 

My long stare jolted to surprise as my assistant, Jack, said this, arms outstretched. He had been standing there waiting by the doors…

“Jesus. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?” I replied.

We entered the bustle of the firm together. Phones ringing and answered, people carrying more paper than should be humanly possible, and of course, an armada of corporate interior decoration.

It was quite the contrast to the dingy parking garage. I was convinced that the designers had simply purchased all of the gold accents that Target had to offer. 

Jack looked at me conspiratorially.

“Do you have any pressing work this morning?”

“Not at the moment. Why?”

“Then we're going to have breakfast in the food hall, and you're going to tell me all about it.”

“I already had breakfast.”

He gave me a frank look.

“Okay, maybe I didn't,” I admitted. “But I don't know what you're talking about anyway.”

“Oh, sure. Who would have anything to say about how you saved Express Electronics singlehandedly, becoming the favorite person of–”

“All right fine,” I interrupted. “but you're buying, got it?”

We walked through the extensive corridors until we made it to the food hall, passing many other paralegals on the way. It wasn't anything too large, and we shared it with all of the businesses in this building, but it was nice.

A coffee place, a sandwich joint, and a few other fast food locations were set up throughout. The seating was in the middle, the businesses on the edges. 

One particular restaurant specialized in breakfast, so we ordered our food from there. Jack did actually pay for me. To him though that was likely a symbol that he'd effectively paid for my story too…

“So? Tell me everything.” He said eagerly, having vacuumed up his breakfast to ask questions faster. I was still on mine.

“It was nothing really.” I muttered between bites of an egg sandwich.

“Come on! You've gotta tell me where you get that courage.”

I sighed.

“Really, it's not a big deal. I just made a casual suggestion during a war room. I can't really talk about the details, but–”

“Please. Just a ‘casual suggestion?’ You and Mrs. Jensen were *presenting* to the *admin*. It was all over the schedule for that conference room.”

I glared.

“Do you actually want to hear the story or not?” 

He shrugged and sat back, zipping his lips. I continued after another bite.

“Like I said, I can't talk about the details, but I re-read the case files for a couple of days before I saw an opening.”

“And?” Jack chimed.

“*And* yes. My strategy caused Judge Adamson to grant us a stay.”

“A *stay*. On a class action suit this big? Even Adamson must know that they'll just be able to launch it now with no problems before any real barricades come up.”

“Yep.”

*Not to mention that Adamson was our preferred Judge…* I thought.

Jack rolled his eyes.

“Just admit it. You blew their socks off with your brilliance and now you’re leaps and bounds up the partner track. Rumor has it that Mrs. Jensen is pretty pleased with you.”

I looked up at that.

“You think so?”

“Honey, you're already passed the glass ceiling,” He leaned in to whisper. “I also heard that Mrs. Jensen has someone important she wants you to meet today. It's been pretty hush-hush, but everybody saw the unmarked black vehicles pull up.”

I continued with my breakfast without a reply. Jack seemed to study me, as if he had just noticed something.

“Are you okay, Elaine?”

“Yeah. I've just been having strange dreams lately.”

Jack shook his head.

“Whatever you say…”

-

As the day went on, Jack ended up being exactly right.

After we had finished breakfast and got back to work, lunch came and went, then a dough-eyed new hire came to tell me that Mrs. Jensen wanted to see me in her office.

Despite my good standing, I couldn't help but feel nervous. Jack was usually right about rumors, so what ‘important person’ did Mrs. Jensen want me to meet?

I rode the admin elevator to the uppermost floor. The twentieth floor. It was also the nicest looking area of the building. Garish carpets for an office, plants, large paintings on the wall, the whole nine.

It was down the hall and up to a reception desk to reach my destination. The woman sitting at that desk stood with a smile.

“Mrs. Edwards. Please wait here while I check if they're ready for you.”

I heard muffled laughter from the office as I sat down. The receptionist waited a polite amount of time after the sound before dialing her phone. I shuffled nervously.

“Mrs. Edwards is here. Yes, I'll send her in.”

She turned back to me and smiled again.

“They're ready for you.” 

The receptionist stood, walking forward to open the door for me. I took one more second to breathe before standing up myself.

Mrs. Jensen's large office was filled with modern decor, placed throughout to give the room fluidity. Wavy, wooden tables with glass tops. Short, square couches that could in no universe be comfortable, and of course, quite the city view. Even though it was only about twenty stories up, it was still impressive what you could see from all the way up here.

I swallowed. I felt like a lamb in the den of a lioness. No, a *mouse* in the den of a lioness. 

I could no longer delay with distraction once I looked toward the great oak desk in the back. There were two people there. Mrs. Jensen of course, her professional air buttoned up tight into a custom suit, but there was also a tall man with a permanently smug expression. His hair was slicked back, clothes expensive looking if not very stylish.

Mrs. Jensen smiled as she turned to greet me.

“Why, hello again.” She said as her receptionist closed the door. I crept forward warily.

“How are you, Elaine?”

“Good… um how are you?”

“Good. I'm also good. Good weather we're having.”

“Good…” I muttered.

Mrs. Jensen was about to reply before the man stepped forward, laughing.

“Not one for small talk? I get it, me neither. Let's skip to business then,” The man shook my limp hand. “So then. You're the hero?”

I must have had quite the ‘help me’ expression, because Mrs. Jensen stepped in to save me.

“Where are my manners? Elaine, this is Bobby Dicksson, the CEO of Express Electronics. Mr. Dickson, this is Elaine Edwards.”

That information did not save me at all.

“Bobby please. Mr. Dickson was my father.”

A silence stretched on as we all stared at each other. Was this the moment where I said something? Worry clawed at my gut as I reached for words. *This* guy was the head of Express? That somehow made terrible sense… I clamped that thought shut before I accidentally said it out loud.

“Uh– wow, hi.” Was all I managed. Bobby raised an eyebrow at me.

“It's alright. People are always stunned by me, even when my dad was still in control. So, you *are* the hero then, yeah? You made that iron solid defense for me?”

“I did.” I said, managing a small smile.

“Well then. You don't seem too proud of it.” Bobby said.

“Sorry if we seem tired,” Mrs. Jensen interjected. “We've had several long days of making sure everything was in order for you. We may have stalled things, but we've still got a battle plan to make.”

“Understandable. Well, as a reward, I suppose I should give you ladies a little hint… We've been testing ‘E.E.’ already in pockets throughout the city. We think this'll be a great launch. The markets just can't predict my genius, I tell you.” 

*E.E.?*

Mrs. Jensen smiled as Bobby laughed hard at his own joke.

“That's great, Bobby. I'm sure E.E. will be remembered for generations to come.” Mrs. Jensen said. Bobby paused, then looked at us both pointedly.

“You know what? I think I'm suddenly into lawyer ladies. What would you two say we all go and get a drink? My treat. We can ditch this snobby palace for somewhere with liquor. We can even take my sweet red Ferrari…”

Bobby waggled his eyebrows. Mrs. Jensen chuckled with the artificial flavor that only an uncomfortable corporate big wig can manage.

“We're of course flattered by the offer, but unfortunately, we're both married.” She said.

Bobby shrugged.

“Doesn't have to mean anything. Come on. Based on your looks you probably haven't slept with your husbands in, what, ten years? They’re probably salty old men anyways. Could be fun…”

Neither of us said anything. Bobby frowned.

“But– suit yourself, I guess. I appreciate your hard work. Keep at it, sport.” He patted my shoulder, and strode off. “We can have a bright future together. Anyways, I better get going.”

I heard him mumble to himself as he opened the door.

“Stiff bitches…”

Mrs. Jensen and I exchanged a glance.

“So, Elaine,” She said quickly, as if to wash the interaction away. “Any new ideas on our next strategy? The CPA isn’t just going to roll over.”

We sat and talked legal jumbo for a while. I was right. The green, upholstered, very square ‘chairs’ were definitely not comfortable. Still, it was easier to just talk to Mrs. Jensen than Mr. Dickson, but I was still nervous. She was kind of an assertive presence. 

She showed me further details of the case, and I made more suggestions. She commented on how young blood always had the sharpest eye for this, and even told me a little about herself.

“You know, I didn't want to be a lawyer originally.” She said.

“Really? But you're so good at it. You really harness the courtroom. What did you want to be?”

She chuckled, smiling.

“Don't laugh. An actress…”

I smiled.

“I could see that. I mean, the courtroom is pretty much a stage.”

Eventually, I left her office to do my own work. Pretty soon though the work day ran out. My only option was to go home. To my surprise, Mrs. Jensen caught me again just as I was taking the elevator.

“Oh, Elaine?”

“Yes, Mrs. Jensen?”

“Sorry about him earlier. Just try to ignore it.”

I gave her a fake smile, nodded, and kept on.

My thoughts were cloudy as I drove back home. 

That damned construction was causing bumper to bumper traffic downtown. It gave me plenty of time to think I guess, whether I wanted it or not. Also plenty of reasons to honk at other drivers.

*“We've already got a lot of speculation on Express’™ newest project,”* Said Fast-talk Fred. *“Lots of posts on Fred's Forum about how positive everyone is. Of course there’s a few misguided stinkers, but we all know they're just trolls anyway. What do you think, Ginnie?”*

*“Well, Fred, I know we can't say much about the new innovation just yet, but I can tell you this, folks. I've been lucky enough to have a sneak peak and I must say it'll change our lives forever! Express Electronics™ is truly a boon.”*

A strange, chilly sensation crawled up my neck. It must be that damned headache from earlier… I guess the acetaminophen had worn off. I rubbed my temple with a free hand.

*“That's great to hear, Ginnie, and I agree! You know, while we can't tell you the secret just yet, I **can** offer you all another surprise! Thanks to Express Electronics™ becoming an affiliate of my shows, we're prepared to offer you a special **20%** discount across Express’™ entire website! You heard that right, folks. They're so excited about their new product that you could get a new phone, television, or whatever you need at a cut!”*

Pre-recorded clapping played.

*“You know, my teenage daughter has been begging me for her own phone. How do we get this discount, Fred?”*

*“Glad you asked, Ginnie. Just use code **‘FRED’** at online checkout or even in-store! That's code **‘FRED.’**”*

*“Really? That's great! You know what else is great?”*

There was a pause before Fred replied. His words were slow and dark.

*“Why yes, Ginnie. I do.”*

The pressure in my head built. I winced as I reached towards the radio dial. Maybe turning down the volume would help?

Guess I was going to have to take another pill when I got home. I was so focused on the pain in my skull that I didn't notice until moments later that the radio was silent. Silent for several noticeable seconds. Only static hummed, all until one sentence was spoken.

*“Elaine wants to escape.”*

My car came to a slow halt at a red stoplight. Had I heard that right? I sat there in confusion, breathing shallow breaths. 

I saw something out of the corner of my eye. A smiling, familiar face, peering into my window. I gasped as I flipped sideways to look at it– but something changed. *Everything* changed. Like watching the sky, then being forced underwater, my vision darkened. I was going deeper, deeper, until no light was reaching me. When that darkness faded, things were different.

Terror filled me as I looked outside of my windshield. The city was gray, full of abandoned vehicles, and so, so empty.

I tried to open my door to see what was wrong, but it locked itself. That talk show host spoke from the radio again, his voice low.

*“He'll be a real asshole tonight. He'd rather ignore you than deal with what he's done,”* Fred tsked. *“There's just no helping you, is there? A case as lost as a ship at sea. At least, not until E.E. helps us all. Helps you, even though you don't deserve it, but you **do** deserve everything else, don’t you?”*

That haze in the back of my head seemed to stab at me. Soft, then sharp, pulling me painfully backwards.

*“The doors will open and the world will be changed. A gray world in a gray mind overtaken by its own greed. Watch the screens, Elaine. Watch the **screens**.”* Fred began to laugh. A laugh that echoed darkly.

That laugh began to sound strange. It burbled oddly into a whining sound that pushed at me. Louder, louder. 

Then I recognized it. I blinked. The sound was a car horn behind me. 

I gasped shakily for air as though I really had been in water. The pain faded. The radio continued jauntily.

*“That's right, and I've just gotta remind you folks that it's sitewide! Don't forget about their in-store trade-in value.”*

The world was… back to normal? Crowded sidewalks, bustling traffic, and colors. No more of that lifeless gray.

The car behind mine honked again, the driver shouting angrily. I waved dismissal as I continued through the now green traffic light.

I glanced down at the radio again.

*“I just can’t believe how gracious they are. Express is truly–”*

It came with no accessories and there is some damage to the table which i halfway expected with how many other peoples experiences have been, but overall the table seems solid. 

  
I mainly bought this because I am a college student and forsee myself needing to be pretty minimalist over the next few years so I thought this was a great way to get a reasonably priced table that won't be a pain to move and could double as a desk/ coffee table if I decided to go for the topper. I know that many people have not received their accessories yet, but I am hoping to get some insight on the topper accessory before I pull the trigger on getting it as the quality and customer service from this company make me very hesitant to do anything before seeing how things pan out for those who supported this project initially. 

  
Even the person I bought this table off of was selling it for a friend who basically was having issues with their customer service (They moved and let the company know way ahead of time and even still they shipped the table to the wrong address). They have been talking to their customer service team and I am sure are comparably annoyed/ angry as many others. I am not in contact with this person, but I feel for them. I hope this company rectifies their mistakes and everything works out as I think this is a great idea and probably the best option as far as I can tell at the moment for a folding board game table.

""When's your birthday?""

A lot of questions I simply wasn't ready to answer, and don't even get me started when she started pressuring political questions because those were ""important to her"" (yeah... I caved..)😅

Now, she did do like 90% of the talking. I took her to get coffee & waffles, then to golf, then bowling. I'm sure her attraction is still pretty high for me. Her text to me after the date was ""Home xx""

Can someone clarify for me what responding to questions should really look like in practice? Should I always respond jokingly? Do I open up with actual answers sometimes? When? When do I just respond something like ""What part of the city do you live?"" ... with ""Where all the cool kids live"" or ""That's some pretty revealing info you're asking for""? vs a real answer?  
  
All in all the date ended pretty conclusively--I ended it after some kissing and going for the ""let's go back to your place"" close, which she rejected with a reason. She seemed keen to come back to my place, but the logistics weren't good to execute on that tbh.

Everything I post is **free** — stories, lessons, tips, and even the occasional fail (’cause honestly, that’s where most of the learning happens 😅).

You might see a few **affiliate links** from time to time — just honest recommendations of tools I actually use. If you try them out, I might earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.

# My Story

I’ve been freelancing for **9 years** now.  
Started with zero connections, no roadmap — just trial, error, and a lot of late-night Google searches.

Today, I’m blessed to have **16 long-term clients** — 10 individual and 5 agencies — all on flexible terms, and still growing through referrals.

For the longest time, I was a **one-person team**. Then last year, I taught my niece (my sidekick now!), and we’ve been building quietly and consistently since then.

No plans of starting a big agency or offering internships — been there, done that. I love the peace and balance I have now.

I simply enjoy sharing what I’ve learned — how to find and retain premium clients, stay consistent, and build a freelance life that’s both stable and peaceful.

# Why Reddit?

Real talk — I’ve always wanted to share my journey.  
But social media? Medyo nakakatakot minsan, especially with bashers 😅

And with **six kids** to protect, I’d rather keep our private life *private*.  
Here on Reddit, I can stay lowkey, share freely, and hopefully help others grow — without all the noise.

This all started when I shared a short freelancing story here.  
The support and encouragement I got from everyone pushed me to keep going — so, thank you. ❤️

# What You’ll See Here

* Real freelancing stories (wins *and* fails)
* Tips to find and keep premium clients
* Tools and systems I actually use
* Workflows and small automations that save time
* Random reflections over coffee ☕

No fluff, no gatekeeping — just real stories from someone still in the trenches, figuring things out one project (and one caffeine boost) at a time.

That’s it. If you’re a freelancer or just curious about this kind of life, stick around.

Thanks for being here — and feel free to share your own thoughts, workflows, or favorite tools. We’re all learning together.

I wanted it raw, even if it may be a bit messed up, because in my first language (french) I'm an editor and I love writing. It would feel very wrong to have an AI do it for me.*

*\*\*\**

You know when they say you should let go of your magic, trust in it, and let <*whatever/whoever you believe in rather it's the Universe, a deity, or your own power*\> do it's thing?

Well friends, it's goddamn true. Grab a coffee and sit comfortably, I have a story for you.

First, you have to know that I just spent the last 21 months trying to remove someone, or at least have them take a goddamn seat, for mentally, emotionally and financially abusing the closest friend I had this past decade (let's call him Ben). Ben is extremely generous, but due to the fact he's neurodivergent, he has a hard time recognizing signs of abuse and, well. Not everyone has a good heart ya know.

In January 2024 he made a new friend who quickly displayed signs of abuse (mostly financial), but Ben fully believed them when they said I was trying to ruin their newfound friendship out of jealousy.

So I did what a witch does to fix things her way : sigils, sour jars, war water, hot foot powder, freeze spells, moon water, eclipse water, how many banishing oils did I make, too? I even created a servitor to help me in my task. One or two spells were kinda successful but for only a very short period of time. The new friend I was trying to banish only came back stronger and my friendship with Ben became very problematic, dare I even say toxic.

Each and every spell I did was released and forgotten about... or so I thought. Looking back I was more obsessed with them than I dared to admit at the time. I was doing a spell... waiting 2-4 weeks, secretly hoping it would work and being on the lookout for signs (aka basically putting doubt into my magic) and when I was realizing nothing was happening?

Rince and repeat : I would plan/do another spell.

Eventually, the whole situation started to really mess up with my mental health, so I did what a witch does : I did a mundane thing called therapy. There, I learned to accept I cannot always have things going my way, I cannot be responsible of others and mostly, I learned to accept things as they are rather than trying to fight them. Basically I learned the real art of **letting go**.

On September 27th I finally felt ready to truly and fully let go of it **ALL**, so I did what a witch does (and it was endorsed by my amazing therapist) : I turned to my altar. I wrote a letter to my matron, Hecate, to tell Her I was ready to accept that I was powerless in regard of Ben and I had to let go of it in order to stop the toxic dynamic him and I were stuck in since over a year and a half. I also said that it would kill me inside but if the only way to stop said toxic dynamic with Ben was to end our friendship, I would accept it as well, and let it runs its course.

I asked Hecate to accept all that I was finally releasing, all my hopes that weren't fulfilled, all my anger for not succeeding, all my sadness at the idea of maybe having to end a very important friendship... I asked Her to take it all away from me and lead me towards a path that would finally heal me and bring me peace of mind, a feeling I didn't experience in almost 2 years.

I ended my letter by saying I was fully trusting Her and that I knew She would make sure everything would come back to bless me in due time. I sealed the letter in an envelope, had a good ugly cry while holding it, probably put a bit of snot on it, then put it on Hecate's altar and went to bed.

The very next day I removed the letter from my altar; mind you, I normally leave my letters up to a full week on display, but I really wanted to be done with it asap. I stored it and forgot about it.

\*\*\*

A week later on October 5^(th), Ben's shit friend (and abuser) messed up big time. Big, BIG time, enough for Ben to finally realize something isn't right. And he did what he haven't done since many, many months : he turned over to me for support and help. In that moment I wouldn't have been happier if I had won a billion dollars and got to swim naked in it with Pedro Pascal.

It also gave us the opportunity to amend some very important things between us. We apologized to each other. I cried like the hypersensitive person I am. He was his usual awkward self when I cry. It was fantastic. We agreed it's time to nurture our friendship back to health. We started right away. The last 4 days have been very close to the friendship we shared in the past.

The toxic friend probably won't go away entirely but Ben is more aware of what's happening and I have faith our friendship will heal. I have been pinching myself for four days now. And also showering Hecate with thanks and offerings of all kind.

I feel at peace in a way I haven't in almost two years. I got what I worked for, for so long, 8 days after **TRULY LETTING GO**.

I initially flew into Changi Airport and spent a couple of nights exploring the city at a relaxed pace, taking in both the iconic sights and the quieter corners. Most people rush through Singapore in a day or two, but I decided to slow down, recharge, and really absorb the atmosphere. Mornings were spent walking along Marina Bay before the crowds arrived, sipping coffee at small cafes and watching the city slowly wake up.

Exploring neighborhoods like Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam was a highlight. Each area had its own charm,colorful shophouses, local markets, and hidden alleyways filled with small shops. The street food at hawker centers was incredible; I tried Hainan Chicken Rice, Laksa, and other local staples without ever feeling rushed.

Singapore is surprisingly easy to navigate, so wandering through its streets was effortless. I loved the small details,  the reflections in the bay, the mix of modern architecture with heritage buildings, and even the way the city felt meticulously clean yet welcoming.

Most of my photos were taken spontaneously while wandering, trying to capture the little things that make Singapore unique, the gardens, street art, and little cafes tucked into quiet streets. Even simple moments, like watching people stroll along the waterfront or sitting in a park, felt peaceful and memorable.

It was a short attempt at slowing down in one of the busiest cities in the world, but it gave me a chance to see Singapore in a more relaxed, human-paced way. Definitely a city worth revisiting!",1,1760059090.0,BeautifulTravelPlaces,0,1.0,False

1o2njfa,https://youtu.be/zy8QWBQXEUQ,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Summer Night Horror Stories,"# ""Quiet Now"":

I had just finished wiping down the counters at the diner where I worked — the kind of place that smelled like fried onions and strong coffee, where the regulars came for pie and quiet after their shifts. The neon sign outside buzzed and flickered against the windows, throwing pale red light across the empty booths. It was late — past midnight — and the air conditioner hummed like a lullaby.

Lisa was supposed to meet me, same as she did most nights. We’d sit in the back booth, share a plate of fries, talk about the boys in town and all the big places we wanted to go. But tonight, she didn’t show.

I wiped the same spot on the counter for the fifth time, watching the clock tick past twelve-thirty. The hands moved slow, but the silence in the diner was heavy — the kind that made you hear every sound: the creak of the sign outside, the clink of a spoon in the sink.

Finally, I grabbed my jacket and told Frank I’d lock up. The night air outside hit me with that damp river chill — the kind that carried the scent of wet soil and iron. The streets were empty, lamps humming low, houses dark except for a few windows where people still watched TV or smoked on their porches.

Lisa’s house was only a few blocks away. I knew her mother would still be awake, waiting like she always did. When I knocked, she opened the door with a tired smile, a shawl around her shoulders.

“Emma. She’s not home yet?”

“No, ma’am. I thought she might be with you.”

She shook her head. “She went out with that sailor boy — Tom. The one on leave. Said they were heading to Alexander’s for drinks. She should’ve been back by now, though.”

Her voice was calm, but her eyes flicked toward the clock behind her. I nodded, pretending not to feel the cold knot forming in my stomach.

Lisa had talked about Tom earlier that afternoon — said he was charming but a bit intense. Then she mentioned something else, something that hadn’t sat right with me. Deputy Harris. The married man who’d been “checking in” on her a little too often. The one who always seemed to appear where she was. She told me last night that he’d grabbed her arm outside her house, asked her to go to his cabin by the river. She’d said no — and he hadn’t liked that answer.

“Stay away from him,” I’d warned her. And now, with her missing, that memory felt like a warning I hadn’t shouted loud enough.

“I’ll go look for her,” I told her mother. “Maybe they’re still at the bar.”

She nodded, a small, hopeful smile. “You’re a good friend, Emma. Tell her to come home.”

The road to Alexander’s Log Cabin Inn cut past the edge of town, where the fields started and the crickets took over the noise. Every few minutes, I caught the distant rumble of the river, black and endless in the dark. When I reached the inn, the gravel lot had only a handful of cars. The sign above the door — an old wooden carving of a bear — creaked in the wind.

Inside, the air was thick with smoke and laughter from a couple of fishermen at the bar. Frank, the bartender, was wiping glasses.

“Hey, Emma,” he said. “Didn’t think I’d see you this late. What’ll it be?”

“Looking for Lisa. She come in tonight? Maybe with a sailor?”

He nodded. “Yeah, came in around ten-thirty. They sat by the jukebox. Had a couple drinks, seemed happy enough. But…” — he hesitated — “Harris was here too. Sat at the bar the whole time, just watching them. Didn’t say much, but he left right after they did.”

My heart dropped a little. “Did Lisa seem worried?”

“Not that I could tell,” he said. “They headed east — maybe toward Stenhouse’s place.”

The Stenhouse was another few miles out — a bar and grill near the river bend, where young couples went to drink cheap beer and watch the trains go by. It was also close to the woods. The kind of place where, if someone screamed, no one in town would hear.

By the time I got there, it was past one. The place was still lit up, yellow light spilling across the lot. Inside, a few men sat quietly at tables. No Lisa. No Tom.

Mr. Stenhouse was behind the counter, counting bills. “Emma? You’re out late, kiddo.”

“I’m looking for Lisa Reed,” I said. “Was she here tonight? With Tom Skridla?”

He thought for a moment, then nodded. “Sure were. Around midnight. Had sodas, nothing strong. Left not long ago — said something about going for a drive.”

“Do you know which way?”

He shrugged. “Didn’t say. Tom’s car was out front — blue sedan, I think.”

Outside, the road was nearly silent. I spotted what looked like a blue car parked down by the trees, just off the shoulder. I crossed over, the gravel crunching under my shoes. The car was empty. Driver’s door cracked open. Inside, Lisa’s purse was spilled across the seat — lipstick, compact, the little silver hairbrush I’d given her last Christmas.

Something in me went cold.

“Lisa?” I called out, softly at first, then louder. The only answer was the wind in the trees.

That’s when I heard footsteps behind me. Slow, deliberate. Crunch. Crunch.

When I turned, a beam of light hit my face. A flashlight.

“Emma?” a voice said. Calm. Familiar. “What are you doing out here?”

Deputy Harris stepped into view, uniform crisp, hat low over his eyes.

“I’m looking for Lisa,” I said, backing up slightly. “She was with Tom. You seen them?”

He pointed his light toward the car. “Yeah. I saw them pull off down this way earlier, when I was on patrol. Must’ve gone for a walk.”

“But her purse is here,” I said. “She wouldn’t just leave it.”

He came closer, too close. “Maybe she forgot it. I’ll help you look.”

I wanted to refuse, but my throat was dry. The night pressed in, thick and dark. So I nodded, and we started down the dirt path that led deeper into the trees. The ditch beside us was overgrown, filled with weeds that whispered as we walked.

“You know,” he said after a moment, voice low, “Lisa’s a nice girl. Too nice for that sailor. Outsiders cause trouble.”

“What do you mean?”

He didn’t answer. His flashlight moved ahead, sweeping across the ditch. Then it stopped.

“There,” he said.

I followed his gaze. A shape lay twisted in the mud — Tom. His shirt soaked dark, his arm bent unnaturally. My breath caught in my throat.

“Oh God,” I whispered.

Harris crouched beside the body, checking for a pulse. “He’s dead. Shot. Multiple times.”

I took a step back, my hands trembling. “We need to call the sheriff—”

“Yeah,” he said slowly. “We will. But first, let’s make sure Lisa’s not around here. Could be she’s hurt.”

He started walking again, and against every instinct screaming in my head, I followed. The ground grew softer, muddier near the river. I could hear the water now, faint but steady.

Something in his tone changed — the easy calm replaced by something colder.

“You know,” he said, “Lisa talked too much. Just like you.”

“What?”

“She didn’t want to come with me. Said she was too good for me.” He turned, the flashlight catching the edge of his smile. “That wasn’t very nice.”

My heart hammered. “You… you did this?”

He stepped closer. “She made me. I just wanted to talk. Then that sailor showed up. Things got messy.”

I stumbled back, but he grabbed my arm, his grip iron-tight.

“Don’t make this hard, Emma.”

I tried to scream, but his hand clamped over my mouth. His breath was hot against my ear. “Quiet now,” he whispered. “No one’s coming.”

Something in me snapped. I bit down on his hand as hard as I could. He yelled, jerking back. I tore free and ran — through the weeds, through the mud, the branches slashing at my face.

Behind me, I heard him shouting, boots pounding on gravel.

The road came into view — a stretch of open blacktop under the stars. A truck’s headlights appeared in the distance. I waved my arms wildly.

The truck slowed. The driver — an old farmer — rolled down his window. “What’s wrong, girl?”

“Please,” I gasped. “Call the police. There’s a body in the ditch — and the deputy—”

He stared at me, unsure, but he let me climb in. We sped toward town, his hands white-knuckled on the wheel.

At the station, I told them everything. Every word, every sound. But Harris was one of their own, and small towns protect their own.

By morning, they’d found Tom’s body right where I said. Four days later, they found Lisa’s too — half a mile downstream, one bullet through her chest.

Deputy Harris disappeared that same night. Some said he fled west. Others whispered that he’d had help — friends in the department who made him vanish clean. The sheriff called it “an ongoing investigation,” but the file gathered dust before the year was out.

I left town soon after. But even now, when I drive through quiet streets at night, I catch myself checking the mirrors. Sometimes, I think I see headlights behind me — steady, following.

And every time I do, I remember his voice in the dark:

“Quiet now. No one’s coming.”





# ""Blue Rock Springs"":

It was the Fourth of July, 1969, and the heat still clung to the air even after midnight. Vallejo had quieted down from the fireworks, though faint bursts still flickered in the sky, echoing like distant thunder. I’d been waiting all week to see Emily again. She worked at the local diner — the kind of small-town place where you could still get coffee for a quarter and the waitress knew your usual before you sat down.

I was nineteen then, restless, working odd jobs and saving up for a beat-up Ford I’d been eyeing. Emily was twenty-two, with a laugh that stuck in your head long after she walked away and eyes that always seemed to hold a secret. We’d met that spring, when I came in with some friends after work. She served us pie, and by the time the coffee refills ran out, we were talking about everything from The Beatles to Hitchcock movies. I kept coming back after that — for the pie, sure, but mostly for her.

That night, around eleven-thirty, the phone rang. Her voice came through the receiver, soft but rushed.  
“Hey, Alex. You still up for hanging out tonight? I can pick you up in a few.”

My pulse jumped. “Yeah, of course. Where we going?”

She hesitated. “Just a drive. Need to get out for a bit. It’s been a long day.”

Ten minutes later, I was standing out front, the air smelling faintly of gunpowder and smoke from leftover fireworks. She pulled up in her brown Corvair, headlights cutting through the quiet street. I climbed in, and she leaned over to give me a quick kiss on the cheek. “Glad you could come,” she said, smiling under the yellow streetlight.

We drove out of town, windows down, the night wind warm against our faces. She told me about her shift — the cranky customers, the guy who tipped her a five-dollar bill just for a smile. I told her about a buddy who nearly wrecked his truck trying to impress a girl at the lake. We laughed. For a while, it felt like the whole world existed only in that car — her perfume, the hum of the engine, the soft rhythm of her voice.

But as the city lights faded, I noticed a car behind us — pale in color, maybe a Ford, its headlights steady in the rearview mirror.

“Is that someone you know?” I asked.

She glanced at it, her expression flickering. “Probably nothing,” she said, forcing a little laugh. “People take these roads all the time.”

Yet the car didn’t pass. When Emily sped up, it sped up too. When she slowed, so did it. My unease grew, a slow tightening in my gut.

“Emily,” I said quietly, “maybe we should turn around.”

She bit her lip, then nodded toward the windshield. “Blue Rock Springs Park is just up ahead. It’s close to town. We’ll stop there a bit — maybe they’ll keep going.”

The park appeared out of the darkness, a patch of gravel and shadow bordered by trees. She pulled in and parked near the edge, cutting the engine. Crickets chirped somewhere out in the grass, and the faint booms of fireworks still carried over the hills. The car that had been following us was gone — or at least I couldn’t see it anymore.

“See?” she said softly. “Nothing to worry about.”

We sat there, the world quiet again. She leaned back, telling me about her dreams — traveling to New York, maybe Europe someday. “I just want to see something different,” she said. “Something bigger than this town.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’d like to see the mountains up north. Somewhere peaceful.”

She smiled. “Peaceful sounds nice right now.”

Just then, headlights washed over the lot. A car had pulled in — same light color, maybe the same one that had been following us. It stopped about eighty feet away and turned off the lights, the engine idling.

“Who’s that?” I whispered.

“Probably nothing,” she said again, but her tone had changed.

We sat in silence. The car lingered there, the engine humming faintly. Then, without warning, it revved up and drove off, gravel crunching under its tires.

We both exhaled, almost laughing at our own nerves. She reached over and squeezed my hand. “See? Just some guy killing time.”

For a few minutes, it was calm again. I told her about my little brother, how he once tried to ride our dog like a horse. She laughed — that bright, effortless laugh that made everything else fade.

Then headlights flared behind us — close this time. The same car had returned, pulling up just a few feet away on my side. My chest tightened.

A door opened. A man stepped out, heavyset, maybe in his thirties. Curly light brown hair caught the dim light. He held a flashlight, its beam cutting across the car and straight into our faces.

I squinted, trying to make out a badge. “Evening, officer?” I said.

He didn’t answer. The light stayed fixed on us, blinding. Emily leaned forward. “Can we help you?”

Nothing. Just the sound of his slow footsteps in the gravel. The silence was worse than anything he could have said.

Then his arm lifted. I saw the metal glint — a gun.

The first shot ripped through the window and into my right arm. The sound was deafening, the pain instant and searing. I screamed, clutching the wound as blood poured hot down my side. Emily gasped, turning toward me — and the second shot hit her in the neck.

“Emily!” I shouted, reaching for her, but another shot exploded, then another. Glass shattered. I fell against the door, pain blooming through my back and leg.

The man moved calmly, methodically. No shouting, no hesitation. Just aim, fire, reload.

I went limp, forcing myself not to breathe too loud. I could feel the blood soaking through my shirt, the air thick with the smell of gunpowder and iron.

Then, just as suddenly as it began, it stopped. I heard his footsteps crunching away, the car door closing, the engine revving. He drove off into the night.

For a moment, there was nothing — just my ragged breathing and Emily’s faint, broken gasps beside me. I tried to speak, but the words came out as choked sobs. Her hand twitched, then went still.

I don’t know how long I sat there, frozen in that car. The world felt unreal — like it had slipped off its hinges. Then I forced my left arm up, weak and shaking, and slammed the horn. Once. Twice. Over and over, until the sound cracked through the dark like a scream.

It must have been fifteen minutes before headlights appeared again — three teenagers pulling into the lot. Their laughter stopped the instant they saw the blood on the windows. One of the girls ran toward us, shouting for help.

“Please,” I whispered. “Call the police. She’s hurt bad.”

The next moments came in flashes — sirens, bright lights, paramedics lifting me out. Emily was taken away, but by twelve-forty, she was gone.

I woke up in a hospital bed days later, tubes in my arms, pain flaring every time I moved. The detectives came — tired eyes, notepads in hand.

“He didn’t say a word?” one asked.

“Nothing,” I whispered. “He just looked at us. Then started shooting.”

They wrote it all down. The description. The car. The silence.

A few days later, I heard about the phone call — the man who rang the police station, flatly confessing to what he’d done, linking it to another murder from last year. The newspapers gave him a name: **the Zodiac.**

Even after my wounds healed, the fear stayed. I couldn’t drive at night. Couldn’t sit in a parked car without checking every shadow. Every sudden noise made my heart seize. I moved away from Vallejo, tried to start fresh, but it followed me — that memory of his flashlight, that expressionless silence before the first shot.

People turned the story into puzzles and headlines, into whispers about codes and symbols. But for me, it wasn’t some mystery. It was the night everything changed — when the world proved it could turn cold and senseless in the span of a breath.

Sometimes, even now, I wake in the dark and see the beam of that flashlight again. I hear Emily’s laugh, then the gunshots, and I’m back there — nineteen, terrified, bleeding, watching the light fade from her eyes.





# ""Summer’s End"":

It was the summer after I turned nine, the kind of golden, endless summer where time felt slower and the air always smelled faintly of cut grass and sunscreen. My mom, Anna, had taken me and my little sister Lily to a swimming meet at the local pool. Lily was six—tiny, fearless, and full of spark—and that day, she’d won her very first ribbon. She splashed through every race like she’d been born in the water.

We stayed later than usual because of the awards ceremony. By the time we left, the sun had slipped behind the trees, and a dusky purple light hung over everything. The walk home was familiar—just over a mile down a quiet lane hemmed in by tall pines and thick brush. Our cottage sat at the very end, far from the main road, no neighbors for half a mile. It used to feel peaceful. Safe.

“Mom, my legs are tired,” Lily whined, dragging her towel like a cape.

Anna smiled, patient as always. “Almost home, sweetie. I’ll make sandwiches when we get back. Emily, you doing okay with the bag?”

I adjusted the damp string bag on my shoulder. “Yeah, Mom. Lily, you were amazing today! You beat that girl who was way bigger than you.”

Lily grinned. “I did, didn’t I?”

Our laughter drifted through the warm air. The lane ahead shimmered faintly under the last light. Then, a car rolled up behind us, slow. I turned. The driver was a man—light hair, maybe in his forties. He didn’t wave when I did. Just stared as he passed.

A minute later, we rounded a bend, and there it was again. The same car, parked sideways across the narrow road, blocking our way.

The man stepped out. He looked ordinary—plain shirt, work pants, nothing strange except the hammer in his hand. He held it like someone might hold a tool they’d forgotten to set down, except his knuckles were white around the handle.

“Give me your money,” he said. His voice was flat, calm, like he was asking for directions.

Anna froze, one arm instinctively going around Lily. “We don’t have any. My purse is at home. Please, let us pass.”

He took a step closer. “Now.”

Lily whimpered. “Mommy…”

“Shh,” Anna whispered. “It’s okay, baby.” She turned to him again. “I can get you money. Just… please don’t hurt us.”

The man shook his head. “No. You’re not going anywhere.”

The world seemed to tilt then. I remember the weight of the bag slipping off my shoulder, my heart beating so hard it hurt.

“Emily,” Anna said quietly, without turning her head. “Run. Go to the nearest house. Go now.”

I barely managed a step before the man lunged, his hand like iron around my arm. The hammer swung. It hit the side of my head—hard, but glancing. Stars burst behind my eyes, blood in my mouth.

“Stop!” Anna screamed. “She’s a child! Please, stop!”

He didn’t. He shoved us off the road, into the trees. The air changed—cooler, heavy with pine and dirt. Branches tore at our clothes as we stumbled into a small clearing.

“Sit,” he ordered.

Anna pulled Lily and me close, her breathing uneven. “Why are you doing this? We don’t have anything you want.”

He didn’t answer. He just tore Lily’s towel into strips. “Hands behind your backs.”

Anna tried to reason with him, her voice trembling. “My husband’s expecting us. If we’re not home soon, he’ll come looking. Please…”

He didn’t look up. His jaw clenched, eyes empty. He tied Anna first, then Lily, then me. His hands were rough, fast, methodical.

When he was done, he stood over us, hammer dangling loosely. For a few seconds, the only sound was the rustling of leaves.

Then, he moved.

The hammer rose and fell—fast, brutal. It hit my mother first. The sound was soft and heavy, not like in movies. She gasped once and slumped forward.

“Mom!” I screamed.

Lily cried out, high and thin, a sound I still hear sometimes when I dream. He turned on her next. One blow, then another, until she stopped moving.

I couldn’t breathe. I tried to crawl to her, but the ropes held tight. “Please,” I sobbed. “Please stop.”

The hammer came for me. I felt the first strike, then another, dull and distant. I fell sideways, and the world went dark.

When I came to, everything was quiet except for the sound of his footsteps moving away through the leaves. I stayed still, afraid he’d look back. My head throbbed. Blood trickled down my neck.

When I finally dared to open my eyes, the clearing was a nightmare of red and silence. My mother’s arm was still outstretched toward me, her hand open. Lily lay beside her, so small. Our dog, Daisy, had followed us from home—I hadn’t even realized—but she was there too, not breathing.

I whispered their names. Nothing.

Somewhere in the distance, a car door slammed. Then nothing again.

I don’t remember how long I lay there. My wrists were raw by the time I got free. Every sound—the rustle of leaves, the creak of branches—made me flinch.

I tried to walk but fell after a few steps. My voice was barely a whisper when I called out. “Help…”

Eventually, I heard shouting. My father’s voice. I think I screamed then, though I’m not sure. The next thing I remember was light—bright, sterile, painful. Machines beeping. The smell of antiseptic.

“She’s lucky to be alive,” someone said.

Later, they told me my dad had found us. The car was gone. The man, gone. Just tire tracks and blood and the broken towel on the ground.

They searched for weeks. Questioned drifters, local workers, anyone with a record. Someone was arrested eventually—a man who looked the part. But some detectives weren’t convinced. Another suspect confessed years later, then recanted. The case went cold again.

I recovered, at least on the outside. The scars on my scalp faded. My speech came back after therapy. But inside, something stayed broken.

I still dream about that lane. About the way the hammer caught the last of the evening light before it fell. About my mother’s hand, reaching, trying to keep us safe even as everything slipped away.

I live far from that cottage now. But every time I see a car idling too long on a quiet road, I feel that same cold rush inside me. Because danger doesn’t always roar up with sirens. Sometimes, it just parks sideways in your path—quiet, patient, hammer in hand.





# ""Blood on the Shore"":

I was just eighteen that summer of 1960, the air warm and full of dust from the road as I rode my motorcycle toward the quiet edge of Lake Bodom. My girlfriend, Irma, rode behind me, arms wrapped tight around my waist. She was fifteen—bright, laughing, restless in the way only the young can be. Behind us, our friends Seppo and Anna followed on another bike, their voices carrying faintly over the wind. We were heading out to escape the city noise, to find a little peace by the water. Just a weekend by the lake—nothing more.

We reached the far side of the lake by late afternoon, where the trees crowded thick and the world went still. The spot we chose was perfect—no houses, no roads, just a clearing of grass sloping gently down to the water. The air smelled of pine and lakeweed. Birds wheeled overhead, and the only sound was the quiet lap of the waves against the shore.

We unpacked what little we had—blankets, sandwiches, a couple of sodas, a single tent. “This is perfect,” Irma said, brushing her hair from her face as she helped me stake the canvas into the ground. Her smile caught the light, warm and easy. “No one around to bother us.”

“Yeah,” Seppo said, grinning as he dropped his pack. “We can stay up late, tell stories, maybe even swim in the dark.”

Anna laughed softly. “As long as no bugs crawl into the tent first.”

We built a small fire as the evening settled, its orange glow flickering across our faces. The world felt wide open then. We talked about school, about what came next after summer—things that felt big and far away. Seppo told some stupid joke, and Irma leaned against me, her hand finding mine. “I’m glad we came,” she whispered. Her voice was soft, half-lost in the rustle of the water.

By the time the fire burned low, the stars had come out—thousands of them, cold and bright. We doused the flames, zipped ourselves into the tent, and lay close, whispering half-asleep goodnights. The lake outside breathed in quiet rhythm.

I don’t remember what time it was when I woke. Maybe two, maybe three in the morning. Something had changed—the stillness wasn’t the same. I opened my eyes to darkness and a faint sound. A soft rustling, like someone moving just beyond the tent.

I lay still, heart already beating faster. The others were asleep—Irma beside me, Seppo and Anna pressed close on the other side. I told myself it was an animal. A fox, maybe. Nothing to worry about.

But then I heard it again—slow, deliberate footsteps circling the tent. Crunching twigs. Breathing.

“Hello?” I whispered. My voice sounded strange in the dark.

Silence. Then, a faint scrape—metal against fabric.

I held my breath. The shape of a shadow flickered across the tent wall, tall, human. Before I could move, something struck the canvas hard, the sound sharp as thunder in the stillness. Seppo jerked awake with a shout, and Anna screamed.

A blade tore through the fabric in a sudden rip, slicing the air inside. Irma cried out as I threw myself up, trying to see, to understand. But the world had exploded into chaos—the tent shaking, the sounds of struggle and panic everywhere.

“Run!” I shouted, grabbing Irma’s arm. But another blow came from outside, heavy and fast, smashing against Seppo’s head. His cry stopped short. Anna’s voice rose in horror—“Please! Stop! What do you want?”—before it broke into sobs.

Something sharp cut across my forearm, hot pain blooming. I swung blindly through the rip in the canvas, but my fists met only cold air. Whoever it was stayed outside, moving fast, silent except for the thuds and tearing sounds.

Irma’s fingers dug into my arm. “Nils—help me!”

I pulled her toward the opening, desperate to get her out, but the attacker struck again. I felt her body jerk, her breath catch. Blood sprayed warm across my face. I screamed her name, but another hit came—this one to my head. The world went white, then black.

When I woke, it was quiet again.

Morning light filtered weakly through the trees. My face was swollen, blood dried in streaks across my skin. My jaw burned when I tried to move it. For a moment, I didn’t understand where I was. Then I saw the tent—collapsed, torn apart, soaked in red.

Irma lay half outside it, her hair matted with blood, her eyes half-open to the morning. Anna and Seppo were inside, still and broken, the grass around them dark with what had spilled from their bodies.

My legs barely held me as I stumbled to my feet, calling their names, my voice shaking. There was no answer. Only the soft lap of the lake, as if nothing had happened. My shoes were gone. My keys. I didn’t remember losing them.

I started walking, barefoot through the brush. The ground was cold and wet. I remember seeing someone in the distance—a man, walking away through the trees. Blond hair catching the light. Or maybe that’s something my mind added later.

By the time I collapsed near the road, the sun was already high. Birdwatchers found me hours later, babbling, bleeding, barely conscious. When the police came, it was already too late. Too many footprints trampled the scene. Too many details lost.

They questioned me again and again, trying to piece together what I couldn’t say. My memory fractured in places, whole stretches gone. I told them about the sound, the shadow, the steps circling the tent. About Irma’s hand slipping from mine. But even I began to doubt myself.

A man in black. Eyes red in the dark. Or just a trick of fear.

Years passed. The case went cold. People whispered. Some said I had done it—that I killed them all in a jealous rage and hurt myself to hide the truth. They called me a liar, a monster.

Decades later, in 2004, they arrested me again. The police said there was new evidence—blood on my shoes. But the tests showed it wasn’t mine, and in the end, they let me go.

Still, the questions never stopped. Who was out there that night? A stranger? A hunter? Someone from town angry about campers trespassing? Or something worse—something that didn’t belong to the world of reason?

Sometimes, even now, I wake in the dark and hear that same faint rustle—the sound of someone moving just outside the walls of memory. And I wonder if he’s still out there, somewhere by the lake, watching, waiting.

The place is quiet now. People camp there again. But I can’t go back. The trees remember. The water remembers.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

hey everyone, figured i'd share some tips on parking at the hollywood walk of fame since it can be a real headache. honestly, finding a spot can feel like trying to win an oscar yourself.  
  
first up, an app called Prked is a game changer for parking at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. it lets you rent someone's private driveway or garage right next to all the action. it's usually way cheaper than the big lots, you get to skip the insane traffic circling for a spot, and it's just a short walk over. definitely check it out before you go.  
  
if you're going the traditional route, the main spot everyone knows is the garage at the Ovation Hollywood complex (it used to be called Hollywood & Highland). it's super convenient because you park right under the Dolby Theatre and you're literally steps from the main part of the walk of fame. a pro tip is to buy something small, even a coffee, from one of the shops inside to get your parking validated. this can knock the price down significantly for the first couple of hours.  
  
there are other big garages too, like the one at Cherokee and Hollywood, and a few others scattered around on side streets like Las Palmas and Cahuenga. prices can be anywhere from 15 bucks to over 40 for a few hours, it really just depends on how close you are and what's going on that day. you can also use apps like spothero to book a spot in one of these garages ahead of time, which can sometimes save you a few bucks and the stress of finding out a lot is full.  
  
now, about street parking. can you find it? maybe. should you count on it? probably not. competition for metered spots on hollywood blvd and the side streets is insane. if you do get lucky, read the signs like five times. there are time limits, street cleaning restrictions, and tow-away zones everywhere. the city is ruthless with tickets, and it's the fastest way to ruin your day. they've also been doing a lot of construction and changes on hollywood blvd itself, which has blocked off even more spots lately.  
  
a really big thing to know is that they shut down streets around here all the time for movie premieres, star ceremonies, and other events. it's not just the big award shows either. you could show up on a random tuesday and find hollywood blvd completely blocked off between orange and highland. always check online for street closures before you head out.  
  
timing is everything in LA. if you can, go on a weekday morning. the crowds are smaller, traffic is a bit lighter, and you'll have a much easier time finding your favorite stars without a million people in your photo. weekends are an absolute zoo. driving there from LAX can take 30 minutes or over an hour, just depending on traffic. honestly, if you're close to a metro station, just take the red line. it drops you off right at hollywood/highland and you can avoid the whole parking nightmare completely.  
  
for handicap parking, the big garages like ovation hollywood have accessible spots for anyone with a valid permit.  
  
hope this helps you have a great time checking out the stars! it's a super cool spot to see at least once.",1,1760058258.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False
1o2n9ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1o2n9ym/advise_me_please/,"Advise me, please.","So, I met this lady who is a director at one of the great companies at a networking event, and we really got along. We talked about everything except me applying to the company because I didn’t know, I just wanted to meet her. However, I did mention that I was interested in forensic work (she’s an auditor), and she said, ""Let me grab your LinkedIn; I’ll connect you with someone from that area."" She recommended I watch one of the well-known documentaries—All the Queen’s Horses—explaining that she usually encourages all interns and new employees to watch it when they join the team. We wrapped things up since people were waiting behind me, and I left. After the event, I messaged her on LinkedIn as people do and asked her to connect me with the person she mentioned. She replied politely, saying she shared my profile with her and thanked her—that was it. A month later, I messaged her on LinkedIn again after watching the documentary. I gave a brief review and added that no one had reached out to me, so if I could get the email of the person she wanted me to connect with instead of the other way around, that would be great, as I really wanted to meet her. The next day, the lady sent me and the other lady an email, introducing me with kind words, and I responded accordingly. Eventually, the two of us decided to meet for a coffee chat. My question is, I don’t want to mess this up because I feel it’s a significant opportunity—since the first lady was the one who introduced me, it’s almost like a referral—and I want to make a good impression on the other lady as well. She said we could meet at the office and then walk to a nearby café for the 45-minute meeting. I’ve already applied for the internship in forensic work, so this could be a really good opportunity to showcase my interpersonal skills that are often hard to showcase in a resume and all so can you all give me tips on how I can secure my internship if not secure but at least make a lasting impression. For context, I’m a second-year student at a good university with a decent amount of extracurricular activities and a 3.36 GPA. ",0,1760058163.0,Accounting,0,0.5,False

My name is Nick and I'm a 28 year old guy from Texas. I've posted before but I'm deciding to try something a little bit different this time around and just putting everything in the table, so buckle up and I'm sorry in advance for all of the writing.

Some things about me, I work for one of the largest investment companies in the US, I've been in the financial field for about 4 and a half years now. Before that, I spent about the same amount of time working in water damage restoration. I am college educated, I actually went back to college for a finance degree, switched to marketing because it was interesting, stayed and plan to stay in finance. Minor mistake. I'm very big on honesty and not hiding any secrets, ask about anything and everything.

Physically, I am 6 feet tall, I go to the gym but I also like to eat, I'm white, brown hair, brown eyes. Just a pretty generic dude. I wear size 12 shoes but size 13 boots, the boots also make me 6'2 in case I plan on reaching the top-top shelf that day. I have 3 tattoos and plan on getting more.

Hobbies are kinda scattered here and there. My main two are watching formula 1 every weekend it's on, and playing games primarily on PS5 or PC. I commit to reading a few books a year, I enjoy poetry, every now and then I'll build a Lego, I'm slightly involved in the furry community since I have a good friend who is an artist, I like doing things with my hands, I enjoy making coffee, I like going out to stores and to eat, I have a cat, I keep myself busy most days and out of the house.

What I'm looking for is something genuine and long term. Yap on reddit for a bit to see if there's a connection, move onto somewhere else. I want yap sessions, if we have similar hobbies then lets do them together, be shoulders to lean on, add to each other's lives, become a positive stone on your path. Be a name that when I think of it or see it, I think of you and smile.

1o2n8fy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2n8fy,Design and layout advice?,"Recently moved to a new apartment (layout print included in post). I have a few decorating and layout questions!

For context, I'm aiming for a vibe that is MCM, Bauhaus-ish, and sleek. I want to play with adding chrome and walnut accents throughout the space to achieve this.

Right now, I'm not the happiest with the rug. I feel like it is too big, color does not complement furniture/look, and it matches the wall too much. Any suggestions on sizing and color?

Also, I feel a bit iffy on my layout. I would like to include a dining table, couch/coffee table/TV console, and a working desk. Not sure if I am using my space widely or you guys see a different way to orient things.

1o2n6na,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1o2n6na/canada_border_crossing_no_housesitting_allowed/,"Canada border crossing - no housesitting allowed - thanks, TrustedHousesitters for setting us up","So we love TrustedHousesitters and have had great experiences with it for years, until now. 

First, we had a 6-month sit in the US (we are American) starting this month, and they canceled a few weeks in advance for health reasons (ongoing issues, that they were aware of but had not mentioned, maybe because they were being optimistic, or maybe because they genuinely didn't know what it might interfere with the trip). We lost \~$1,000 on that one with flight changes and a non-refundable ski pass, plus a week of stress trying to figure out where to go (we were already on the road, 20h from “home”, with all our stuff packed in the car for a 3-month journey on the way to the sit). 

We felt incredibly fortunate to find another 6-month sit pretty quickly, this time in Canada. We spent another $1,500 or so re-arranging things, getting a few nights of hotels, and making our way to Canada. Again taking a couple days off work for travel. But when we got to the border, we were told Canada considers housesitting work, end of story. It doesn’t matter that it’s unpaid; it’s still an exchange of services. And it’s still taking jobs away from Canadians because they have housesitting businesses there. At least all of this is according to one agent… he presented it as fact for Canada, but when I called border control later, they would not give me a straight answer on whether housesitting is allowed. It’s up to each agent’s discretion. What’s weird is each agent disappears after you talk to them, like they’re going to consult the oracle, and then they come back and tell you The Decision as if they had nothing to do with it. Is it really the agent? What are they doing when they disappear? Just having a coffee and laughing about sticking it to the Americans? (I wouldn't blame them but making me have a complete meltdown does not hurt the big T in any way, and I don't share his views so why punish me? Would it have helped if I told them I didn't vote for him?)

So anyway after being turned away, we talked to the homeowners, made arrangements to pay rent (we have nowhere else to go and were looking at other places to rent… why not rent from the same people?), put together a lease, and tried again. The second agent seemed sorta onboard but went to go talk to the original agent. When he came back he had removed his name tag (??) and said no sorry too fishy — the first guy says you can’t come in. So we can’t stay at their house for free, and we also can’t pay them. Got it. This time when we pressed him, he started referencing the farm (there is no farm; she had goats at one time but does not anymore) and insisting that we’d be doing work. We said we wouldn’t be doing farm work… he said we would… ok fine they can make up anything they want about us. So I give up.

Now I have lost yet more work time (I work remotely, but I do actually need to actively work; I can’t spend all day just researching/trying to decide where we should go next and how to get a roof over my head) in addition to immense stress and yes, more money. How much will it cost us to get “home”? (Added wrinkle, we don’t technically have a home.) I have no idea. Probably another $1,500 - 2,000  at this point, depending on whether we start driving right away, or whether we stay here for the rest of the workweek so I can try to get caught up at work first.

The TH website says this is “extremely rare” but the border agent said they turn away one TH user every week, just at this one very small crossing. It’s not even in the list of the top 28 crossings, so if they get 1/week… is that hundreds per week across the whole Canadian border? Maybe that’s not fair though. Maybe it’s just one agent who works at this one crossing who likes to turn housesitters away. Or the magical person they consult in the building who likes to say no. Maybe housesitters go through busier crossings all the time, no problem.

Either way, be advised. 

To keep things in perspective, there are much, much worse situations in which a person could find themselves turned away. But still painful and wish we could’ve avoided it.  I guess the American border works the same way. I’m sure there’s a reason but gosh it would be nice if they could all just have an official policy so you don’t have to roll the dice.

I am also curious — how many people have successfully crossed the Canada border after being honest that they were there to housesit, and for how long?

1o2n6iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1o2n6iy/day_101_without_a_period_trying_to_get_pregnant/,Day 101 without a period.... trying to get pregnant August 2026,"I am 32 years old, 130lb, 5'4"", BMI \~23, was just diagnosed with PCOS after 10+ years of thinking I had it. I was a competitive gymnast growing up. I had my first period at 16 years old. From 16-20 I can't remember exactly how many periods I had, but I remember being verrrrrry irregular and at one point going 6 months without a period. At 20 years old I went to the OB-GYN for the first time. He prescribed birth control. I was on the pill from 20-28years old. At 28 years old I started having spotting while taking the ""hormone"" pills (not the sugar pills). Went to the OB-GYN, I switched to the Nuva Ring. While on the Nuva ring from 28-32 years old I would ""bleed"" (so light) maybe once every 4-6 months. I was told by the OB-GYN this was a ""benefit"" of the nuva ring and ""totally normal"". Also, notably, I used to be 50lb heavier. I started gaining weight in college and was 160-180lb 22-27 years old (gaining and losing the same 20lb with diets). In September 2019 I started losing weight (and maintaining) with diet only (WW) then in March 2020 added exercise. I now exercise every day. 

I am getting married in August of 2026 (at 33 years old) and would like to get pregnant ASAP after the wedding. Therefore I went off birth control in February 2025 to try to ""figure out"" my periods. About 3.5 weeks after taking out the nuva ring in Feb 2025 I had a period. Then 45 days after that I had period #2, then exactly 45 days after that I had period #3. That was July 1st. No period since. (101 days ago)

* August 2025: ultrasound confirming PCOS - started taking inositol first 
* September Labs: Testosterone 77.8 (all other labs 'normal' - hgba1c 5.5%, DHEA 253, fasting insulin 4.9)

Supplements I have been taking since August: 

* Wholesome Story Myo-Inositol & D-Chiro Inositol
* NAC
* Nordic Naturals Prenatal DHA, Unflavored - 180 Soft Gels - 830 mg Omega-3 + 400 IU Vitamin D3
* Qunol Mega Ubiquinol 100mg CoQ10

Other symptoms:

* Facial cystic acne: did 2 rounds of accutane -- 25 years old and 29 years old, acne is coming back AGAIN 
* Hair: mustache I have to shave or pluck, 2-3 chest hairs, 2-3 nipple hairs (all dark and long)
* Chin hairs - this is a new one as of LITERALLY last night, noticed 4 LONG chin hairs out of seemingly no where

Other things I'm doing:

* August 2025: 
   * Removed all the toxins and harsh chemicals from my house (harsh cleaners, fragrance, candles) and switched to Branch Basics
   * Water filter, only drink filtered water (was just drinking it right out of my sink before)
   * Cut down my caffeine from waaaaay too much to 1 cup of coffee a day
* 16 days ago: cut out gluten, dairy, sugar - eating only whole foods (Whole 30 diet)
   * 16 days without diet coke.... dying over here....

I am feeling very defeated, depressed, and infertile. I DID the thing, I LOST the weight and have been maintaining it for 5+ years! Why is this still happening to me??? I wanted to try to get a period back naturally (diet, exercise, cut the toxins, eat whole foods) but now I am desperate. Should I try metformin? spironolactone? GLP-1? Should I go back on birth control and then hope when I come off closer to my wedding my period will happen 3x again like it did earlier this year and then I will ovulate??? Should I find an IVF doctor? I have been spiraling since my diagnosis in August. Please help me get a period!",1,1760057898.0,PCOS,2,1.0,False
1o2n5z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1o2n5z7/free_parking_near_the_hollywood_walk_of_fame_a/,Free parking near the Hollywood Walk of Fame? a few tips,"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some tips on parking near the walk of fame since the garages can be ridiculously expensive. finding a truly free spot is tough but not impossible if you know where to look.  
  
honestly, your best bet for a genuinely free spot is to try the residential streets north of hollywood blvd. i've had some luck on fuller ave during the daytime. it's a bit of a walk, maybe 10-15 minutes depending on where you find a spot, but it's completely free and there are no meters. just make sure to read the signs carefully for any street cleaning restrictions or permit-only zones, cause they do exist and a ticket is way worse than paying for parking. the further you go from the main strip the better your chances are.  
  
if the free spots are all taken, which happens a lot, i've started using this app called prked. people rent out their driveways and garages right next to the hollywood walk of fame. it's way cheaper than the big commercial lots, especially if you're planning to be there for more than an hour or two. you can book a spot in advance which is nice so you're not stressing and circling around forever. it's a solid backup plan and saves a headache.  
  
some other cheap options are the metered spots on the side streets. they're usually free after 8 pm and on sundays, but always double-check the signs. during the day they can be okay for a quick visit but the time limits are strict. another classic trick is to park at the hollywood & highland center garage. if you go into one of the shops and buy something small, even just a coffee, they'll give you validation that makes the parking rate much lower for the first couple of hours.  
  
just be prepared for a bit of a hunt if you're set on free parking. it gets crazy busy, especially on weekends. avoid parking in any red zones or areas that look sketchy, it's not worth the risk of getting towed.  
  
hope this helps someone out. good luck finding a spot",1,1760057853.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False
