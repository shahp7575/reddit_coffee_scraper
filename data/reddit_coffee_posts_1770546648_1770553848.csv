1qz7m91,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz7m91,Digital Underground - Sex Packets (1990),"What’s good, Funkateers? I’m calling this Thirteen Days of ‘90s P. We won’t be rockin bells that go a-ding and a-dong, but a couple (literally, two) of y’all will recall the 51 Days of P-Funk I did like 6 weeks back. I had a good time so I’m back for more. Thirteen more. Chronological-ish.

In the 1990s, the Parliament-Funkadelic sound, the whole sub-genre, launched in all kinds of directions musically, lyrically, philosophically, technologically, all that. It would become a legacy thing with all kinds of unreleased shit dropping. It’d reboot with whole new albums rockin’ classic lineups. It would spin off jazz albums, New Jack, metal, hip hop. It would be sampled more or less legally and repurposed for a whole new brand of Funk. That’s what we’re about. Good? Let’s go.

Watch whatcha doin’. It’s 1990. We’re rhymin’ on the Funk. It’s Digital Underground and *Sex Packets* and the P will never be the same.

We’re talking samples now. In the liner notes for \*Sex Packets\* we got George and the Funk Mob given the credit and these tracks named: “Flashlight,” “Let’s Play House,” “Motor Booty Affair,” “Four Play,” “Dr. Funkenstein,” “Atomic Dog,” “Aqua Boogie,” “Pumpin’ It Up,” and “Bootzilla.”

It’s cool to go sample hunting on \*Sex Packets.\* We open with the classic that ya’ll know, “Humpty Dance,” the Parliament “Let’s Play House” sample throughout in the brass. I love the claps. Humpty’s voice and the backing vocals sort of fill stuff out. The P brings melody sneakily and the Digital Underground kids are on top of it. No doubt this is the iconic cut on the album. I won’t dwell on it.  It’s just the start anyhow.

“Rhymin’ on the Funk” is mostly Parliament’s “Flash Light.” A little bit “Pumpin’ It Up” by the All-Stars, too. It’s sparse though, man. The effects from “Pumpin” are louder than any groove. The riff is still there but it’s in and out. Distant in the verses. But when the break kicks in they’re throwing down a whole new way. And these cats dig the “Flashlight” groove. It’s everywhere. “Dowhatchyalike” is another one, but I like it for the “Atomic Dog” drums more. That electro-verging-on-New-Jack feels perfect with the vocal. When it draws out. It drives the track to my favorite thing in the world right now: \*This message has been brought to you by the makers of the way we swing…\* The cool is unmatched. \*Chase the cat!\* And the piano? Come on now… we’re off topic… aren’t we?

There’s plenty of other P, too. Let’s be quick with it: “Danger Zone” is “Flashlight” and “Bootzilla.” The strings are killer. “Sex Packets,” the title track, builds on the live cut of “Dr. Funkenstein” and tosses in some Prince riffs and \*DAMN\* the groove is thick now… that’s the one that sticks with me most to be honest. “Underwater Rime” leans heavily on the Herbie “Chameleon” sample but inside the “Aqua Boogie” beat. Super dope. Very smooth.

Plus, there’s plenty here that doesn’t stick solely to the P and still kills. “Gutfest ‘89” samples Ray Charles. “New Jazz” is entirely a Run DMC sample from what I can tell and it breaks up the album especially nicely. A little grittier. “The Way We Swing” too. That’s leading with the Jimi Hendrix sample, grittier, and the duo vocal they put on top makes more of that NYC 80s sound. Boom. You rhyme like a school teacha. These dudes are more than Sons of the P now. Right? Is this “P” because they use P samples or because they sample wild shit? \*They don’t know - they don’t know - they don’t know what I know.\*

Best proceed with an open mind now.

Anyway. The 90s P is upon us and it’s gonna come in all kinds of unexpected ways. Sometimes is chopped and screwed by someone else. Sometimes it’s straight right out of the Cosmic Slop. Sometimes it’s fuckin’ reggae. Or is that a werewolf? So. Until then, you deep sea gangstas and underwater prankstas. It’s gonna be a weird two weeks. Cool as shit. But weird.

What’s next? Is that your favorite song, darlin’? You gonna rock it all night long, darlin’?",2,1770553495.0,funk,0,1.0,False

Instagram is newly created [u/sugarandsweet28](https://www.reddit.com/user/sugarandsweet28/), and Snapchat sugarandsweet28  
  
I am looking for a legit sugar daddy. I'm not interested if you're not willing to show me how you look, hear your voice, and send pictures back. I want a real connection and arrangement. Need someone who can handle me. I have a witty mouth. Like to banter, but if it's disrespectful and degrading, move along, it's an instant mood killer for me - dirty talking is fine boundries will be discussed.  
  
I'm cautious of scammers and first want to connect and have normal conversations to see if I like you. Yep, you heard right. How dare a sugar baby make demands? This is the first time ""selling"" myself. I'm a corporate tycoon myself, just in a tough spot at the moment, but I won't need to be reliant on your finances forever. Getting to know you is a must for the arrangement before any sexual content is sent, a clear arrangement and boundaries prior.  
  
You need to be a friend with benefits, someone I like, because like I said. I would like it to turn into an emotional connection once I no longer need your money. To meet in-person only after I'm certain I won't become a murder doc or something along those lines. Wanting to connect, have fun, and just be free. I'm very careful and suspicious of scams. So if you are one don't even bother you won't get far because I know what I'm looking for - I'm a slut with standards and no amount of money will make me settle.  
Also needs to be a Dom. As you can see, I have a mouth and attitude on me that someone needs to dominate, and I'm cheeky about it too, which will give you some fight. If you're not a scam looking for something long term send me a message. Only looking for one exclusive sugar daddy. I'm also not interested in being with someone who likes to be dominated. I like to be dominated so respectfully stay away from my dms, money won't change my mind don't even try it. I basically need a friend who can enjoy my kinks and fantasies with.  
  
I am assertive and want you to prove to me why you should be my one and only sugar daddy. Tip my long message is an indication of how I like to talk. If you don't know how to keep a conversation flowing or too short with replies you can also consider yourself disqualified. Applications are open😉 only one spot. I'm a white female  
I'm a married 28 year old woman. Extremely new to this. I do have a story that I'll share with you.  
  
I'm interested in an online dynamic only. It can be as sexual as we want. I don't mind in person meetups as long as I know I'm safe.  
  
However in-person meetups - I prefer to only be platonic. We can flirt but no crossing the actual boundary. I want to be able to have fun, laugh enjoy the moment with someone who can banter, tease, compliment.  
  
Someone who enjoy a blooming sunflower girl whose eyes lid up when they see the little things in life. Whether it's a small butterfly or tasty coffee. Someone who can get lost staring at me being gleefully happy in the moment.  
  
No hubby doesn't know I'm here. I'm looking for someone who will also have normal convos with me - a balance.  
  
To make me laugh, blush and enjoy each other's company. I'm very picky and very careful. But once I have that solid foundation with someone I want it to be natural fun and safe.  
  
Emotionally and physically. If you're someone who degrades move along. I don't mind banter and dirty talk but I won't take the arrangement lightly as it's a big leap for me. It's my first time doing this. I'm cautious of suspicious requests. I need real and legit. And if I'm comfortable I'll let go with you online. And you'll see another side other that sweet and innocent.",1,1770553491.0,u_Sugar_and_Sweet,0,1.0,False
1qz7m4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qz7m4w/other_half_to_your_heart/,Other Half To Your Heart,"You held your index and middle finger out in a heart-shape towards me. I looked at you with suspicion for a split second, as I was unsure of your intention in doing so. *Ultimately, I obliged and matched your fingers with mine*. We are always so silly honestly, I love us (*you*) so much.

There was not much significance in this action but I hope this confirms for you that you will always be *the other half to my heart no matter what, my child*. I just want to pour my soul into you so badly at times but I don’t want to mess up our progress after we’ve come so far. 

I guess I should just be content that you hold such strong platonic love for me, right? I really do cherish every moment and memory we make together but you know I want more from you. I was even thinking of surprising you with a box of chocolates next weekend honestly as chocolate is the one thing I know you love more than myself lol. I would personally buy you some baby food too but only if I get to spoon-feed to you lol (*you’re so strange and I love it so much*). 

Things were going so well too but then you randomly brought up your ex to me just to rain on my parade (*thanks for that btw*). Maybe you were trying to express that you were feeling lonely in that moment but there’s other ways to convey that personally. You’ve broken my heart hundreds of times now and I will probably let you break it a hundred times more because I crave you like an addict craves their drugs sadly. 

*Yet you are probably the only thing I crave in the mornings more than my coffee if you hadn’t realized it yet*. Without you two, I feel like I am a hopeless wreck as you can tell. I need you to guide me so that I can be the best version of myself for you. So I can be someone worthy of claiming. *I really do want to be that someone you fantasize about when you are feeling lonely*. I know I was that person for you in the past and now we finally have a fresh start to try again so please don’t waste it being afraid. 

*Being your’s is all I want to be at the end of the day, beautiful*. For all intents and purposes, I already am but I don’t know how to express that to you without risking our relationship. I will continue to wait patiently for you in the meantime as you have given me no choice. *I just hope and pray you will match the other half to my heart when I hold it out to you the next time*…

Take care for now, my human squishy ball. I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing you next week no matter what happens. *I’ll be okay as long as I am blessed to see your beautiful face and shining smile*…

Love,

1qz7lsw,https://i.redd.it/xlz8cpyfk9ig1.jpeg,Effort Is Invisible Until Results Appear,"I’ve been there, sitting in a tiny room, staring at a slow laptop, cold coffee piling up like sad trophies, tabs multiplying like a virus, grinding on a project nobody seemed to notice. Months of late nights, revisions, failed prototypes, and yet, nothing. Meanwhile, social media is full of wins: diploma selfies, business launches, viral posts. And I mutter, “Is all this work invisible or am I just cursed?”

The world worships results. The final product gets applause. But the 3 a.m. edits, the hours of practice, the days you dragged yourself out of bed when you wanted to quit? Invisible. Effort stays hidden.

Think about it. The student who studies every night while friends party gets called “lucky” when they top the exam. The entrepreneur surviving on instant noodles while “overnight successes” get the hype. The musician practicing scales in the dark. The parent working double shifts so kids can have opportunities. Talent? Often just invisible effort finally showing up.

I’ve been that person, doubting every step, envying quick wins, almost quitting countless times. The invisible phase is soul-crushing. But that grind is doing its work quietly, like roots underground. Most people quit right before the breakthrough. That’s why success seems “instant” for some, it isn’t.

Effort compounds silently. The bloom, the diploma, the launch, the skill, comes later. Showing up when nobody sees you is the real test. When results appear, they’ll be yours, earned the hard way. The world will call it luck. You’ll know better. You’ll remember the nights of doubt, the failed attempts, the silent persistence, and quietly think, “It was worth it.”

The grind is frustrating. You’ll want to quit. You’ll scroll past highlight reels and wonder if it matters. But invisible effort is the real flex. Show up consistently, especially when no one’s watching. One day, the results will show up too. And when they do, you’ll smile, knowing the real win was refusing to stop.",1,1770553454.0,u_yeshuaxrpl,0,1.0,False

1qz7kvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarAnomalies/comments/1qz7kvm/why_my_morning_coffee_obsession_led_to_solar/,Why my morning coffee obsession led to solar panels,"Camping always meant going without real coffee, and I’d accepted that as part of the deal. Instant coffee or nothing, those were the options. Then my nephew showed up at our family camping trip with this weird contraption that looked like it belonged in a sci fi movie. It was a solar kettle. He set up these reflective panels, filled the container with water, and twenty minutes later we had boiling water for proper coffee. No fuel, no electricity, just sunlight. I was more fascinated by the device than the coffee, honestly.

Back home, I fell down this research rabbit hole about solar thermal technology. The basic physics was straightforward, but the practical engineering was clever. Reflective surfaces concentrated sun energy onto a small area, dramatically increasing temperatures. Performance depended on weather and sun angle, but for the right conditions, these things were legitimately useful.

The applications went way beyond camping convenience too. Developing regions without
reliable electricity could benefit hugely. Emergency preparedness kits could include these for disaster situations. The more I learned, the more possibilities I saw.

I started comparing different models, efficiency ratings, portability features. Some folded flat for
easy transport, others prioritized heating speed. The price range was all over the place. Found
options on Alibaba from budget to premium.

My nephew thought it was hilarious that I’d gotten so into this. What started as curiosity about his camping gadget turned into genuine interest in renewable energy applications. Now I’m that
person at parties talking about solar technology.",1,1770553374.0,SolarAnomalies,0,1.0,False

1qz7jee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qz7jee/partner_fucking_sucks/,Partner fucking sucks,"The share of housework I do is insanely disproportionate. We both work full time. In the morning I  give our child breakfast, make sure he gets dressed, and take him to kinder. She never does any of this except on her days off which is once every fortnight.  Even on her days off she will just give him breakfast and dress him and often I will drop him off because she does not like doing the drop off. In the evening it is typical that I pick up our child, cook dinner, do the dishes, give our child a bath, read him books, and put him to bed. This is at least 60% of nights. The only one of these things that she ever does is cook dinner and when she does cook dinner I am still doing absolutely everything else. Between these tasks I am usually playing with our son, taking him to the park, putting away millions of toys, vacuuming, mopping, doing laundry, mowing the grass, generally tidying up, or maybe getting some things from a supermarket. My partner never, ever, does any of these things except for occasionally washing her, and our son's, clothes. She just sits on the fucking couch watching Tiktok vidoes and shopping. She insists on washing our son's clothes but more than once when I went to dress our son he had no clean clothes so then when I noticed his clothes needing washing I would ask her if I could wash them but this seemed to piss her off so now I just secretly wash his clothes.

She never learnt to clean up after herself. In the evening she often eats chips and gets crumbs on and around the couch and never cleans this up. Leaves empty shampoo and conditioner bottles in the shower, leaves shit in our cars. Speaks while she has food in her mouth. when she is sick she just sticks tissues in her nose and leaves them there. Eventually the tissues fall out on the bed or the couch and she just fucking leaves them there. If she finishes a toilet roll she just fucking leaves in the bathroom, if she uses a glass she just leaves it lying around. IF she does take the glass to the kitchen she leaves it in the sink instead of putting it in the dishwasher. If she does put it in the dishwasher it seems to only ever be when the dishes in the dishwasher are clean. I told her off for this once because me putting her dirty dishes in the dishwasher only for her to redirty them by pouring coffee all over them when she puts her coffee cup in the dishwasher before leaving me to deal with her dirty dishes for a second fucking time is beyond the fucking pale. She responded by saying that I am grumpy and she threatened to take our son to her parents' place the fucking bitch.

It is always like this. Whenever I have become annoyed enough to point that she has left her mess for me to clean up she has never, ever, taken responsibility for it and to her I am always being unreasonable.

On weekends I never have time to myself because she does not like driving so she is almost incapable of leaving the house without me. Like, if she wants to take our son to​ her parents', or her sister's, house, both of whom live over an hour away, she would often remind me the she does not like driving and seemingly try to guilt me in to driving her and our son to her parents' or her sister's house. She does not come with me when I take my son to see my family. I think she noticed me resisting the need to see her family so it seems like now every time she sees her family it is associated with some event like going to the zoo, or the aquarium, or the museum, or legloland, or a theme park, or one of millions of other things. Now when I say ""I might stay home to months learns/wash the cars/clean the garage/fix something that is broken/whatever else"" she says some shit about it being a family outing and tries to guilt me in to going them. Making absolutely every catch up with her family some event like this also churns through money.

Obviously I should leave her but the leaving when we share a house and child is extremely daunting.

Before we had a kid I barely noticed how she does not tidy up after herself and when I did notice it it was not a problem because I was nowhere near as time poor as I was after having a child.",1,1770553243.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1qz7bhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1qz7bhd/picked_up_some_decaf_and_caffeine_pills_here_we_go/,Picked up some decaf and caffeine pills... Here we go,"I've been lurking here for a while. I've been wanting to try to stop consuming caffeine; though, I absolutely love drinking coffee. I appreciate that some of the people in here have a tolerance for decaffeinated coffee. I will start there and give it some time. I got some expresso blend dark roast decaf coffee. I really love dark/bold coffee, so needed something that would be similar to get started. 

The caffeine pills are to avoid the withdrawal as much as I can and to reduce my caffeine intake over time. I'm not in a rush to quit, but I also do not want to drag my feet. My plan is to be caffeine free (other than decaf) by March, if not sooner. I think that I've been consuming 300-400 mg most days recently. Today I will have 150 mg and work my way down from there. 

Life is funny. As an addict of the full blown kind, I would have never thought that I'd be quitting caffeine. I haven't drank alcohol in over 3 years, I quit cannabis 2 months ago, I'm tapering down nicotine using lozenges, and now working caffeine down to a minimal amount (whatever trace amounts are in decaf). I am hoping that this will go hand-in-hand with quitting nicotine. I have definitely noticed that the more caffeine I have, the more nicotine I want; which is one of the reasons I want to quit.

The others are:

* I would like to see what this calm and collected person is like that people seem to say they have discovered by quitting caffeine. 
* I am 6 months 40 now and  would like to know if my joints will quit hurting as much by quitting caffeine (this one would be great - I can't find much research supporting it, but have read anecdotes in here about it) because I love playing sports and hiking and I've been getting pretty bummed out lately for how many joint issues have been popping up
* I've had trouble sleeping since I was a kid and for some reason I have never thought about whether it was due to caffeine (unless I consumed more than usual in a day), because my sweet mom would make me coffee for while I waited in the cold for the school bus. Plus I would get into cola's and whatnot whenever possible. 
* I wonder if I really suffer from ADHD or if it's the caffeine. For years I have had to fight this to do well in school and at work. I am in the last semester of another degree and hope to discover that it's easier to get my things done. I've always thought a lot of coffee was helpful, but I've been practicing awareness after my coffee consumption and realize that I'm more prone to being distracted and going off to do other things leaving my work ""for later"" only to come back to it stressed out that it's not finished. I want to stop procrastinating on my things as much
* A big one, and my last, is that I really hope it will make me feel a little more social and able to appreciate deeper conversations. I love studying and learning, but too much caffeine makes me put that off - I'm genuinely curious as to if I will want to be more social with those around me or find it easier to do. 



I guess my only real worry is that I won't feel like superman as often. It's pretty nice drinking coffee and going on a 5 mile run or playing sports or cleaning my place. Alright, that's enough from me. Thanks!

I’m planning on opening a high quality coffee place and I have read some good books on business and systems (E-Myth, Profit First, Psychology of money, the art of spending money and all these nice ones). Most mention that marketing is a big part of a business’s success, which is undoubtedly true. Some of them mention colors, like navy blue, or logo shapes like circles or crosses and so on.

I found that very interesting and was looking for some books that offer this practical knowledge.  I have read “Influence” by Cialdini and although it was interesting, it was a tad too generic for me and too long to prove a simple point every time.

I've never fasted before, and don't have a particular spiritual or health reason to do so. I save about 60 minutes per day I don't eat, and I feel like fasting spills over to better impulse control in general, and that's enough for me.

I struggle with sleep, so I prefer to consume minimal/no caffeine. On Sundays, I make this sort of tea:

* 200g water + 4 grams licorice root
* 250g water + 8 grams of cassia seed
* Boil / stoop separately, then mix to taste

It resembles the taste of coffee, but has zero caffeine. Too much licorice causes blood pressure/heart problems, so I limit it to Sundays. After a bit of reading, I found that the sweetness of licorice root may also be enough to stimulate an insulin response, and thus nullify the autophagy-related benefits of fasting.

I'm fine with just drinking water on the weekends, so if a cup of such tea in the morning would cause me to potentially lose out on something, I guess I'd prefer to just stick with water... but I do like my tea, and I appreciate the routine of brewing it first thing in the morning. It'd also be nice to keep. 

Could anyone give me a bit more information about this, or point me to further reading, so I can make a decision? Alternatively, is there any way I can measure/eyeball this—just to the extent of ""insulin has indeed spiked""—short of using a CGM?

1qz74ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusDrivers/comments/1qz74ol/i_saved_everyone_on_a_bus_by_flirting/,I Saved Everyone On A Bus By Flirting,"I woke up in a psychiatric hospital, with no recollection of what happened. They said I punched and slapped my father but all I could remember was this beating pain from the right of my skull. The frontal lobe most likely had been disturbed for the time being, but they wanted to keep me there just as they keep all their patients for monetary gain, $2500 per person, and as they used me and my health as a sponsor to gain more patients and notoriety, they used my family as leverage noticing that they were the ones that weren't sure about what happened, nor wanted me to come home. As I stood staring into the abyss, the hard glass bolted against the metal embroidering of a so-called room, where the walls always felt like they were closing in, as the light from the hallway ceased to ever beam away because the only rule was to keep our doors open. Those lights never turned off, even at night, just so there was access for whomever was doing the nightshift to check up on us 10-15 minutes as we slept to make sure we were asleep. I had a roommate that always talked on the phone, trying to reach out to a girl that he was in love with, and knowing how desperate he wanted to be with her, I held onto that memory of him constantly on the phone; cause everyone could hear it. I overheard him talking about how he'll be out soon and how he wanted to have a baby with her. He told me how his family wanted him out soon as well. All this and more. But he most importantly told me that they only want you to say things that they would like to hear. Those who control you and know that you're not supposed to be where you are, would still do anything to ignore you in order to prove they are right and to humiliate you into believing you are wrong, either by giving you drugs that aren't meant for you and/or either through blame. That being said, I was the only one in the psychiatric hospital that was self-aware and not a danger to others, nor myself. I highly doubt that a quarter of the people there were a danger because I know I was put there because they thought I hurt my Dad, but as the days went by and as night just felt like dusk, darker and darker, like looking into eyes that lack color; getting lost in their pupils of misdirection, only to finally be out of the hospital after winning the hearing. The doctor was trying to use my family as leverage, especially my mom, convincing her that I should stay at the hospital for longer, giving me a paper stating that I wasn't a harm to myself nor others by crossing off both options #1 and #2, but leaving #3 circled; the only thing that they could claim: disabled/not being able to provide for myself (neither one being true-all three being lies on a piece of paper). This is why I won the hearing and managed to be discharged from the psychiatric hospital. But somehow word got around, probably because I went to the shelter and slept there for just one night, and I kept being followed as if everyone knew I was leaving to LA. So much so that the entire city was doing all they could to stop me from leaving, especially when I was already discharged and was looking everywhere for a spot to load my cash into my card; it was nearly impossible because everyone was following me, juicing the battery from my phone, using AI and other methods to communicate through their group chats and hypocritical narrative actor walking around ""trading futures,"" one would say. I left the shelter I was at because I was already free and discharged, meaning that I could finally live my normal life, whatever ""normal"" is after the damage had been done by those at the facility taking away my time, sleep, and my daily diet, being reduced to a patient when I always felt like I knew the problems of people more than they could ever imagine. I managed to get a ticket to LA but for some reason the bus driver just didn't want to get my luggage from the bus when I got there. She wanted me to crawl inside the bus and get my own bag from the other side of the door that could be opened. When she opened the luggage door, she said ""Go get your bag."" I told her ""Isn't it your job?"" Then she said, ""Okay fine,"" closed the luggage door, ""I'll go to the other side and open the other door,"" and as we both walked to the other side, I said, ""Is everything okay?"" She responded with ""Just get your bag."" I got my bag and said ""Thank you, have a good night."" Then she kept staring at me, as if she just hated me for no reason at all, that glare just looked into my soul as if she just wanted me gone for no reason. I stood there just to show her that I wasn't going to be disrespected like that, so I waited, and she said, ""Get away from my bus,"" when I was literally not even close to the bus, just toward the side, not even close to where she was getting on. She proceeded to say, ""There are cameras everywhere and we both know that the police will be here."" I had no idea what she was talking about and I wasn't going to think about the psychiatric hospital I was discharged from, because I was already free and back into the real world because I won the hearing; there was clearly no issue upon me nor was there anything wrong with me. I walked around as if I wanted to just sit down and reflect on how she treated me, driving reckless, making me feel uncomfortable, almost as if she was timing the breaks and turns of the bus messing with my sleep, posture, and health on the bus, and there was this one time where I got up, maneuvered to the restroom where she would deliberately pull on the breaks and my phone in my pocket slammed into the side door of the restroom in the bus, almost having me bust a rib. That being said, when we arrived, there was no reason for her to not get my bag and continue to treat me that way as if the other side had no door to open when in reality the bus had two doors, only having her mention it in the end, and even then she still refused to get my bag. This is where the story begins. I arrived into LA and this bus driver called the police on me. So that was when something clicked in my brain: if the world is f\*cking with you repeatedly, might as well troll them back by framing the spectacle. They sent helicopters, the entire cavalry, looking for me as if I am a harm to society when I am just on vacation. I stayed there, looking at helicopters and every kind of cop car impaginable, as the police drove by, and create a whole scene, yet no one was able to speak to me and ask my side because even they knew this was a waste of time. Maybe they started looking for someone else, but I kept it cool and waited till the commotion was over, so much so that I donated my clothes to a homeless man, giving him my entire music catalogue (CD's), cards, collectibles, an Xbox 360, and my headphones/speaker. I gave him all the clothes in my luggage and everything else, leaving me with just the clothes I was wearing and my journals, documents, and my two phones. I kept everything that I could because I didn't want to make a whole scene because I wasn't sure whether the cops were looking for me or someone else. I felt like I was Venom, or at least, a Symbiote Spidey (Symbiote Spider-Man). I left Union Station, walking around as if I was homeless, stumbling with barely enough energy because I felt like I was drained by the insects that would suck my blood from the dirt where I was hiding. The security showed up, they asked me if I was okay, but I was so illiterate, playing the part, and walked passed them, crossing the street, and even then, a truck tried running me over, barely missing me by an inch. The homeless people on the other side told me that it was like a movie. I walked around LA, made friends, got high, drank some amazing coffee, had a spiritual awakening with God, and sat by Echo Park, feeling like it wasn't LA, it was just a version of it that reminded me too much of the hard times back home, especially when I went to the Target store to grocery shop only to spend more money than I should. The only thing that kept me from staying there was when I failed to get a battery pack from Target when it was for USB-C not iPhone. I was too focused on the bags I brought in, worrying I would be robbed and I won't have nothing to take back home, so I forgot to check what the employee was bringing from the other side of the locked door. But still, I had an Amazon gift card, $100 worth, same as my Target gift card. But where could I even use an Amazon gift card? Think about it? Either way, not all was lost. I ended up finding a spot to sit down and drink coffee, and I had a spiritually awakening with God, a feeling that was like realizing everything all at once, and transcending: we talked about nostalgia, amnesia, and deja vu. Like how all three things were related but not the same. How we forget just to remember again. That being said, the guy at Target who gave me the wrong battery-pack could care less but I found God through his mistake, because how he forgot something, it made me remember something, when I spoke to a new friend, and in the end, I gave him that battery-pack, perfect his phone. Almost like a symbiotic gesture, and think about it, before I was just laying in the dirt, bugs and leeches eating away at my skin, layering in, and then I brush them off, carrying whatever I had left, then finding God off someone making a mistake with my grocery list at Target. Funny. But that's not the most interesting thing about this story, and the man I spoke to would say the same thing, cause he'd probably forget too. When I called my Mom, she said she was okay with me coming home, and that I wouldn't have to stay at a shelter anymore, the shelter that was in San Jose, you know, the one that I was at for a night, and then left to LA. My Dad was okay with me coming back home. He bought the ticket from LA Union Station to San Jose Diridion. It was a ""bus ticket,"" so f\*ck Amazon's Audible, because they didn't even listen, yet made an ad the next day of what I'm about to tell you, but that may be the joke, nobody listens to the details, not even the prettiest of women, cause they see things too quickly, passed the naked eye, flower pedals tearing apart from a flower by the wind, and they won't know the withering of heights, because they are too busy and excited being busy with what they know is not true nor right, cause the wind is all that swept them away from a flower from a distance to never second guess what's in front of them, only to forget what's tearing apart. Anyways, and anyhow, I got on the bus, and yes, it was the same bus driver that dropped me off at Union Station in LA. She was picking me up this time, and she asked for my name, and let me on. Somewhere throughout the ride she kept saying ""Sorry"" to people. Here and there, through announcements, and I knew she was trying to say it to me somehow, but all I could think about was me going back home, in one piece. We arrived somewhere, I believe it was a college/university. A girl got on the bus with a suspicious bag. It was way too big. I thought the girl's ""passenger princess,"" or the person sitting next to her on the bus, got up and went to the restroom, because she buckled the bag, a heavy bag, but there was like no reason to buckle it, but that's beside the point. I needed to go to the restroom real badly, so I thought, why not, let me strike up a conversation, and just like that, knowing damn well how to talk to a lady, I saved everyone on that bus cause I overheard someone mentioning that she actually brought a bomb. I swear to God, after I flirted with her, she got up, went to the restroom, came back. That's it. Then I thought to myself, ""Wait, where was that person sitting next to her."" Turns out! There was no one else! But her! It's just that bag being big as hell buckled like she didn't want it to go anywhere. To lighten the mood, one of the guys gave me a WAX pen to smoke, and I puffed that sh\*t! Smoked it like I wanted to get so high, that I forgot to blow the smoke, I engulfed it like Godzilla. I got dropped off at San Jose Diridion Station, feeling like Spider-Man, but even more so, like Symbiote Spidey. I was so high that I couldn't even choose or talk to any of the hot girls that were walking around: hugging, kissing, and just being the most obnoxious, yet so beautiful and sexy as hell. I felt like that guy, who made a touchdown that was the most skinniest among the entire team. I actually felt like a man. But I didn't want to make it about me. So I slept, waited for my ride, sat outside and then went back inside the station, eating poptarts, and then playing chess on my Macbook. Like, did you know? They got chess on a Macbook? And guess who taught me chess, one of my friends at the psychiatric hospital. When there was no one to talk to, nothing else to do when my phone kept dying on me, I played chess just like I framed the spectacle, by turning the tables when everyone was looking at me as something I'm not, only to prove to the world that I'm the hero they've been waiting on. But honestly, I was just trying to get the girl's number. The real hero was my friend at the psychiatric hospital, talking to his girl every day and night, over the phone, and yes, he called me a ""p\*ssy,"" but imagine how he would feel, knowing that I went to LA, didn't have them create a false narrative against me how they try to do to everyone with sane minds just to be kept from the free world, how I was smart with every move I made, talked to a girl at the back of the bus, saving all the passengers, and not realizing it until overhearing it from someone that she had brought a bomb. I dedicate this to everyone that feels like they aren't that confident to talk to girls or that they feel they are insecure, but maybe, just maybe, you'll be too ridiculous for her to even want to stay long enough to hear you say anything at all, even when it comes to her bag. So yea, maybe being yourself just might save the world some day, maybe even yourself, and maybe even others.",2,1770551938.0,BusDrivers,2,1.0,False

35M looking to make some new friends. Like a lot of people, a few friendships have drifted over the years due to life, work etc. and I’d like to build some new, genuine connections.

I’m based between the North West and West Midlands and ideally would love to meet people locally, but I’m also happy to travel a bit if needed. Somewhat around my age would be good, but I'm cool as long as 18+ as the connection is more important!

I'd describe myself as easy going, a little introverted, and can be a bit shy to start with, but soon open up once I’m comfortable. Ideally, I’d like to start by chatting online and, if we get on, meet up in real life. I’m looking for something long-term and a genuine mate or two.

Into hiking, nature, and getting outdoors. Also enjoy watching the F1, reading, history, and cooking. Like travelling, exploring new places, and learning languages too.

Would be happy to just chat, meet for a drink or coffee, explore somewhere new, do a hike together... Up for different plans!

If you're looking for something similar and are interested, feel free to message me!

Cheers",1,1770551454.0,UkFriends,0,1.0,False

1qz6y7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flirting/comments/1qz6y7p/i_saved_everyone_on_a_bus_by_flirting/,I Saved Everyone On A Bus By Flirting,"I woke up in a psychiatric hospital, with no recollection of what happened. They said I punched and slapped my father but all I could remember was this beating pain from the right of my skull. The frontal lobe most likely had been disturbed for the time being, but they wanted to keep me there just as they keep all their patients for monetary gain, $2500 per person, and as they used me and my health as a sponsor to gain more patients and notoriety, they used my family as leverage noticing that they were the ones that weren't sure about what happened, nor wanted me to come home. As I stood staring into the abyss, the hard glass bolted against the metal embroidering of a so-called room, where the walls always felt like they were closing in, as the light from the hallway ceased to ever beam away because the only rule was to keep our doors open. Those lights never turned off, even at night, just so there was access for whomever was doing the nightshift to check up on us 10-15 minutes as we slept to make sure we were asleep. I had a roommate that always talked on the phone, trying to reach out to a girl that he was in love with, and knowing how desperate he wanted to be with her, I held onto that memory of him constantly on the phone; cause everyone could hear it. I overheard him talking about how he'll be out soon and how he wanted to have a baby with her. He told me how his family wanted him out soon as well. All this and more. But he most importantly told me that they only want you to say things that they would like to hear. Those who control you and know that you're not supposed to be where you are, would still do anything to ignore you in order to prove they are right and to humiliate you into believing you are wrong, either by giving you drugs that aren't meant for you and/or either through blame. That being said, I was the only one in the psychiatric hospital that was self-aware and not a danger to others, nor myself. I highly doubt that a quarter of the people there were a danger because I know I was put there because they thought I hurt my Dad, but as the days went by and as night just felt like dusk, darker and darker, like looking into eyes that lack color; getting lost in their pupils of misdirection, only to finally be out of the hospital after winning the hearing. The doctor was trying to use my family as leverage, especially my mom, convincing her that I should stay at the hospital for longer, giving me a paper stating that I wasn't a harm to myself nor others by crossing off both options #1 and #2, but leaving #3 circled; the only thing that they could claim: disabled/not being able to provide for myself (neither one being true-all three being lies on a piece of paper). This is why I won the hearing and managed to be discharged from the psychiatric hospital. But somehow word got around, probably because I went to the shelter and slept there for just one night, and I kept being followed as if everyone knew I was leaving to LA. So much so that the entire city was doing all they could to stop me from leaving, especially when I was already discharged and was looking everywhere for a spot to load my cash into my card; it was nearly impossible because everyone was following me, juicing the battery from my phone, using AI and other methods to communicate through their group chats and hypocritical narrative actor walking around ""trading futures,"" one would say. I left the shelter I was at because I was already free and discharged, meaning that I could finally live my normal life, whatever ""normal"" is after the damage had been done by those at the facility taking away my time, sleep, and my daily diet, being reduced to a patient when I always felt like I knew the problems of people more than they could ever imagine. I managed to get a ticket to LA but for some reason the bus driver just didn't want to get my luggage from the bus when I got there. She wanted me to crawl inside the bus and get my own bag from the other side of the door that could be opened. When she opened the luggage door, she said ""Go get your bag."" I told her ""Isn't it your job?"" Then she said, ""Okay fine,"" closed the luggage door, ""I'll go to the other side and open the other door,"" and as we both walked to the other side, I said, ""Is everything okay?"" She responded with ""Just get your bag."" I got my bag and said ""Thank you, have a good night."" Then she kept staring at me, as if she just hated me for no reason at all, that glare just looked into my soul as if she just wanted me gone for no reason. I stood there just to show her that I wasn't going to be disrespected like that, so I waited, and she said, ""Get away from my bus,"" when I was literally not even close to the bus, just toward the side, not even close to where she was getting on. She proceeded to say, ""There are cameras everywhere and we both know that the police will be here."" I had no idea what she was talking about and I wasn't going to think about the psychiatric hospital I was discharged from, because I was already free and back into the real world because I won the hearing; there was clearly no issue upon me nor was there anything wrong with me. I walked around as if I wanted to just sit down and reflect on how she treated me, driving reckless, making me feel uncomfortable, almost as if she was timing the breaks and turns of the bus messing with my sleep, posture, and health on the bus, and there was this one time where I got up, maneuvered to the restroom where she would deliberately pull on the breaks and my phone in my pocket slammed into the side door of the restroom in the bus, almost having me bust a rib. That being said, when we arrived, there was no reason for her to not get my bag and continue to treat me that way as if the other side had no door to open when in reality the bus had two doors, only having her mention it in the end, and even then she still refused to get my bag. This is where the story begins. I arrived into LA and this bus driver called the police on me. So that was when something clicked in my brain: if the world is f\*cking with you repeatedly, might as well troll them back by framing the spectacle. They sent helicopters, the entire cavalry, looking for me as if I am a harm to society when I am just on vacation. I stayed there, looking at helicopters and every kind of cop car impaginable, as the police drove by, and create a whole scene, yet no one was able to speak to me and ask my side because even they knew this was a waste of time. Maybe they started looking for someone else, but I kept it cool and waited till the commotion was over, so much so that I donated my clothes to a homeless man, giving him my entire music catalogue (CD's), cards, collectibles, an Xbox 360, and my headphones/speaker. I gave him all the clothes in my luggage and everything else, leaving me with just the clothes I was wearing and my journals, documents, and my two phones. I kept everything that I could because I didn't want to make a whole scene because I wasn't sure whether the cops were looking for me or someone else. I felt like I was Venom, or at least, a Symbiote Spidey (Symbiote Spider-Man). I left Union Station, walking around as if I was homeless, stumbling with barely enough energy because I felt like I was drained by the insects that would suck my blood from the dirt where I was hiding. The security showed up, they asked me if I was okay, but I was so illiterate, playing the part, and walked passed them, crossing the street, and even then, a truck tried running me over, barely missing me by an inch. The homeless people on the other side told me that it was like a movie. I walked around LA, made friends, got high, drank some amazing coffee, had a spiritual awakening with God, and sat by Echo Park, feeling like it wasn't LA, it was just a version of it that reminded me too much of the hard times back home, especially when I went to the Target store to grocery shop only to spend more money than I should. The only thing that kept me from staying there was when I failed to get a battery pack from Target when it was for USB-C not iPhone. I was too focused on the bags I brought in, worrying I would be robbed and I won't have nothing to take back home, so I forgot to check what the employee was bringing from the other side of the locked door. But still, I had an Amazon gift card, $100 worth, same as my Target gift card. But where could I even use an Amazon gift card? Think about it? Either way, not all was lost. I ended up finding a spot to sit down and drink coffee, and I had a spiritually awakening with God, a feeling that was like realizing everything all at once, and transcending: we talked about nostalgia, amnesia, and deja vu. Like how all three things were related but not the same. How we forget just to remember again. That being said, the guy at Target who gave me the wrong battery-pack could care less but I found God through his mistake, because how he forgot something, it made me remember something, when I spoke to a new friend, and in the end, I gave him that battery-pack, perfect his phone. Almost like a symbiotic gesture, and think about it, before I was just laying in the dirt, bugs and leeches eating away at my skin, layering in, and then I brush them off, carrying whatever I had left, then finding God off someone making a mistake with my grocery list at Target. Funny. But that's not the most interesting thing about this story, and the man I spoke to would say the same thing, cause he'd probably forget too. When I called my Mom, she said she was okay with me coming home, and that I wouldn't have to stay at a shelter anymore, the shelter that was in San Jose, you know, the one that I was at for a night, and then left to LA. My Dad was okay with me coming back home. He bought the ticket from LA Union Station to San Jose Diridion. It was a ""bus ticket,"" so f\*ck Amazon's Audible, because they didn't even listen, yet made an ad the next day of what I'm about to tell you, but that may be the joke, nobody listens to the details, not even the prettiest of women, cause they see things too quickly, passed the naked eye, flower pedals tearing apart from a flower by the wind, and they won't know the withering of heights, because they are too busy and excited being busy with what they know is not true nor right, cause the wind is all that swept them away from a flower from a distance to never second guess what's in front of them, only to forget what's tearing apart. Anyways, and anyhow, I got on the bus, and yes, it was the same bus driver that dropped me off at Union Station in LA. She was picking me up this time, and she asked for my name, and let me on. Somewhere throughout the ride she kept saying ""Sorry"" to people. Here and there, through announcements, and I knew she was trying to say it to me somehow, but all I could think about was me going back home, in one piece. We arrived somewhere, I believe it was a college/university. A girl got on the bus with a suspicious bag. It was way too big. I thought the girl's ""passenger princess,"" or the person sitting next to her on the bus, got up and went to the restroom, because she buckled the bag, a heavy bag, but there was like no reason to buckle it, but that's beside the point. I needed to go to the restroom real badly, so I thought, why not, let me strike up a conversation, and just like that, knowing damn well how to talk to a lady, I saved everyone on that bus cause I overheard someone mentioning that she actually brought a bomb. I swear to God, after I flirted with her, she got up, went to the restroom, came back. That's it. Then I thought to myself, ""Wait, where was that person sitting next to her."" Turns out! There was no one else! But her! It's just that bag being big as hell buckled like she didn't want it to go anywhere. To lighten the mood, one of the guys gave me a WAX pen to smoke, and I puffed that sh\*t! Smoked it like I wanted to get so high, that I forgot to blow the smoke, I engulfed it like Godzilla. I got dropped off at San Jose Diridion Station, feeling like Spider-Man, but even more so, like Symbiote Spidey. I was so high that I couldn't even choose or talk to any of the hot girls that were walking around: hugging, kissing, and just being the most obnoxious, yet so beautiful and sexy as hell. I felt like that guy, who made a touchdown that was the most skinniest among the entire team. I actually felt like a man. But I didn't want to make it about me. So I slept, waited for my ride, sat outside and then went back inside the station, eating poptarts, and then playing chess on my Macbook. Like, did you know? They got chess on a Macbook? And guess who taught me chess, one of my friends at the psychiatric hospital. When there was no one to talk to, nothing else to do when my phone kept dying on me, I played chess just like I framed the spectacle, by turning the tables when everyone was looking at me as something I'm not, only to prove to the world that I'm the hero they've been waiting on. But honestly, I was just trying to get the girl's number. The real hero was my friend at the psychiatric hospital, talking to his girl every day and night, over the phone, and yes, he called me a ""p\*ssy,"" but imagine how he would feel, knowing that I went to LA, didn't have them create a false narrative against me how they try to do to everyone with sane minds just to be kept from the free world, how I was smart with every move I made, talked to a girl at the back of the bus, saving all the passengers, and not realizing it until overhearing it from someone that she had brought a bomb. I dedicate this to everyone that feels like they aren't that confident to talk to girls or that they feel they are insecure, but maybe, just maybe, you'll be too ridiculous for her to even want to stay long enough to hear you say anything at all, even when it comes to her bag. So yea, maybe being yourself just might save the world some day, maybe even yourself, and maybe even others.",1,1770551316.0,Flirting,0,1.0,False

I am not enlightened. I am still a mess. Please manage expectations.

Anyway,-

On Friday; I woke up late feeling extremely burnt out and depressed... I called in sick to work. And immediately 20 minutes later, I spilled coffee on my shirt and iPad, ruined my iPad, and decided the day was colossally ruined. In this fragile emotional state, I remembered reading a comment from this very subreddit which I saw a weeks ago that said something along the lines of  “If you’re bored with life do something slightly unhinged but harmless.”


So instead of going to work, I set out on a Walter Mitty-esque adventure with no plan in mind.  I walked into a random store I have literally never entered before. I don’t even know what they sell there. I just went in out of spite. Inside, there was a man passionately explaining to the cashier why he refuses to use QR codes because “paper menus have soul.” The cashier looked like he had been spiritually defeated years ago.

I bought something I did not need. Talked to a stranger for no reason. Took a different route home. Ate dinner at a time that felt illegal.

And now here’s the thing-

My brain has been weirdly calm since then.

Like… why? That should not work. That is not how mental health is supposed to function. I did not journal. I did not meditate. I did not drink water or touch grass. I simply behaved slightly incorrectly for one evening.

Now every time I feel stuck, my brain goes “Have you tried being a little confusing today?” 

So I need to know. What is the most unproductive, random, or mildly chaotic thing you’ve done that somehow made your life better for no logical reason?

Hey guy's 👋🏻 happy valentines week to all the people who are having a chance to celebrate it, I'll cut it short yesterday I was returning from my evening run and side by side decided to stop for a coffee. I have never got the chance to celebrate valentines day or week or let's just say have a relationship or someone special. So as I ordered it I found myself surrounded with people who were in actual love with each other so as I saw it i couldn't help but recognize that there was this sharp feeling of being left out or unloved. Throughout the years the girl's have said you are cute, handsome in some sense, you are well mannered, have the stability to handle a relationship. But I couldn't understand the fact that if I am this good then why have I been left out. 

You can say it's my jealousy or underlying things working but maybe idk the answer could you guys help, I have tried everything the textbook things so if you.can help me out please do it is much needed and will be appreciated even if you up vote or down vote. 💖",4,1770550585.0,TwentiesIndia,2,1.0,False

They said I punched and slapped my father but all I could remember was this beating pain from the right of my skull. The frontal lobe most likely had been disturbed for the time being, but they wanted to keep me there just as they keep all their patients for monetary gain, $2500 per person, and as they used me and my health as a sponsor to gain more patients and notoriety, they used my family as leverage noticing that they were the ones that weren't sure about what happened, nor wanted me to come home. As I stood staring into the abyss, the hard glass bolted against the metal embroidering of a so-called room, where the walls always felt like they were closing in, as the light from the hallway ceased to ever beam away because the only rule was to keep our doors open. Those lights never turned off, even at night, just so there was access for whomever was doing the nightshift to check up on us 10-15 minutes as we slept to make sure we were asleep. I had a roommate that always talked on the phone, trying to reach out to a girl that he was in love with, and knowing how desperate he wanted to be with her, I held onto that memory of him constantly on the phone; cause everyone could hear it. I overheard him talking about how he'll be out soon and how he wanted to have a baby with her. He told me how his family wanted him out soon as well. All this and more. But he most importantly told me that they only want you to say things that they would like to hear. Those who control you and know that you're not supposed to be where you are, would still do anything to ignore you in order to prove they are right and to humiliate you into believing you are wrong, either by giving you drugs that aren't meant for you and/or either through blame. That being said, I was the only one in the psychiatric hospital that was self-aware and not a danger to others, nor myself. I highly doubt that a quarter of the people there were a danger because I know I was put there because they thought I hurt my Dad, but as the days went by and as night just felt like dusk, darker and darker, like looking into eyes that lack color; getting lost in their pupils of misdirection, only to finally be out of the hospital after winning the hearing. The doctor was trying to use my family as leverage, especially my mom, convincing her that I should stay at the hospital for longer, giving me a paper stating that I wasn't a harm to myself nor others by crossing off both options #1 and #2, but leaving #3 circled; the only thing that they could claim: disabled/not being able to provide for myself (neither one being true-all three being lies on a piece of paper). This is why I won the hearing and managed to be discharged from the psychiatric hospital. But somehow word got around, probably because I went to the shelter and slept there for just one night, and I kept being followed as if everyone knew I was leaving to LA. So much so that the entire city was doing all they could to stop me from leaving, especially when I was already discharged and was looking everywhere for a spot to load my cash into my card; it was nearly impossible because everyone was following me, juicing the battery from my phone, using AI and other methods to communicate through their group chats and hypocritical narrative actor walking around ""trading futures,"" one would say. I left the shelter I was at because I was already free and discharged, meaning that I could finally live my normal life, whatever ""normal"" is after the damage had been done by those at the facility taking away my time, sleep, and my daily diet, being reduced to a patient when I always felt like I knew the problems of people more than they could ever imagine. I managed to get a ticket to LA but for some reason the bus driver just didn't want to get my luggage from the bus when I got there. She wanted me to crawl inside the bus and get my own bag from the other side of the door that could be opened. When she opened the luggage door, she said ""Go get your bag."" I told her ""Isn't it your job?"" Then she said, ""Okay fine,"" closed the luggage door, ""I'll go to the other side and open the other door,"" and as we both walked to the other side, I said, ""Is everything okay?"" She responded with ""Just get your bag."" I got my bag and said ""Thank you, have a good night."" Then she kept staring at me, as if she just hated me for no reason at all, that glare just looked into my soul as if she just wanted me gone for no reason. I stood there just to show her that I wasn't going to be disrespected like that, so I waited, and she said, ""Get away from my bus,"" when I was literally not even close to the bus, just toward the side, not even close to where she was getting on. She proceeded to say, ""There are cameras everywhere and we both know that the police will be here."" I had no idea what she was talking about and I wasn't going to think about the psychiatric hospital I was discharged from, because I was already free and back into the real world because I won the hearing; there was clearly no issue upon me nor was there anything wrong with me. I walked around as if I wanted to just sit down and reflect on how she treated me, driving reckless, making me feel uncomfortable, almost as if she was timing the breaks and turns of the bus messing with my sleep, posture, and health on the bus, and there was this one time where I got up, maneuvered to the restroom where she would deliberately pull on the breaks and my phone in my pocket slammed into the side door of the restroom in the bus, almost having me bust a rib. That being said, when we arrived, there was no reason for her to not get my bag and continue to treat me that way as if the other side had no door to open when in reality the bus had two doors, only having her mention it in the end, and even then she still refused to get my bag. This is where the story begins. I arrived into LA and this bus driver called the police on me. So that was when something clicked in my brain: if the world is f\*cking with you repeatedly, might as well troll them back by framing the spectacle. They sent helicopters, the entire cavalry, looking for me as if I am a harm to society when I am just on vacation. I stayed there, looking at helicopters and every kind of cop car impaginable, as the police drove by, and create a whole scene, yet no one was able to speak to me and ask my side because even they knew this was a waste of time. Maybe they started looking for someone else, but I kept it cool and waited till the commotion was over, so much so that I donated my clothes to a homeless man, giving him my entire music catalogue (CD's), cards, collectibles, an Xbox 360, and my headphones/speaker. I gave him all the clothes in my luggage and everything else, leaving me with just the clothes I was wearing and my journals, documents, and my two phones. I kept everything that I could because I didn't want to make a whole scene because I wasn't sure whether the cops were looking for me or someone else. I felt like I was Venom, or at least, a Symbiote Spidey (Symbiote Spider-Man). I left Union Station, walking around as if I was homeless, stumbling with barely enough energy because I felt like I was drained by the insects that would suck my blood from the dirt where I was hiding. The security showed up, they asked me if I was okay, but I was so illiterate, playing the part, and walked passed them, crossing the street, and even then, a truck tried running me over, barely missing me by an inch. The homeless people on the other side told me that it was like a movie. I walked around LA, made friends, got high, drank some amazing coffee, had a spiritual awakening with God, and sat by Echo Park, feeling like it wasn't LA, it was just a version of it that reminded me too much of the hard times back home, especially when I went to the Target store to grocery shop only to spend more money than I should. The only thing that kept me from staying there was when I failed to get a battery pack from Target when it was for USB-C not iPhone. I was too focused on the bags I brought in, worrying I would be robbed and I won't have nothing to take back home, so I forgot to check what the employee was bringing from the other side of the locked door. But still, I had an Amazon gift card, $100 worth, same as my Target gift card. But where could I even use an Amazon gift card? Think about it? Either way, not all was lost. I ended up finding a spot to sit down and drink coffee, and I had a spiritually awakening with God, a feeling that was like realizing everything all at once, and transcending: we talked about nostalgia, amnesia, and deja vu. Like how all three things were related but not the same. How we forget just to remember again. That being said, the guy at Target who gave me the wrong battery-pack could care less but I found God through his mistake, because how he forgot something, it made me remember something, when I spoke to a new friend, and in the end, I gave him that battery-pack, perfect his phone. Almost like a symbiotic gesture, and think about it, before I was just laying in the dirt, bugs and leeches eating away at my skin, layering in, and then I brush them off, carrying whatever I had left, then finding God off someone making a mistake with my grocery list at Target. Funny. But that's not the most interesting thing about this story, and the man I spoke to would say the same thing, cause he'd probably forget too. When I called my Mom, she said she was okay with me coming home, and that I wouldn't have to stay at a shelter anymore, the shelter that was in San Jose, you know, the one that I was at for a night, and then left to LA. My Dad was okay with me coming back home. He bought the ticket from LA Union Station to San Jose Diridion. It was a ""bus ticket,"" so f\*ck Amazon's Audible, because they didn't even listen, yet made an ad the next day of what I'm about to tell you, but that may be the joke, nobody listens to the details, not even the prettiest of women, cause they see things too quickly, passed the naked eye, flower pedals tearing apart from a flower by the wind, and they won't know the withering of heights, because they are too busy and excited being busy with what they know is not true nor right, cause the wind is all that swept them away from a flower from a distance to never second guess what's in front of them, only to forget what's tearing apart. Anyways, and anyhow, I got on the bus, and yes, it was the same bus driver that dropped me off at Union Station in LA. She was picking me up this time, and she asked for my name, and let me on. Somewhere throughout the ride she kept saying ""Sorry"" to people. Here and there, through announcements, and I knew she was trying to say it to me somehow, but all I could think about was me going back home, in one piece. We arrived somewhere, I believe it was a college/university. A girl got on the bus with a suspicious bag. It was way too big. I thought the girl's ""passenger princess,"" or the person sitting next to her on the bus, got up and went to the restroom, because she buckled the bag, a heavy bag, but there was like no reason to buckle it, but that's beside the point. I needed to go to the restroom real badly, so I thought, why not, let me strike up a conversation, and just like that, knowing damn well how to talk to a lady, I saved everyone on that bus cause I overheard someone mentioning that she actually brought a bomb. I swear to God, after I flirted with her, she got up, went to the restroom, came back. That's it. Then I thought to myself, ""Wait, where was that person sitting next to her."" Turns out! There was no one else! But her! It's just that bag being big as hell buckled like she didn't want it to go anywhere. To lighten the mood, one of the guys gave me a WAX pen to smoke, and I puffed that sh\*t! Smoked it like I wanted to get so high, that I forgot to blow the smoke, I engulfed it like Godzilla. I got dropped off at San Jose Diridion Station, feeling like Spider-Man, but even more so, like Symbiote Spidey. I was so high that I couldn't even choose or talk to any of the hot girls that were walking around: hugging, kissing, and just being the most obnoxious, yet so beautiful and sexy as hell. I felt like that guy, who made a touchdown that was the most skinniest among the entire team. I actually felt like a man. But I didn't want to make it about me. So I slept, waited for my ride, sat outside and then went back inside the station, eating poptarts, and then playing chess on my Macbook. Like, did you know? They got chess on a Macbook? And guess who taught me chess, one of my friends at the psychiatric hospital. When there was no one to talk to, nothing else to do when my phone kept dying on me, I played chess just like I framed the spectacle, by turning the tables when everyone was looking at me as something I'm not, only to prove to the world that I'm the hero they've been waiting on. But honestly, I was just trying to get the girl's number. The real hero was my friend at the psychiatric hospital, talking to his girl every day and night, over the phone, and yes, he called me a ""p\*ssy,"" but imagine how he would feel, knowing that I went to LA, didn't have them create a false narrative against me how they try to do to everyone with sane minds just to be kept from the free world, how I was smart with every move I made, talked to a girl at the back of the bus, saving all the passengers, and not realizing it until overhearing it from someone that she had brought a bomb. I dedicate this to everyone that feels like they aren't that confident to talk to girls or that they feel they are insecure, but maybe, just maybe, you'll be too ridiculous for her to even want to stay long enough to hear you say anything at all, even when it comes to her bag. So yea, maybe being yourself just might save the world some day, maybe even yourself, and maybe even others.

I’ve been having all sorts of issues, including creepiness, flakiness, ghosting, married men, amongst more. I matched with a guy who lives a 30 min drive away from me about 3 weeks ago , it just so happened that the next day he was going on a trip abroad for several weeks. He’s 30 I’m 25.

We kept in contact, had several voice and video calls during the time. We met the first day he got back. During this time he was speaking to me about sexual topics, I told him I wasn’t comfortable or ready for that and he respected that.

Yesterday we met at his city centre, we had a walk around, then had a coffee then grabbed a pizza. We made out in his car, it was pleasurable , I would say the pace felt good, he showed initiative without being pushy. He did ask if I wanted more but I told him not yet. One thing that did concern me abit was he told me he never gets himself off, that it’s difficult to do it, he said he’s been to the doctors about it and they basically didn’t do anything about it. I found this abit concerning to be honest , I want him to be healthy in this area. I hope he’d be able to finish with me lol.

Another thing that I noticed is on the dating app it said his height was 6 foot. I don’t think he was more than 5”9 in person( I’m 5”3). He was pretty muscular though and had big hands, he was genuinely very strong and we joked that he could break my hand in he squeezed hard enough lol.

He knows about alot of things , knowledgable in a lot of areas, has lots of interesting stories. We had a nice connection really, he said he felt likes he’s known me for a while and I felt quite the same. 

He‘a pretty work/ money oriented too, he has some properties that he rents out . But he has quite a lot of free time and says he would value to spend that time with a partner. 

I find him pretty masculine and dominant. He opened the doors for me. He seems he would be protective. 

I know this sounds shallow, but I think the main thing for me is his looks, like his height was a disappointment being totally honest. He also wasn’t very handsome but did have masculine features. I suppose it’s a small nag holding me back.

We’ve spoken about our next meet already and pencilled it for tomorrow. I’m kind of in two minds about him and not completely sold. I’m not totally excited , but I do feel good about the thought of spending more time with him, if that makes sense.

I’m aware that there are women who wait for the perfect person to come along and it never happens, I don‘t want that to be me and I want to be realistic as I really want to have a family. 

Any advice on if this sounds worth pursuing would be appreciated 🙏

1qz6n5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1qz6n5m/been_practicing_for_1_month_and_had_good_results/,Been practicing for 1 month and had good results so far. Here's what's working for me!,"So, next Tuesday I'll be completing exactly 4 weeks of practicing and given what I've been reading in this sub lately, I feel like I'm having very good progress: I'm currently remembering 3 to 5 dreams every night, and I already had 6 lucid dreams so far (3 last night alone, that's why I decided to write this). So I decided to share what has been working for me and maybe help other beginners. This is also a way to keep me engaged in the topic.


**Disclaimer: I am not an experienced lucid dreamer at all. I consider myself as much beginner as anyone who started practicing lately.** I did know about lucid dreaming for a long time though. I used to practice a bit back in 2010 or so, that's more than 15 years ago. So I am familiar with a lot of terms, but never took it as far as to make it a big part of my life.

Also obligatory ""english is not my first language"". 

#1 Thinking about it frequently
First thing I decided to immerse myself completely. Bought some books about lucid dreams and I read at least 10 to 20 pages every day. This is a way to keep myself always thinking about it. I also lurk this subreddit daily, read a few posts, think about them, sometimes reply or post something when I think I can contribute with something.

I also started doing reality checks (pinch nose) and ADA (all day awareness) since day 1. Not because I was hoping to have lucid dreams right away, but to build the habit so when the time comes, I will be ready. More on that later. 

#2 Keeping a dream journal

Of course one of the most important steps to lucid dreaming is remembering your dreams by keeping a dream journal. This is something I never enjoyed doing, mainly because it usually takes a lot of time when I have detailed dreams. But instead of seeing it as an obstacle, it's important to make it pleasant. So instead of writing down, I started taking voice notes.
Even then, for the first 1 or 2 weeks I could only remember 1 short dream every other night, which was really demotivating. I kept experimenting with daily habits until I had a **big turning point**. I'm not entirely sure which one had the greatest contribution, but I tried two things at the same time, and I still keep them today:

1. I love coffee. I usually have a cup in the morning and a second one in the afternoon. I decided I would try to avoid having this second cup of coffee. It was tough the first few days, now I think I'm more used to it;
2. I always had micro awakenings during the night, which was something that always annoyed me. I don't think I've ever had a full night of sleep (go to bed at night and just wake up in the morning). I always wake up once or twice during the night (usually around 1:30~2am and then 3:30~4:30am). I decided to take advantage of this and started to record the dreams I remembered not only in the morning, but also during these short awakenings.

Again, not sure which of these two contributed the most, but after that I went from remembering 1 short dream every other night to 3 to 5 long dreams every night, which still is the case today.

#3 Daily habits and reality checks

Something that I feel is relatively new in the community is the idea of ADA. When I was reading about lucid dreams 15 years ago, most of the techniques were already established, like MILD, WILD, WBTB, DILD, DEILD, etc. Of course people already talked about mindfulness and meditation, but I don't remember ADA being a big discussion and most discussions were about techniques. Now I feel attention has shifted from techniques to actual daily habits. So here are some things I'm applying daily:

1. Some months ago I was unfortunately caught in the habit of doomscrolling, which has taken several hours of my life from me and is probably culprit for a lot of mind wandering, specially after waking up and before going to bed. This is one of the things I'm working hard to avoid. If I feel like doomscrolling, I will grab some book and read instead;
2. Reality checks: I'll do them occasionally every time I remember. But not just do it automatically, I will actually stop what I'm doing, look around, think to myself whether or not I'm dreaming and, most importantly, **I will always assume I'm dreaming**. It's easy to dismiss it and do the RC thinking we are awake, but we sleep for roughly 1/3 of our lives. That's a significant percentage, there's no reason not to assume you are sleeping right now. So I'll do the RC, look around, remember what I was doing in the past few minutes, and imagine myself being lucid. I also think ""what would I do right now if this was a dream?"" and I make a little ritual as if I'm dreaming: rub my hands, touch something to feel its texture, yada yada. This is internalized enough to the point that I actually did all that as soon as I soon as I got lucid in the past few lucid dreams I had.

Related or not, but I also workout 4 days a week and take at least 30 minutes walks daily.

#4 Side effect: fixing sleep schedule

Less doomscrolling and less caffeine actually made me go to bed early.  I used to go to sleep around 11 pm and get up at 7 or 8am with an alarm. Now I start to feel sleepy at around 9:30pm, sleep at around 10pm and wake up naturally at around 6 or 6:30am without an alarm. That's a big change. I wake up with more energy, my day is more productive in general, and with my relative success so far, I get excited about going to bed.


===============================


Points 1 to 4 already had a significant impact on my dream recall and with that alone I had 2 lucid dreams within 3 weeks. Granted, they were very short and not extremely realistic (they felt blurry in general), but I was really happy with the progress and the fact that I could keep myself relatively calm and consciously do my little ""lucid ritual"" inside the dream.

#5 What about techniques?

I'm taking it easy on techniques. I do take advantage of my regular nightly awakenings. I will get up for 5-10 minutes, no lights on, record a voice note of any dreams I remember up to that point, and then go to bed again (basically WBTB). If I am feeling like it, I'll do a SSILD, but it hasn't worked really well to me so far, but I try not to be too hard on myself. 
I have tried MILD in the past few nights (repeat to myself I will remember my dreams and I will get lucid), and this night I had 3 lucid dreams - 2 were short and with relatively low lucidity, the 3rd one was the longest I had in a several years (5 to 10 minutes) and I felt way more in control. Not only that, but I also wrote down a total of 8 dreams (including the 3 lucid ones), which is the most I've ever had.
More importantly though, I'm not assuming techniques are the most important part of my routine. Definitely remembering my dreams and my daily habits are my #1 strategy.

# Conclusions and results

Again, I consider myself a beginner, but I've been seeing in this sub people that are practicing for longer than I am and are very frustrated with how little progress they are having. I decided to share my experience hoping to help since apparently something I'm doing is providing good results.

1. Focus on daily habits (all day awareness, actually engaging reality checks, immersion on the topic of lucid dreaming) instead of stressing over techniques;
2. I record my dreams in the middle of the night instead of assuming I will remember them in the morning;
3. Reduced caffeine + reduced doomscrolling = better sleep schedule;

As results, I'm remembering 3 to 5 dreams every night and had 6 lucid dreams in the past 4 weeks.

* Three of them were as short as doing the RC -> realize I'm dreaming -> dream starts to fade -> try to stabilize it with little success -> wake up;
* One was actually in 3rd person where I was watching things unfold in front of me but I wasn't actually participating. I remember doing a successful RC but couldn't control anything and even thought to myself ""how tf am I lucid but not dreaming about me?"";
* I felt more control in the last two of them: I could look around and even fly. The feeling was great, but both realism and lucidity weren't at their maximum: dreams felt like AI videos (forms morphing around) and I lost and regained lucidity several times.

I really hope this helps and I'm open to questions regarding any of the topics or my habits. I'm also open to suggestion/tips from more experienced lucid dreamers!

I had been on the same plan for years. Same provider, same price. I never really chose it. I just accepted that this is what a phone plan costs.

*February 6, 2026*

Yesterday after I picked my son up from school my neighbor flagged me down in the driveway to ask me if she could use my laundry machine because hers was broken. I said sure, because she's my neighbor. While she was in her house gathering her laundry I made grilled cheeses for myself and my son. When she came over I showed her where the machine was. After loading the machine she came into the kitchen.

My neighbor asked if she could have a grilled cheese. I might just be a dick, but I thought that was a ridiculous thing to ask. I told her I only made two. She asked why I did that since I knew she was coming over??? Because she was coming over for laundry, not grilled cheese...

My son offered her half of his. I always put an egg in my grilled cheese sandwiches. She bit into it and was grossed out by the egg (which she should have seen before she bit into it). She then asked where my trash can was. My son said ""don't waste food!"" So she just HANDED THE SANDWICH BACK TO HIM. I told him to switch halves with me and then binned the sandwich half when he wasn't looking.

She asked to use my bathroom, which I of course agreed to. She came back to the kitchen after and asked if I had any refreshments. I said no and suggested that she wait for her clothes to finish at home. She asked if I was trying to get rid of her. I said we needed to get started on homework. She said she didn't mind. I said we needed to keep distraction to a minimum.

She said ""well, I know when I'm not wanted,"" and left. When she came back to switch her clothes to the drier, she was very irritated. I apologized for hurting her feelings. She said it didn't matter, but she sounded angry. Then she left. I feel bad, but I also feel annoyed, because who acts like that?

___

># Consensus:

Not the asshole

___

># Comments by OOP:


I think she's in her thirties. Maybe a hot early forties. Also she's married and has kids.

___

I actually just moved here last month. I think I've spoken to her maybe twice? This was her first time coming into my house. I also think it was strange to be honest.

___

She put me in an awkward position with *[my son]*. Obviously I want to model for him to always be polite and welcoming, but there is a limit. It's a more nuanced situation than a five year old can probably grasp.

___

I completely understand not wanting to drive to the laundromat, but wanting to also be fed when your house (which presumably contains food) is right there is so odd to me.

___

She's married. And she's at least ten years older than me.

___

Like she wants to be my friend or like she wants to get with me? Because she's too old and too married for me. If you meant the friend thing, maybe. But what a weird way to make friends.

___

*[Somebody comments she wanted to use the bathroom to steal medication]*
If she wants my gas-ex that much she can have it.

>#`How OOP makes their grilled cheese:`

Cook the egg at the same time you brown the toast. When you flip the toast and put a piece of cheese on put the egg on top and then a second piece of cheese. Place one of the pieces of toast on top, browned side down. Let the melted cheese seal in the egg and flip. Best way to eat a grilled cheese.

The cheese seals it in until you take a bite. The yolk mixed with the melted cheese is perfection.

># [Update](https://np.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qyxbcc/update_aitah_for_asking_my_neighbor_to_wait_for/)
*February 8, 2026, 2 days later*

I have a tiny update about my weird neighbor with the broken washing machine. She came back! I know 90% of you said to never let her back in the house, so you are probably going to judge me heavily. In my defense I was a little flustered by the whole thing.

She waved me down again when we were walking up to the house. She said to wait because she had something for me. I waited because... I guess because I'm stupid? I figured she would just knock on the door anyway if I didn't.

She came back with a pie that she said was thanks for using my washing machine. I said thank you and she didn't have to. She said ""let's go inside and try a piece."" I said it was almost my son's naptime. She said ""great! We can eat pie while he naps!""

A lot of you said she might have been interested in me, and that was still in my head. So I said ""yeah, and you should invite your husband over too."" I was expecting that to deter her. Nope!

She got very excited! She said ""that's a great idea! Here, you take the pie in and I'll go get him."" So at that point I'm internally thinking ""what the fu...."" My son and I went inside. I started cutting pieces of pie because at this point I felt like a victim of fate.

She came over with her husband. I have never seen a man that looked as exasperated and embarrassed as this guy. We ate pie, and the whole time she asked me weird questions while her husband looked annoyed. Every once in a while I would say something and she would give her husband a look. He kept pretending not to see the looks.

After we finished the pie, she asked if I had coffee. Her husband said ""Honey, he wants to put his son down for a nap. Let's go home.""

She said ""oh he doesn't mind.""

Her husband said ""he minds"" while he took her elbow and started leading her out the door. She kept insisting that I didn't until they were outside. I gotta say, I think I'm in love with this guy.

As weird and annoying as the whole thing was, I feel a lot better about my neighbor now. Some of the comments had some pretty crazy speculation that made me a little nervous. Now that I've met her husband I'm pretty sure she's just bored. Which is fine. It's annoying, but not creepy.

So to all the people who were worried she was trying to seduce me or spy on me or steal from me, don't worry. Based on her husband's reactions she's just... like this.

___

># Comments by OOP:

I'm divorced. I have a kid. She seemed really zeroed in on that topic. I think divorce is actually pretty common, but maybe not in her social circle. My son and I are in a minority group. Not a super interesting one or anything though.

___

Kind of weird. I'm younger than her and a different gender. I don't really see us being coffee buddies.

___

She has kids.

___

I think this is it. I'm pretty sure her kids are teenagers. So maybe now that her kids are at the ""leave me alone"" age she wants a project. Based on her behavior and a lot of the comments I feel this is most likely.

___

This is going to sound so bad, but... The pie wasn't that good. Way too much sugar.

___

It wasn't that great. To answer the question below, it was an apple pie. It was canned filling and had way too much sugar. It wasn't the worst pie ever, but she didn't even do a lattice crust. That's like the whole point of making a pie.

1qz6j2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qz6j2v/how_to_pick_books_that_actually_make_you_smarter/,How to Pick Books That Actually Make You SMARTER: The Science-Based Method That Works,"Look, I get it. You've got 47 tabs open on book recommendations, a Goodreads list that's basically a small library, and zero clue where to actually start. You buy books with big hopes, crack them open, get hit with dense paragraphs that feel like homework, and boom, back to scrolling TikTok.

Here's what nobody tells you: Most people are choosing books completely wrong. They're picking what *sounds* impressive rather than what actually fits their brain right now. After going down a rabbit hole of research (neuroscience studies, interviews with actual authors, podcast deep dives), I figured out the actual formula for choosing books that stick instead of becoming expensive coasters.

The truth is, it's not about how smart the book makes you look. It's about matching the right content to where your brain actually is. Because the issue isn't you being dumb or lazy, it's that information overload is real, and most books aren't designed for how modern brains process stuff. But there are strategies to cut through the noise and actually learn something.

# Step 1: Start with Your Actual Problem, Not Your Fantasy Self

Stop picking books for the person you wish you were. You know what I mean, buying that 800-page philosophy tome when you can barely remember to drink water. Instead, pick books that solve a problem you're dealing with **right now**.

Got a shitty boss? Read about workplace psychology. Can't focus for more than 10 minutes? Grab something on attention management. Feeling anxious all the time? Pick up a book on mental health strategies.

When a book addresses a real pain point, your brain actually gives a damn about remembering it. That's how memory works, we retain information that feels relevant to our survival or current struggles.

# Step 2: Check the Density Level Before You Commit

Not all books are created equal. Some are light and conversational. Others read like a doctoral dissertation. You need to match the density to your current mental bandwidth.

Quick test: Open to a random page. Read two paragraphs. If you have to re-read sentences multiple times to get the meaning, that book is too dense for where you're at right now. No shame in that. Come back to it later.

Start with **gateway books**, these are well-researched but written in accessible language. Think Malcolm Gladwell style. They introduce complex ideas without making your brain hurt. Once you've built up your reading stamina, then tackle the heavier stuff.

**Try this**: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. This book won the hearts of millions because Clear breaks down behavior science into bite-sized, actually usable chunks. No academic jargon. Just straight-up practical wisdom on building better habits. It's like having a conversation with a smart friend who actually explains things clearly instead of showing off. The concepts stick because they're simple but backed by solid research. People call it life-changing because it gives you a framework that actually works in real life, not just in theory.

# Step 3: Prioritize Books with Frameworks Over Random Facts

Your brain loves systems. Random facts? They disappear faster than your motivation on Monday morning. But frameworks, mental models you can actually apply, those stick around.

Look for books that give you tools, not just information dumps. The best books teach you how to think, not just what to think. They give you lenses to view problems through.

**Charlie Munger** (Warren Buffett's partner) swears by this. He talks about building a ""latticework of mental models"", basically collecting thinking tools from different disciplines. Books that teach frameworks let you apply the same concept across multiple areas of your life.

**Try this**: *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. Yeah, it's a beast at 500 pages, but Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner in Economics) breaks down how your brain actually makes decisions. The framework of System 1 (fast, automatic thinking) vs System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking) will change how you see everything from buying coffee to making career moves. Fair warning though, this one's denser, so maybe tackle it after you've warmed up with a few lighter reads. But once you get the concepts, you'll catch yourself using them constantly. It's the kind of book that makes you go ""oh THAT'S why I do that"" about 100 times.

# Step 4: Use the ""Chapter Test"" to Avoid Fluff

Here's a dirty secret about nonfiction: A lot of books could've been a long article but got stretched into 300 pages for publishing reasons. You don't need to read all of that.

Before buying, check out the table of contents. Does each chapter promise something new and specific? Or does it look like the same idea recycled 12 different ways?

Read reviews that mention ""repetitive"" or ""could've been shorter."" Those are red flags that the book is 80% filler. Your time is valuable. Don't waste it on books that repeat themselves endlessly.

**Pro move**: Read the first and last chapter, then skim the middle. If you're getting value, slow down and read properly. If it's just rehashing, move on.

# Step 5: Mix Your Reading Diet (Don't Just Binge One Genre)

Reading only self-help? You're missing out. Only reading business books? Same problem. Your brain needs variety to make unexpected connections.

Some of the best insights come from cross-pollinating ideas from completely different fields. Read a psychology book, then a history book, then something on biology. Your brain starts connecting dots between disciplines, which is literally how original thinking happens.

**Steve Jobs** famously credited a calligraphy class with influencing Apple's design philosophy. Random input creates innovative output.

**Try this mix**:

* **Psychology/Behavior**: *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist breaks down the science of why we do what we do and how to actually change it. The three-part habit loop (cue, routine, reward) is stupid simple but incredibly powerful. This book makes complex neuroscience feel like common sense, which is exactly what you want.
* **Philosophy Made Digestible**: [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck* by Mark Manson.](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck) Controversial title aside, this book uses Stoic philosophy to cut through modern anxiety about needing to be special or successful all the time. It's brutally honest, darkly funny, and actually makes ancient wisdom feel relevant to your Netflix-and-existential-crisis life.
* **Science/Brain Stuff**: *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker. Sleep scientist at UC Berkeley basically proves that sleep is the closest thing we have to a superpower. After reading this, you'll never look at all-nighters the same way. Walker makes neuroscience fascinating and terrifying in equal measure.

# Step 6: Give Yourself Permission to Quit

This one's huge: **Not finishing a book doesn't make you a quitter**. It makes you smart.

If a book isn't serving you after 50 pages, drop it. Your future self will thank you for not wasting 6 hours on something that wasn't landing. There are literally millions of books out there. Why torture yourself with one that doesn't click?

The best readers aren't the ones who finish everything. They're the ones who ruthlessly cut books that aren't delivering value. Treat your reading time like it's precious, because it is.

# Step 7: Use Apps to Track What Actually Sticks

Don't just read and forget. Use tools to actually retain the information.

**Readwise** is insanely good for this, it resurfaces highlights from books you've read so the ideas actually stick in your long-term memory. The app uses spaced repetition, which is backed by cognitive science as one of the best ways to remember stuff.

Or try **Glasp**, a social highlighting tool that lets you see what others are highlighting in the same books. Sometimes seeing what resonated with other readers helps you catch insights you missed.

If you want something that pulls together all the books mentioned here (plus thousands more), check out [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts that transforms book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into custom audio learning plans.

Type in something like ""become better at critical thinking"" or ""build reading habits that stick,"" and it generates a structured learning path from psychology books, productivity research, and expert interviews. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive (there's even a smoky, podcast-host style one). Plus, it creates flashcards automatically so concepts actually stick. Makes chipping away at that reading list way more manageable when you're commuting or doing laundry.

The point is: Reading without retention is basically entertainment, not learning. And hey, entertainment is fine, but if your goal is getting smarter, you need a system to make ideas stick.

# Step 8: Find Your Entry Point Authors

Some authors are just better at making complex stuff accessible. Once you find one that clicks with your brain, read everything they've written. Then check who *they* recommend.

Authors often mention their influences or favorite books in interviews, acknowledgments, or their own bibliographies. It's like getting a curated reading list from someone whose thinking you already trust.

**Some gateway authors that make you smarter without the pain**:

* [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/) for social science and psychology
* **Yuval Noah Harari** for history and big-picture thinking
* **Cal Newport** for focus and productivity
* **Brené Brown** for vulnerability and human connection
* **Ryan Holiday** for Stoicism and mental toughness

Start with one, branch out from there.

# The Real Talk

You don't need to read 50 books a year. You need to read the **right** books that actually change how you think and act. Quality over quantity, always.

Stop trying to impress people with your reading list. Start choosing books that solve your actual problems, match your current brain capacity, and give you frameworks you can use. That's how you get smarter, not by collecting titles, but by collecting tools.

Now go pick one book from this list and actually read the damn thing.",1,1770549832.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

今天晚上，我们在给她备饭的时候，她又开始转起圈来，但突然转了几圈之后，她改变了路线！她飞奔到了院子里面，大叫了一声，然后又回到房间里开始重新绕着茶几转圈。

I’m writing here because right now I’m going through a “mini heartbreak.” Long story short, I caught feelings for a female co worker and she led me on a bit till I found out her true intentions. 
We bonded really well due to our country’s culture / customs. 
We will share lunch together, exchange food. 
Talk about personal stuff, give her driving advice, life advice about living in the U.S. 
I treated her like a gentleman and a friend.
She asked me for morning rides, and one time she invited me for coffee. I caught feelings for her real quick. I respect her boundaries due to her being in a relationship and living with her boyfriend. 
This past Monday night, she texted me saying that she will txt me the day before to pick her up. I found out that was really weird, because I was picking her up every day. 
So on Tuesday morning, I showed up earlier than usual, and I saw her pulling up with another male coworker that I have “beef” with, and she knows it. 
So that broke my heart really bad to the point that I had to miss work for a day, and I’m still heartbroken that I’m thinking about missing her birthday ( 2/10 - Tuesday ) and Wednesday so I can “heal quicker”.
Me not seeing her will make me lose feelings for her quicker, but I’m still hurt really bad. 
From this Tuesday ( 2/3) till now, I haven’t sat down with her to have lunch, no more  personal convo, and I stopped asking about her at work.
I texted her on Friday night cause she Zelle me for the last car ride and made a joke about it but when she replied I didn’t open it just saw it on the notification bar.  Little things like that will make me get over her. 

The reason for this post, 
Is that every heartbreak we go through we learn from it. Now I know how to react next time when this scenario reoccurs in my life. 
We cry, we are downed for a few days but then our hearts heal again. 

Remember: 
Don’t give your heart to anyone give it to the person that really deserves it, cause we only have one heart. ❤️‍🩹

1qz6233,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1qz6233/30m_scotland/,[30/M] Scotland,"I’m a 30-year-old software engineer currently living in the northeast of Scotland, though I originally come from the Highlands. Growing up surrounded by mountains, lochs, and wide open spaces had a big influence on who I am, and I still feel most at home when I’m outdoors or somewhere a little quieter than city life.

By trade, I work in software engineering, which suits both my problem-solving mindset and my curiosity for how things work under the hood. I enjoy learning new technologies, refining my skills, and building things that are both functional and thoughtfully designed. Outside of work, I tend to gravitate toward hobbies that balance creativity, learning, and a bit of adventure.

Cooking is one of my biggest passions — I love experimenting with new recipes, trying different cuisines, and refining techniques, whether that’s slow comfort food or something more technical. Alongside that, I’m *really* into coffee. Brewing methods, beans, grind sizes, tasting notes — all of it. Making a great cup of coffee is both a daily ritual and a hobby in its own right.

I’m also a big fan of video games, particularly ones with strong storytelling, immersive worlds, or clever mechanics. They’re a great way for me to unwind and also tie into my interest in other cultures and languages. I enjoy learning new languages and reading about different cultures, histories, and ways of life — understanding how people live and think elsewhere in the world is something I find genuinely fascinating.

When I want to disconnect from screens, you’ll usually find me hiking or out with a camera. Scotland offers no shortage of landscapes worth exploring, and photography gives me an excuse to slow down and really notice my surroundings. I enjoy capturing natural scenes, light, and atmosphere more than anything overly staged.

Overall, I’d describe myself as curious, fairly laid-back, and thoughtful. I enjoy meaningful conversations, learning new things, and finding joy in small details — whether that’s a well-pulled espresso, a great view at the end of a hike, or finally understanding a tricky concept.

Came here for a moot court, leaving with... thoughts.

The whole residential campus concept is honestly fascinating and weird in equal measure. Once you're inside the gates, that's it , no stepping out for a 5-minute smoke break, no quick walk, no ""I'll be back in two minutes."" You're in, you're in.

And as someone who didn't take campus residency, that meant entering the university at 9 AM and being stuck there till 7 PM. No leaving in between. No flexibility. It felt less like a college campus and more like a very aesthetic, very well-maintained bubble.

That said, credit where it's due. The campus is genuinely beautiful. Clean, expansive, calm in a way that grows on you. Somewhere between long rounds, waiting rooms, coffee breaks, and random walks, it starts to feel familiar. Comfortable, even.

So yeah, the rules took getting used to. Some days they were frustrating. Some moments felt unnecessarily restrictive. But standing here on the last day, it's hard not to admit - I'll miss this place. The campus, the energy, the quiet in between the chaos of a moot.

This coming Valentine’s, nag-ask siya if free ako. Sabi ko sa 13 magde-date lang kami ng mom ko, then sa 14 magde-date kami ng bebe ko. Sabi ko kung free siya sa Sunday, game naman ako. Ayun, sabi lang niya enjoy daw ako. Based kasi sa message niya, parang gusto niya ako kitain sa 14, eh gusto ko kasi mag-celebrate kami ng bebe ko :( Ayun, feel ko lang baka may ma-feel siya na something.

I’ve followed the instructions, but the machine won't heat up. Here is the situation:

What works:

• PID Display and settings

• Turning the machine on and pumping water

The Symptoms:

• The Problem: The boiler stays completely cold.

• The Weird Part: The Steam LED on the front of the machine is glowing, even though the Steam Switch is OFF.

• Power LED: The main power LED is on, and the PID unit has power.

• SSR Status: The Brew SSR ""OUT"" light is on.

What I’ve measured with the Multimeter (AC):

• Heat fuse is not blown

• SSR Terminals 1 & 2: I measured across the load side of the SSR while the PID is calling for heat. It reads \~1V (essentially 0V drop), which means the SSR is triggered and closed.

• Boiler Terminals 1-4: Measuring from a neutral (blue) wire to any of the 4 boiler terminals reads \~235V.

• Continuity: The heating elements themselves measure \~25-30 Ohms (so the elements are not blown).

My Setup:

• I am using a dual-SSR setup (Brew and Steam).

• I am 100% sure the wires are back on the boiler pins 1-4 exactly as they were before the mod.

The Theory:

It seems like the phase is reaching the boiler (since I see 235V at the pins), but there is no return path to neutral, so no current is flowing. The fact that the Steam LED is glowing suggests ""phantom power"" is backfeeding through the lamp because it can’t find its way back to the blue neutral line.

Does anyone know which specific wire on the Gaggia switch bank or the thermostat chain usually provides the neutral return for the boiler? If I haven't moved any wires on the boiler, where else could the break be?",1,1770547023.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False

At first, I used the beans that came with it in a gift pack. Those were four bags of coffee, without roasting dates on it. One dark roast and three intense roasts.

So for this weekend I bought a medium roast at a specialty store (Ethiopian Sidama Damo). I ground one setting finer (as I understood lighter roasts need finer grinds.

I ground 18 gr and tamped (seemed a lower level than with the darker grounds). Then I wanted to aim for 40gr out, since the roastery owner said that. However, even after 40+ seconds, I had barely 20gr of coffee out.

I was feeding her a puree pouch when a man walks in with a small shopping bag and a used disposable coffee cup. He didn't have a child with him. He proceeds to use the sink to wash the coffee cup and then reaches behind the microwave to get an opened box of tea. He grabs a tea bag and fills the cup with water from the filter then tries to figure out how to microwave his tea. He was there for less than 5 minutes but he would look at us or look at the baby, maybe smile.

My anxiety during this situation was through the roof. I made sure not to turn my back towards him and I was ready to pick up bub and run if he did anything scary. Thankfully, he left after making the tea. I was left there wondering if I did the right thing. I didn't want to confront him in case he fights and hurts us. I was able to finally breathe when another family walked in to use the parents' room after he left.

What would you have done in this scenario? Have you experienced anything similar?

I don’t feel like I belong to the team at all. My colleagues often exclude me from social events, and at work I feel like I’m mostly on my own without real chemistry or collaboration with anyone.

It feels like people are very picky with me, and small things often turn into bigger issues. For example, one colleague once shouted at me and insulted me for not doing something immediately, even though I was in the middle of another task. Another got upset because I arrived five minutes late and grabbed a coffee before handing over patients during changeover. On another occasion, someone complained that I left a blanket on the night-shift bed without removing it, even though the room itself was generally messy and this didn’t seem unusual.

When I try to explain myself or defend my actions, it sometimes escalates into tension or verbal conflict. I feel like some colleagues have already labeled me as someone who doesn’t respect others or is selfish, which honestly doesn’t reflect how I see myself. I enjoy joking, communicating, and working efficiently, but I also admit that I have an ego and it’s hard to constantly accept criticism without becoming defensive.

During rounds I sometimes feel sidelined or ignored, as if my input doesn’t matter. I also get the impression that some colleagues are more focused on monitoring or judging my behavior rather than working collaboratively, which creates a lot of anxiety and anger for me. At times there are passive-aggressive comments or mockery in the residents’ group chat that seem directed at me, which feels unprofessional.

I’m trying to understand what’s going on. Is this a normal residency experience? Am I misinterpreting things, or could this be a toxic environment? What might be forcing them to treat me such way? Is seeming independent , having a good personality , wanting to be autonomous immediately , being competent reinforce this attitude towards me?Most importantly, how can I improve the situation or handle this better?

1qz5nt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1qz5nt2/i_failed_the_math_section_and_still_got_into_my/,I Failed the Math Section… and Still Got Into My Dream University,"I got into my dream university even though I didn’t meet the math cutoff. My interview wasn’t strong. On paper, I shouldn’t have made it.

Honestly, I’m still processing how it happened.

The exam was rough for me, especially math. Everyone else walked out saying it was easy, comparing answers, and Whatever hope I might’ve had was gone.

Three days before the test, I’d already accepted that this university probably wasn’t happening for me. I went in with no expectations, just wanting to get it over with and move on to my next applications.

But what stung more than the exam was realizing the mushroom research center I’d waited two years to visit (right beside the uni) was closed that day. It’s a remote spot, and this felt like my one shot. Standing there, tired and disappointed, I honestly thought: “That’s it, I’ll never be back here again.”

Even though i have been manifesting since 2018, in the last two years, my faith in manifestation had became brittle... Recently, I’d started slowly rebuilding it. Not by chasing big goals, but by testing out Loa and subliminals on small, low-stakes things. I started with manifesting ladders then moved on to manifesting slightly harder things.

One example: there’s a spot on my head where my hair is thin, and to prove the law, I began listening to a hair thickening subliminal. after only three days I started seeing baby hairs grow in exactly that spot. I actually took photos to track it. Seeing real, physical results—especially when I wasn’t emotionally attached—started to change how I felt about the whole process. I was also listening to booster and “limiting belief removal” subliminals in the background, which probably made my mind more susceptible to suggestions

On the bus ride home, I was exhausted. I’d pulled an all-nighter and kept drifting in and out of sleep, jolting awake every time the bag in my hand slipped. After it happened a couple of times, a thought crossed my mind: this is the hypnagogic state.It's the ideal states to manifest

Half asleep, without effort or emotion, I imagined one simple thing—being called back for the interview round. Not getting admitted. Just passing the first stage so I’d have a reason to return and finally visit the research center.

I didn’t loop it.

I didn’t affirm all day.

I imagined it once or twice and let it go.

A few days later, out of nowhere, I got the call: I’d made it to the interview round.

The interview itself didn’t go well. I was nervous, stumbled over answers, and at one point the interviewer told me outright that my math score was very low. The only positive feedback I received was about my English. I walked out fully expecting a rejection.

That same day, I finally got to go the mushroom research center. I bought spores, some edible mushrooms, and felt weirdly at peace. I finally got to visit the mushroom research center!!!

After that, something shifted. The research institute actually offers a training program, and I really wanted to attend. So before sleeping, I imagined going to university there, and after class, walking over to the research center for training. I pictured myself learning new things, getting comfortable with the place, even becoming friends with the staff

Not long after, I got the final result.

I was accepted.

I didn’t pass the math cutoff.

My interview was shaky.

On paper, I had no business getting in.

But somehow, i got in.

this was my easiest manifestation in entire life. I had to put lot more effort to manifest a freaking ladder !!!

# 

# An analysis of the mechanism behind this manifestation:

**1. Complete Non-Attachment to the Outcome :**

Yes, even though this was my dream university (it offers great courses and have super affordable tuition.)

Since I didn't expect getting into this uni and I was more focused on acing the next uni admission that are a month away, I didn't really care that much about whether I got into this university or not.

And also, since I knew I could retake admission test in this uni in six months, I was mentally preparing myself to pick up math in the meantime. Which resulted in me being super non-attached to whether I got into this uni or not.

**2. Manifesting the Implied Result, Not the Main Desire**

This is honestly the *core* of how this all happened. Instead of directly visualizing “getting admitted to my dream university”, which my logical mind would have rejected (especially after flunking math) I focused on something that could only happen *if* I got in: like regularly visiting the mushroom research center.

I specifically imagined myself finishing classes, then heading over to the research center for training, talking to the staff, building a routine around it

Because I focused on the *experience* that was only possible if I was a student, my mind never really had the chance to argue, “But you did poorly on math, how could that happen?” 

If I had only imagined going to the research center without connecting it to university life, maybe the outcome could’ve shown up in any random way. Like years later me getting a job in that area which would give me the chance to visit the research center daily

But I always visualized the research center *in the context* of being a student there. So the university admission became an unspoken part of my assumption.

By focusing on the **implied result**, which is the side effect of my real desire, I bypassed doubt and let my subconscious work out the “how” for me.

**How to use this technique in your own situation:**

* **Manifesting a relationship with someone specific:** Don’t just imagine being together. Instead, imagine yourself shopping for a A for them (if they’re into Star Wars), browsing a specialty store and thinking about what would make them happy.
* **Manifesting a job at a certain company:** Don’t focus on landing the job itself. Imagine yourself grabbing coffee at a café next to their office every day after work, feeling like a regular.
* **Manifesting a gold medal in a competition:** Visualize it has been three years since you won this medal, and now you need to clean it to maintain the polish and the shine. So you are researching online on what kind of product to buy.

**3. Using the Hypnagogic State**

Hypnagogia is basically repeatedly going to the state when you're not quite asleep but not quite awake. This state is extremely powerful for impressing your subconscious mind because your brain is more susceptible to suggestions in this state.

**4. Gradually Rebuilding Faith through Physical Proof**

Even though I had manifested some stuff that should have been impossible, but my faith in law had become brittle in the last two years. 

Instead of trying to force myself to “just believe,” I shifted to testing it gently, step by step. I started with small things like manifesting ladders,thicker hair etc which helped me have faith in the law

`{btw this is an ongoing project next i am gonna manifest vascular arms -> vampire teeth/ sharp and elongated canine teeth -> long fingers etc to strengthen my faith. If you wanna join me in this side quest my dms are open}`

**5. Using subliminals that makes you more suggestible**  
I listened to

subconscious mind repeats affirmations upgraded, and full limitation removal ->absolute power subliminals
