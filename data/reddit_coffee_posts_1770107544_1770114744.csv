London remains the ultimate destination for higher education, housing some of the world’s most prestigious universities. However, the prestige of studying in the UK capital comes with a well-known reputation for a high cost of living. As of 2026, global economic shifts and local inflation have adjusted the financial landscape for students. Understanding these costs is no longer just a recommendation; it is a necessity for a successful academic journey. On average, a student in London should expect to spend between **£1,500 and £2,200 per month**, depending on their lifestyle and location. This guide provides a meticulous breakdown of expenses to help students navigate the financial complexities of London life.

# Cost of Student Accommodation

The single largest expenditure for any student in London is accommodation. Typically, rent accounts for **50% to 60%** of the total monthly budget. In 2026, the London rental market continues to be competitive, with prices varying significantly across the city’s transport zones. For many, finding the [best student housing in London](https://en.uhomes.com/uk/london) is the most critical step in the pre-arrival process. Here’s where [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) comes in. The platform offers various high-quality purpose-built student accommodations in London, featuring a blend of security, community, and all-inclusive utility bills that private rentals often lack. It offers a lowest price guarantee and 100% verified listings with on-site certification, directly solving the critical pain point of finding affordable and reliable accommodation abroad for many international students.

# Comparing London’s Transport Zones

London is divided into zones, with Zone 1 being the central hub and Zone 6 being the outskirts.

* Zone 1 & 2: These areas are closest to major campuses like UCL, LSE, and King’s College. A standard en-suite room in a student hall here can range from £350 to £550 per week.
* Zone 3 & 4: Areas like Wembley, Stratford, or Greenwich offer a more suburban feel. Rent here is more manageable, typically ranging from £220 to £300 per week.

# Average Monthly Rent by Accommodation Type in 2026

|**Accommodation Type**|**Monthly Rent (2026)**|**Key Features**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|University Halls|£950 - £1,500|Managed, Social, Close-to-campus, All-inclusive.|
|Private Apartment|£1,900 - £3,000+|Independent, Private, Bills-excluded, High-autonomy.|
|Student Accommodation|£1,300 - £2,400|All-inclusive, Modern-amenities, Secure, Community-focused.|

Choosing the right housing early is vital. Those who secure their spot in the best student housing in London early in the year often benefit from fixed rates that protect them against the seasonal price hikes seen in late August.

# Cost of Digital and Utility Expenses

For those not living in all-inclusive student housing, utilities (electricity, gas, and water) are a significant variable. In 2026, these costs average £90–£130 per month per person in a shared house. High-speed broadband typically costs around £30 per month, usually split among housemates. Mobile phone plans are relatively affordable, with ""SIM-only"" deals offering large data packages for £15 to £25 per month.

# Cost of Food and Groceries

Food is the second most significant pillar of the student budget. While London offers world-class dining, relying on restaurants can quickly deplete a student's savings. In 2026, the average monthly grocery bill for a student who primarily cooks at home is estimated to be between £250 and £400.

# Supermarket Tiers in London

Strategic shopping is a hallmark of the savvy London student. The city’s supermarkets are generally categorized into three tiers:

* Budget Tiers (Aldi, Lidl): Ideal for bulk buying and staples. Students can save up to 30% compared to mid-tier stores.
* Mid-Range (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, ASDA): The most accessible options with frequent ""Clubcard"" or ""Nectar"" discounts.
* Premium Tiers (Waitrose, Marks & Spencer): Best for high-quality fresh produce but significantly more expensive for a full weekly shop.

# Dining Out and Socializing

Eating out in London remains a luxury. A meal at a casual chain restaurant (like Nando's or Wagamama) costs around £15–£22 per person. A coffee from a high-street cafe is now roughly £3.80–£4.50. To balance the budget, many students adopt a ""meal prep"" routine during the week, reserving dining out for special occasions or weekend social gatherings.

# Transportation Expenses

London’s transport network is one of the most efficient in the world, but it is also one of the most expensive. Fortunately, the city provides specific concessions for the student population.

# The 18+ Student Oyster Photocard

Full-time students living in London are eligible for an 18+ Student Oyster photocard, which provides a 30% discount on adult-rate Travelcards and Bus & Tram Pass season tickets.

* Monthly Travelcard (Zones 1-2): Approximately £118 with the student discount.
* Bus-only Travel: Approximately £1.75 per journey, capped at a daily rate.

# Personal Growth and Leisure: Hidden Costs of Student Life in London

Beyond the essentials, students must account for academic materials, personal care, and the vibrant social life London offers.

* **Academic Supplies:** While most resources are digital, students should budget roughly £20–£40 per month for printing, specialized software, or occasional textbooks.
* **Health and Wellness:** Students should factor in the International Health Surcharge (IHS) as part of their visa, but local gym memberships can range from £25 (Budget gyms like The Gym Group) to £80+ (Premium clubs).
* **Leisure and Culture:** London is famous for its free museums, such as the V&A and the Science Museum. However, West End theatre tickets (£30–£120) and cinema tickets (£12–£18) require careful planning.

# London Monthly Expenditure Review

To provide a clear picture, here are three estimated monthly budget tiers for a student in London:

|**Category**|**Budget Tier**|**Standard Tier**|**Premium Tier**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent (inc. Utilities)|£850|£1,400|£2,200|
|Food & Groceries|£250|£350|£500|
|Transport|£70|£120|£180|
|Social & Misc.|£150|£250|£500|
|Total Monthly|£1,320|£2,120|£3,380|

Ultimately, while London is an expensive city, it offers a range of options for every budget. By prioritizing the search for the right accommodation and utilizing student discounts, international students can manage their finances effectively while enjoying everything this global metropolis has to offer.

1quofzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scleroderma/comments/1quofzr/advice_regarding_how_to_think_about_positive_anti/,Advice regarding how to think about positive Anti Th/To,"Dear all,

Last year, I developed symptoms suggesting Sjögren’s disease. Fortunately, I was able to see a well-known specialist in Sjögren’s, who felt it was unlikely that I have the condition, though he still referred me for a full range of tests, including a lip biopsy.

Most of the investigations are still outstanding due to waiting times. All blood tests, including a full scleroderma panel, were negative except for a low-positive anti-Th/To antibody.

I don’t actually have any classical scleroderma symptoms. My main issues are dry eyes, dry mouth, and joint pain. I also have reflux and gastritis, but these are usually well controlled with PPIs, less stress, and reduced coffee. I also have the gastric symptoms since I am 24, now I am 34. 

The difficulty is that it takes more than six months to see my rheumatologist. I would even pay privately, but unfortunately, he doesn’t have a private practice. I’ve sent a message to his secretary, but it’s likely he won’t be able to reply or see me soon, which is understandable.

Could you please help me think through this situation? I suppose I just feel quite sad and anxious that it might be scleroderma, as it often seems more serious than Sjögren’s—though I’m not entirely sure about that.

Of course, I’m still hopeful that all of this could simply be stress and not an autoimmune condition, but that antibody result has really shaken me.

I would also like to preface this that I am in my 30’s, of good hygiene and did not think I was an idiot before this. I do now. 

In 2017 When plastic straws got banned my friend and I got matching reusable metal straws with a little phrase etched on them. Our master plan was to take them out with us to pubs etc to avoid the floppy paper straws of sadness. Now as you can imagine that happened once. 

However, my daughter and I love an iced coffee. We have a pretty good set up at home with an ice machine, coffee machine, syrups etc. That fateful metal straw makes an appearance alongside its new metal straw friends multiple times a day. After it’s used it’s rinsed with warm soapy water and left to dry - ready for its next iced delight. Wonderful. 

About a week ago I thought my coffee tasted off. Stale. Something was not quite right. One close  sniff of the straw confirmed my stomach flip - it smelled damp, musty… earthy. I ordered some straw cleaners. 

Now here is where I absolutely fucked up. 

A normal person would have cut their losses and tossed it. Living in my delusion that I had not been sucking on a mouldy straw would have been delightful. 

Instead I used this straw cleaner which with one gentle push into the top, came out completely black. Thick chunks of black mould fell into the sink - forever tainting using straws ever again. 

Every single one of these metal straws - black mould inside. And not just a little sprinkling. Think an ecosystem of Black Death. Generations of mould have gathered here at the Mecca of foosty straws. 

So I share this as a warning for anyone like me who thinks rinsing a straw is enough. It absolutely isn’t.

 

TL;DR I used a metal straw for 9 years only rinsing it. Before getting a straw cleaner and removing 9 years of chunky black mould I had been enjoying with my daily iced coffees. ",3,1770114380.0,tifu,4,0.8,False

So I am at the end of month 1 of my social transition. Its been a ride. This isn't my first attempt but its the first time I've stuck with it. I've ridden out backlash from family this time. Although I've thrown a hand grenade into my marriage its held right now for the most part. And although at work I now present as NB/Androgenous (mainly due to lack of HRT) i am listed as Transfemme and get to utilise my companies Toolkit for transitioning at work (which is a fancy way of saying Management and HR keep on top of language and possible abuse).

I've gone so far so fast though that now I don't feel the rush. I feel Euphoria yes and its nice to be able to present how I like and not hear my old name all the time. But other than that everything feels . . . Normal? Is that weird? Like I do get dysphoric days but they aren't too terrible. For the large part I haven't changed fashion sense much (not that I had any) and wearing makeup in my community (alt) just isn't surprising. 

So now I guess I dont know. HRT could take months or even years. God knows how ill be able to get through the list on waiting for Gender Dysphoria treatment on the NHS (I can't afford private). But should it feel normal or settled this fast? Am I kidding myself that I need to go further? I dont know. 

I really wanted to get out today, wear something pretty and go get coffee (can't be too feminine at home. Still pretty raw). But I am kinda stuck due to funds so I just need some positivity from you guys

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1quo99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1quo99p/6_months_solo_building_a_saas_taught_me_market/,6 months solo building a SaaS taught me: Market validation > Perfect product. Here's what I learned.,"Just finished building my first SaaS (solo, 6 months, lots of coffee).



Want to share what I learned because I wish someone had told me this stuff earlier:



The Build:

\- Problem: Teams waste hours hunting for ""how do we do X?"" in docs/Slack

\- Solution: Built an SOP tool that doesn't suck

\- Reality: Building was the easy part



What I Learned:



1. Validation is everything

I spent 2 months building features nobody asked for. Should've talked to 50 potential customers first. Live and learn.



2. Marketing is harder than coding

I can build the thing. I have no idea how to get people to try it. This is humbling.



3. ""Solve your own problem"" is good advice

I built this because I was frustrated. That authentic pain point makes it easier to stay motivated when it gets hard.



4. Solo is lonely but liberating

No co-founder disagreements. But also nobody to bounce ideas off at 2 AM when you're stuck.



5. Scope creep will destroy you

Killed 30+ ""nice to have"" features. Shipped with 5 core features instead. Best decision I made.



My Question for r/Entrepreneur:



For those who've shipped products:

\- What's your #1 tip for getting initial users?

\- How do you validate demand before building?

\- What would you do differently on your first launch?



Happy to answer questions about the build process, tech stack, or mistakes I made.



Currently working on getting my first real users. Any advice welcome.",1,1770113751.0,Entrepreneur,2,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1quo5f6,https://i.redd.it/z1z28vpu79hg1.jpeg,"I'll Start Monday."" I Said That 47 Times Before I Finally Stopped. Here's What Was Actually Going On.","Let me paint you a picture, bella.

It's Sunday night. You've just spent the last two hours meal prepping containers of sad chicken breast and steamed broccoli. Your kitchen smells like a gym locker room. You've downloaded a new fitness app — the fourth one this year — and you've set your alarm for 5:30 AM because ""this time is different.""

Monday morning comes. The alarm goes off. You hit snooze. Then hit it again. By the time you actually get up, there's no time to work out, so you grab a granola bar and a coffee and promise yourself you'll ""make it up"" tonight.

Tonight comes. You're exhausted. You eat whatever's closest. You scroll your phone for an hour feeling vaguely guilty. And somewhere in the back of your mind, a tiny voice whispers: ""What's wrong with me? Why can't I just do this?""

Mamma mia. I lived that cycle for almost six years.

The Real Reason ""Starting Monday"" Never Works
It's not willpower. I need you to hear that and actually absorb it, because the fitness industry has spent billions of dollars convincing you that it is.

It's not discipline. It's not motivation. It's not ""mindset.""
It's that the system you've been given is designed to be unsustainable.
Think about it. Every single diet or fitness plan that's been marketed to women over 30 asks you to do one or more of the following: restrict foods you love, exercise in ways that feel like punishment, meal prep like you're training for the Olympics, feel guilty about enjoying anything that tastes good.

And then when you inevitably burn out — because of course you burn out, you're a human being with a life — you blame yourself. You think you're broken. You think everyone else has it figured out and you're the one lazy, undisciplined woman who can't stick to it.
But bella, you're not broken. You were just given bad instructions.

The Guilt Spiral Is the Real Enemy

Here's what nobody tells you about the ""start Monday"" cycle: it's not just about food or fitness. It's about how you feel about yourself.
Every time you ""fail"" at another diet or plan, a small piece of your confidence gets chipped away. You start to internalize the idea that you're someone who can't follow through. Someone who doesn't have enough willpower. Someone who will always struggle.

And that narrative? That's what keeps you stuck longer than any bad meal plan ever could.

I know because I was there. I was a woman who had accomplished genuinely impressive things in every other area of my life, but when it came to my body, I felt completely defeated. Like it was this one massive blind spot where I was just fundamentally not good enough.

""The most dangerous diet is the one that makes you feel like a failure every time you try it.""

That quote lives in my head rent-free, tesoro. Because it's true.

What The Women Who Actually Look Great Are Doing Differently

Here's something I noticed once I started paying attention to the women I genuinely admired — the ones who looked effortlessly slim, healthy, and alive — and it wasn't what I expected.

They weren't suffering. They weren't depriving themselves. They weren't at the gym five days a week looking miserable on an elliptical.

They were enjoying their lives. They were cooking food that looked and smelled incredible. They were drinking wine at dinner without a calculator in their hand. They were moving their bodies in ways that felt good — walking, dancing, swimming, gardening — not ways that felt like penance.

They had stopped fighting their bodies and started working with them. And the results spoke for themselves.

That's not a coincidence. That's a fundamentally different approach to the whole thing. And once you shift into it, the ""start Monday"" cycle just… stops being a thing. Because you're not white-knuckling anymore. You're just living.

So What Do You Actually Do?

The first step — and I mean genuinely the very first step — is to stop treating food as the enemy.

That's it. That's step one. Nothing else changes yet. You just start noticing how you talk to yourself about what you eat, and you start questioning whether that voice is actually helping you or just making everything worse.

For most women I've talked to, that single shift — just pausing before the guilt kicks in — changes everything downstream. Because once you stop punishing yourself, you actually start making decisions from a place of pleasure and nourishment instead of shame and restriction.

And decisions made from pleasure? Those are the ones that actually stick, dolce vita.
How many times have you done the ""start Monday"" thing? Be honest with me in the comments — I genuinely want to know, and I promise there's no judgment here. We've all been there.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

But last week I tried something different: a work date at myHQ. The idea was simple: we brought our laptops, but also made time to chat, laugh, and grab coffee together.

At first, I was skeptical , would it feel awkward? Would we even get work done? Surprisingly, it was kinda perfect. We both focused on our tasks, shared ideas, and when we hit a slow patch, a tiny coffee break turned into a mini-adventure around the space.

By the end of four hours, we had actually finished our work *and* discovered we enjoy each other’s company. Who knew productivity and a little romance could mix so well?

If anyone’s curious, myHQ is currently doing a **WORKDATE30** offer , it’s a cute way to try a low-pressure “date” while still getting stuff done. Honestly, it might be the best combination of work + fun I’ve had in a while.",1,1770113173.0,BangaloreFindDates,0,1.0,False

I just **finished my progesterone last night**, while I’m still continuing the myo-inositol.

Here’s what I experienced while taking progesterone:

* I really **needed 7–9 hours of sleep**. If kulang, I’d get **headaches and eye pain**
* **Coffee became a trigger** — every time I drank coffee, sumasakit ulo ko
* Body-wise:
   * occasional **lower back pain**
   * **mild cramps**

Nothing too severe.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Last October 2025 She reposted a tiktok vid saying na “She’s better than me? Sure bring her to my playground” I commented on that repost saying na “superiority complex at it’s finest” after one week I saw her on my profile views on tktok and napansin ko na she unfollowed me kasi nakalagay is “follow” e I know were mutuals since nakikita ko nga mga repost and all. And after that I also saw my one friend na kacircle rin namin na nasa profile views ko rin, before that happen nagkita kasi sila I have this weird thoughts na baka sinumbong niya ako or pinag usapan nila ako since sa circle of friends namin close yung dalawa na yon. But sa ig and fb mutuals padin kami and ang weird here is nauuna talaga siya lagi iview lahat ng stories ko hahaha Im the type of friend kasi na pala post ng tiktok vids ko. Fast forward kahapon, nag coffee kami and that was our first meet on this year since we’ve been so busy in the past few months tapos bitbit niya na naman bf nya kahit ang usapan kami lang apat ang magccoffee date. Kamustahan ganyan and she starting to say na namomotivate daw siya mag masteral kasi daw nag leadership training sila last time para daw talaga siyang leader don tapos sakaniya daw inaask lahat, and she also said na kapag daw binibiro siya ng mga juniors don tinatarayan nya lang daw at lalo niyang pinahihirapan sa quiz, she also added na very strict daw talaga sya in terms sa mga gamit na dala dapat complete, while sipping my coffee napag isip isip ko, ano kayang way siya pinalaki bakit siya ganito? And also napansin ko all this time nasa kaniya lang yung attention ng mga friends ko so hinayaan ko lang since I was sanay naman na rin since close nga sila kesa sakin siguro?

I’ve never posted on here before and I’m not sure what I’m looking for really. Maybe some thoughts and different perspectives than those who are close to me and inevitably biased.

I (F38) dated a man (M28) 4 years ago. We were together just over two years and he was heavily involved in my life and my children’s lives. We loved him dearly. The children’s father unfortunately was consumed by addiction after a long battle. It was awful. It was a long time until I dated anyone and this new man fell into my life from work and friendship. 

He always said he didn’t want children of his own and was so happy with mine. Well one day, at our local coffee shop, he broke down in tears and said he wanted a baby. It’s his dream and he hoped I’d have come around to the idea after seeing how lovely he is with mine…When I tell you I raised my kids alone in trauma I felt no desire for more… I played the idea over and tried to convince myself I could have one but it wasn’t in my heart. Being married to an addict you become co dependent and I’m aware I give everything to those I love and I tried to convince my body to just have a baby for him and my children. “It would be lovely for them” I would say. But for me it wasn’t in my heart and that wouldn’t be good for me mentally.

After months of going over it I looked at him one day as he was staring at a family next to us and I said I love you so much and you deserve to be a father. You’re young enough to go and make that dream for yourself but I can’t stare at a bird in a cage. It will break both our hearts growing old together. We really and truly love one another and are the bestest friends. He was crushed an didn’t want to separate and said for me to forget the baby idea. It was out. I couldn’t forget something he wanted so bad. I pushed him away.

We stayed close and caught up now and then over the phone. We missed eachother and couldn’t not.

Well, 5 months later he met someone new. 20 years my junior… she worked at the place I worked at so it felt a little hurtful but it is what it is and I don’t believe it was intentional but it hurt as I had to walk into work.

Being a young girl she posted on socials a lot and seeing him smiling made me upset for myself but happy for him (I told myself.)

Every few months he would call and we would discuss politics, spiritualism, the news and family/friends etc. it was never anything out of line but we both said how fulfilling it is to have deeper conversations on that level. He said he misses me so much. He said that dating someone a lot younger is challenging. I still find it hard to accept that anyone would date someone that they don’t bond with…anyway. He said his girlfriend is a really sweet person and the one thing she really wants is to have a family young. 

We left it a while then he calls one day and asked to meet for coffee. I did. He told me he can’t stop loving me and I am always in his mind. We talked about it all again. There were tears and he said just please think about starting a family with me. It felt so conditional. Like I could have him but with this cost. Or was I being unreasonable? I kept saying that I did still love him and we all as a family miss him. He walked out upset and the last thing he said was “if you loved me like I love you, would want to do this with me”

It was very upsetting and intense. 

Months later. I am not sure if you believe in the law of attraction or fate or what not, but one day whilst driving one of our songs came on the radio. It’s not a known song either. Well I get out of the car and as I’m walking into the shop he’s walking out. We are both kind of stunned and catch up lightly but he texted and said how nice it was to see me and I agreed. We both were a little lighter with chat and the intensity had gone but it was short and sweet. He asked if it was ok to call every Wednesday for a catch up. I know it’s not right but I enjoyed it. He made me laugh a lot whilst I was making dinner it was nice. We get in so well.

One day I asked if he was trying for a baby. He kind of went silent. I said he didn’t have to answer and it is out of line, but he did. He said yes they are… I felt hurt in my heart and couldn’t help but reply saying how crazy this is. How we are both the best of friends and truly care deeply about one another but he’s going about this whole other journey and life. He agreed. He said I just don’t want to grow old and alone. Family is everything. I got upset and said what I’d said before about my children who love him without trying to take down his dream of his own child. Anyway he didn’t call me after that… Wednesdays went cold. 

Fast forward a few months to today. I’ve just seen a post he’s been tagged in announcing a baby on the way…  

He didn’t tell me himself I got sent it from a friend.

I’m sure lots of you may say well it’s his new life etc and he needs to respect his partner. I know that. I really do…

I’m hurt though. I know it’s what he wanted but I’m still really struggling with it….

I’m struggling because I wanted that “father figure” for my kids. He knew about their father. I wanted him with all his funny quirks but I also desperately wanted him to have what he wanted. Putting others wants before my own I guess.

He’s happy and starting this whole new life and family.

Ive never tried to meet anyone since and sworn I wouldn’t do that to myself or my children again. It was so painful. It still is….

Talking of fate. The day after I found out his baby news I took my youngest out for a little lunch. She chose a place in the city we haven’t been to in years. As I go in who is sat there at the table? Yes him. With his mother who I knew always wanted more for him than me and a this mother he wasn’t too keen on. They had bags from a local baby shop near by.

As expected we both locked eyes and it was like it had always been. A deeper feeling than normal. I smiled and said hello to them both and we did light catching up.

He shuffled the bags underneath and didn’t know that I knew his news already and he didn’t say anything. 

My daughter was sat over on the table near by and he didn’t go and say hello to her or anything. That hurt.

I know I have to move on. Maybe writing this is part of my process. He once told me that he wasn’t in love with this girl yet but maybe he could learn to. With a family.

My support network are up in arms that I’d even have feelings for someone who could move on so quick. Someone who couldn’t be in touch with my children anymore and someone who smiles so happily over social media but can call up an ex. But deep down I miss him so much. I can’t listen to songs we loved. I am crying whilst writing this. Maybe I feel sorry for myself. Maybe I’m jealous. Maybe I made the wrong decision and I should’ve just had a baby… no that would be right.

Maybe I’m depressed.

A friend of mine has a partner who is younger than her and he said to her recently that he couldn’t see himself growing old without her. With or without kids. That feels like love. Is that how it’s supposed to be? Or maybe I’m convincing myself.

Maybe I put this guy of mine on a pedestal? 

If you are still here reading this I value your time and I thank you. 

Reading this back helps me see it for what it is. I tell myself he’s selfish and it helps me move on. 

My mother said to me, “what do you expect him to do? Just roll over and die when you said it’s over. He’s moved on. It is what it is.” We’ve been separated two years now. That’s such a long time. I need to just “get over it.”

1quntz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1quntz8/previously_neglectful_father_issues/,Previously neglectful father issues,"I’m so glad to find this subreddit, I feel like it’s finally the perfect place to get the insight I need. Hopefully this isn’t TOO disjointed because there’s obviously years of context and turmoil but I’m trying to keep this issue specific. 

Growing up, my stepmom was awful. She repeatedly made it known that I was imposing on her preferred life, would make mountains out of molehills, and inevitably encouraged my dad to kick me out by telling him either I moved out or she did. She’s not the main character of this story, merely just providing a glimpse into what I dealt with with her. Outside of that, I was babysitting my siblings from the two of them from the age of 8 onwards (for free, obviously), had no guidance in terms of schoolwork or anything like that, and had to do all of the housework. But it was always a really weird dichotomy because my dad did play favorites in odd, small ways, and it was obvious I was his favorite. Eventually though, because of something so dumb as I used some of her instant coffee one day, my stepmom told my dad to pick between the two of us and he chose her, my life became a lot more simple when I moved back to my mom’s. That happened when I was 13. From the time I left his house after that until I was 15, I only spoke to him on holidays and birthdays when I had to. At some point when I turned 15, he said something that I can’t remember but it upset me so much, I didn’t speak to him again until I was 18. At some point though, I just kind of moved on from all of it. He apologized, they divorced, we’ve never been close since but I believe he has his regrets. Am I hopping at the chance to bridge the gap? Do I answer all of his phone calls? No, not really. But I’m just kind of rolling with it now. 

My dad has always had really bad health problems. He had to have a quadruple bypass when I was \~12, he had major spinal surgery when I was 14, his heart started failing when I was 21. We still had a very tenuous relationship when I was in my early 20’s and I still remember sitting in that intersection in Surprise, AZ, listening to him tell me he needed a new heart and his kidneys might be causing problems but it was all okay, and then my mom promptly calling me afterward to ask me if he told me that he kidneys were actually failing and his doctors were telling him to reach out to his people… fortunately he ended up being okay, it’s been several years and he’s had his heart transplant, and he just had his kidney transplant earlier this month. 

The other part of this story is my brother. He’s one of my half siblings via my stepmother, only 15 months younger than me. He is presently my dad’s caregiver but he is in BAD shape. A few years ago he was involved in a road rage incident where he ended up killing a man in self defense. It 100% was self defense and there’s no doubt about it given the witnesses and video evidence, but that obviously messed him up mentally. He’s since become agoraphobic and unemployed. My dad claims he keeps my brother on as a caregiver to give him an opportunity to have somewhere to live since he can’t work. I’ll admit, I don’t fully know what sort of financial web they’ve got going on as they are literally all the way across the country. 

They’ve had repeated problems with each other. My brother has supposedly told my dad that me and my other siblings think he’s a POS and that’s why we’ve “abandoned him” (we’ve all literally always lived scattered across the country, it’s not like we moved away abruptly). I have had to deal with multiple phone calls from my dad where I answer the phone expecting a normal conversation and it starts off with “Your brother thinks \*insert some crazy assumption about how much other people care about dad\*, is this true or not?” There was a point where my dad was bringing in a new caregiver but I guess something happened because it’s back to being my brother. 

My dad wants to move to the town I live in so he can be near my children and have a relationship with them. We have to wait \~3 months for him to get the go ahead from his transplant team. HOWEVER, the other day, I got another phone call from him starting off with “Your brother seems to think you’re just saying you’ll let me move out there but it’s not true and you think I’m a POS, is that true?” And then I instantly hear my brother yell in the background that that’s not what he said. After some back and forth on their end, my brother gets on the phone and tells me that they had just gotten into an argument over some egg salad… After hearing them both go back and forth, it became obvious that they just needed to separate from each other and it was a dumb argument. But they do this a lot.

I’m now worried that by opening up my home, I’m opening myself up to this sort of dynamic, which I already had no intention of doing. My dad thinks he’d be coming to live with me but he’d literally just be with me for a couple months while I help him get on this state’s health plan and find him a place. He is NOT living with me. Hell, I’m going to have to move one of my daughters into her sister’s room to accommodate him and there’s no way that’s going to be permanent. 

But I also feel obligated. Like, I do care about my dad now. I wish it could’ve been better and I’m not overly attached to him, but all of my other siblings aside from my brother just don’t care due to my dad’s negligence. I just happen to be the one he liked the most and now I feel like I have to do something and I don’t know what. ",1,1770112192.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False
1qunty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WishKo/comments/1qunty3/wish_ko_gumaling_na_paa_ko_this_year/,Wish ko gumaling na paa ko this year,"I (30M) suffered a stroke January of last year, ""Hala ang bata mo pa na stroke ka na?"", yes po. Hahaha wala eh. Combination of genetics, poor health choices, at kulang sa pag mo-monitor ng blood pressure ko kasi akala ko gumagana pa ang meds ko, 'di na pala.

Anyway, brief lang naman stay ko sa hospital. I was in and out within a week. Sabi ng doctor ko kasi bata pa ako, which is why naka recover agad ang katawan ko. Honestly, if nakita niyo ako naglalakad, 'di niyo talaga masasabi na na-stroke ako.

When I was released, I did a complete 180. Changed my diet, exercised more, monitored my blood pressure twice a day to make sure my meds were working. I was able to lose a lot of weight. Around 30kgs., and counting. All my labs and CT scans showed positive results, as well.

'Yun lang, when September arrived, I noticed a pain sa left foot ko. At first, I didn't think much of it kasi akala ko plantar fasciitis lang, which I've experienced before. Pero kahit anong stretch or exercise ko, 'di talaga nawawala ang sakit, hangga't di ko na siya mapataas. So, imagine ninyo nalang na 'di ko na siya ma flat sa floor.

'Di ko na pinatagal, I went to a suggested rehab clinic. That's when I found out I have a spastic foot, which is due to my stroke. Sabi kasi ng doctor, these can still happen to a stroke survivor, even when months had already passed since the stroke.

Ngayon, I've been having therapy sessions twice a week, and that's the only time I get to leave my apartment. So, most days, I'm just stuck here because I can't really go anywhere, which sucks. So, my weeks are just filled with work and therapy. I can't even invite friends over because they're either not in the Philippines anymore or living in Metro Manila (I'm from Bacolod, by the way, just in case you needed more context). Kaya wala. I'm just alone, but I'm comfortable naman with living by myself. It beats living with my toxic family.

By now, ma flat ko na ang foot ko sa floor, pero nahihirapan pa rin akong lumakad. I still need to use a walker to help me. But that's a small win, I guess. 😅

Kaya 'yun lang ang wish ko. Sana gumaling na ang paa ko para makalabas na ako sa apartment kung kelan ko gusto. I miss going out and finding new coffee shops. At, para na rin magkaka-love life. Hahahaha feeling ko kasi, pag magka-love life ako while ganito ang situation ko, parang magiging pabigat ako sa babae and I can't take her our on dates or mag travel kung saan-saan. So, hopefully, this 2026 will be the year. 😅

I'm sorry. This was longer than expected. If you read up to this point, thank you! I appreciate you! Kaya natin to! 💪🦿",3,1770112189.0,WishKo,4,1.0,False
1qunr4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1qunr4i/old_passport_blues/,Old Passport Blues.,"Runaway to the edge of the world, to where your great prophecies call.
Home will surely wait, it will wait…


…


When his immigration officer hands him his passport back, he does so with a smug glare. Even after all that explaining he is still not wholly convinced that the faded photo in the document is supposed to resemble the man before him. “The passport seems to disagree with you sir."" He had said in the course of their back and forth.

There's a vase of money plant on the officer’s table and a stationary stand with pens: red and green. Beside it, a tag reads his name: Officer Maari. And Officer Maari has a verdict to deliver. He fiddles the pen he’s holding so eager to write a fine on the man’s behalf, but to naught; at the end of the day, the man really can't be fault. A water dispenser's to the right of the room behind the confessor’s seat, someone turns it on and water glugs down to a cup. It does so four times. 

The man puts his passport back into his satchel and slips his steel chair back just an inch, but a shrill follows it unexpectedly loud—Couldn't get out any faster. Just in that time another officer comes in with servings of hot coffee, its aromus smoke leaves a trail reaching back to the cold outrooms. Sunlight's tucked away.

Right as the man is about to exit the room, Maari speaks up one last omen, “nobody to recognize sir."" 

The man halts, then walks out.

The outside is darker than the room he has just left, a little brighter than he remembers it being. People walk past him wearing thicker hides for the cold, and they slip right past. Nobody really meets each other's eyes anymore, something interesting in the distance a hundred yards away. Well, it no longer is just him at least.









There's a vending machine! Get by it- insert coin- hot coffee- plonk. 









Clouds scramble just a while for yellow tint of sunlight to cast a tall shadow. He throws away the emptied can sooner then. At least satiated with the warmth it filled his belly with, come on now, move out along. This place is a lot colder now, he tugs his scarf closer. The day his baby was born, he no longer remembers- at least having learnt that used to make him happy.

The sidewalk he’s on leads to a single exit, it's a long path though from the immigration office. Through that walk he keeps company of the hazy clouds that stretch from the ground up far and wide, spreading thin every now and then which lets the sun peek. When he approaches the exit, there's a mechanical buzz off of twinkling LEDs rhythmically humming on the lined suit booth; one walks out of it in a yellow overall suit covering him whole, even including a mask that covers his face completely except the eyes, but the eyes don't tell names.

The mirror fogs up— he observes during his turn inside. Mechanical arms nap and fit the suit onto him and it takes him about a minute-five to walk out of that heavy door now just the same as ‘the everybody else’.

A cheap ride finds him outside the airport’s gate. A yellow fare van, Mehkhabs as they are called. They seem bigger now, and the drivers seem to have shrunk. These rides are what take one to wherever they must go though, at this point in time, no words need tell where to head. 

He leans out the window just till his nose peeks out, though it is still within the suit. The roads are in amazing condition to drive in, and the distance seems shorter at that speed. As they get closer it gets warmer, or so he feels— It's all placebo.

A nuke had detonated on Slovia’s soil. The first and only victim to a short war. When the dust had settled: everything; then ash and char. 

But the war ended soon after so, perhaps it was even a sacrifice for a swift end? That's surely the nicer murmur that's around. ‘Slovia was not very stable anyways- old ideals, young lives moving out. 
Better it than ___.’

There are camps laden about in patches of land for returning visitors, closer still to the crater blackened and there are more yellow suits straddled about, and Mehkhabs, big and small were in a sandy parking that’s a little to the left in front of them.

He hands the driver one hundred currency inside the car itself- can't do it outside, can't pull the windows down, dust from here getting in is the most unpleasant. After the transaction, Mehkhab goes away. 

He takes a moment to turn from how he was facing the car, perhaps watching the tail light as it dispersed through the dust its wheels tossed, or maybe the cloud that way. He turns this way after awkward time. Finds it—The black black crater, right there. 

The man used to live here. Their home, thinking referentially, probably was right in the middle of it all. and then everybody he knew around it. He was supposed to be here too- turned to dust; but he did not. 



When she did tell him she was pregnant he remembers she held his hand, clasped it in a gentle grasp. He remembers the great world he wished to bring them to.



The yellow suits around him he could hear through fabric: groans from the one on his left, the one on his right collapsed, though he could not hear his sounds. 


Then they left, the one on the left and the right one too. The sun had moved from forehead to undernose. He's still there.

The evisceration before him and passing dusk, he shall not cry, he does not deserve it. He just stands there not wanting to move anymore, not a breath leaving with dignity of ease. And yet, no matter how hard he clenches,

He still can't remember the day of his baby’s birth.

I am definitely not the thinnest person in my (corporate, white collar) office. I also tend to slip under the radar a lot; I am not one of the important influential people there either.

...I've just had an increase in people commenting on my eating habits lately at work and it's starting to make me super uneasy. I'm scared of three things, primarily: a) someone tying my appearance to performance issues or deciding weight loss is about health issues or drug use (and then the resulting rumour mill), b) HR ""wanting a word"", or c) senior people getting weird about it.

Other than working from home, how to deal? Most of the comments haven't been particularly confrontational or accusing or nasty, so saying, ""Please don't comment on my eating habits,"" feels uncomfortably defensive. (And I don't want to get in hot water with HR.) There are a number of dismissive and toxic people at work... and it's the nice ones who have commented. 


The irony of the situation is that work was probably a major contributing factor in me relapsing. A lack of control or stability, the loss of genuinely good colleagues via redundancies and resignations, enough people doing the constant body/food talk stuff, and a huge desire to simultaneously be invisible and to have some sense of accomplishment at something. Right now this feels like the only thing I have going for me and the job market is terrible out there so just moving on isn't really an option.

I make sure I am seen eating at group staff things where food is served, I ""go out for lunch"" on breaks, and ""eat lots at home"" if asked but I do NOT talk about or invite weight or food discussion whatsoever. Just... let me drink my energy drinks and coffee and eat my tofu, guys.

It lasted about an hour till before he said “To be honest, I’m actually pretty tired so I might call it.”

This is the shortest date I’ve ever had, and it’s made me worry that I don’t look close enough to my Hinge photos.

The date started well, though I could gauge fairly quickly it probably wasn’t a match based on our vibes. He was attractive and nice, and probably carried a bit more of the weight of the conversation - I’m less talkative naturally, especially early on, however would like to think I’m fairly decent on first dates, I’ll just never be super chatty. Off the bat he was more talkative and probably expressive. His body language faced directly towards me mid way through the date and he touched my arm etc., however I was probably a bit closed off (I’d like to think I’m warm, but definitely reserved). He then called it shortly after - after the first drink and about an hour. Also, he’s 36-37 from memory and I’m 27, so a decent age gap, which although I didn’t feel, he perhaps felt.

What are some of the reasons you call a date after only one drink/coffee/an hour? 

I really hope I’m not deceiving people with my profile (for more context, I’ve been on two other dates lately with the same profile, one was only one date but there was a good vibe and we stayed for about four hours, the other turned into a two month fling).",1,1770111410.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

I don't necessarily want to die, but I want to walk into the woods and just lay alone on the ground forever. I'm 23 and I'll probably be mentally ill for the rest of my life. That could be decades. I will likely never acheive love, a career, academic success, financial stability, personal fulfillment, etc. I'm clinically depressed, I have CPTSD, I'm not very smart or driven or passionate, I hate working, I'm constantly exhausted, I'm not very likeable or even a good person. I hate being around people or talking to them. I'm envious of people with good childhoods, or money, or happy lives, or good qualities that I don't have. I'm constantly consumed with rage. I keep it as silent as humanly possible so nobody knows the full extent of it, but I'm still not a pleasant person.

I've put in a ton of work over the past several years to build some coping techniques so that I'm not completely nonfunctional or on the verge of suicide 24/7, and I am grateful not to be as bad as I was for so long. But even still, at my most measured and functional, I'm never happy. I never really want to be alive.

I know it will end poorly for me and when I die I will look back on my life with overwhelming, inescapable regret. It feels pointless. Maybe I'm not constantly in crisis anymore, but for what? So I can still be miserable and hopeless, just more functionally miserable and hopeless? Hopeless at work instead of in bed? What's the point of that? It's so much effort every day for so little reward.

I still have periods where I'm extremely suicidal, but I do have people in my life who would be impacted by my death. I'm supposed to be grateful that I have people keeping me here, but I'm not. I love my sister more than anything in the world and my worst nightmare is for her to be hurt in any way, so I constantly wish that she and everyone else could forget I existed and move on so I could disappear. Even when I was a kid, I used to pray for everyone to forget I ever existed.

I dread everything. I dread work, I dread my future, I dread pain, I dread my relationships. I don't know what to do. I've felt like this for nearly my entire life and it's never stopped. I don't see the point in living such a worthless, meaningless life. Talking about it has never helped, it just made me an attention-seeking, trauma-dumping burden. All of the usual survival techniques (find something small to look forward to, write down 10 things you're grateful for every day, whatever) all feel juvenile, corny, and insincere. I'm glad that they work for some people, but they don't for me. I feel like this and I'm supposed to stay alive for coffee or sunshine or whatever? It feels almost insulting. And barring biblical levels of divine intervention, everyone is obviously not going to forget my very existence. I can never disappear. I can never be free.

My Istanbul trip that I made this month has come to an end. In a few hours, we’ll be heading to the airport. First of all, I’d like to say that throughout my trip, I only had one negative experience, and that was at a restaurant. Other than that, I didn’t encounter any problems.

I had a very enjoyable and full three days. An Istanbul city tour, a boat cruise, long walks, and places that we didn’t have enough time to properly explore during the tour but caught my interest I noted them down and later visited them individually, spending enough time there. Excluding today, the total cost of my three-day Istanbul trip (excluding my flight ticket), including hotel, round-trip transfers, the Istanbul tour, the boat cruise, a public transportation card, and personal expenses, came to a total of 800 euros.

The places I enjoyed the most were Galata Tower, the streets of Balat, the surroundings of Topkapi Palace, and sipping coffee while having a pleasant conversation along the Sarayburnu coastline. On our last day, we also visited Kadıköy, Balat, Taksim, and Beşiktaş. Walking through the streets of Balat was very enjoyable, and we discovered delicious drinks and desserts in the small boutique cafés there. We walked to Taksim from a point near Galata Tower where a long walking route begins, and it was a very pleasant walk. Along the sidewalks, many people both locals and foreigners were singing music and performing shows. We saw wonderful shops and restaurants. From Taksim, we went to Beşiktaş, took photos in front of the stadium, and then visited the Naval Museum by the seaside. We discovered large cannons and many impressive boats and ships. We learned that this museum, said to be the largest maritime museum in Turkey, houses around 20,000 artifacts.

Since we had one more night to spend, on our third day we tried to walk as much as possible, explore more, and dedicate more time to Istanbul. We went to Kadıköy by ferry around 5:00 PM, using our Istanbul Card from a pier on the Eminönü coast, crossing with a wonderful Bosphorus view. I already knew that Kadıköy generally has bars and nightlife, so we planned to spend the evening there and have fun. A Turkish friend told me that concerts are frequently held in Kadıköy. We wanted to attend one, but we couldn’t get tickets because it was sold out I guess we found out too late. We went to a nice venue and spent about two hours there, enjoying plenty of music and dancing. There was no entrance fee; if we wanted drinks, we simply paid quickly with a credit card when ordering and continued enjoying ourselves. For dinner, we found a great restaurant. Honestly, I never expected it to be that good. I don’t know if it was because of the day’s exhaustion, but we were all very satisfied. The amount we paid per person for dinner was 750 TRY.

Around 1:20 AM, we wanted to return, but there was no public transportation or ferry available at that hour. We had two options: taking a taxi or contacting the company that handled our airport transfer. Our priority was a taxi, since we knew the other company works with reservations and requires booking at least two hours in advance. We asked several taxi drivers how much they would charge to go to the Sultanahmet area, and the prices we were quoted were 2,000 TRY, 2,300 TRY, and finally, one crazy taxi driver asked for 150 euros, which made us step back. As a last hope, we contacted the other company. After a 10-minute phone call and waiting, we agreed on 1,200 TRY, and they said the vehicle could reach our location within 20 minutes. We arrived at our hotel around 2:50 AM. We sat in the hotel lobby for about 10 minutes, the hotel staff offered us lemon water, and then we went up to our room.

We did have one bad experience during our Istanbul trip. We all wanted to buy some souvenirs together, so we entered a shop and selected a small basket of items we liked. When we said we would pay by credit card, the seller said he couldn’t accept cards first saying he didn’t have a POS machine, then saying the machine wasn’t working. He said payment could only be made in cash. However, the credit card machine was right there on his desk. When we pointed this out and asked why he wouldn’t accept card payments, he said the prices were only valid for cash purchases. Honestly, we really liked the items and had already shown them to the people we planned to gift them to via video call, so we didn’t want to give them up. We asked how much commission he wanted, and he said a 10% bank commission would be added. We accepted, bought the items, and left. It was a tense and irritating moment, but I don’t want to go into too much detail.

Aside from this negative experience, our Istanbul trip was wonderful, and we didn’t face any other problems. Our hotel and travel company were the most supportive and made things easiest for us during this trip. On the last day, we learned that concerts are regularly held at Dorock XL in Kadıköy. I’ll definitely attend one on my next trip to Istanbul. If I ever travel between Asia and Europe, I will definitely choose the ferry. Crossing from the European side to the Asian side with the Bosphorus view is truly worth experiencing. That’s why I would prefer the ferry over public transportation or taxis.

My final personal notes: In general, I felt that prices in Kadıköy were not exaggerated. I noticed that it’s a place where locals live more than tourists. It’s a district with great food, wonderful venues, and very cheerful people. The streets of Balat are worth seeing it’s an authentic and beautiful neighborhood with mostly old buildings and not yet heavily developed with new housing. If you’re coming to Istanbul, I’d recommend spending at least one hour there. Taksim and its surroundings honestly didn’t feel that great to me. If I were to ask myself whether I should choose Taksim or Kadıköy for entertainment, I would definitely choose Kadıköy. Taksim didn’t attract me much; maybe I just couldn’t feel it. It felt like a classic crowded area. Beşiktaş, on the other hand, was really beautiful. There were plenty of locals, and I liked the museums, coastline, side streets, entertainment venues, and bars.

We used a passenger ferry to go to Kadıköy. I think we paid around 50 TRY. They told us the last ferry was at 11:30 PM, so we returned by car. My recommendation is: if you’ll return before the last ferry, use it. Why waste time in traffic? And why miss those amazing views? You can also buy a reasonably priced tour package like we did to have an enjoyable day in Istanbul. We had no problems with airport-to-hotel transfers, and the entire process was smooth and pleasant. We didn’t have any bad experiences with the hotel we stayed at everything was normal and even better than expected. We left tips for the staff when checking out. They helped us with many things.

Yes, today is the last day of our trip. We’ll be leaving at 13:00 PM. According to the vehicle and driver details sent by the company via WhatsApp, we’re waiting in the hotel lobby. After checking the license plate, we’ll get into the car and head to Istanbul Airport. Endless thanks to the travel agency that helped us throughout this adventure, the entire hotel staff we stayed with, and the wonderful locals of Istanbul we met along the way. I love Istanbul, and I love you. Let’s always stay kind and happy. I’ll miss you, and we’ll see each other again very soon.",1,1770110748.0,istanbul_tips,1,1.0,False

I wanted something quiet. Something that takes 20 seconds and asks nothing more.

So I started writing one line about my day. Not a journal entry. Not a reflection. Just one sentence.

""Good coffee this morning."" ""Took a different route home."" ""Tired but okay.""

It sounds almost useless. But after a few months, I looked back and saw my entire year in these tiny fragments. Small moments I would've completely forgotten.

The constraint is what makes it work. When you can only write one line, you stop overthinking. You just write.

I ended up building a simple app for this (waiting on App Store review now). But honestly, you could do this in Notes or on paper. The format matters more than the tool.

I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter lately about tasks on Aether/MultiMango that are crossing the line from ""Standard Work"" into ""Deeply Personal."" I want to start a thread to document these ""Red Flag"" instructions.

Specifically, has anyone been asked to:

1. Upload your Government ID inside a task (not just for account sign-up)?
2.  Photograph License Plates or ""Street Documents"" as part of a ""Verification"" check?
3.  Capture your own face at specific angles (tilt up/down) to ""verify"" you’re a human?

Why I’m asking: We know the Q1 2026 pushes for ""World Models"" are hungry for high-detail data. If they can get people to provide our IDs or license plates under the guise of ""verification,"" they get professional-grade training data for $0.00 while paying low wages for the tasks.

I don’t like straight espresso — maybe I’ve just never had a good one!

I used to have a De’Longhi Magnifica S. The cappuccinos were drinkable, but they were nowhere near what I get at a coffee shop.
Right now there’s a De’Longhi Dedica Style on sale for €150, and I’m considering it along with a K6 grinder.

Will this setup make noticeably better coffee than the Magnifica S?

I’m hoping for something closer to coffee-shop quality — especially for milky drinks.

The other option is the Dedica Arte at €250. Would that be better than the Style? 

I wanted to get the Bambino but it is roughly double that and outside my budget right now.

My plan would be to start with aDedica and maybe upgrade later if I end up getting deeper into espresso.",1,1770110460.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa is a flanker of the original Khamrah with a similar DNA, often compared to Angels’ Share by Kilian. It opens with notes of praline, warm spices, and slight boozy touches, with roasted coffee adding a nice depth.

It’s a pleasant, comforting gourmand fragrance that works best for autumn and winter. The scent feels smooth and well blended, and I’ve already received a few compliments while wearing it.

Performance is very strong…..it easily lasts 12+ hours on me, making it a great value for the price.

Today I had a test so I woke up a bit earlier than usual, I took a shower and made myself some coffee (I prefer fasting to be more focused for the exam), and went to the living room, there I found my two roommates (5'8 and 6'2) playing fifa, I greeted them and sat down to rehearse my notes.

They were talking about a guy, and the 5'9 said: ""bro, how are you gonna let a guy half your height clown you like that, he is like a child mocking you!"" I didn't say anything or react and acted oblivious, the other guy noticed the weirdness and changed the topic.

When I got to college, I met with my friend (5'4) and his friend group (they're not really my friends) and I was talking to him about the gym, diet, routine, and overall just gym talk, and one of the guys (he was 5'11-6) heard us and said: ""bruh, you dwarfs acting like you can build any muscle"" I just replied with a joke about how he is overweight. (He is also white with blue eyes so it doesn't really matter)

But the guy and I stopped talking about the gym, we didn't say anything, but there was that silent understanding between us, we just knew. We then split up and we went to our exam halls.

So yeah, you can't really escape this nonsense, and this is why I don't really like college in general, wasn't the first and definitely not gonna be the last. Even the guy I was talking to is always the joke of their friend group, this is why I don't really like hanging out with them so much. College in general is just a ruthless experience for short men.

They talk about Ian's body being moved. Garrett takes liars into his car to get them to the police station but makes them get out of the car. Han is right about not being safe outside either. He tells them to lie to the police. Wow. What a cop… And he will keep the money. What?! So they decide to keep the videos a secret. Awesome, because they involve Jenna right? Who was literally hearing them standing near. 

The girls are in Spence's room. It's after the questioning. Em is so right that A gives so she can take. Jenna can't be A cause it's really important to see to do A's job. Also why send you the video of herself and Toby?! Em thinks it's best to tell about A. Spence is right, A knows all of their secrets.

They don't like Spence's coffee. So they go down to make themselves. Their parents are there. Veronica tells them that because of what they said about Ian they are suspecting all the others. Police wants them to see a therapist. Spence asks if they believe them but Veronica doesn't answer. That's so heartbreaking. They should've tell them they believe them cause now they will make them feel like crazy. They don't even believe Ian died? Does it really matter if he's alive or not? Or if he killed Ali? He tried to kill Spencer. Isn't that enough to raise suspicions that something's fishy?

Toby wants to see Spence, Peter tells him she is in trouble, he doesn't help and he has a reputation. So he has to stay away of her. She is annoyed and goes upstairs. How is his reputation worst than Spencer's? Because he went to reform school? Probably. But this is happening for so long. Spencer's reputation is getting worse, his is stable.

Jenna and Garrett in his car. He wonders why Jason went back to his house. Cause it's his house? He thinks he's looking for something that Jenna doesn't let him say. He is scared if anyone find out about the Jason thing. Are they all naming stuff with the name of the person and thing? Jenna tells him to not let it be discovered. What else will he take care of?! How did they even got together?

Ella tells Aria she will be returning home, for the kids and for herself cause she's ready. But she said she thought what Aria told her so is it really her decision?

The liars walk in and there it's a hangman on the board meaning liars. Harsh. Ezra comes in and sees it and erases it. Did he understood? Noel returns, sits next to Aria and asks if she has missed him. I didn't at all though.

Some girls gossip about the liars next to Hanna. They have no shame? Mona comes and wonders if it's more pathetic people who gossip or those who listen it. She's right. Well done! Han says she misses when things were easier. Aria wonders how Noel can get suspended and come back more popular.

Spence doesn't trust Noel. Same. Ezra wants to talk with Aria. He asks her if she's okay, she doesn't want to talk to him. He asks sorry. How doesn't Jackie change anything? She feels different and leaves. They don't even know if they are over.

Em watches in her room Toby and Jenna video. Why? Also isn't it risky with volume? A real estate agent came and basically insulted her bedroom. The shock poor Emily got cause he just appeared…
Spencer goes to Toby's house but Jenna opens and she says she isn't allowed to see him. How is it now worse than before?!

Hastings house. Garrett asks Melissa about Ian. He says they contacted every hospital, he hasn't been treated for anything. He could have said wrong name or something. Spencer comes, she is happy Melissa is home. She looks at her like it isn't the time or doesn't believe her? Garrett says finding Ian is top priority. Well that works out well.

Spence says that it's true what she saw. Melissa says when Ian comes home they will leave cause she doesn't want her near her baby. Cause you believe she will try to kill it or something? Spencer says he will never come home. Well hypothetically speaking he could. Like why hide the body if he's dead? To make them look crazy? Possibly. I really think it's kinda harsh but like he tried to kill Spence and would probably the others. Why does Melissa supports him more than her sister? Spence is right, they are two daughters but they only protect one cause the other is a complication. It's true.

The liars minus Han are at the therapist, she is probably late. She comes, she has been shopping, I guess their financial crisis is over. She didn't lost anything cause they waited for her.

Lucas has brought Caleb to Rosewood. He tells him to not do again what he did to Han. I love him so much! I believe he agrees with him.

The liars talk about Ali. Sullivan got that they are crediting Ali for their friendship cause she brought them together. They look at each other cause they don't know if they will say about A. They answer when Ali's body was found. I would say that as well. Sullivan says it's a safe place and they can talk. Nowhere is safe. They wonder if they will talk. They got messages, that thought it was A but wasn't.

Spencer sees Toby driving Jenna from somewhere. Poor babies, they can't be with each other. They are on the newspaper. Wow. It says they knew Ian was going to run away and made that story. But why would Ian run away? And now A messages them that spies a liar. The newspaper?

Han comes home to Ashley and says that she saved money and she will be happy. Do you mean by stuff you didn't got? You could save even more if you didn't got them. She sees Caleb there, Ashley leaves.

Han tells him he isn't allowed to look at her like that. What? The eyes of longing and love? He says he didn't left without saying goodbye. He should've told her in person. We agree on that one. He never said what he was feeling and wrote them in the letter, that he was sorry, he felt alone all his life but then met her. That's so sad and so cute!! He says he gave it to Mona.

She says she appreciates that he came back to tell her that but doesn't change what he did. Well obviously but it's a sorry and clearing up the situation. He thinks he can make it up to her cause he loves her. She still stands than she doesn't forget that he was using her and tells him to leave. He leaves and she cries. 

Han goes to Mona. She confronts her about the letter. She said she did it for the better cause no one ever hurt her like that and doesn't want to happen again. Because she had never loved anyone like that. Han says she didn't had the right to chose for her and she's right. Han says he hurted her but this hurted more. Mona asks sorry. Mona dates Noel? What? Why?! How did everyone find each other in this place?!

Spence thinks what shirt to wear. Toby messaged from Em's phone. Melissa wants to talk. Spence says she's going to go out with Em. “Cute outfit. Are you wearing it for Emily?” She could though! She says she won't say anything if she will go to see Toby. Melissa says she's sorry she said she doesn't want her around the baby. She says she doesn't believe the police that he took the money and left town cause he wanted the baby as much as her. They will name it Taylor. She wants to tell her again what happened at the church cause now she listens. She thinks Ian would never leave her.

Toby is at Em's house and decides to remove her height markings from the wall. Spence won't be able to come. That's sad. I loved the shirt. She asks sorry about believing he hurted Ali. I love their friendship so much. He saw the way she looked at Maya. She feels like she leaves 4 friends back. He says they will always be able to come back.

Aria comes to Ezra's apartment. Aria talk about Ian. She thinks the things have changed. He tells her to ask him whatever she wants. Jackie thought was ready for the commitment but wasn't. She wasn't his rebound but she helped him get over her. That's so sweet!! Awww, when they are together he doesn't think of anyone but her. That's so cute. Love that he's honest. She leaves. As soon as she leaves he's apartment, A messages her if anything's missing with a photo from Ezra's apartment. She goes and checks that the key isn't under the doormat.

At Em's room the liars try to find what is missing. Han thinks the typewriter or playbill is a playboy. Em says she doesn't want to sit next to them at another funeral. Isn't that like close to impossible? They talk about telling Sullivan about A cause she like has to keep it a secret. They think they should show her the video. Han says she was wearing a gorgeous pair of Chloe's. “And this is relevant to this conversation because…” I love her. She says you can tell a lot about someone from what shoes they wear. Just the shoes? Why? Em says she likes that she said they don't have to go through this alone. They agree to tell Sullivan.

They arrive, Han asks if she can't tell anyone about what they tell her. She answers if they are a danger to themselves or others. Han notices her boots. “Are you satisfied?” I'm dying. Aria starts to say what they already told her about drifting apart but Spence sees a certificate of Hollis college of Ezra. She cuts her saying the talk is premature, they need to organize it more. Han takes the certificate. Sullivan was so confused.

They got out and Han shows the certificate to Aria. Yeah, awesome right in the middle of the street for everyone to see. Aria wonders how A is always one step ahead. Han thinks A has superpowers. Based. Spence tells her to tell Ezra to change his locks. When I first watched I thought she was his mom and had his certificate as a proud parent and they decide to steal it. I was so confused. And stopped the conversation cause they felt awkward because of Ezria.

Ella and Byron come to Aria's room. They got off the phone with Sullivan, that said that it won't be helpful being together at the sessions and they aren't capable of maintaining a healthy friendship at the moment so they should spend some time apart. They tell the rest of the girls. This is so wrong in so many ways on their situation. They need each other right now so much. It's how they were holding on. It's like diverse and conquer. Spence sees something outside of her balcony door and she's scared. So she locks and gets a knife. She is so scared and I get it. Anyone can come into these houses? But it was Toby. She needs that as well. They met today!! So happy! Sullivan locks and leaves, A stalks her.

Toby tells her to lock the door. That she does. She hears a message and wents to see, “Melissa, i'm sorry but it's not safe yet. I can't tell you.” So Ian is probably alive? She's shocked. Spence soses the girls, they meet at the greenhouse and talk about the message. So Spence literally stole the phone and then messaged him to know it is him. What Melissa is gonna say? A sees Em's room with the real estate agent and deletes her files from the laptop. That means the videos. How long would you think A would let you have them?!
See you next week!!

​The extraction doesn’t happen normally. Either it takes 15 to 20 minutes just to get a mediocre extraction, or it's faster but it 'explodes' (spraying coffee everywhere).
​I make sure to screw it on tightly, I use boiling water, and I fill the filter to the brim with grounds without tamping them. Then, I place it on my stove at a power setting of 3 or 4 out of 9.
​In my opinion, the problem comes from one of these things:
​It’s an induction hob, so I have to use a frying pan to transfer the heat since I don't have an adapter yet.
​The heat is transferred in pulses by the pan and is not continuous.

Is it worth the investment?,"I’ve been living near Shanti Path, Jaipur, and I recently moved into a [Penthouse in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/) at Aurallis, so I thought I’d share my honest experience for anyone considering it.

First of all, the biggest difference I noticed compared to regular apartments is the privacy and openness. This is a [Luxury Penthouse in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/), but it doesn’t feel like typical apartment living. The layout is spacious, the ceilings are high, and the private terrace is honestly the highlight. Morning coffee with open views and zero noise feels like a rare luxury in the city.

Aurallis is located in a premium pocket near Shanti Path, which already has a calm, upscale vibe. Connectivity is smooth, yet the area doesn’t feel crowded. Security and maintenance are well managed, but you’re not constantly dealing with society restrictions like in most apartments.

That said, if someone is comparing this with a [Luxury Bungalow in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/) or a [Bungalow in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/), the decision really depends on lifestyle. A bungalow definitely offers ground-level independence and more control. However, this penthouse gives a similar sense of exclusivity without the hassle of managing an entire standalone property.

What I personally liked is that Aurallis almost bridges the gap between apartments and bungalows. In fact, it feels close to the concept of [Bungalow Penthouses in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/)—you get elevation, views, privacy, and a semi-independent living experience.

From an investment point of view, [Penthouse in Jaipur](https://upasnagroup.com/aurallis/) options at prime locations like Shanti Path hold strong long-term value due to limited supply. Rental demand is also solid among HNIs and corporate tenants.

So, is it worth the investment? If you want luxury, views, privacy, and a premium address without fully committing to a bungalow, then yes—it absolutely makes sense.",1,1770109565.0,u_Unique_College_9236,0,1.0,False

From what I can tell, they focus on handmade, small-batch products like sugar scrubs, serums, soaps, and cleansers, with ingredients like mango butter, cocoa butter, almond oil, coffee, green tea, lavender, jasmine, etc. Seems very ingredient-forward rather than flashy marketing which is good I think? I always check ingredients before using anything new. 

What stood out to me:

They talk a lot about gentle formulations and avoiding harsh stuff

Products seem more about skin barrier care than instant “whitening” claims

They’re showing up consistently at local events, which is nice to see for a Pakistani brand

I haven’t personally tried them yet, but I’m considering it, especially their sugar scrubs and foaming cleanser.

Has anyone here actually used Terraglow products?

So, for a  proof of concept, I just used some HO ballast and decorative pebbles and cut some sleepers from Mc Donalds Coffee stirrers. I like the look and there is enough clearance for the wheels. 

  
However, I think the ballast scale is off just a notch and I also wonder if the sleepers need to be wider. Obviously, I would stain them dark brown.

Issues so far are the molded parts that make it impossible to place the sleepers just under the track. I also need to fill the space between tracks to hide the studs to a level that is not looking perfect.

  
I think a bit of copper tape would go a long way and maybe even adding some weathering.

I need to focus on the task at hand. That’s what matters right now. Dealing with the girls and that entire disaster is for later. First things first. I’ve got my clothes bundled in one arm and my backpack in another. Before I get any strange looks for wearing nothing but my boxers, I dig into my pack and pull out a long green piece of fabric: An Afghan burqa, sure to cover my body completely but not cook me in the ever-sun quite as much as the black ones would. Yes, it’s women’s wear; but in this case the ambiguity is a good thing.

And gendered clothing is quaint and antiquated anyway.

I put on my regular clothes, gloves, and a voice-modulator before donning the burqa, then I set out for my meeting.

I show up to the meeting location an hour in advance, and type out a message on my pad explaining the circumstances. *“I can’t make the meet, but keep going. A human will be picking it up, wearing a long green dress. They don’t know what it is, so don’t brahking tell them!”*

It’s another bench, at another park. I’ve been having a lot of illicit meetings at these lately, but with everyone staying as far away from humans as they can it just makes sense. After some time a skittish Venlil with fur the color of soot shows up. They’re all skittish, but this one is especially so. They walk right over and don’t bother with any subterfuge.

“Where’s StandUpForPrime? He was supposed to meet me.” I’ve been pretending to be ‘StandUpForPrime’ on the ResistThePreds forums. The Venlil as a species don’t appear to understand anything about operational security. I look up at the Venlil who is probably male with a quizzical tilt of my head.

My own voice comes out modulated and feminine. “You mean Thavnik? I dunno, his dad took a spill and ended up breaking some bone in his tail. He asked me to pick some stuff up for his job.”

The Venlil, whom I only know as ‘NeverBeCattle’, cringes. “Ah, I… I guess that’s fair, then. Well, uhh, here it is. It’s sensitive, so don’t drop it!” He holds out a box with a handle. I take it.

“I’ll be careful, thanks. Uhh, what is it?”

“Never you mind, human! It’s… It’s expensive and delicate equipment, and I don’t have time to explain it!” He totters off as quickly as his knock-kneed legs allow.

I get a message on my pad seconds later. *“Okay, I handed it over, but are you sure it’s fine? I mean they’re the one you’re gonna use it on, right?”*

I responded. *“No, it’s a different human. I told you I have to deal with two of them! But thanks to you, I’ll soon have hard evidence of their plot! Empathy tests can be faked with drugs! But nobody can talk against a neural scan! This’ll work, just you wait!”*

It wasn’t hard to spill some bullshit. A bit of a sob story about how horrible it is to live with a couple of humans, yadda yadda. Then it’s ‘Oh I’ve got it now, I know their evil plot but I need hard evidence for anyone to believe us! Does anyone work in a hospital and have access to portable neural scanning equipment? It doesn’t have to be a university-grade one’. And now I have one, free of charge. Dumb xenophobic little bastards.

 

The next step is simple, but not easy. For many reasons.

I had rattled the cage of the Krakotl Exterminator, Jarkim, a little. So naturally he ended up sending messages to the other ones, Luarik and Karta. I only know this because that HF kid did a password dump of more or less every single Exterminator’s account. I’m relying a lot on those types for intel, but tens of thousands of angry hackers isn’t the kind of resource I can pass up. Even if their politics are garbage.

The important part is that Jarkim finally got a response from one of the others, setting up a meeting. I’ve got his home address, because of the profiles HF have built. And I’ve got the meeting location. As a bird he’ll probably just fly. The local train doesn’t get him much closer than his home anyway. I’ve got about two hours before the meeting, and hiking out into the largely automated farmland isn’t a problem.

Since learning the injunction was filed by one of the Krakotl trio, I’ve got them all pegged as culprits in the bombing.

I end up finding a rock jutting out that provides me with a good sight line and lets me conceal myself by nestling in under it. I’ll have the sun at my back, too, which is important. But first, I open up my backpack and start assembling.

I’ve used the printer and the receiver to make a basic, semi-automatic ghost gun. Standard UN caliber, supposedly untraceable. Turns out the information on how to build them is easily available on 89sama. The blueprints are constantly updated and adjusted, disguised enough that the algorithms won’t flag it for a few days: I’ve been printing out ‘camera stands’, ‘crutch attachments’, and the likes.

The pieces click together smoothly. The ‘camera stand’ is a bipod mount, letting me anchor the rifle in the ground. It’ll help my aim.

I haven’t been telling the lambchops or any other Venlil, for obvious reasons, but I’m an alright shot. Nothing spectacular, but I’ve spent some time at the range with an uncle who wanted someone to share his hobby, and he took me hunting a couple of times. I even shot a rabbit once. *That’s right, I’ve hunted for my food before. You fuckers want to treat us like predators? You’ll get to see what a predator can do.*

I settle in to wait for Jarkim.

I stepped into the room where we held the kid. He had been stewing for a couple of hours. I entered with a water bottle and a paper cup of coffee in one hand, and a paper plate of donuts in the other. I deliberately put them all down on the table, before sitting down in a simple folding chair opposite his. I took the coffee and sipped it quietly, and then indicated the rest.

“Feel free to have something to drink and eat, Peter.”

The kid was Peter Davis. Sixteen, but had added two years to his age when signing up to be a blue helmet. That was pretty common, and the UN wasn’t in a position to turn down recruits. That wasn’t why Davis was here. Irregularities had been noticed in arms storage, and it didn’t take very long for him to be put as a prime suspect. His internet traffic showed he had Humanity First affiliations, and before long we found evidence of him making sales. The MPs caught him not long after.

I waited patiently, but he just stared at me. So I shrugged and took a donut for myself, eating it. It was chocolate-glazed, and tasted divine. After a few seconds of uncertainty with his eyes moving between me and the plate, he picked up a jam-filled one and started eating too.

I once again waited, until he was done with his treat. “So, Peter, why don’t you tell me where the guns are?”

“I sold them.”

That much was already known to us. “Alright. Why did you sell them? What did you need the money for?”

He grinned at me. “It wasn’t about the money.”

We already knew that much too. “Money is usually why people run guns. If it wasn’t about money, why did you steal and sell these guns?”

“I sold more than just guns, man. Look, I sold ammo and parts too. But as for why I did it… First thing you gotta understand is, on this planet there are a lot of people who don’t feel very welcome. Honestly, our little alien buddies always seem one bad day away from a pogrom. People wanna feel safe, y’know?”

I nodded. “I understand that.”

“Right, and Humanity First needs people on VP, not just back on Earth. Recruitment’s easy, you just let people come to you with their fears and concerns; and then you help them. But you can’t give them protection for free, or it’ll be too obvious; they’ll have their guard up. But you sell it cheap, then offer a friendship discount on top… Suddenly they feel a lot more positive about you, see?”

“So you sold guns to people you felt were ideologically aligned with Humanity First?”

He scoffed. “You think we’re just, like… one big group of angry assholes who hate aliens, don’t you?”

I shrugged. “Why don’t you tell me why I’m wrong, then.”

 

He laughed quietly, and wiped his mouth. “Yeah, sure, fuck it. Look, first thing you gotta understand about Humanity First is: We’re a big, decentralized tent. Anyone who doesn’t want to be wiped off the face of the galaxy has a place with us. It doesn’t matter if you agree with Zhao that ten humans are worth ten million xenos, if you think this is doomsday as foretold in the book of Revelations, if you’re just scared because our species got literally fucking decimated in one day, or if you think the Harchen are the true form of the Jewish reptilians. These are all differences that don’t matter when the fate of humanity is on the line, see? The goal was never, like, for Humanity First to stage a takeover of VP or build a bunch of terrorist cells and start bombing funerals or whatever. Just for there to be a support net, people who’ll have the tools and knowledge and ideally training to be prepared for when the sheep decide they’d rather stick with the Feds after all… though even that part’s kinda contentious.”

I continued urging him with a tone of polite interest. “How so?”

“A lotta people think the only good xeno’s a dead one, and they’d rather us humans were the only people in the galaxy. But they’re actually in the minority even within HF, most of us are actually pretty pro-Venlil, and really pro-Zurulian too. And even the ones who aren’t tend to keep it on the down-low. Talking shit about the teddy bears that are joining Doctors Without Borders because they’re so nice and cuddly and wanna save lives is just bad optics, y’know?”

I nodded. He continued. “Right, so the point is… most of the people I met weren’t really looking for guns. I think like, a solid three outta four of them were just scared and needed someone to talk to, and didn’t know what to do about that fear. Most of the time I don’t even complete the sale. I just listen. Then I say something like ‘Look, I know they’re controversial, but a lot of what you’re saying sounds like what the Humanity First guys say they’re all about’, or maybe I invite them to one of our self-defense community groups that keeps the ideology quiet. I’ve sold more bacon sandwiches than guns, frankly. Of course the ones I meet with from the HF forums directly don’t need any soft soap, they’re for real. But even the ones who are just nudged in the right direction are useful. Y’know how many people you need to support one fighter?”

There were several answers, depending on circumstance. That wasn’t important, though. Keeping the kid talking was. “No I don’t, go on and tell me.”

“About ten. You need intel, counterintel, suppliers, medics, propaganda, logistics, saboteurs… All kinds. Everyone is potentially valuable, nobody gets left behind. We all just want humanity to continue to exist tomorrow, in a galaxy where everyone else seems to want us dead.”

“That may be so, Peter. But you are still admitting to radicalizing people into extremist political views, and then arming them.”

He shook his head with a smirk. “I’m not radicalizing anyone, man; the galaxy is. Y’know there’s a quote that’s become popular with the HF. ‘The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born. Now is the time of monsters’. We had first contact, and then the monsters came, and we only survived because even more monsters showed up to fend them off. If we’re going to survive to see the new world… we can’t leave our fate up to the aliens. You get that, don’t you? We want the same thing the UN does. It’s probably why there are so many of us working as blue helmets. I figure maybe one in twenty of the ground pounders are with us.”

It seemed peculiar to me that right-wing extremists would quote a Marxist philosopher, but I also realized it was a perfect encapsulation of what Davis was saying: The movement was driven by fear and uncertainty, not by any sort of higher ideological goal. And in a world where everyone is afraid, it’s easy to fall into thinking that it’s Us or Them.

And unfortunately his estimate for the number of grunts in the UN with positive views of Humanity First was, if anything, understating the problem.

The most salient question remained, however. “How many weapons would you say you’ve sold, so far?”

He kept grinning at me. “Me? I dunno, man. Guns and receivers put together, it’s gotta be a couple dozen, at least.”

The idea of a few dozen scared, angry people armed with guns seeded in the general populace of our closest allies was breathtaking. It was already nothing short of miraculous that all the serious violence since the assassination of Meier had been Venlil attacking humans, but it was only a matter of time before someone would do something stupid. And whenever guns are involved, stupid has much more severe consequences.

I see the alien flying past on his way to the meeting, but the angle is terrible and the range is bad. So I wait for him to leave line of sight before I reposition, find a new hidey-hole, and wait for him to return from the other direction. He’ll take the same route back. Probably. All creatures are creatures of habit. Laziness conserves energy.

I’m rewarded about an hour later, as I see him flying almost directly overhead. Probably thirty meters in the air or so. I stay still, letting the tall grains camouflage me. Then as soon as he’s too far past to see me, I nestle in and look through the scope. I see his body clearly. So clearly that I can count the blue feathers.

*I had a conversation with him in a bar, and now I’m about to kill him. That’s insane. This is insane.*

I think of the number Two Billion. I let that one swirl around on my tongue, like a sommelier at a wine-tasting. I try to conceptualize Two Billion people like my friends, family, acquaintances, all gone in a flash. Then I try to conceptualize that the death toll of the raid was actually higher. And that’s not to mention the culture, the artwork, the irreplaceable evidence of our society and world. Sue the T-Rex. The Mona Lisa. The Parthenon. The fucking Pyramids. Because of the Federation, and particularly the Krakotl. The concept is staggering, too large to wrap my head around.

I scale back. The memory of verifying Tom’s body at the hospital gives it the connectable, human touch. A distraught boy standing down at the empty shell of what used to be a person he cared about. That, more than two billion times over. That gives me enough rage for what I’m about to do.

*These fucking Feds. These bird freaks and Exterminators. They took so much from us. From me. Nothing more. Not one more fucking thing.*

I put my finger on the trigger, and hold my breath.

So I've realized how toxic I've been. Me (F31), my longtime friend (M30), let's call him Alex and a mutual friend (F40), let's call her Maya have this not great dynamic. Me and Alex have been best friends for a long time. We've gone through many ups and downs in our relationship. Alex and Maya are more recent friends. When things get bad Alex tends to block people for extended amounts of time. 

So back in May me and Alex had a falling out because he was dealing with a lot of stress in his life at that time. We got over it in time for his birthday, the night after his birthday party he was frustrated with Maya because he was stressed about life and wanted to talk with her but he wanted her to put her kids to bed so he could do so. She took offense to this but didn't tell him. Fast forward to a couple months later, Alex and Maya have a falling out. He was wanting to know what time to head to her place because she was going to help him to legal process a childhood SA incident. They had a falling out because he was impatient with her and she totally disregarded his childhood trauma. He blocks her. In the mean time I tell her he will unblock her and they will hash it out in time. 

Now with Maya I didn't know her well, she would occasionally ask if I could babysit her kids as she is a single mom. I would do so to be nice but I always wished she wouldn't ask. I recognize now my inability to say no was my problem, not hers. She paid me money and was always appreciative. I tried to develop a closer friendship and we had coffee a couple times. She's a nice person but she rants and and is always in some drama. I never felt like we jived but I never really knew how to back away from things.  

In the fall me and Alex had a falling out. He blocked me. I confided in Maya with it. I think she would try to get me to talk shit about Alex looking back. Amp me up. December, me and Alex make amends and we work out how we want the relationship to be better. He soon reaches out to Maya as well and they patch things up.

A few weeks ago, Maya got a puppy. She asked if I would puppy-not that weekend. I love dogs so I said yes. My god puppies are overrated, I'm so used to having an older dog i forgot how much work puppies are. Anyways, I invited Alex over to Maya's place since they were good now. I realize that Maya may not like me inviting other people so I ask her if Alex was asking if he can come over to see the puppy. She says she's not sure because she doesn't fully trust him and I say that's totally fine I can tell him that she doesn't want other people there when she's not. She says it's okay he can come but to let her know when he is coming. She doesn't want to deal with him being negative and judging her. Alex agrees to come and arrives late. I forget to let Maya know. Alex knocks the door too loudly and Maya lives in a townhouse. Neighbors ask her what is going on. Maya lives in subsidized housing and is very anxious about making sure she does not get evicted. She immediately calls and sends a barrage of irrate text messages to me on how I totally betrayed her. I didn't tell Alex what was going on but I was stressed and being very short with him which made him feel confused and hurt. I apologize to her the next morning and we talk on the phone and smooth things out, she apologized for her reaction and said she did in fact say it was okay for him to come over. I apologize for not telling her when he was coming and she largely blames Alex for knocking loudly and that she was right for feeling like she can't trust him. I didn't stand up for him on his behalf.

The next day, Alex messages that he's coming by because he left his bracelet there. It's a gem bracelet and he believes in crystal energy so it's important to him. I quickly tell Maya and she's immediately suspicious. He comes quickly grabs the bracelet and heads off. Maya texts me accusing me and him of making up this story just to hang out in his place to disregard her feelings of him being there. She then calls me about this very thing and that she's not stupid. I convince her that it had nothing to do with that and if she has cameras she can see for herself. She is then convinced and recognizes that she's projecting because of some other friend drama in her life with another friend. She calls later to tell me that she's late in getting back and then asks me for time stamps of when Alex texted and called and when he got there and compared it with her time stamps of when he called her as if she's suspicious of my story. When she gets back she's appreciative of me watching the puppy and gets me and uber and then apologizes for the way she acted. She then sent me a bunch of text messages apologizing and buys me a spa treatment.

Next day Alex calls asking what happened and I break down and tell him the whole situation. He tells me I need to separate my friendship with Maya because that situation was not okay and it made me really upset. A week later and I'm hanging out with Alex when Maya texts me asking to watch her kids so she could fly to LA to get some work done. I don't respond to the texts and she calls Alex who says I'm with him. She asks him to ask me as well. I don't answer my text messages. She responds that her neighbor would do it. She texts me also that she's so glad that me and Alex are hanging out again (referring to our friendship break) and that he really has a way of dragging people back in (referring to how me and her previously had conversations about our issues with him). I responded that ya but if we have issues again then that's it (which was kindof referencing me and Alex's makeup, but obviously I guess I was being underhanded in saying it that way because both me and him have our issues and I didn't mention to her any of mine).

I call her a few days later and I ask her how she's doing, she decided not to go to LA. We get onto the topic of the weekend and she says she felt bad for the way she handled things but only did so since she had told me she didn't want him there and says I didn't listen to her (despite her telling me at the time that it was okay to invite him). In hindsight I know I should've just asked her first before inviting him, she is still under the assumption that he had asked to come over. I try to navigate the conversation to be about how I'd like to set up boundaries and for her to not ask me to watch her kids unless there was an emergency. I said that I felt our relationship had been a bit transactional and i think it would be better if we were only a personal relationship where we just hung out without doing anything professional. She was on my resume for babysitting and i was her references for a grant. I also outlined that I felt an emergency would be like if she was in the hospital (I used this example because she's texted me she was in a crisis before and it ended up being she had no one to watch the kids while she gets a facial). She agrees and make plans to get facials and get coffee. Half an hour later I get a barrage of text messages and screenshots because she didn't like that I used the word transactional and she wanted to show every time she asked me to just hang out. It was also her saying how hurt she was, that friends be there for each other and that she constantly asks if she can help me (which she does i just don't need anything) and that she felt Alex was behind this and manipulating me. It totaled to 46 text messages. I don't read them for a couple days. Stressed me tf out.

A few days later I read the text messages and don't respond. I hang out with Alex and tell him all about it. He says I should just cut it off and block her. He helps me craft a message, I make it my own and send it, blocked her. He leaves and he gets a text from Maya that apparently I was talking shit about him to her about her dog which is bs. He didn't know about how what she was telling me about how she though he was judging her but I never told her he judged her, she was just assuming. 

She asks him to hang out with her over the weekend. He goes and holy shit. She blasts me saying I said such horrible shit about him. Completely overdramatizing everything. Saying I said he's psychotic and needs therapy and that she's got screenshots and recordings. She denies that she sent 46 messages to me as well. He gets convinced and reveals that he helped me and encouraged me to send that last message. She says I didn't really like her and her dog and that she scared me (which i did say, even though i knew she was harmless, she still does). She then goes into how she has her issues with him and he ends up crying because she's saying I said all these things about him and that I can't be trusted. It also comes out that I invited Alex over first and that he never asked to come over. After this he calls me and comes over to me. I show him all my text messages with her. He sees that she did send 46 messages but also the message where I say if he messes up I'll end the friendship without saying that I recognized my issues in the friendship too. He sees that I said nothing like Maya accused me of saying but he obviously does know what we talked about in person. Maya sends me two emails while he's there with me. They are insane, threatening legal action against me, full of lies or what she thought was the truth. He reads those as well.

The coming days after Alex texts me that he recognizes that I'm not someone that would say the things she was accusing me of, that it didn't make sense and that she's doesn't have screenshots and recordings or anything. He keeps trying to sort things out with Maya until he texts me he blocked her again.

Alex calls me tonight to say he cannot move forward in a friendship with me until I agree to a three-way phone call between all of us to sort this out. Me and Maya don't have to be friends but we have to try to come to some understanding. He also states that he's very hurt by both of us and that I basically started this whole thing by being dishonest and that i have a problem with honesty and accountability, which I agree. He felt that my dishonesty about the things that I said about him was hurtful. I sent her an email apologizing for not being honest, that she deserves a real friend, that I should've been able to say what i felt and not talk about her behind her back. I said I wanted to take accountability for my actions and the hurt I caused.

So...that's it. I'm realizing how toxic i can be by wanting to agree with everyone and not want to rock the boat. Or maybe that's not a good account of my actions? Idk. I was thinking maybe I should cut myself off from Alex as well because he never deserved any of this. 

I guess I really do have a problem with honesty, telling white lies, and lack of appropriate boundaries and I don't really know how to improve and become a better person/friend. I'm in university and I made a counseling appointment. I've been in counseling before for anxiety.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I’m creating a Reddit community for people in Leyte who work from home — freelancers, VA’s, remote employees, online sellers, or anyone earning online. The goal is to connect locals who share the same lifestyle and help each other grow.

Inside the community we can share:

	•	job leads and opportunities

	•	work setup and internet tips

	•	local co-working or coffee meetups

	•	support, advice, and networking

WFH can feel isolating sometimes, so having a local circle who understands the struggles and wins would be really nice.

I’m 37 f told my husband 38 m that this isn’t working out. We have been in a relationship for five years and married for another seven years.

We always had different opinions on everything I mean EVERYTHING! Politics, music, hobbies, life goals you name it. Even though it’s kind of a battle I like the fact that he was challenging me. That was the first lie I told myself. We have been through a lot. Financial crisis, two miscarriages and lots and lots of family problems we been there for each others.

I think first sign was that three years ago we went to a amusement park and I slipped and fell in the water slide and hit my head hard. I kind a lost my consciousness for around five minutes and I remember the assistant there was calling me and asking I’m okay and I couldn’t respond because I was in a shock. And eventually he came and grabbed me from the water. My husband didn’t cane closer to grab me and after confirming that I was okay from the nurse like in 10, 20 minutes he wanted to try the next water slide. I was shocked but I said okay and he’s kind a hesitant afterwards.

Second one was when I had my baby two years ago and we went some cloth shopping for him while he was sleeping and his grandma was there. I fell down and couldn’t get up my own because got a heavy back pain after the childbirth. He acted like he didn’t see me and eventually I grabbed a rack side of me and stood up. He was literally in front of in the line and turned back and acted surprised.

After the baby birth I suffered severe ppd and I couldn’t function for a while. With proper medication and therapy I got better and have a great relationship with my son. My husband on the other hand we kind a started to drift away. It’s been one and half years and we keep having fights and he refused to sleep in the same bed with me.

And last night he screamed at me and said he can’t take anymore with my tone and disagreements and my child and I were terrified. Today once we cooled off I told him this type of behavior is unacceptable and he’s putting all the blame on me. I realized there is nothing more I can do about our marriage. So I said I was done and I’ll ask for a divorce at the end of the year and I need full custody of my son. He didn’t look any different and he said okay. And that’s it. And later I tried to talking him for a coffee and talk about this but he said no need.

My son is 18 months and he hates when his dad sit next to him or trying to hold him. He cries loudly and say no. Even if he forces he struggles and run away in minutes. I really don’t know why. Husband works as a sailor and came home two weeks ago and first few days my baby played with him happily and now doesn’t even want to sit next to him.

I supported my husband for two years while he’s doing his higher diploma and I handled all the household expenses and sent both of our families allowance every month. I paid 70% his education and even found and paid for a tutor to help him with higher maths. After he passed the exams and got the promotion his attitude towards to me started to change. In one fight he told me to leave and he’ll raise our son. I was heartbroken. Obviously that wasn’t going to happen. Now I feel like he’s been rude and distance for thinking that I will leave eventually.

So that’s it for now I guess. I did my best for this marriage and my best wasn’t enough.",0,1770108799.0,Marriage,19,0.25,False

1qumvik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1qumvik/my_regular_easy_go_cup_recipe/,My regular easy GO cup recipe.,"I wanted to create a simple recipe for GO that would work both indoors or outdoors without the need for scale. I based this recipe on a cup that holds around 220 ml of water (half of the GO cup). 



**RECIPE:**

1. **Add 15 grams of medium-ground coffee (one flat scoop on GO spoon) to brew chamber, shake gently to level the grounds. Pour 170 grams of water (up to top of the nr 3 on the GO), stir few times.**
2. **Insert the plunger and wait for 10 seconds.**
3. **Gently press the plunger down, pause when you meet resistance, then stop once the plunger reaches the coffee grounds. Add 50 grams of water to fill a regular cup, or until you reach the halfway point on the GO cup.**



Here are a few notes based on my tests:

I used medium-roasted coffee beans. For light roast, either increase the temperature or extend the blooming time. For a dark roast, either skip blooming or reduce the water temperature to between 80 and 85 °C. You can also skip the final step of adding water to enjoy a smaller, fuller cup. 

Doing it this way eliminated bitterness from my coffee. These tips are based purely on my limited experience with coffee, so please feel free to correct me or provide more insights regarding temperatures, etc.
