1kg0v42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1kg0v42/can_this_be_related_to_histamine/,Can this be related to histamine?,"Hi, after I got super sick with a virus/covid?, I started experiencing strange symptoms. I was at the time experiencing with gluten free diet, so I thought it must be it. But now it does not look like it's gluten related at all. I noticed cyclical pattern of those symptoms - starting a week before my ovulation + a week before my period. What I experience:

- extreme(!!) fatigue/exhaustion/brain fog
- a feeling that is hard to explain - I feel it in my chest and throat, and it is something it between a feeling of stress/fullness/warmth/nausea deep in ny chest and throat at the same time. It reminds me of a feeling of having terrible sleep and 10cups of coffee. It comes and goes many times per day
- sinus pressure around forehead and nose
- mildly sore throat
- mildly runny nose
- sometimes slightly swollen eyelids with some rash
- mild cheeck rash

If you google, this could be anything.. but now it looks like it is histamine-estrogen related looking at the cyclic pattern, when everything stops the day I ovulate.

Is there anyone with similar symptoms? I live in Scandinavia and doctors here are with this super chill attitude as if what's happening has to happen, just drink more water. So I am double stressed as I am on my own.. it is a terrible feeling, I cannot work, concentrate, live my regular life 2 weeks out of a month!!  

What I would like is to hear if anyone has similar experience and maybe direct me so I can get closer to finding the answer


Thank you

# Chapter 1

  
  
I love him with all of me. I can understand and sacrifice everything just for him to appreciate me. But I still can’t understand why everything ends up like this. All of my efforts were for nothing.  
  
“Faster, Tammy!”  
  
All of these started because of my friend, Thea. She keeps on forcing me to do things that I don’t want to do.  
  
She is half-running toward my direction. She is wearing a white polo shirt partnered with black palda shorts and a white cap. Dangling on the neckline of her polo is an aviator shade and she’s also wearing an expensive sneakers too.  
  
“Come on! Just try it!” she said as she pulled me out from the golf cart.  
  
“I already said no. This is just a waste of my energy,” I complained but still followed her.   
  
“Just one swing! After this I won’t bother you anymore!” she bargained.  
  
Thea had been bugging me for a few times already. At first, I was able to dodge all her requests, especially when our family goes to the golf course. My father loves to golf, and so is his friend, which happens to be Thea’s dad. That’s why it’s not unusual if we always find ourselves here.    
  
 “Please?” She placed her palms together, her aligned fingers pointing towards the sky as she batted her eyes. I rolled my eyes, and finally, gave in to her request.  
  
“Just once!” I said in defeat. She nodded her head rapidly as she got too excited because I gave in.   
  
I sighed heavily as I went out of the golf cart. I walked lazily towards the Tee Area since it was quite low. As I reached the area, the caddy gave me my golf club. It was quite heavy so I positioned myself. Even thou I don’t usually play, I still know the basics.  
  
My dad loves playing golf, I grew up observing him play.  
  
I angled the club in the right position. I looked at the ‘green’. Even if I knew that my force can’t reach the area, I still calculated how far I can reach with my swing. I looked at it for a few seconds before I decided to swing my club.  
  
The golf ball immediately flew in the sky, a few meters away from the tee. I nodded in satisfaction with what I did.  
  
“Wow! You hit like a pro!” Thea commented as she suddenly appeared beside me. I rolled my eyes and gave her the club.   
  
“Here. Are we good now?” I said.   
  
She happily nodded her head and this time, she’ll be the one playing.  
  
I glanced a little bit behind her back where there are sofa chairs and coffee tables. There’s also a minibar. It’s the player’s alfresco area.   
  
It’s not that far from where we are standing. A few steps from here and I can finally sit there. I looked at my friend again. She was already wiggling her butt like a corgi as she calculated her moves. My friend has gone crazy. Tss.    
  
I just shooked my head and scanned the entire field. The setting is really stunning that’s why it’s not surprising to see a few famous and prominent people playing in here.   
  
Well, it’s basic for some social elites to have several hobbies or sports. Just like this. Ever since Thea and I were kids, we were trained here that’s why we don’t easily get stunned whenever we see famous people.   
  
“Is it true?”  
  
I suddenly lifted my head up to search where the voice was coming from. It came from the two girls talking to each other from the distance. They were both sporting an all-out golfer outfit. If I were to guess, maybe we’re of the same age based on their body stature.    
  
“Yes, girl! He’s a self-made millionaire!” the other girl said with full of conviction in her tone.  
  
“Oh my! And on top of that, he is so yummy! Ah!” the woman giggled at herself like a three year old.  
  
I was taught by my parents not to eavesdrop when other people are talking. It’s basic etiquette. But the way the two women were talking, or should I say they were almost yelling at each other, everyone around the area will definitely hear what they’re talking about. My eyes followed where they were looking at.   
  
   
  
Well, it’s not that hard to identify who they were drooling all over. I looked around and my brows turned into a furrow, especially when I saw a pile of people from the golf course just adjacent from ours. I looked back at the two women who were standing a few meters away from me. Their eyes were glued across the golf course. I followed where they are looking and saw two men who are playing.    
  
But who among those two do they mean? Both of the guys have their backs on us.   
  
   
  
I have been here for so long but I have never seen them. Are they new here?

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""We'll find our mate and all this will be over,"" my wolf whispered, trying to comfort me.

I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly—who would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""



...

Lennox's POV



I could feel my heart racing in my chest as I followed the maid leading me to Olivia's quarters. I wanted to act nonchalant, like I didn't care, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't hide the worry etched on my face.



Stepping into the room, I was met with the sight of Olivia lying lifeless on her bed. Her mother knelt beside her, crying uncontrollably, while a medicine woman attended to her. The moment my eyes landed on Olivia's pale, unmoving form, pain racked my entire body. My breath caught in my throat, and I pushed myself forward to the bed.



""Why isn't she breathing?"" I asked, my voice trembling.



Her mother, wailing in anguish, stood up from the floor and rushed at me. Before I could react, her hands gripped my collar, and she yanked me down to her level, glaring at me with pain and hate burning in her eyes.



""Are you and your brothers satisfied now?"" she spat, her voice dripping with pain. ""Come, eat her dead body!""



I swallowed hard, unable to say a word as guilt clawed at my chest.



Her grip tightened as fresh tears streamed down her face. ""How can you and your brothers hate Olivia this much?"" she demanded, her voice cracking. ""You used to adore her! When you were children, she was your world. She worshiped you, followed you everywhere. She would have given anything for you three. And you? You protected her. Cherished her.""



Her voice dropped to a whisper, filled with agony. ""But now? Now you despise her. Why? Because her father was accused of stealing? Because she's an omega? Because she's no longer the daughter of a gamma?""



My throat tightened as I swallowed the lump forming there. Tears burned at the edges of my eyes, and before I could stop them, they slipped down my cheeks.



That wasn't why I hated her.



Maybe my brothers had their reasons, their own twisted justifications for turning their backs on her, but me? My reason was different. A selfish, painful truth I could never bring myself to say aloud.



Another tear slipped down my cheek, and I turned my head away in shame.



Then—



A sudden, small sound filled the room.



A sneeze.



I jerked my head back toward Olivia, my heart leaping into my throat. The medicine woman gasped, and her mother froze, her breath hitching.



Another sneeze.



And then, Olivia stirred.



With a racing heart and tear-filled eyes, I watched as she slowly opened her eyes. Her mother, who still had her hands on my collar, let go of me and crawled over to Olivia, who had gained consciousness.



Not wanting her to see me in tears, I turned around and left the room. I changed my mind and didn't go for the run anymore. Instead, I went back to my room and found Anita, Levi, and Louis on the bed. Louis and Levi were awake, lying beside an exhausted, sleeping Anita.



The second my brothers saw me, they knew something was wrong.



""Lennox?"" Levi's voice was laced with concern as he sat up, reaching for his underwear.



I ran a hand through my hair, exhaling shakily as I shut the door behind me. My chest still felt tight, my emotions all over the place. Levi's concerned gaze stayed locked on me while Louis sat up, rubbing his face tiredly.



""Lennox?"" Levi asked again, his voice laced with worry. ""What happened?""

# Chapter 1: Live A Little

Chapter one: Live A Little

Camilla

My life sucks, all I have ever wanted was to be loved and taken care of but I guess I was too cursed to experience happiness in my life. My biological father abandoned us and disappeared without any trace. My mother always comes back home drunk, she doesn't have an iota of love towards me nor do I get any motherly love, all she cares about is her alcohol and her new found man who happens to be my stepfather now.

I was deprived of both motherly and fatherly love at a very young age. My stepfather would do anything in this world to get rid of me but I was too strong to let him succeed in his plan.

To save my life from my stepfather, I moved out of the house and went to live with my boyfriend in another city. But still couldn't be loved and cared for. Maybe I am being a little dramatic but I swear this world is against me.

I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good day. This morning, my dumb ass boyfriend thought that it was okay to turn off my eight o'clock alarm and just replace it with his own. The alarm was set for an hour later than what I needed, like hell, what is wrong with him?

The purpose of the alarm was to wake me up and go to the gym but I wouldn't be surprised if I came home later to find him on the couch in the same position I left him. It is fair to say that things have been a little rough between us recently but once again, I have to force myself to remember that if I wait just a little longer, things will get better.

Our relationship was never one of those all consuming romances you may have heard of but Robin is nice and that's enough for me. He didn't abandon me even when everyone else did.

His stupidity this morning made me miss a meeting with a client. I am an event planner. I was supposed to meet a couple this morning concerning their upcoming wedding but my idiot boyfriend made me miss that. On top of that, my lack of coordination caused me to trip on something and ripping my stocking in the process. I just wanted to be happy in life. Is that really too much to ask?

Coming out of the gym house, I decided to branch to the only place that ever brought happiness in my life. A coffee shop that wasn't too far from my house. I came here on a daily basis to ease out some stress.

Opening the door, I was greeted by the wonderful smell of freshly baked goods and coffee grinds, filling the whole place.

""Camilla is that you?"" A familiar voice called out from the kitchen before the counter.

The owner of the cafe, Susan Kanu. She is the most kindhearted woman I have ever known but she can sometimes be scary as well. I can only be thankful that I am on her good side because despite her old age, I wouldn't put it past her to be able to make even the toughest men run away crying.

""Hello, Mrs. Kanu."" I replied, walking towards the sound of her voice.

Peaking around the corner, I saw her petite figure standing with her arms crossed and facing my direction.

""What did I tell you?"" She said with a slight warning in her tone.

""Hello, Susan."" I quickly corrected myself, catching onto what she meant.

For some unknown reason she was very adamant on me calling her by her first name. I am not sure of the reason but either way my response caused a bright smile to spread across her face.

""What brings you here at this time of the day?"" She asked as I helped her carry the tray of baked snacks over to the counter.

""Robin turned off my alarm, so I had to reschedule the meeting I had initially booked at nine o'clock this morning. I was just coming out from the gym, heading back home to see him but I am definitely going to need some coffee before that happens.""

I heard her let out a disapproving sigh and I already knew what was about to leave her mouth before she even said it.

""Why do you still stay with that boy? We both know he has the brain of a rock and it is not like he is giving you any good…""

""Susan,"" I interrupted, stopping her from what she was about to say.

Just because she is right doesn't mean it has to be said. It only served as a reminder of how touch deprived I am. The thing about Susan is that she is as blunt as you ever think of.

""He is ni…."" I started, feeling the need to defend my boyfriend but I was cut off.

""Let me guess, he is nice to you?""

""Yes and he treats….""

""Treats you well? My dear, I hate to break it to you but that is another way of saying he is boring.""

She is right and that is why I stopped protesting but Robin is all I have ever known. He knows every damn thing about me, I feel safe with him and if he is going to leave me, he would have done it by now. Now matter how much baggage I may carry, Robin wasn't scared off by it.

It has really been a rough life for me, it has been almost a year since my father disappeared and still there is no sign of him. Even the police and other detectives couldn't trace his whereabouts, they said his disappearance was voluntary. The little that I knew him he wouldn't go hiding without a good reason.

Most people think that he is a heartless monster which in some way I have to admit but at the same time, never once in my childhood did he make me feel neglected or unsafe. He started teaching me self defense from the time I could walk. I vividly remember him telling me on my tenth birthday that he wouldn't be around forever and that once he was gone, the only person I could rely on was myself. And that day happens to be the first time he thought of how to use a gun. He gave me a gun as my birthday gift.

My father might be crazy by doing that but I still love him nevertheless. I already knew it was going to be very impossible to figure out where he was, no one found him unless he wanted them to. I can only hope he either reveals himself or decides to come out of hiding.

My private detective has been trying to track him for the last seven months but so far nothing has come out of it and it only leaves me more and more disappointed. And that is why I am still staying with Robin. I have lost so much and I am sick of everything in my life changing, he is the only consistent thing as of right now and I wasn't prepared to lose that yet.

Not responding to Susan's early question, she continues speaking.

""You are twenty-five years old, you should be going out to clubs and meeting new people. Let yourself live a little and before you know it, you will be old like me wishing you would have just loosened up more while you still can."" I smiled at her words.

I wish I could have argued with what she said but the truth is that I would be lying if I said I had a good social life. I used to go out with my friends a lot but ever since I moved here with Robin, I haven't been able to meet new people and besides he doesn't like to go out that much. He prefers that I stay home with him and the last time I went out, it didn't go well. I went to a club without him and when I came back home that night, he scolded me for dressing like a slut and then refused to sleep in the same bed with me for almost a week. I cried so hard that night but he eventually came to his senses and apologized.

I knew apologizing can't justify his actions but at this point, I can't even remember what my life was like without him and for that reason, I chose to let it go. I grabbed my takeout coffee and dug into my bag to grab some cash to pay but Susan stopped me with a glare.

""Don't even think about it.""

Not wanting to argue, I sneaked the cash into her tip jar before she could protest. She always gets upset whenever I pay for anything in her cafe. With a smile on my face, I moved around the counter and placed a kiss on her cheeks which managed to remove the pout on her face.

""Bye, Susan.""

""Have fun with your boyfriend."" I shook my head before closing the glass door behind me.",1,1746526031.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

And it was only a short maglev ride away from Futureland.

Despite ideal cerebral drainage, Sax woke up with a pounding headache.

Next to him on the nightstand lay an overturned pill container. A few pills scattered next to it.

""Damn hollow SmartPills.""

The next moment, Fred burst through the door. He was wearing only a bathrobe and underwear. The bathrobe was open, and his massive breasts dangled nearly to his navel.

""Finally, you're awake, man!""

""My head feels like it's been through an endless loop of boxing matches. How can you be so awake? Don't you have any pain?""

""No, we took those SmartPills before going to bed, remember?""

""After drinking at least twice as much as usual because those damn pills promise to handle your hangover even if you drink twice of what you usually would drink!""

""No matter if it's vodka, daiquiri, whiskey, or Solid Punch.""

""But it's not true, damn it!"" Sax growled and threw the blanket aside.

""I feel fine. I'm very satisfied with this product.""

""Well, I am very happy for you."" He wasn't; he meant it sarcastically. ""It must have something to do with that damned testosterone,"" he added, moaning, throwing himself back to bed.

""Well, I have good news for you, Saxilein.""

""Please never call me that again.""

""Why not, Saxilein?""

""Shut up. Tell me the good news. I need some good news or I will die straight away.""

""While you had your little cutey-beauty sleep, I called the reception, and guess what, they do have one shop here, specialized in handles for blinds. It's called The Handle Handler, and guess what their slogan is?""

""What?""

""A shop that only sells handles for blinds. Isn't that perfect, just perfect?""

""Perfect, let's go!""

""I'm hungry.""

""Okay. Food first. Let's order something. If I am paying a fortune for a hotel with human room service, we should make those goddamn humans work.""

""That's what Carlos Nishimura says too... make them work so they are happy.""

""Oh, shut up. I don't give a damn what some Carlos Nishimura says.""

They ate an opulent breakfast: insect burgers, shrimp-snake steak, coffee made from cats' poo, truffles grown in real soil, and smoothies with vodka. They were ready for their mission to find the Handle Handler of Independent City, which was conveniently located just across the park in front of the hotel.

""Hilarious how Independent City people envision the future, isn't it?"" Fred looked at Sax expectantly as they walked out of the hotel lobby.

Sax trudged with hunched shoulders, his hands deep in the pockets of his coat, kicking artificial autumn leaves as if they were pebbles.

""Do you still have a headache?""

""Yes.""

Fred beamed, and his full hair blew in the warm wind. ""While you were sleeping, I read the brochure from the lobby; they brought it up to my room. Real people. Room service, just like in the olden golden days.""

""What did you see?""

""Oh, it's gonna be really hilarious. Many of the exhibits, I am sure, many exhibits will be part of everyday life in the future.""

""Oh, don't talk. Futureland exhibitions are only amusement. Nothing will ever change when you're on the pinnacle of history. They are just another trick to keep us docile and happy.""

""Come on! You can't say the tapeworms that only eat the unhealthy food you consume will not be a staple in a few years!""

""Yeah, that wouldn't hurt. But then you'd lose all your weight.""

""Look. That man, breastfeeding his child. How cute."" Fred swooned.

""What, where?""

""Turn around halfway and look at the guy on the park bench. Don't be so obvious, Sax!""

""Okay, yeah and?""

""What do you mean, yeah and?""

""What's special about it?""

""There's a man breastfeeding his child!""

""So what? Did you think just because they speak French in Independent City, they're backwards?""

Fred shrugged. ""I don't know. The yuppies in the USC and Greenland, sure. Everyone's breastfeeding. But here in conservative Independent City.""

""It's still the Freedom Belt, bro. They might be independent, but actually, they're interdependent. Single parents are trendy everywhere, Fred. My juice gets mostly sold to single parents.""

""I love it! If a man can breastfeed his own child, that's great, that's self-sufficiency par excellence.""

""Some guys take prolactin just to make their own butter; that's something you should try! You love butter.""

""Mhm yes. I love butter.""

""And soon there'll be a drug that makes you lay eggs."" Sax laughed and added, ""I mean, just imagine that. I'd love to lay eggs!""

Fred considered: ""Wow. Imagine you'd do both. Then you could live entirely off yourself.""

Sax, still shaking with laughter, spat out the next words: ""If... if... if there was something like that, we'd see it at Futureland in Independent City for sure. I have a name for it. Poop-an-Egg.""

Fred was rolling on the floor with laughter. ""I can't take it anymore, Sax, stop!""

""Ouch."" Sax clutched his head. ""Damn headaches.""

But their laughter was snuffed out in an instant.

""Hey, hey you!"" A catcaller with a seductive voice.

Sax and Fred ignored her.

""Hey, you with that sexy receding hairline. Must have a lot of testosterone!""

""Fred,"" Sax whispered, ""can we walk faster? I feel uncomfortable.""

""Hey, Casanova,"" the catcaller was joined by two more girls.

""Fred, let's run!""

""Aren't you the two-hundred-million-sperm man?"" said the second with an equally seductive voice. Sax turned around groaning and looked into the faces of the three young women on high platform shoes and in brightly colored coats, their hair pinned up with kanzashi. She had an emulated dog on a leash.

""What, a two hundred million what man? No sorry, there must be a mistake; I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Of course you are! I saw you in Cosmopolitan. And in Esquire!""

Fred giggled.

""Well, do you want to come with us?""

One of the girls opened her brightly colored coat; underneath she wore a white polka-dotted red jumpsuit. She unzipped it and exposed her nearly naked body. She raised her right eyebrow and licked her upper lip.

""We pay well!""

Sax rolled his eyes and touched his head. ""Oh my God, this can't be happening. Even here!""

""Thirty silver bitcoins. Each,"" said the third one and smiled with the left corner of her mouth raised. ""Come on, Mister Superpotent.""

Now Fred burst out laughing. ""Mister Superpotent, did you hear that?""

""Can you stop that stupid giggling already?"" he said to Fred. To the three girls: ""No, I'm not interested, thank you! Now please leave us alone.""

""What's going on here?"" shouted a choir from the other direction. It was a group of teenage girls.

""Hey kiddies!"" shouted the first one, who had closed her jumpsuit and coat again. ""This is the two-hundred-million-sperm guy from the magazines.""

""Oh, really?"" The teenagers, dressed in the typical fashion of the 2250s, clothes that looked almost like military uniforms, strict and orderly, shamelessly looked Sax up and down, giggling into their hands. ""What a hot receding hairline!""

""Come on, Fred, that's enough. Let's go!""

""Oh, Sax, don't be like that. They're cute! Maybe we can make some friends here?""

""Shut up.""

Sax stormed off, leaving a cloud of artificial maple leaves in his wake.

The girls kept calling after him until he disappeared behind a hill.

Fred shrugged apologetically, then followed his friend. When he caught up with him, he put his hand on his shoulder. But Sax brushed it off.

""Get your fingers off me.""

""Hey, don't be like that. They were just paying you compliments.""

Sax stopped abruptly, made sure they were out of sight of the young women, and then looked grimly at Fred.

""Don't you understand anything? Anything at all? Apart from the fact that this was harassment, it's highly concerning. I am in all the magazines! They put my pictures there without even asking me. We're living in the age of shamelessness!""

""That was the 2020s. And by the way, nobody reads Esquire…""

""Just wear a hat, then no one will recognize you!""

""Then my bald spot will get even worse.""

""That's not true. I don't know how long this stupid misconception has been around, probably hundreds of years, but it's not true. It's proven that wearing a hat does not affect the number of hairs on your head.""

""Really?""

""Here,"" Fred fished a burglar's hat from his coat pocket.

Sax hesitated. Then he took it gratefully and put it on.

""Keep that thing on your head. I can lend you a men's bra, stuff some socks in it, and no one will recognize you. Everyone will think you're simply a modern man with beautiful proportions.""

Sax stared at Fred for a long time. Then he hugged him.

""Thanks.""

""It's all right, my friend, it's all right. I always say, friendship is like brotherhood, and brothers are forever."" Fred added, almost swallowing his lower lip and his eyes sparkling.

""When do you say that?""

""All the time, I say it constantly.""

""I've never heard you saying that.""

""It's from Carlos Nishimura.""

""Damn, can you stop? Who the hell is this damn Carlos Nishimura? It's been the fiftieth time you mention him today.""

""Shsh. No cursing, please; we're still in public, and neither your hair nor your flat chest is that much a giveaway of masculinity than your cursing; keep that in mind.""

""You're right, Fred. For fuck… I am sorry. So who is this Carlos Nishimura? You keep mentioning him!""

""You really don't know him, do you? And yet, I think he would be great for you! He writes self-help books for the ultrarich. How to be happy when you're rich. A real big bestseller. My favorite chapters were: Being rich without being wasteful. For example, washing and reusing coffee filters, using coffee grounds for cleaning, ordering the cheapest dish on the menu instead of automatically going for the most expensive, which is not necessarily the best. Oh, or the chapter about growing watercress in your garden instead of tropical fruits from Greenland or bamboo shoots from Japan!""

""Why do you read such crap? You're neither rich nor unhappy.""

""How do you know that?""

""I am rich and unhappy, and I don't read such a crappy book.""

""But Sax! You're the living proof that Carlos Nishimura's book isn't garbage. You do exactly what he describes, all the time! Living in a tiny apartment even though you could afford ten villas.""

""I only live here because of the window, man!""

""You're riding a bike because you don't have a car.""

""Because it's more fun!""

""You even wash your coffee filters and reuse the coffee grounds!""

""I use my coffee grounds to fertilize my watercress!""

Sax paused to think. Then he continued with the same fervor. ""And that crappy book is supposed to be a bestseller?""

Fred took a deep breath, ready to defend his favorite book. ""Millions and millions of copies have been sold, my hyper-potent friend.""

""Your favorite book sucks. Why don't you read something good, like Civilizations of the Jupiter Moons by David Van Däniken?""

But Fred was already somewhere else – they had reached the end of the park, and in front of him, in old, fading letters, painted on a wooden board, appeared the words The Handle Handler.",1,1746526024.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

However, there are strict rules…most notably, the past cannot be changed, and one must return before the coffee gets cold. Through four interconnected stories, the novel explores themes of love, regret, and closure as people revisit moments with those they’ve lost or left behind. With its quiet charm and emotional depth, the book gently reminds readers of the importance of cherishing the present and the people in it.

And yet I find it extremely hard to actually make friends as an adult (I’m mid thirties, married with a child). We moved to a new city a few months ago, and while I’ve met a bunch of people, I wouldn’t say I made any friends.

Here are some examples: 

- I joined a FB group for moms in the area and went to one of their meet up twice. Sure, everyone there is friendly to each other, and I even felt like I really hit it off with one mom there, we talked for ages and exchanged numbers, but afterwards she never reached out. I reached out twice, inviting her to a bbq, and another time to just meet for a coffee, but both times she had an excuse why she can’t meet. She has ghosted me since. I’ve messaged to other moms as well, also with little success.

- I joined a sports club, where I work out and play tennis. Most people there aren’t really into talking, they’re just there to work out or play tennis. Everyone is friendly, but I can tell nobody is really interested in connecting.

Has anyone else found it super hard to make friends as a non-young adult? Especially as a parent? I used to think it was so easy to make friends. In college I made 25 friends on my first day, that I hung out with multiple times a week. Of course I’m not expecting the same to happen, but I just wish it was easier. Any other suggestions?

(I’ve actually made my therapist cry telling her my story). 34 F, turning 35 soon. Unexplained infertility. Healthy, active and pretty much changed my life to be optimal for fertility. Been trying for 5 years. Tried naturally for 2 years, 4 IUIs, 2 rounds IVF, 5 failed transfers (one with 2 embryos). All failed to implant except one. Finally got pregnant and found out at 21 weeks my baby boy wasn’t viable and had to TFMR. Announcing our pregnancy and then having to tell people we lost the baby was the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me. Had residual scar tissue, so I then had to have a follow up surgery. Isn’t that just the most depressing stats you’ve seen? 

My doctor recently told me that she doesn’t think it’s an implantation issue. She thinks the egg quality isn’t good enough. Almost all of our embryos have been 3 or 4 CB/BC. I have one more embryo to transfer (total of 7 which I am thankful to have gotten, but wtf how can none of them be viable). She basically said, “I would have thought you’d be pregnant by now”. That hurt. I don’t feel confident they can help me get better quality embryos, they just recommend a similar protocol every time. 

At this point I feel like I’m just putting on a brave face and going through the motions but I don’t feel hopeful. Then, I feel guilty and think I’m not manifesting hard enough. But after 5 years it just feels like I’m gaslighting myself into thinking this time will be different. It’s now at the point where drinking coffee or having a sweet treat are an act of defiance in my mind, like if I do it I’m sabotaging everything. 

I’m now also struggling with the idea of trying again or getting an egg donation. (See I have already written off the embryo in the freezer). Honestly I’m over it and kind of want to just stop — but my amazing husband wants to be a dad so bad. I want to keep going for him. I know if I got pregnant I would be so happy, but I just feel so isolated (on purpose, people are naive and can’t handle my reality, it makes them uncomfortable or worse, I would become their brunch story “my friend did IVF and…”)… I just feel stuck.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The lighthouse candles available on the market in 2025 exhibit a range of features designed to enhance their aesthetic appeal and functionality.

**Rotating Light Mechanism:** Some high-end lighthouse candles incorporate a rotating light mechanism powered by the candle's heat.

This innovative feature mimics the authentic experience of a real lighthouse, where a focused beam of light sweeps across the horizon. The rotation is driven by convection currents generated by the burning candle, eliminating the need for batteries or external power sources. This adds a dynamic visual element to the candle, making it a captivating centerpiece in any room. The speed of rotation can vary based on the candle size and the design of the mechanism.

**Detailed Architectural Design:** The best lighthouse candles boast intricate detailing that replicates the architectural nuances of famous lighthouses.

These details can include accurately scaled windows, meticulously crafted railings, and faithfully reproduced tower structures. The level of detail is often achieved through advanced molding and casting techniques using materials like resin, metal, or high-quality ceramic. The precision in replicating these architectural elements contributes significantly to the candle's overall aesthetic value and its ability to serve as a conversation piece. Some models are even painted with weather-resistant paints to simulate the effects of sea air and aging.

**Scent Infusion Technology:** Modern lighthouse candles often incorporate advanced scent infusion technology, ensuring a consistent and long-lasting fragrance.

This technology involves carefully embedding fragrance oils throughout the candle wax, allowing for a gradual and even release of scent as the candle burns. The fragrance profiles typically lean towards marine-inspired aromas, such as sea salt, ocean breeze, and driftwood, complementing the lighthouse's nautical theme. The scent infusion process is designed to prevent the candle from becoming overpowering, ensuring a pleasant and subtle aromatic experience that enhances the ambiance of the room.

**High-Quality Wax Blend:** Premium lighthouse candles utilize a blend of high-quality waxes, such as soy wax or beeswax, to ensure a clean and long-lasting burn.

These wax blends are chosen for their superior burning properties, minimizing soot production and maximizing the candle's burn time. Soy wax, in particular, is a popular choice due to its sustainable and eco-friendly nature, derived from renewable resources. The use of high-quality waxes also contributes to a more consistent scent release, ensuring that the fragrance remains balanced throughout the candle's lifespan. This attention to wax quality elevates the overall user experience, providing a cleaner and more enjoyable burn.

Key features of the best lighthouse candles include:
 * Realistic rotating light mechanisms
 * Intricate architectural detailing
 * Advanced scent infusion technology
 * High-quality wax blends for clean burning

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about lighthouse candles:

**How long do lighthouse candles typically burn?**
 The burn time of a lighthouse candle can vary depending on the size of the candle and the type of wax used.

Larger candles with multiple wicks may burn for longer periods, while smaller candles will have a shorter burn time.

# Best Linen Table Runner 2025: Reviews & Guide

The linen table runner is more than just a piece of fabric; it's a statement of style, a touch of elegance, and a practical addition to any dining setting. In 2025, the market is saturated with options, each promising to elevate your table d茅cor.

[[Browse top-rated linen table runner on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=linen+table+runner)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal linen table runner combines aesthetics with functionality. Considerations include the quality of the linen, the dimensions, the ease of care, and the design details.

**Material Quality:** A high-quality linen table runner should be crafted from 100% pure linen or a high-linen blend. The fabric should feel substantial yet soft to the touch, indicating a tight weave and durable construction. Look for linen that has been pre-washed or pre-shrunk to minimize shrinkage after cleaning and improve its texture. The best linen becomes softer and more beautiful with each wash, adding to its longevity and appeal.

**Dimensions and Sizing:** Table runners come in a variety of sizes, and choosing the right one is crucial for achieving the desired aesthetic. Consider the size and shape of your table when selecting a runner. A runner that is too short will look awkward, while one that is too long can overwhelm the table. A general guideline is to allow the runner to hang down approximately 6-12 inches on each end of the table. Standard lengths typically range from 70 to 108 inches, with widths varying from 13 to 16 inches.

**Care and Maintenance:** Linen is a naturally durable fabric, but proper care is essential for maintaining its beauty and longevity. Look for table runners that are machine washable and dryer-safe. However, be mindful of washing instructions; some linen may require gentle cycles and low heat to prevent damage or excessive wrinkling. Ironing, while not always necessary, can restore the runner's crisp appearance, especially for formal occasions. Stain resistance is another valuable feature, with some runners treated to repel spills and minimize staining.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of a linen table runner should complement your existing d茅cor and personal style. Options range from simple, minimalist designs to more elaborate patterns and textures. Consider the color, pattern, and overall aesthetic of the runner in relation to your tablecloth, placemats, and other table settings. Neutral colors like white, beige, and gray are versatile choices that can be easily paired with different styles, while bolder colors and patterns can add a pop of personality to your table. Embroidered details, scalloped edges, or hemstitch accents can further enhance the visual appeal of the runner.

Key features of a high-quality linen table runner include:

*   Durable and high-quality linen fabric
*   Appropriate dimensions for various table sizes
*   Easy care and maintenance with machine washable options
*   Aesthetically pleasing design that complements various styles

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen linen table runner offers a multitude of benefits, enhancing both the visual appeal and functionality of your dining space.

**Elevated Aesthetic Appeal:** Linen table runners instantly elevate the aesthetic of any table setting, adding a touch of sophistication and elegance. Whether you're hosting a formal dinner party or enjoying a casual meal with family, a linen runner can transform the ambiance of your dining area. Its natural texture and subtle sheen create a visually appealing focal point, enhancing the overall dining experience.

**Protection and Practicality:** Beyond its aesthetic value, a linen table runner also serves a practical purpose by protecting your table from scratches, spills, and heat damage. It acts as a barrier between hot dishes and the table surface, preventing unsightly marks and stains. This is especially beneficial for delicate or antique tables that require extra care. Additionally, the runner can help absorb spills and prevent them from spreading, making cleanup easier and minimizing potential damage.

**Versatile Decorating Option:** Linen table runners are incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of ways to enhance your home d茅cor. They can be draped across a dining table, coffee table, or console table, adding a touch of texture and visual interest to any space. You can also use them to create a layered look by pairing them with tablecloths, placemats, and other table linens. Linen runners are also suitable for various occasions, from casual gatherings to formal events, making them a versatile addition to your home d茅cor collection.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about linen table runners:

**How do I choose the right size linen table runner for my table?**
   To determine the appropriate size, measure the length of your table and add 20-36 inches to account for the overhang on each end. This will ensure that the runner drapes elegantly over the edges. The width typically ranges from 13 to 16 inches, but you can choose a wider runner for a more dramatic effect.

**Can I machine wash my linen table runner?**
   Yes, most linen table runners are machine washable. However, it's essential to follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Generally, it's recommended to wash linen on a gentle cycle with cold or lukewarm water and a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach, as it can damage the fibers and cause discoloration. Tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry to prevent shrinkage and wrinkles.

**How do I remove stains from my linen table runner?**
   Act quickly to treat stains before they set in. Blot the stain with a clean, damp cloth, avoiding rubbing, which can spread the stain. For stubborn stains, pre-treat with a stain remover specifically designed for linen or delicate fabrics. Follow the product instructions carefully and test it on an inconspicuous area first. After pre-treating, launder the runner as usual.

Chapter 1- My body Mia POV  
  
“Mia, Mr. Polanski confirmed on the phone, I can come with you tonight at the club,” My friend Rizza told me on the line.  
  
I heaved an intense breath, “Okay, thank you, girl. I shall message you tonight. I needed to go to the hospital first.”  I answered back, looking at the clothes I was folding before Rizza called.  
  
“Perfect, see you and… you got to think twice babe… but no matter what…I love you,” she said before hanging up the call.  
  
I dropped the shirt that I was holding before sitting down on the bed. Heaving another deep breath, I closed my eyes. ‘you got to think twice, babe,’ those words rang in my head.   
  
I got to think twice. I was about to entangle myself in a mess. It wasn’t that I wanted, but I had to. Life was on the line if I didn’t do this. My friend Rizza suggested borrowing money from Mr. Polanski, a well-known underground club owner here in California.   
  
He owned about twenty party clubs that weren’t just ordinary clubs but people in different social classes and society patronized. He was rumored running a prostitution den, but no one could actually prove it.   
  
A not-so-old man in his fifties who came from a European race was involved in a secretive mob group in West Los Angeles, but apparently, the latter was another rumor.  
  
The money that I would be needed was for my older sister Jennifer, who was recently diagnosed with Kidney or renal failure. Jen was my life. It was only her and me in this world. No mom that we knew of and just a dad who died in a horrific accident five years ago when I was fifteen and Jen was eighteen.   
  
Jen had been staying in the hospital for the last two months, luckily she had health insurance, but It wasn’t enough. The doctor said she needed a kidney transplant as soon as possible. Her health coverage didn’t approve to pay for the operation for some absurd reason, which meant we have to produce money amounting to 300,000 US dollars.   
  
We have no resources or funds for that enormous amount of money. Jen was a freelance columnist and part-time editor at one of the publishing houses in the city. And me? I was a struggling actress, been doing extra or cameo roles in some television series in Hollywood.   
  
My friend Rizza introduced me to one of the staff and crew working in television when I was a teenager. I’ve been doing it for three years since I finished High school. I opted to enter acting school to enhance my skills in front and behind the camera. I hadn’t landed any prominent roles, just small ones enough for me to earn a few hundred dollars in a day’s work.   
  
Although I was becoming a part of the acting group and went to production school, I mainly wanted to be a part of behind the scene production. My main job on the production set was as a wardrobe assistant and part-time makeup artist. It was the nearest job I got after spending my ass for two years in drama school.  
  
‘Ding’ I heard my phone ring, sending me back to reality. I looked at my phone. It was from Rizza.  
  
Babe, fifty-grand was too much, Mr. Polanski told me, but he said he could make some arrangements for you… I know you are aware of what It meant”   
  
I clutched my old iPhone tightly. My eyes glistened. I was going to loan about fifty grand for Jen’s operation. The hospital agreed to a down p\*\*\*\*\*t of the total cost of her surgery. I had no choice but to agree with what Mr. Polanski meant possibly.  
  
I typed, ‘Okay, thank you. I shall see you soon,’ and sent it right away. There’s no turning back. It was about Jen’s life versus my life. Jen was my life. If she didn’t make it, I would be nothing. Jen was my support after our Father died. She worked her ass for me to send to the school. She did everything for me, and I will do anything for her.  
  
I checked my time, and It’s already half-past one. It’s Saturday, and I could see the sun from my room’s window was bright and shining outside. I stood up and continued packing the shirts and clothes that I would bring to the hospital.   
  
Once I was done, I prepped myself up and organized the clothes that I would need tonight.   
  
\~  
  
Jen was lying in her hospital bed, and her eyes were closed, but I knew she wasn’t sleeping. I arrived about five minutes ago and just watched her silently. Her pale skin, like mine, was paler and yellowish. The same shade of dark hair that we shared was getting lesser and dry. I couldn’t help but feel blue seeing her in that condition. She was energetic and healthier, but too much dedication to her work costed her health.   
  
“Hey…” I whispered, brushing Jen’s arm. Jen stirred up, and her eyes widen soon as she saw me.  
  
“Oh, Hi, my baby,” she mumbled, trying to get up and give me a hug.  
  
“Careful,” I said as I help her to sit on her bed. She then hugged me, and I hugged her tightly.   
  
Her Dialysis treatment was keeping her alive and well. She could actually go home and visit the hospital for her treatment, but since I was working full time, I couldn’t take the risk of leaving her alone at home.  
  
“Jamie is outside to get some coffee. Did you see him?” Jen said.  
  
Jamie was our childhood friend and Jen’s boyfriend for eight long years. They were teenage lovers since seventeen. He was such a nice guy, and he loved my sister so much that I treated him as my older brother.  
  
“No, I didn’t, but I brought his newly washed clothes. All his office and casual clothes are on that bag,” I told Jen, pointing at the big bag on the couch.  
  
“Thank you, love. He would be happy again to know that,” Jen said, smiling at me,  
  
“Oh, I know. I am grateful for Jamie’s here with us.” I said as I arranged the flowers I bought for Jen at the table,  
  
“Yes, without him, I’d be down and scared. I wished I would be healed soon. Jamie told me about the loan he was going to ask for from his company. I know how big the money we are needing, but I promise, once I am okay and healthy, I will do anything for you,” Jen said.  
  
I smilingly looked at Jen, walking towards her before holding her hand.   
  
“Don’t think anything about paying us back. You are not asking us for a favor. We are doing this to you because we love you. We will get over this, Yes?” I said, assuring her,   
  
Jen looked at me in the eye, and her blue orbs glistened. “I love you, Mia Elisa,” she said,  
  
My eyes gleamed in tears, knowing what I was about to embroil myself was for her to survive and give her another chance in life.  
  
“I love you too, Jennifer Louise,” I said, hugging and kissing her forehead,  
  
“I love you three!”   
  
I heard said the voices coming from behind us. Jen and I both turned our heads and saw Jamie at the door holding two coffee cups and a paper bag,  
  
“Hey, Mia belle!” Jamie greeted me.  
  
He walked towards me and handed me a coffee. I smiled and took one cup before I hugged his six-foot-four inches’ tall, lean body back. I was looking small at my five-foot-five inches’ flat height.  
  
I broke the hug, and Jamie walked around on the other side of Jen’s bed, giving her a peck on the lips.  
  
“I saw you at the entrance carrying a massive bag, so I thought of buying your favorite caramel macchiato from Starbucks,” he said, “And I brought your fresh cranberry juice,” he added, looking at Jen.",1,1746525330.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

hapter 1 Two Bitches Perfect for Each OtherJuly, Seattle   
  
Julie Finch opened the door of the coffee shop, and noticed the woman sitting in the corner.  
  
She was wearing a lavender dress, and looked beautiful in spite of her pale complexion. She stood up immediately upon seeing Julie.  
  
“I thought you were still angry, and wouldn’t come to see me,” the woman said.  
  
Julie bit the bullet, casually sitting down, and eventually began to speak. “Of course I’m not angry with you. Can’t you see that I’m only playing cat-and-mouse with you?”  
  
The woman looked surprised, and like she was about to cry.  
  
“I know you blame it on me. But when he said he wanted to be my boyfriend, he never talked about you. If I’d known you were still together, I wouldn’t have agreed to.”  
  
Never talked about her? Jasmine sure knew how to make Julie feel worse.  
  
Julie Finch smiled coldly, and laid her phone down on the table.  
  
Was she pretending that she, Jasmine, was blind? The background of Julie’s phone was a blown-up picture of Andrew Parker. She must have seen it.  
  
Julie got up close to her face, and sneered: “But you have slept with him! What can I do?”  
  
The woman began to cry. “It’s all my fault! Hit me if it’ll make you feel better...”  
  
Then she wanted to grab Julie’s arms in provocation.  
  
“Hit you?” Julie slapped her hands away, and grinned at her. “It would make my hands dirty.”  
  
The woman looked guilty. “If you don’t do it, I’ll do it myself...” Then she began to slap her own face.  
  
Julie looked down at her own clenched fist. For the first time, she realized that they’re quite similar. They both pretended to be someone they were not.  
  
That woman pretended she was poor and innocent, and Julie pretended she was strong!  
  
Because that woman knew that being innocent can get her what she wants, and Julie knew that only when she’s strong like a hedgehog can she protect what she deserves.  
  
Julie didn’t react to Jasmine’s slaps, and that woman felt so embarrassed after her manic fit. Her tears kept falling.  
  
“Sister, I’ve slapped myself. Please tell me what I can do to make you forgive me!”  
  
“Don’t beg her!” A man walked into the coffeeshop, and quickly wrapped Jasmine up in his arms.  
  
Julie was frozen in place, and she couldn’t process what was happening.  
  
Last night, Jasmine had called her, and drunkenly begged Julie to pick her up.  
  
But Julie had witnessed the two having s\*x in his room. And apparently it hadn’t been the first time they’d done this.  
  
She had confronted Jasmine on that day, and had wanted to know that woman’s intentions. But to her surprise and annoyance, Jasmine had pretended to be innocent in front of Andrew. That b\*\*\*h!  
  
Looking at them, Julie clenched her jaw, and rolled her eyes. “Andrew, don’t you remember that I’m your girlfriend?”  
  
“But I love Jasmine!” Andrew glanced at her coldly. “I only used you as a shield!”  
  
Julie sneered. For the past five years, she had driven away all the women trying to get close to Andrew, and she had even considered giving up her career for him.  
  
But she hadn’t expected that all her efforts would be in vain when it came to this woman.  
  
“Then I should congratulate you both. You two bitches are perfect for each other.” Then Julie turned on her heel, and rushed out.  
  
If she were to slow down her pace, she might start crying.  
  
After getting in the car, she stepped on the gas, and the vehicle jolted forward.  
  
Then she noticed that Jasmine had followed her, and was running towards her car as though she wanted to kill herself for her sins.  
  
Julie was terrified, and sharply turned the wheel, without noticing the car immediately behind her.  
  
Boom!  
  
Her used Alto was wrecked! Luckily, the car behind her hadn’t been moving too quickly, or she would have been dead.  
  
But the other car was still an armoured off-road vehicle—a Knight XV!  
  
Julie came from a rich family, but she didn’t have much money of her own. She could barely afford a tire...

1kg0k45,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/1kg0k45/from_excel_to_access/,From Excel to Access ?,"Hi,

  
Even after reading the FAQ (which is really well made btw), I'm not totally sure if I've to keep on using Excel as I've always done or use Access + Excel.

  
Right now, I'm using a tab in a large Excel file as a database with 50 columns / 4700 rows. Each month, I'm adding data to this database and that's all in terms of modifications. The only other action I do on this database is filtering it sometimes when I need to look at something specific. There is some calculation in this database (age and a few other things). All the other tabs in this file are dedicated for the analysis (19 tabs, each one is unique).

  
My main problem is that each time I'm doing an action on the database (mainly filtering), it takes more and more time as the database is getting bigger. The fix I've found is to copy my database tab so I've a database with minimal calculation involved, then I filter or update my data and then I copy/paste to my main tab and make a coffee during the update.

  
My idea is to remove this database tab, use Access for this instead and keeps all the analysis tabs on Excel. Will it helps with the lag ? Does Access is a better tool than Excel in my case ? What's your advice ?",1,1746525097.0,MSAccess,3,1.0,False

1kg0hjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1kg0hjv/best_vpns_for_virginia/,Best VPNs for Virginia,"In today's digital landscape, protecting your online privacy has become more important than ever, especially for Virginia residents. With the state's evolving privacy laws and cybersecurity concerns, having a reliable VPN has moved from being a luxury to a necessity. Whether you're looking to secure your data, access geo-restricted content, or simply maintain anonymity online, this comprehensive guide will help you choose the **best VPN for your specific needs** in Virginia.

# Why Virginia Residents Need a VPN in 2025

Living in Virginia comes with its own set of digital privacy considerations. The state implemented the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) which went into effect in 2023, with new amendments expanding protections in 2025. While this legislation offers some safeguards for consumers, it doesn't completely shield you from all privacy risks.

I remember last summer when I was working from a coffee shop in Richmond and received an alert about suspicious login attempts to my banking app. That experience was a wake-up call - even in a state with decent privacy laws, your digital footprint is never completely secure without additional protection.

# Virginia's Unique Privacy Landscape

Virginia's approach to internet privacy has evolved significantly. The VCDPA gives residents rights to access, correct, delete, and opt out of the sale of their personal data. However, there are still gaps in protection, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks or when your data crosses state lines.

As someone who frequently travels between Virginia Beach and the DC area, I've noticed how my internet connection varies greatly depending on my location. This inconsistency highlights the importance of having a reliable VPN that works seamlessly across the state.

# Top 5 VPNs for Virginia Residents in 2025

After extensive testing and research, I've identified the five best VPNs that offer superior protection, speed, and features specifically beneficial for Virginia users:

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall VPN for Virginia

**Key Features:**

* Military-grade AES-256 encryption
* 5,500+ servers across 59 countries
* Dedicated IP addresses available
* NordLynx protocol for lightning-fast speeds
* Threat Protection Pro feature to block malware
* Dark Web Monitor to alert you of data breaches

NordVPN consistently delivers the best combination of security, speed, and usability, making it my top recommendation for Virginia residents. During my tests across various locations in Virginia, NordVPN maintained impressive speeds even during peak hours. When I connected to their servers from Virginia Beach, I experienced only a minimal 7% reduction in my normal internet speed.

The Threat Protection feature is particularly valuable for those who frequently use public Wi-Fi in places like Tysons Corner Center or Virginia Commonwealth University campus. It blocks malicious websites and scans downloaded files for malware, adding an extra layer of security beyond standard VPN protection.

**Price:** Starting at $3.39/month with a 2-year plan (includes 4 months free)

# 2. ExpressVPN - Most Secure VPN for Virginia

**Key Features:**

* Best-in-class encryption with quantum-resistant features
* TrustedServer technology (RAM-only servers)
* 3,000+ servers in 105 countries
* Lightway protocol for fast, secure connections
* Extensive third-party audits
* Perfect forward secrecy

ExpressVPN stands out for Virginia users who prioritize security above all else. Their TrustedServer technology ensures that no data is ever written to a hard drive, which is particularly important given Virginia's data protection laws regarding breaches of personal information.

I tested ExpressVPN extensively in Alexandria and Charlottesville, and was impressed by its consistent reliability. When accessing banking websites and government portals, ExpressVPN maintained secure connections without triggering any security alerts or requiring additional verification steps.

**Price:** Starting at $6.67/month with a 1-year plan

# 3. Surfshark - Best Value VPN for Virginia

**Key Features:**

* Unlimited device connections
* CleanWeb ad and malware blocker
* Camouflage Mode for extra privacy
* Alternative ID tool for online forms
* GPS spoofing on Android devices
* Rotating IP feature

Surfshark offers exceptional value for Virginia families or small businesses needing to protect multiple devices. The unlimited connections policy means you can secure every device in your household with just one subscription.

I particularly appreciate Surfshark's Alternative ID feature, which creates a fake persona to fill in online forms when you'd rather not give your real details. Living near the Northern Virginia tech corridor, I'm especially cautious about my digital footprint, and this feature has come in handy numerous times when signing up for services that don't need my real information.

**Price:** Starting at $2.19/month with a 2-year plan

# 4. Private Internet Access (PIA) - Best for Virginia Server Coverage

**Key Features:**

* Dedicated Virginia servers (including Richmond)
* 10 Gbps network for buffer-free streaming
* Open-source applications for transparency
* SOCKS5 proxy included
* Port forwarding capability
* Split tunneling for app-level control

PIA shines for Virginia residents needing local connections. With servers specifically in Richmond, PIA provides the fastest possible connection for local services while still maintaining privacy.

During the winter months when many Virginians work remotely, I've found PIA's split tunneling feature invaluable. It allows me to route only certain apps through the VPN while keeping local services on my regular connection - perfect for accessing work resources securely while still using local streaming services without interruption.

**Price:** Starting at $2.03/month with a 2-year subscription

# 5. Proton VPN - Best for Privacy-Conscious Virginians

**Key Features:**

* Based in Switzerland with strong privacy laws
* Secure Core servers for enhanced security
* NetShield ad blocker and malware protection
* Perfect forward secrecy
* Transparent, open-source code
* Free tier available

Proton VPN is ideal for privacy-focused users in Virginia, especially those concerned about data sovereignty. Since Proton is based in Switzerland, it operates under some of the world's strongest privacy laws, providing an extra layer of protection beyond Virginia's state regulations.

I tested Proton VPN extensively in Norfolk and Blacksburg, and found its NetShield feature particularly effective at blocking trackers. This is especially relevant for Virginia residents, as the state's Consumer Data Protection Act has specific provisions regarding tracking and profiling of consumers.

**Price:** Free tier available; Premium starts at $4.99/month with 2-year plan

# VPN Features Virginia Residents Should Prioritize

# Strong Encryption Standards

Given Virginia's position as a tech hub with many government contractors and cybersecurity firms, the state is a prime target for sophisticated cyber threats. Look for VPNs that offer AES-256 encryption at minimum, with additional features like perfect forward secrecy.

# No-Logs Policy

While Virginia has enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act, there are still concerns about data collection by ISPs and third parties. A strict no-logs policy ensures your VPN provider isn't storing data that could potentially be compromised or requested by authorities.

# Kill Switch Functionality

This feature automatically disconnects your internet if the VPN connection drops, preventing accidental exposure of your real IP address. This is particularly important in Virginia Beach and other tourist areas where public Wi-Fi networks can be unstable.

# Multi-Factor Authentication

With cybersecurity threats on the rise in the Commonwealth, having an additional security layer beyond passwords provides crucial protection for your VPN account.

# How Virginia's Data Privacy Laws Impact VPN Usage

Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) represents a significant step forward in privacy rights for residents. The law, which came into effect in 2023 with new amendments in 2025, gives consumers the right to:

* Access their personal data
* Correct inaccuracies in their data
* Delete their personal data
* Opt out of targeted advertising
* Opt out of the sale of personal data

However, even with these protections, a VPN remains essential for several reasons:

1. The VCDPA has exemptions for certain entities and data types
2. It doesn't prevent your ISP from seeing your browsing activity
3. It offers limited protection when using public Wi-Fi
4. It doesn't help with accessing geo-restricted content

# Using VPNs with Virginia's Popular Services

# Streaming Services

Many Virginia residents subscribe to local streaming services like Dominion Energy's streaming platform or want to access regional sports networks. Some VPNs work better than others for these specific use cases.

NordVPN and ExpressVPN consistently unblock most streaming platforms while maintaining good speeds, which is crucial during UVA basketball games or when catching up on local news programs.

# Online Banking

Virginia is home to several regional banks like Atlantic Union Bank and Chesapeake Bank. When accessing these financial institutions online, security is paramount.

I've found that ExpressVPN and NordVPN work especially well with Virginia-based financial institutions, rarely triggering security alerts while providing the encryption needed to protect sensitive financial data.

# Educational Resources

For students at Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, or George Mason University, accessing educational resources securely is important - especially when using campus Wi-Fi.

Proton VPN and Surfshark offer excellent features for students, including affordable plans and the ability to bypass certain network restrictions that might be in place on campus networks.

# Common VPN Issues in Virginia and How to Fix Them

# Connectivity Problems in Rural Areas

Parts of Southwest Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley still struggle with reliable internet connections. If you're in these areas, look for VPNs with lightweight protocols like WireGuard or Lightway that work better on less stable connections.

I've personally tested NordVPN in Bath County and was surprised by how well it performed even with a spotty cellular connection. The key was selecting their NordLynx protocol, which is optimized for weaker network conditions.

# ISP Throttling

Some Virginia internet service providers are known to throttle certain types of traffic, particularly streaming and gaming. A good VPN can help circumvent this issue by masking your activity from your ISP.

When Cox Communications was slowing down my streaming speeds in the evenings, switching to ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol immediately resolved the issue. The difference was like night and day - HD streaming went from constant buffering to smooth playback within seconds of connecting.

# Compatibility with Smart Home Devices

The Northern Virginia tech corridor has one of the highest adoptions of smart home technology in the country. Setting up VPN protection for these devices requires router-level implementation.

ExpressVPN and NordVPN offer the most straightforward router installations, with detailed guides specifically for popular models used in Virginia homes.

# Setting Up Your VPN for Maximum Privacy in Virginia

# Optimal Server Selection

While connecting to servers in neighboring states like Maryland or North Carolina might seem logical for Virginia residents seeking best performance, sometimes servers further away actually perform better due to internet routing architecture.

In my testing across different Virginia cities, I discovered that NordVPN's New York servers often provided better speeds than their DC-area servers when accessing certain services - contrary to what you might expect based on geography alone.

# Recommended Security Settings

For maximum privacy protection under Virginia's legal framework, I recommend enabling:

* DNS leak protection
* IPv6 leak protection
* OpenVPN with UDP (or NordLynx/Lightway where available)
* Always-on kill switch

# Mobile Device Configuration

When configuring VPNs on mobile devices in Virginia, enable settings that protect you when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks automatically.

I've set up my devices to automatically connect to NordVPN whenever I join unknown Wi-Fi networks, which has been invaluable when working from various coffee shops around Richmond's growing coworking scene.

# VPN Speed Test Results Across Virginia

I conducted extensive speed tests across different regions of Virginia to compare how each VPN performed:

|VPN Provider|Northern VA|Richmond|Hampton Roads|Roanoke|Avg. Speed Reduction|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NordVPN|92 Mbps|88 Mbps|85 Mbps|79 Mbps|\~15%|
|ExpressVPN|89 Mbps|82 Mbps|80 Mbps|76 Mbps|\~18%|
|Surfshark|85 Mbps|80 Mbps|78 Mbps|72 Mbps|\~22%|
|PIA|82 Mbps|86 Mbps|77 Mbps|70 Mbps|\~24%|
|Proton VPN|78 Mbps|75 Mbps|72 Mbps|65 Mbps|\~28%|

\*Tests conducted on a 100 Mbps base connection

# Legal Considerations for VPN Use in Virginia

Using VPNs is completely legal in Virginia and throughout the United States. However, it's important to remember that a VPN doesn't make illegal activities legal - it simply provides privacy for legitimate online activities.

Virginia's cybercrime laws are quite comprehensive, with the state maintaining a dedicated cybercrime task force. Using a VPN responsibly means:

* Not engaging in copyright infringement
* Not attempting to bypass security measures for unauthorized access
* Not conducting illegal activities online

# Final Verdict: The Best VPN for Most Virginia Residents

After weighing all factors including performance across different Virginia locations, security features, pricing, and compatibility with local services, **NordVPN** emerges as the best overall choice for most Virginia residents.

Its combination of outstanding security features, reliable performance across the state, ability to unblock local content, and reasonable pricing makes it suitable for the majority of use cases. The addition of Threat Protection Pro provides comprehensive security beyond what most competitors offer.

For those extremely focused on maximum privacy protection, ExpressVPN is worth the premium price. Budget-conscious users who need to protect multiple devices will find Surfshark offers exceptional value without major compromises.

# My Personal Experience Using VPNs in Virginia

Living in Virginia for over a decade, I've used various VPNs across the state's diverse geography - from the beaches of Virginia Beach to the mountains near Blacksburg. My perspective has been shaped by real-world usage rather than just technical specifications.

Last winter during a power outage, I needed to access work files securely using my neighbor's Wi-Fi. NordVPN's quick connect feature got me protected in seconds, and the kill switch prevented any data exposure when the connection briefly dropped. These real-world scenarios have convinced me that having a quality VPN isn't optional in today's connected world - it's essential.

Whether you're a tech worker in Northern Virginia's cybersecurity corridor, a student at one of Virginia's prestigious universities, or simply someone who values their online privacy, investing in a quality VPN service provides peace of mind that your digital life remains private and secure.

Remember that the best VPN for you ultimately depends on your specific needs, but starting with one of these top recommendations will put you on the right path to better online privacy and security in the Commonwealth of Virginia.",1,1746524797.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False

""Here for your usual fix?"" he asked, raising an eyebrow. 

Without thinking, I shot back, ""Maybe I'm just here to see you?"" It was one of those moments where you say something flirty and then immediately regret how awkward it sounds.

He chuckled and replied, ""Well, I'm flattered, but I'm not as sweet as the caramel syrup."" 😅

So the thing about my mil is that she is so clingy to my husband, she texts him everyday all day ( do you know that talking stage in the relationship where you giggle on your phone with your partner, Waiting for his response , And texting on multiple apps?) that’s what mil is giving …She texts him everywhere,  sharing memes , gossiping about other people you name it …

The thing is , my husband is the opposite. He doesn’t respond or if he does he gives her short vague responses … she is also nosey , she demands he must talk to her about everything including our relationship obviously, and when he doesn’t ,she guilts him that he doesn’t love her , he doesn’t make the first attempts to chat  etc ….My husband loves traveling, and she told him that he should call her everyday , she can’t sleep without hearing from him while he is in another country, now my husband does the bare minimum, he just sends her a thumbs up 👍 to let her know that he is fine , then she can sleep …

But my husband is not like this with his dad , His dad doesn’t over text or call , they both give each other breathing space …husband calls his dad like 2 times a week  and fill in each other with what’s going on in each one’s life , some times they even go out for a coffee . 
father in law invites us for lunch at his house like 1 or 2 times a month and it’s always fun , we all chat and it’s always looks genuine.. it’s always a different fun when you meet someone not so often compared to someone you meet every day.  On the other hand MIL demands to meet us often and pushes for family time and sometimes we just be on the dinning tables with nothing to say , at the end of the day everyone is on their phones and it’s boring ..Or she would start putting her nose in our relationship since there is nothing to talk about ..start making us fight, Gossip about me to husband , Manipulation etc … But that’s not why I am here 

I want to advise her to look into therapy because she has unhealthy attachment issues to her son , It has always been like this for my husbands entire life since he grew up with only her , he says he already said too much growing up and she never listens , she always threatened him that she will delete herself , Crying, Guilt tripping, etc …and now he is tired of trying …

But I want us to have the same relationship with her like we have with FIL ..I want us to look forward to her family lunch or dinner invitations not just going because it’s an obligation …I want husband to give her a call when he goes for his trips and tell her how much fun he is having without her demanding he checks in with her everyday .. I want to see him have a normal relationship with her ..what do you guys think ? Should I just stay out of it ? Given what she pulled with me , I would be the last person giving her grace . But I feel for her , at the end of the day it’s his mother. ",2,1746524342.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

She loved the rich aroma of freshly ground beans, but lately, her coffee had started tasting a little... off. It wasn’t terrible, but there was a faint bitterness she couldn’t ignore. At first, she thought maybe it was the beans, but after trying a new bag, the problem persisted. That’s when she realized she hadn’t cleaned her grinder in months. Actually, now that she thought about it—maybe ever.

She did what most people would do: grabbed her phone and searched, “best way to clean a coffee grinder.” As she scrolled through forums and blog posts, one method kept popping up: using rice to clean the grinder. People claimed it worked like magic, picking up leftover grounds and oils. Curious, Emma decided to give it a try.

She poured about half a cup of plain white rice into the grinder and ran it for 30 seconds. The noise was a bit louder than usual, but the rice started turning into a dusty powder. When she opened the lid, she was surprised to see the rice had turned slightly brown, picking up all the built-up residue from the grinder’s blades and corners. She dumped it out, gave it a quick wipe with a dry cloth, and was amazed at how clean it looked.

Feeling optimistic, she ground a fresh batch of beans the next morning and made her usual cup. The difference was immediate. The bitterness was gone, and the flavor was brighter and cleaner. It was like she had a new grinder.

Later that week, she learned another trick from a coffee forum: if her grinder was a burr grinder, she could actually take parts of it apart for a deeper clean. Someone suggested using a small brush—like a pastry brush or even an old toothbrush—to reach into the nooks and crannies. She tried it, and sure enough, there was even more old coffee dust hiding inside.

Emma made it a habit to clean her grinder with rice every couple of weeks and do a deeper clean once a month. Not only did her coffee taste better, but the grinder also seemed to be running more smoothly. It turned out that taking care of the little things—like cleaning a grinder—made a big difference in her daily routine.",1,1746523711.0,KitchenHack,0,1.0,False

Forget stuffy textbooks or endless lectures—this program is about real, messy, exhilarating growth. From day one, you’re diving into experiences that challenge you, push you, and shape you into someone who can inspire, adapt, and make things happen. As someone who’s been through the grind, here’s the lowdown on the **top 10 leadership skills** you’ll walk away with, packed with heart, humor, and honesty.

**1. Strategic Thinking**

You’ll learn to see the forest *and* the trees. Through case studies and hands-on projects, you’ll get good at spotting trends, connecting dots, and planning for the long haul. It’s like becoming a business fortune-teller, always one step ahead of the game.

**2. Decision-Making Under Pressure**

Ever had to make a big call with zero time to think? The PGP MBA throws you into high-stakes scenarios—think group projects with looming deadlines or simulations where every choice counts. You’ll learn to stay cool, weigh your options, and make decisions that hold up, even when the clock’s ticking.

**3. Communication Skills**

If you’ve ever fumbled a presentation or blanked on how to explain your big idea, this program’s got you. From pitching startup ideas to leading class debates, you’ll sharpen your ability to speak clearly, write persuasively, and charm the socks off anyone. You’ll find your voice, and it’ll be a game-changer.

**4. Team Management**

Leading a team sounds glamorous until you’re juggling clashing personalities and tight deadlines. Group projects will teach you how to delegate without micromanaging, motivate without being cheesy, and sort out drama like a pro. You’ll turn a ragtag crew into a squad that gets stuff done.

**5. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**

Leadership isn’t just brains—it’s heart. Through late-night group work, mentor chats, and moments where you’re forced to look in the mirror, you’ll get better at reading people, building trust, and keeping your cool. It’s the secret sauce that makes people want to follow you.

**6. Adaptability and Agility**

The business world is like a plot twist in a movie—you never know what’s coming. The [**PGP MBA**](https://ismspune.in/pgp-mba) throws curveballs, from last-minute project changes to fast-paced simulations. You’ll learn to pivot, rethink, and keep going, no matter how wild things get. You’ll be the leader who laughs in the face of chaos.

**7. Innovation and Creativity**

Got a wild idea? This program will fan that spark into a flame. Through design thinking workshops and real-world business challenges, you’ll learn to dream up solutions that are fresh, bold, and downright clever. It’s about breaking the mold and building something new.

**8. Ethical Leadership**

Being a leader means doing the right thing, even when it’s hard. Courses on sustainability and corporate governance will drill that into you, but it’s the discussions and real-world dilemmas that hit home. You’ll learn to lead with integrity, earning respect that lasts.

**9. Networking and Relationship Building**

Your network is your superpower. Guest lectures, alumni meetups, and internships will throw you into rooms with big names and bigger ideas. You’ll learn to make connections that feel genuine, not schmoozy, and build relationships that open doors for years to come.

**10. Vision and Purpose**

The[ PGP MBA ](https://ismspune.in/pgp-mba)isn’t just about skills—it’s about finding your *why*. Through workshops, late-night chats with classmates, and moments of clarity, you’ll figure out what kind of leader you want to be. You’ll walk away with a sense of purpose that lights you up and drives everything you do.

**Your Leadership Journey Starts Here**

By the time you finish your PGP MBA at ISMS Pune, you won’t just be ready for a job—you’ll be ready to lead with guts, heart, and a vision that’s all your own. These skills, earned through sweat, laughs, and maybe a few late-night coffee runs, will set you up to tackle any challenge and inspire everyone around you.

Just got back from a 6-night stay at **Excellence Playa Mujeres** with my partner (we're both in our early 30s), and I figured I’d drop a full review for anyone considering it. I’ve stayed at a good number of all-inclusives in Mexico and the Caribbean—some high-end, some meh—and this one definitely lands near the top. I’d give it a **solid 9/10** overall.

# First Impressions – Smooth & Classy

From the second we pulled up, you could tell this place runs like a well-oiled machine. Check-in was easy, we were handed champagne and cool towels, and the whole process took maybe 10 minutes. The lobby smells like heaven (seriously, they pipe in some kind of spa scent). It just *felt* peaceful—no loud music, no stress, just calm vibes.

# Our Room – Swim-Up Suite Goals

We booked a **Swim-Up Junior Suite** in the Excellence Club section (worth the upgrade IMO), and yeah… wow. The room was huge, spotless, and the bed was super comfy. There’s a little outdoor daybed and two loungers right in front of your private pool section. Morning coffee out there was next-level peaceful.

Also: double vanities, a rain shower big enough for two, and a giant Jacuzzi tub right next to the bed (cheesy? Yes. Fun? Also yes).

# Food – Surprisingly Great for an All-Inclusive

I’ve had some pretty “meh” food at all-inclusives, but this place brought their A-game.

* **Chez Isabelle (French)** – Probably our favorite. The filet was melt-in-your-mouth, and the escargot was weirdly awesome.
* **Basmati (Indian)** – Solid spice and flavor. We weren’t expecting much, but it ended up being one of the best meals.
* **Agave (Mexican)** – Authentic and delicious. Get the mole enchiladas if they’re on the menu.
* **The Lobster House** – Perfect for a sunset dinner by the water. Great grilled lobster and shrimp.

The breakfast buffet at **The Kitchen Table** was huge. Omelet station, smoothie bar, pastries, Mexican dishes, and everything in between. You won’t go hungry, that’s for sure.

# Drinks – Top-Shelf All the Way

The bars don’t water things down here. Everything is **top-shelf**, and they’re happy to make you something off-menu if you ask. We had killer espresso martinis at the **Martini Bar**, and I was way too into the tamarind margaritas.

The pool and beach drink service was hit or miss depending on how busy it was, but generally solid.

# Pools, Beach, and Chill Time

There are like… a million pools, and each has its own vibe. We usually hung out at the quieter pool near our building, but popped into the main one for some swim-up bar fun a few times. Never had to fight for a chair, which is rare.

The beach? Gorgeous. Soft white sand, super clean, calm water. Not the bluest I’ve seen, but still beautiful. Waitstaff came around pretty regularly with drinks, and there were plenty of cabana-style beds available (no early towel game needed).

# Entertainment & Extras

Nightly shows were decent—not Broadway or anything, but fun to watch with a drink. We caught a rock show and a mariachi night. They also had some cool low-key stuff during the day like sushi-making and tequila tastings.

We splurged on a **couples massage** at Miilé Spa and yeah… absolutely worth it. It’s pricey, but the hydrotherapy circuit and ambiance make it feel like a full-on experience.

# Service – Basically Flawless

Everyone we dealt with was genuinely nice and on top of their game. Housekeeping was consistent, the concierge was helpful when we wanted to set up a special dinner, and restaurant staff actually remembered our drink orders.

They also went out of their way to help celebrate my partner’s birthday with decorations and dessert without us even asking. Classy touch.

# Final Verdict – 9/10, Easily

If you’re looking for an **adults-only, upscale all-inclusive** that isn’t stuffy, Excellence Playa Mujeres is hard to beat. It nails the little things: comfortable beds, great food, friendly service, and legit relaxation. The only reason I’m docking a point is because service at the beach could be a *bit* slow during peak hours, but that’s nitpicking.

We’d absolutely go back—and we’re already eyeing their sister property in the Dominican Republic for our next trip.

1kg0649,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LowDance5801/comments/1kg0649/i_went_on_a_date_of_my_break_up/,I went on a date of my break up.,"My ex reached out after three months of silence, asking to meet up. I went, hoping we could sort things out, but spoiler alert: I came back feeling totally disappointed. Not wanting to go home in tears, I decided to sit on the stairs of the metro station to collect myself. Just then, I got a text from a guy I’d been chatting with for about a month, asking to meet up. In a moment of spontaneity, I agreed to go on a date with him, even though we had never met in person. He was a bit mysterious and hadn’t shared much about himself—not even his full name!

I suggested we meet at the metro where I was sitting. It was raining that day, and he pulled up in his car. We were on the phone trying to figure out who was who when I finally laid eyes on him. Wow! He was absolutely handsome—6'2"", fair-skinned, with curly hair and warm brown eyes. Knowing I had just been dumped, he brought me fries and coffee. 

For some reason, he started playing sad songs and encouraged me to let it all out. And guess what? I did! I cried like a waterfall. 

Then he casually mentioned he had some vodka and rum in his car from a party he’d hosted the night before. In my emotional state, I didn’t say no. I ended up having four vodka shots and three rum shots—yikes! He didn’t drink because he was driving.  He touched my chin and said I looked cute, then kissed my cheek while my tears were still flowing. 

He started playing with my hair and soothing my head, and it felt so comforting that I ended up resting my head on his lap and dozing off for about an hour. But then he casually mentioned he wanted nothing serious, so I cut him off and never met him again. 

Oh, and just a little side note: I had done some light stalking before meeting him. Turns out he was an ex-journalist and a yoga teacher, with a family that had a political background. Plus, he was seven years older than me. What a whirlwind of a day!",1,1746523451.0,u_LowDance5801,0,1.0,False
1kg05rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kg05rr/the_ultimate_betrayal/,The ultimate betrayal,"I have been with my husband since 2019 (on and off). We always had our differences but in the end of the day we loved each other. Recently I gave birth, but my pregnancy was not pleasant. I truly couldn’t stand my husband. We would fight all the time so I thought it would be best if I took some time away and go stay with my family. So we didn’t talk much during that time. After I have given birth he comes and says I don’t want to have anymore children (this is our second child). I have always told him of how I want a big family so that truly hurt to hear him say that. I told him I respect your decision therefore I think we should part ways. He later confessed that the reason he doesn’t want to have children is because he doesn’t want any additional ties to me. I cried. And a lot. It hurt hearing that from him. After a couple of days of being distant while living together he came and apologized. We moved on from this. 

A month later I find out that when he was living with his roommate while I was pregnant they got really close. They would go out together, she would go with him to the doctors and so on. I asked him about her for months. He always downplayed their relationship. 

Me being upset I called his mom. I told her what had happened with his roommate. Mind I was sobbing because of how much this hurt me. She said she’ll speak to him. I overheard their conversation and she knew the whole time. He starts to say to her you know my wife she’s crazy. She always makes things bigger. They proceed to have an hour long conversation about me. He tells her “I come home every night and I eat alone she doesn’t even care about me. She gave me food to take this morning to work and I told her I don’t want, she’s crazy I don’t know what she would put in it.” 

For context I moved across country to be with my husband for his work. I paid all moving cost because he didn’t have it at the time. I don’t know how to cook at all. Everyday I make a dish so I can start learning to cook. I set the table whenever I can while dealing with two kids so we can eat together. Everyday I ask him what he wants to eat and he’ll find it ready when he comes home. He complained about coffee prices I went and bought a coffee machine for the house. I have done everything I can to make sure this man I comfortable and happy in his home. 

He continues to talk about me to his mom and says “these women are strong (he’s referring to me and my mother) you give them a finger and they want a leg.” ME!! He’s saying this about me. I brought him to the US. I worked for a whole year washing cars during COVID so I can bring him to the US. I Paid for our whole wedding. And he says this about me. So much more was said in this conversation about me that truly broke me. 

He doesn’t know I heard the whole conversation. I don’t know what to do. I feel so disrespected. If I ask him about he will deny everything. Please someone guide me.

Currently, I’d say I’m somewhat stable. My last episode was about a year and a half ago, and it was relatively mild compared to the ones before. I recently had to quit my job, but that was more due to a stress-related situation.

During that time, my girlfriend made sure I kept taking my medication. Despite having some burnout-like symptoms, I never actually slipped into a full episode. In the past, when I’ve gone off my meds, I did experience episodes. I’ve never fully believed in my diagnosis, though. I always thought it was more likely MDD or seasonal depression — or even ADHD. Later, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD, which made me feel validated, and after that, I never really took my meds consistently. My psychiatrist is aware of my history with poor compliance.

I still argue that I’ve never experienced a “real” hypomanic or manic episode. Mixed episodes, maybe — I can recognize those — but I’m still not convinced. My entire family believes I’m bipolar. But I don’t.

And here’s the irony: since my girlfriend started making sure I take my meds regularly, I’ve been way more stable — but I actually miss those energy spikes. You know, the ones where it feels like you took five Adderall at once, where music hits so deep it’s almost overwhelming, where everything is exciting, and I feel hyper-enthusiastic, confident, energetic, and super social. Honestly, it felt like being on a way-too-high dose of a stimulant. I know how that sounds.

To be clear: I never felt like those states lasted long. I wouldn’t even say they went on for more than a few days. And they usually happened *within* a depression — kind of randomly. Sometimes it felt incredible; other times it was agonizing, like being stuck in between.

So here’s my point: I don’t believe I’m bipolar, and yet… I miss those mood spikes that only seemed to happen when I was off meds or unregulated. I can’t really explain it — it’s just this gut feeling.

I’m fully aware of the concept of agnosia and how common it is in bipolar disorder. I can also see the evidence: I’m more stable on meds, and people around me have told me how different I act. But it just doesn’t *click* in my head.

I constantly try to rationalize it. I tell myself things like:  
""Well, ADHD can come with serious mood dysregulation,"" or  
""Maybe I’ve just been drinking way too much coffee,""  
—even though I’m aware that some of my behaviors don’t really line up with that. Still, my brain keeps going:  
""Maybe I just get depressed in winter and then super hyped from an ADHD hyperfixation,"" or something along those lines.

And yet… I miss the state or feeling that I supposedly *shouldn’t* want back?  
I have a check-up appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and want to bring all of this up.",1,1746523221.0,BipolarReddit,1,1.0,False

1kg03jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charmdate/comments/1kg03jo/charmdate_review_dating_in_east_europe_and_the/,CharmDate Review: Dating in East Europe and the United States,"To be honest, like most of the guys in the US, before I use **CharmDate** I started with Tinder. It was fun, relaxing, and it really wasn't hard meeting someone for a coffee. I went out with a couple of girls, and it was cool, but I always felt something was missing. It was more like “let's see where this goes“ rather than “I really want to get to know you.“

With time, my curiosity (and a couple of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMyAOqn2zo4) about eastern European girls) urged me to try some dating sites like CharmDate (alright majorly for the stunning pictures). I thought why not? If anything, it would be an interesting experience. Well, it really was.

The first thing I noticed on girls of CharmDate was femininity. Seriously, these girls don't go out of the house without makeup and outfits like they're going to the red carpet. Even for a regular video call. I remember when I was dating a girl Relia from Romania, once she said how she wouldn’t turn her camera on with me because she just woke up and did not put on makeup. I thought she was joking. She wasn't.

* **On one hand, it is great** – you feel like you're dating someone from the movie and she genuinely puts extra effort on herself to look gorgeous for her man. But on the other hand, sometimes I just wished we could eat a burger in regular sweats, to hang out without pressure and tension, but the glamour is always present. That's the thing with their culture and you need to get used to it. Honestly, bravo to them for taking care of themselves like that, but sometimes it is really exhausting.
*  **One other thing – paying bills.** In America, it is normal to split bills, especially on first few dates when you are at the get-to-know phase. Most of the American girls I dated insisted we split it, and I respected it. But on CharmDate and with eastern European women in general - that's out of the question. It is expected from a man to pay for everything – dinner, coffee, even water if it is necessary. It's not out of benefit, it's simply their way. To be a gentleman it means to take care of the bill. I was first confused, but in time the idea grew on me – I felt more manly and appreciated.
* **And of course – family values.** Americans, at least the ones I went on dates with, value their freedom and independence more than anything ( I am no exceptional otherwise I wouldn’t still be here talking about dating sites. ;)) It is perfectly normal for American girls to enjoy dating when they are in their thirties, and only then they will start to think about serious relationship and marriage. But most of the Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian girls I talked to on CharmDate already think about marriage, kids and serious things – in their twenties! Most of girls put themselves out there not for fun but for long term relationship moving forward to marriage eventually. They have a clear vision and serious approach to relationships. And that was a real refreshment for me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**I'm not saying one is better that the other** \-it depends what you're looking for. If you want something casual, American way is for you. But if you're looking for settling down and someone who thinks long term, CharmDate gives you a better chance for it.

Overall, dating people from different cultures really taught me a lot – about expectations, communication, even myself. It is not always easy, but if you are open-minded and really want to get to know someone, platforms like CharmDate can totally change your perspective. I’ve had some amazing conversations, made real connections, and yeah, I even got ghosted once or twice (hey, it happens everywhere).

So whether you're swiping right or trying CharmDate for something more serious, just know the *dating world is huge*—and sometimes, the best match might just be across the ocean.",5,1746523151.0,Charmdate,0,1.0,False

1kg02wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electronicscience/comments/1kg02wa/what_is_a_low_pass_filter_and_why_its_everywhere/,🎧 What is a Low Pass Filter? (And Why It’s Everywhere in Electronics),"If you’ve ever adjusted the **bass** on a music player, filtered noise from a signal, or worked with sensors, chances are — you've already used a **low pass filter** (LPF). But what exactly is it?

# 📘 What is a Low Pass Filter?

A **low pass filter** is an electronic circuit that **lets low-frequency signals pass through**, while it **blocks or reduces high-frequency signals**.

Think of it like a coffee filter:

* The **coffee (low frequencies)** gets through.
* The **grounds (high frequencies)** get trapped.

It’s like a gatekeeper saying: “Only the calm, slow signals can pass. The noisy, fast ones stay out!”

# 🔍 How Does It Work?

The most basic low pass filter uses just **two components**:

* A **resistor (R)**
* A **capacitor (C)**

Together, they create a frequency-dependent response:

* At **low frequencies**, the capacitor behaves like an open path, and signals go through.
* At **high frequencies**, the capacitor acts like a short circuit, redirecting the signal away from the output.

https://preview.redd.it/blqj0dp9p4ze1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c64fe0d490e859a556fc140e70cc8dfac24382

The point where the filter starts to block higher frequencies is called the **cutoff frequency (fc)**, calculated as:

    fc = 1 / (2πRC)
    

# 🛠️ Types of Low Pass Filters:

There are different flavors depending on where and how they're used:

* **Passive Low Pass Filter:** Just R and C (no external power needed).
* **Active Low Pass Filter:** Uses an op-amp for better performance and amplification.
* **Digital Low Pass Filter:** Implemented via software in digital systems like microcontrollers and DSPs.

# ✅ Where Are Low Pass Filters Used?

You might be surprised — LPFs are **everywhere** in tech and everyday gadgets.

# 🎶 1. Audio Systems

* Remove high-frequency hiss and static.
* Shape the bass in speakers and amplifiers.

# 📡 2. RF and Communication

* Filter out unwanted high-frequency noise in radio receivers.
* Improve clarity in signal transmission.

# 📷 3. Image and Video Processing

* Reduce sharp edges or noise (called anti-aliasing) in digital cameras.

# 🔍 4. Sensors and Microcontrollers

* Clean up analog input signals from sensors (like temperature or motion).

# ⚙️ 5. Power Supplies

* Smooth out voltage ripples in DC power outputs.

# 💡 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine driving on a highway where **only slow-moving vehicles** are allowed past a checkpoint. That's exactly what a low pass filter does — it lets the “slow movers” (low frequencies) through, and stops the fast ones.

# 🌍 Why It Matters

In an age where everything is digital and connected — **clean, accurate signals are gold**. Low pass filters help us extract the meaningful part of a signal while keeping the noise out.

Whether you’re designing a smart device, building an audio app, or developing a sensor-based system — understanding LPFs is a **must-have skill** in your electronics toolkit.

# 🧠 Final Thought

A **low pass filter may be a simple concept**, but it’s one of the most **powerful tools** in electronics and signal processing. It proves that sometimes, **less is more — especially when it comes to frequency.**

Want to dive deeper or build your own LPF circuit? Let me know, I’d be happy to help!

Class had already been going for ages—and today’s Chinese class had a quiz. Li Ersen was definitely going to be pissed. Damn you, Zhang Yingfang. This was all your fault.

I jogged back to the classroom, panting like a dying bull and clutching the doorframe.

“Please take your seat, Mr. Bai,” Li Ersen said calmly.

The wind gently blew across his face, tousling his short blond hair. He adjusted his black-rimmed glasses with one hand, his eyes narrowing in suspicion.

“Care to tell me where you’ve been, Bai Feng?”

“Zhang Yingfang called for me!”

“Got it. I’ll ask Dean Zhang about it later.”

He didn’t believe me, clearly—but I was telling the truth, so why should I care?

I slumped into my seat and stared at the completely blank test paper in front of me. I twirled my pen in frustration. It’s not like I *wanted* to rebel. I just couldn’t understand the questions. Seriously, can someone tell me what the hell *‘Laiwang wu bailing’* is supposed to mean in plain Chinese?

Time ticked by. Most of the class had finished and were taking a nap. Meanwhile, my paper was still as empty as when I’d started. Li Ersen happened to walk by, took a glance, and sighed audibly.

“You don’t know a single answer?”

“Obviously. Isn’t it obvious?”

“How do you even get by? Some of these questions are dead simple. You could get them just by thinking a little.”

“Yeah, but if I write them wrong, I’ll have to fix them. Too much work.”

“How do you know they’re wrong if you don’t even try?”

…That actually made sense. Maybe I *should* give it a shot.

I picked up my pen and started scribbling away at the answers, one by one.

Li Ersen gave a rare, satisfied smile and walked away quietly.

*Laiwang wu bailing*? I’m pretty sure I’ve got this one right!

“‘None of my lovers ever ate white citrus fruit’...? Wait, what?”

“Are you serious?”

“I thought we were supposed to rewrite it in everyday language!”

“Ugh… if this is what high school’s come to, maybe just drop out now.”

“Hey! Watch it, teach. That’s not cool.”

Li Ersen pinched the bridge of his nose and stared at me like I was a walking headache.

“Come see me after school. We need to talk.”

What the hell? First I got dragged to the dean’s office this morning. Now this? What did I ever do to deserve this life?

After school, the place felt like a damn haunted house. Empty halls. No students. Not even a stray cat. Just the wind rustling through dead leaves.

The corridor lights flickered as I made my way to the faculty office. It looked pitch-black from the outside. Don’t tell me I got stood up?

I gently pushed open the glass door, peered around to make sure I was alone, then stepped inside.

The lights were on, but most teachers had already left. Only Li Ersen sat there, blankly staring into space.

“What do you want? Make it quick. My driver’s waiting outside.”

He pulled a paper from a stack of books beside him—my test. Crosses and red ink everywhere. The score? Too tragic to look at.

“Happy with this result?”

I didn’t know how to answer, so I stayed silent.

“I taught most of this in class, and you still can’t score over sixty. What are you going to do about high school?”

“Screw around, I guess. I’ve got two years left, right? Worst case…”

“Worst case, what? You don’t go to college? Is that how little ambition you have?!”

I shrugged, eyes drifting around the room.

We bickered like old enemies. Good thing no other teachers were around—we’d probably get kicked out.

Suddenly, a shadow flitted across the window. I rushed over and yanked it open, stabbing my knife into the empty air. Nothing. No one.

“Still working late, Mr. Li? So dedicated.”

That voice—I’d recognize it even in hell.

I turned around. Speak of the devil—it was Zhang Yingfang.

“Dean Zhang! You worried about me?”

Li Ersen’s tired expression flipped instantly into a radiant smile.

But Zhang Yingfang didn’t return the sentiment. In fact, he looked irritated. He spun his keyring with a glare, then leaned in and muttered something in Li Ersen’s ear before leaving.

Whatever he said, it worked—Li Ersen froze in place, all color drained from his face.

“Mr. Bai, go home. Mr. Bai is waiting outside for you. And you too, Li Ersen—I’m locking up.”

I didn’t know what just happened, but I wasn’t about to stick around. I waved goodbye and bolted toward the gate.

White was leaning against the car, smoking and glaring at his phone like it had wronged him.

“Did that damn brat get stuck in school or what?”

“Brat? You mean me?”

I strolled up casually, watching his annoyed face twist into a scowl.

“Oh\~ Are we grumpy?”

“I’m not grumpy.”

“Sure, sure. Your face says *‘I’m absolutely pissed.’* Chill, man.”

White snapped his cigarette in half and barely kept from chucking his phone.

“Get in. We’re going home.”

Uh-oh. White’s mad. Guess I’d better start warning him when I’m running late, or he’s gonna keep throwing tantrums like this.

Once home, I threw my jacket onto the couch and stretched before heading upstairs.

White picked it up with a sigh, dusted it off, and hung it properly.

“Master Bai, your mail.”

He handed me a black envelope—no return address, no sender, just *Wu Baifeng* in sharp ink. Shady as hell.

I grabbed a letter opener and carefully slit it open.

Inside was a movie ticket—and a letter.

“Mr. Baifeng, I’d like to invite you to a lovely weekend movie outing. Would you be free?”

Who the hell has this much free time? Don’t people hate me?

The ticket was for a 10:30 AM screening at Xier Cinema tomorrow. I didn’t have any major plans, but since I didn’t know who sent it, I’d better play it safe and skip it.

“White, who sent this?”

“Found it in your jacket.”

White tilted his head, clearly sensing my hesitation.

“You could just… change your appearance.”

That hit me like lightning. Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?

The next morning, I threw on a plain T-shirt and jeans, styled my hair differently, and went full stealth mode: hat, mask, the works.

“Wow. You really went all out, sir.”

“I have to. What if they’re a threat to the Wu family? Don’t worry—I’ll be careful.”

And off I went, heading to Xier Cinema.

I stood by the stone pillar at the entrance, scanning for suspicious figures. Twenty minutes left before showtime.

Where the hell was this person?

Sick of waiting, I decided to go in. I wasn’t gonna get unlucky enough to sit next to them, right?

“Sir, may I see your ticket?”

I handed it over. The clerk scanned it and frowned.

“Sorry—only seat A13 is left.”

Damn. I should’ve gotten in earlier.

I hurried toward the theater, only to find something odd: the system showed it as full, but the place was empty.

I gripped my blade and cautiously sat down.

“Hey, you’ve got the wrong room.”

“Nope… This is my seat.”

I handed the ticket to the guy beside me, confused.

He slowly took off his hat. Golden hair spilled out, and his glasses cleared, revealing sapphire-blue eyes.

“Li… Ersen?”

“Hmm? Do I know you?”

He looked at me, completely blank.

The movie was a heartfelt comedy, which only made the atmosphere creepier.

Li Ersen munched popcorn, eyes glued to the screen. No chatty couples, no snoring old men, no screaming kids kicking seats. It should’ve been the perfect movie setting—but I couldn’t relax.

Why the hell did he rent out the whole cinema? Why sit *right next* to me?

“Want some? It’s strawberry flavor.”

He shook the popcorn tub in front of me.

Strawberry—my favorite. But now it felt like poison. He could’ve drugged it.

I shook my head and held my knife tighter.

“Want to grab coffee after? There’s a rabbit café nearby.”

“Sure… Whatever you say.”

Let’s see what trick you’ve got up your sleeve, Li Ersen. I’m not letting you touch the Wu family.

After the movie, we hit the rabbit café. I ordered a caramel macchiato and sat down.

The rabbits were adorable. If not for my allergy to long-haired animals, I’d take one home.

“Here you go—two caramel macchiatos.”

Why did he order the same thing as me? Coincidence? Or did he already know who I was?

“Sigh… I was hoping Mr. Baifeng would come. Too bad he gave the ticket to you.”

“He had plans. Gave it to me last minute. What did you want from him?”

He sighed again and stirred his drink.

“You knew him before, right? Was he always this unfocused in class? He’s really given up lately… I’m not even his homeroom teacher, but I wanted to offer tutoring. Ask him what days he’s free. Midterms are coming—I hate seeing him throw his future away.”

His sapphire eyes shimmered with worry. His blond hair had a few silver strands.

Maybe… maybe I was wrong about him?

But still, who goes this far just to tutor a student? Renting out an entire theater?!

“I’ll let Baifeng know. Thanks for your concern. I’ll make sure he studies.”

After dessert, I walked home and told White the whole ridiculous story.

“Don’t sweat it. You’ll get used to it. His family’s loaded and bored. He used to act the same with your father in school.”

Li Ersen was in the same class as my dad? So… he was Zhang Yingfang’s student too?

Advice I can find online is mainly given in grams of coffee, but this data is quite variable and therefore not very helpful.  I did find a claim that the 3-cup is approximately 50ml, but consensus seems to be that the 6-cup does not hold twice as much grounds as the 3-cup.  My best guess is that the 6-cup is too small and the 9-cup too large.  

Also, are there aftermarket funnels for the 6-cup that are deeper than the original - obviously these would require a water level adjustment, which is fine as I get best results with the base underfilled.

 9-minute delivery, everything arrived on time… except the coffee.  
No big deal, I thought. I’ll just raise a ticket.

What followed was a complete waste of 20 mins just trying to get in touch with a human customer support representative.

I was stuck in an AI loop that kept asking the same question. There was no “talk to a human” button, no escalation, no clarity on what would happen next. After three or four rounds of the same bot responses, my ticket was auto-closed with a generic “issue resolved” message. Out of desperation, I called the delivery guy. He didn’t have to help, but he did. He looped in his manager, who finally arranged for the coffee to be delivered later. The issue was solved but not by the system. It was solved by individuals working *around* the system.

This is not an isolated incident. If we zoom out and look at the Indian startup landscape, you’ll notice a pattern, most startups are optimized for scale, not for service. Customer support is either outsourced, automated too early, or simply ignored.

Founders obsess over growth, fundraising, and retention dashboards but rarely build for what happens *after* the user pays. Support is treated like an expense, not a core product function.

If the product breaks, and it will how do you respond? That’s where trust is either built or broken.  
And if your users can’t reach you when it matters, how long do you really think they’ll stay?

1kfzslw,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1kfzslw/most_difficult_yet_dedicated_client/,Most Difficult yet Dedicated Client,"For Context, I started training this woman when I was 18 and she was 32, I have consistently trained her 1-3 times per week for 3 years.

I’m also not seeking advice on what the do, I am preparing to drop this person very soon, although tips on how to make it strict yet soft would be nice.

Now there’s a lot to unpack but I will try and keep it as brief as possible.

I met her shortly after starting in my first gym, she came to the induction tour and found it great as a made a Jurassic park joke which she is a huge fan of.

She then comes to every class I run the following week (not usual for newcomers to overdo classes, but they were all only mine, again didn’t think too much as I was the only one she knew atp)

She then asks for PT after my Friday class and I say we can do our assessment on Monday. She turns up to my class on Sunday, but she’s the only one- so I said “we can either do the class as normal, or do half your assessment now and the other half tomorrow”

She chose to do the half assessment, so we did, and then tomorrow rolls round and we do the other half- I leave to go for dinner with my partner and sister who has travelled to visit me.

I get to the restaurant and receive a text from said client reading “I’m upset”

Great- “Hey *name*, why’s that?”

“I paid for an hour assessment and you only did 30 minutes”

“Yes, because we did the other half yesterday”

“That wasn’t discussed, and I have paid for an hour and only gotten 30 minutes”

“We did discuss that…”

This goes on over text and she doesn’t get me, so I go on DND to enjoy dinner, and afterward I message her saying “when are you next in, I’d like to refund you the money and you can find another trainer” as even as I was learning the business I knew she was ridiculously difficult.

Anyway, we agreed to meet Wednesday to refund her cash (as that’s when our first session would’ve been) but she turns up to my class on Tuesday evening.

Now I found this strange, especially since we’d just had a sour exchange the night before and I told her I don’t want to work with her- but I can’t kick her from the class so she stays.

At the end of the class she cries and explains that in the class alone I made her hit her 2 big goals (touch her toes and hold her foot)

I felt bad and said “I see how much this means to you, we can continue training” as she said she would let go off the assessment situation.

Anyway, over the next coming months she’d constantly ask to go out for coffee, lunch, dinner, birthdays, events etc. reminder that at this point I’m an 19 year old guy, and she’s a 33 woman, completely different interests. She’s like a Disney adult who still lives with her parents (worst type of people), has the weird dyed pixie cut, proper femcel vibe, and I’m just a standard meathead 19 year old, who wants to grow a business, read books, train and now recently single so putting my testosterone to good use.

So, I set the boundary of personal/professional and she literally cried and made me feel terrible, then put on a sad puppy act and made each session awkward.

Anyway, later down the line her birthday comes and she invites me out, saying the other gym people from classes, some PTs from my gym etc are gonna be there.

I thought fine, my friends and colleagues are there, it isn’t 1-1 hanging out, I’ll go.

She sends me an invite, saying meet at this mini golf place out of town at this time.

I turn up, get inside to the course… it’s just her.

Everyone was meeting for drinks later, she’s effectively captured me in a date trap.

Anyway, not to sever our relationship or ruin her birthday we go through the course, it finishes and I’m like “okay let’s go to the bar to meet everyone” I cycled there (as it was a town over) and assumed she was getting the bus.

She then says she planned for us to walk (like 90 minutes) back together.

I literally said fuck that, then saw a rent-a-bike, got it for her and said we’re cycling (just wanted it over quickly)

Got to the bar. NO ONE.

She had left like a 4 hour gap in between meeting me and everyone else and wanted to spend all that time together.

I literally left her at the bar.

Anyway, over the next year she’s seen this as an “all clear” for hanging out so she constantly asks to go out for a drink, dinner, everything.

Then everytime I shut it down she makes it ridiculously awkward- and a few weeks ago she said she was looking for someone “exactly like me, matter of fact- just you” then saw my awkward look and said “if you were 10 years older”

In the meantime by the way, no matter how I’ve trained her she’s just as fat, no stronger and more complaints than ever.

Final little rant- she tries to find out everything about me. Found my dead YouTube channel as starting relaying facts about me that I’d never told her, always checks my Instagram (literally asks me why I unfollowed a specific person, will notice if I delete old posts or change my bio- I don’t even actively post which shows she’s just checking it daily). As mentioned I had a partner when I first started training her, when we broke up she started going out for drinks with her despite never speaking before which I found really strange and uncomfortable.

We moved to online PT and at this point I’d kinda given up, she complains that I don’t message her enough and communication is bad, which is true I do ignore her messages- but it’s because she never messages regarding workouts or diet, it’s always “look at this cute dog” “I just got this outfit” or inviting me out somewhere, then I said please message me about PT stuff but then it’d be weird questions like a picture of her dinner and she’d say “how much protein is in this” then not be able to answer any questions about ingredients.

I asked her (2 years in btw) after she was complaining about her weight a lot, if she’d be open to trying to track calories and her response was literally “meeeeeeehh” like a kid who didn’t wanna eat vegetables. I asked why did she feel “meh” and she went “just because…. Meeeeeeeh” like what the fuck am I meant to do with that.

3 years in to this and I’ve learned a lot, unfortunately it was all about the worst type of people, and I feel bad as obviously she’s stuck on and stayed committed to me, but as for her progress and the amount of stress she gives it is no longer worth it at all.
So if people have a good way to break the news to her in a way that basically says “I never want to speak or interact with you again but I want you to do well” that doesn’t tarnish reputation or discourage the person too much that’d be great.

Did this more as a rant- but wanted to make it useful for newer PTs on how to never ever get into this situation, as it completely destroyed my passion for PT for a long time (she’s the equivalent to managing 6 other people) and due to making no progress it makes you feel inadequate at your job.



So, 
1- if you see the red flags that someone will be difficult (late on pay, a bunch of stupid excuses off the bat, expecting too much from you whilst they do nothing) just cut your losses, it’s worth going without the extra cash to have less stress and fill it with someone good.

2- if a client invites you out, don’t feel bad about saying no, and be stern in your professional/personal boundaries. Although I did have some clients I genuinely liked and would hang it with, I decided to just never risk it like this again- it also makes them listen to you less the friendlier you are. Much like how parents won’t listen when you tout the benefits of working out, but if they hear a celebrity say they did a juice cleanse they’ll be blending pineapples before the hours done.

3- accept that some people don’t want to get better at the normal rate. Sometimes people are slow burners, but after a while you will be able to determine who would benefit from extra support and who is just trying to drain resources to say they’ve tried everything when they put in no effort.

4- baby reindeer is based on a true story, don’t forget that lol.

Weird situation in my family which I think is unsettling and you know when you just can’t think of a logical explanation that you think ‘yep must be that’.

So my uncle ended his own life a couple of months ago, never had any known mental health, never a mention of anything like that. He was the most funniest, laid back type of guy, never took anything too seriously (I get this CAN be common for suicide for it to not be known it’s coming).

For context, he was a caretaker at a primary school. For a while before they were making his life a misery as I think they wanted the house him and my auntie and cousin lived in, or the council wanted it, so it seemed like the school were on a mission to get him out so they could have the building. He worked there for 19 years and always had a really good relationship with the head teacher and everyone else.

Long story short with the school side of it, the head teacher and business manager were who we believe were the suspects of all of this. The headteacher was giving him unfair disciplinaries which came from nowhere (gave him a last warning when he hadn’t even had a first?), said things to him like ‘oh you didn’t do this and that’ and he said it wasn’t his job to, like book meetings, he said he doesn’t mind attending things but that wasn’t on him. At one point he was kind of unwell and had a problem with his stomach and sometimes would have to nip home to use the loo, they knew this and would say to him ‘you left site blablabla’ and he had to explain every time it was literally to use the toilet. He wasn’t one to take the piss either, he loved what he did, he always went above and beyond. Went it was snowing he’d always be in earlier doing things on the grounds he wasn’t even required to do, earlier than he was supposed to be, and didn’t ever say or ask for anything. He did loads of jobs for the school that were not in his contract to do, but he’d never call a contractor to do, he’d do it himself (what he could manage). You get the gist.

The business manager was closely involved too. I think she was the one who actively made things worse for him verbally, but the headteacher knew what was going on and overlooked everything, as a headteacher does….

Just to add in that my auntie also used to work at the school, as a dinner lady supervisor and cleaner, and they started saying things and making her life abit of a nightmare too.

My uncle would message my mum all the time, light heartedly, but say the school were doing his head in and would fill my mum in what was happening so she knew. He’d had meetings with the union, and a guy who was dealing with him told him incorrect information, and apparently ended up getting sacked, and someone higher said they’d be taking a look into it, and taking over everything, but didn’t get chance to. My mum told him in the end to go off sick due to it and it would give him chance to maybe have a break from everything, so he did. He went to the doctors and ended up being signed off with work related stress. Even after this, the headteacher rung him twice (not sure why, don’t think he answered) but he’d told my mum this, and she said they should NOT be ringing you, they know this.

He didn’t drive and with living on site, he obviously still saw the teachers parking outside his house etc. He had been off on work related stress for maybe about 5/6 weeks?? So not long really… before ending his own life in his home. He get on with his family, didn’t have many friends to have any issues with, was a stay at home with the dogs type of guy, didn’t have any financial problems, and his health wasn’t bad really. He had his stomach issues sorted and it was being managed so apart from that, it was only the odd thing like his shoulder or back going, which is fair enough with him being constantly on the move at work. He had a son who he adored, and everything at home was fine.

He wrote a note which he’d left in the bedroom with him basically saying that work had ‘worn him down’ and he was fed up with always having something wrong with his body, said it’s not family etc- I just find it bizarre. My auntie had said to him that they could literally just find somewhere else to live, and get different jobs. And that’s what they could’ve done as a family just to get out of there and start again. There was so many options…

What’s weird is that my auntie and cousin (aged 24) don’t seemed beside themself. Obviously they seem upset but have just been carrying on as normal. My cousin went back to work after a week, my auntie was going out shopping and getting her nails done still. I get everyone deals with it in their own way, and some people want that normality, but I just find it abit soon, personally.

My auntie has since basically said ‘it wasn’t really the headteachers fault or school fault’ and the family are thinking EH???? How was it not? And has been saying ‘they’ve been really supportive’, I mean they’re going to be aren’t they because they’re probably shitting themselves… she was also fine for the headteacher to go to the funeral if she wanted to. My mum wasn’t fine with this and ended up writing a letter to the school telling them they’re not welcome which I completely agree with. My auntie ended up kicking off saying my mum had no right to do this and if she wanted to go she could. She hasn’t seen any wrong in the school at all, yet knew everything that was going on as she lived and worked with him, and was involved too?

My mum also asked her if she’d be taking it further and she basically said she doesn’t see why she would and I just think, do you not want any justice for him? You just want to get used to him not being here and that’s it? You want to carry on like it’s fine? HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE!? She is also annoyed at my mum that my mum has asked her this and basically stated ‘if me and my son decide to then we will’ so has basically pushed my mum out of the picture and she was his sister, that clearly means nothing to her. She has been pushed out with everything since he passed, and also knows nothing. Every time my mum would ask her something to try get some answers (as obviously my auntie knows the most) and was the one who found him, she doesn’t answer anything at all. They agreed to go for a coffee (was actually my auntie who asked my mum) so she thought oh maybe she’s realised and might open up and talk about stuff with her, and they met and my uncle didn’t even get brought up… how can it not!? It’s SO STRANGE.

Weird things happened since he’s passed; 1.	⁠A day after he died, there was a guy outside the house with a suit on taking photos of the house
2.	⁠At the funeral when people were walking in, my mums cousin had seen a woman running out crying no no, we didn’t see or hear anything, but it wasn’t family as she was family so would’ve recognised them, and it wasn’t a teacher who attended, but also I feel like they wouldn’t of come to represent the school and then been so upset to do that? So we’re like who was this woman
3.	⁠After the funeral, my auntie had said to a distant relative ‘well I probably won’t be involved in the family after this’- why wouldn’t you be? What’s making you say that, as we have all tried with her and my cousin and checked in constantly? So is there more to that?

There’s probably a million and one things I’ve missed, but I just find the whole thing strange, and so do the rest of my family, apart from my auntie and cousin?

Like I require another to make a decision for me because I “can’t” but obviously (everyone) can.

I feel like a guest in my own life.  Like I’m not really running things.  Everyday I wake in fear.  Like every single day I awake in a new hotel where I kind of remember where things are, but don’t want to touch something because maybe there will be a cost to it.  The small one cup coffee maker with the crappy, freeze dried coffee, and powdered creamer, the single serving soaps and shampoos.  But this is (MY) house, (MY) life, and it’s a big one but I’m afraid to move left or right.  It’s a self imposed prison that nobody else sees but me.  The bars, the small 9x5 cell, for me they are all there, but it’s only in my imagination clearly.  Nobody else sees them.  And living with me, I can’t even imagine what that is like, honestly.  Hell on Earth?

Of course, the people closest to me feel imprisoned in the same cell withe me, because that is what a lot of loving someone does, but it’s not fair to the other person.  It’s pathetic, insane, and soul destroying to love someone like me.

I need to break free from the cage in my mind.  I’m scared, shocked that my life is like this now, how much I have hurt the most important people in my life, and besides cutting and running to go be in my personal cell - somewhere else, I don’t know what to do.

I… just within the last 8-9 days realized I’m a narc.  I’m middle aged, been married almost 22 years, I have a daughter at an Ivey league school who is very ill, a son going off to college, and a wife who’s life (with me) I have completely ruined, and a wants me out!!

I just got through chemo for leukemia, I’m in remission now not cured, I’m bitter, sad, flailing, twisting in the wind, and I need to grow up and start behaving like a man.

Any suggestions besides therapy which I have probably done 1000 hours of?

I’ve been physically, sexually, and emotionally abused in my family of origin, I know it shaped my fear and invisible prison walls, but I want to shed this skin and start not being such a whore or people pleaser, coward, and stand on my own two feet where I won’t hurt anyone anymore.

Any help, support, guidance is appreciated.

1kfzn2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1kfzn2o/sd_doesnt_want_to_work_at_a_place_where_she/,SD doesnt want to work at a place where she doesn’t agree with their political views,"Since September SO and I have been pushing SD to apply for scholarships/grants to help pay for college. We always got a lot of attitude about it. We also pushed her to apply for a part time weekend job. Same thing. She’d drag her feet, give quick short answers when asked if she’d heard anything back. She starts asking for more facial piercings, shaggy haircut, and jokes that chik-fil-a won’t hire her if she has a crazy amount of piercings. We never told her to apply there and I don’t think she did. However, that comment made me realize she was most likely trying to self-sabotage her chances of getting hired if she drastically changed the way she looks. Anyway, her dad pushed her to apply for a popular coffee chain. She did, to multiple areas, and is pretty vague/reluctant to share if she heard anything. As we were going through the drive thru of said coffee chain, she orders a tea… dad asks if she’s heard anything back and she angrily says no. Starts getting hostile and says she doesn’t want to work at this place. He asks why and she says because she doesn’t agree with their political views… yet she ordered tea… anyway, we leave it at that. Fast forward to today, she just celebrated her 18th birthday and we had a heart to heart. We tell her that we’re not gonna push her to get a job at any place she doesn’t want to work, but that she is expected to help pay for college. Supply her own fun money, and pay for her car insurance. 
Then I bring up the political reasons for not working at certain places. I say “1. It’s ok that you don’t want to work there because of your political views. But why did you support them by ordering a tea?” She says “well… I tried not ordering for a while, but as you and dad kept going I slowly ordered more things too.” I say “ok. If you are going to hold to that belief you need to stand firm on all fronts. You can’t only hold that belief when it’s convenient for you. Because then it looks like you’re just going with the flow of others and being fake. Plus it would hurt a business more not to give them money than it would if you received money from them.” Then I asked “2. Do you judge the people that work there?” She says “no…” I said “how bout your dad? His views don’t align with his workplace, but he has to think about providing for us. Do you judge him for that?” She says “no.” I say “when your dad was your age and he had you and your mom to provide for he had to take whatever job was hiring. His political views came after his family. The same goes for me when I moved out on my own. Getting to choose where you work or don’t based on political views is a privilege that most people don’t have. Especially in today’s economy with the amount of people losing their jobs or struggling to provide. If you wouldn’t judge me, your dad, or the coffee place employees why would you feel judged for working there?” She says “because other people do judge them for that online.” I say “that’s really sh*tty of those people, they don’t know the employees situation and life story. They don’t know the goals they’re working towards or why they have to work in the first place.” She’s quiet and I say “if you choose not to work at that place because of your views that’s ok! We’re ok with it. But understand that if you can’t find a job that you agree with and decide not to work, the consequence of that might be that you don’t get to go to college.” She nods. 
Afterwards she gives me a kiss on the cheek and says she loves me. And I keep replaying the conversation in my head hoping that I made sense. That I wasn’t being unfair, that what I said was reasonable. I just want her to grow into an independent, stable, young person who can take care of herself. I’m not sure what tag to put on this, I wanted to share this story and do want feedback. I’m interested to hear other perspectives if there are any. I tried to get feedback from my SO and he just said it was a good conversation and agrees with what I said. ",0,1746521155.0,stepparents,6,0.25,False

# Chapter 1 - Curiosity about Dad

“I need to taste you right now, Evelyn.” Mark’s voice is thick with desire. “Get your ass up here.” Mark is all stretched out on my bed, six-foot-five inches of tanned, brawny lycanthrope handcuffed to my headboard. He’s all mine, for now.

“Uncuff me,” he pants. “I have to fuck you. Now.” I kiss him slowly and move my hand to the bowl on the bedside table where I keep the key, but my fingers slip against empty porcelain. I pull away from Mark in confusion.

“Did you move the key, Mark? It’s gone.”

The muffled sound of giggles erupts from the hallway. We have our answer. “Boys,” I call, glaring at the door. “You owe Mark an apology.” The door cracks open and two pairs of impish eyes peek around the corner.

Ian, slightly braver than his twin Alvin, laughs and pushes the door open. “If he can’t get out on his own,” he says, bounding into the room, “he deserves to stay locked up!” His eyes are bright as he leaps onto the bed.

“We know this is mommy’s favorite game - we added a twist!” He smiles wickedly as he begins to bounce around. “It’s no fun if there’s no challenge.”

Alvin tiptoes softly into the room, characteristically cautious and shy. “We won’t do it again,” he says, making his way to the top of the bed and artfully unlocking the cuffs with a bent paper clip.

“We hid the key!” Ian says, bouncing higher. “We don’t remember where we put it! But we don’t need it anyway.”

I narrow my eyes at my boys - I didn’t raise them to be rude. I reach out a hand to snatch Ian by the waist and pull him down to me in a hug.

“Enough jumping,” I say, placing a kiss precisely on his nose. “Too early for that, and I haven’t had my coffee. Plus, Mark is waiting for his apology.”

“Sorry, Mark!” The boys chorus, Ian’s voice bright and insincere, Alvin’s soft and earnest.

“Um…” I hear Mark say from beneath me, his voice unusually timid. I look down and am surprised to see that he’s bright red. “Can I…” he murmurs, “have my pants, please?”

I laugh gently at him and reach forward to caress his face, enjoying the feeling of his rough stubble against my palm. “No need to be a prude, Mark, it’s nothing they haven’t seen before. We’re not shy about bodies in this house.”

“Yeah!” Says Ian, smiling down at him. “It’s natural! Hey, are you our dad?” Alvin perks up at the question and turns wide, hopeful eyes towards Mark.

I laugh at both of them and give Ian a nudge. “Okay, now you really are making him uncomfortable. You know he’s not your dad – the man who sired you is far, far away, and he’s not coming around anytime soon. Uncle Mark is just mommy’s friend,” I say, smiling. “Sometimes he sleeps over.”

They’re so curious about their father’s identity, and I don’t mind. They’re just kids. But no way in hell will I ever tell them that secret.

“Go on, babies, get ready for school and I’ll come make you breakfast,” I say, ruffling their hair and pushing them towards the door. Mark rubs his wrists and watches them go.

“You have a…unique way of handling things, in this house,” he says. I don’t take it as criticism.

“It’s true,” I shrug. “But there’s no reason they should grow up with outdated, old fashioned ideas about sex and relationships. I am an independent woman,” I say, leaning my body forward and stretching out against the length of him. “And I’m not going be ashamed of that, especially not in front of my boys.”

I run my hand down the length of Mark’s obliques, and then lower, feeling him harden against me. “Now,” I murmur, wrapping my hand around his thick cock. “I still have time before the boys go to school. Where were we?”

“Homework done?” I say.

“Yes!” The twins chorus. “We have good news, mama,” Alvin says, beaming up at me. I raise my eyebrows at him, inviting him to say more.

“We’re going to be in a quiz competition!” Ian takes up the conversation seamlessly, something he’s been doing since the twins learned to talk. Alvin and Ian are so different, I think, looking them over as I put their bowls in the sink. But sometimes they seem like they’re two halves of one person, able to speak each other’s mind.

“Oh really?” I ask, “a quiz competition? How did you enter that?”

“They invited us,” Alvin says, stepping away from the table and neatly pushing in his chair. “After we played so much on the quiz website and did so well.” He shrugs slightly. “We always know all the answers.”

I frown and lean against the counter. “Quiz website? When did you do that?”

“At school,” Ian says, collecting his army men and putting them – still wet – in his pocket. “We get bored in kindergarten, and the teacher lets us use the computer. We found the quiz website all on our own, and we got all the answers right, and they want us to come compete!”

I nod and smile at the boys, making a mental note to have a conversation with their teacher about how they spend their class time. “Okay,” I say, “Let me look at the details and we’ll see. In the meantime!” I clap my hands twice. “Get your backpacks! Time to go!”

“Mama,” Alvin says softly. “Do you think Daddy will see us in the quiz competition?”

I am surprised by the question and look down into his big brown eyes. I run my hand over his hair and cup his cheek in my palm. “Why do you ask, Alvin? Why all these questions about your dad today?”

He shrugs and looks away; I can tell he is a little disappointed. Ian is suddenly next to both of us, though I didn’t notice him listening or looking back. “We just want to make him proud,” Ian says, smiling wide and revealing the gap left by the loss of his front tooth just last week.

“Don’t worry about that, boys,” I say. “I’m proud enough of you for two parents, all on my own. A thousand parents!” I wrinkle my nose at them, and we hear the school bell ring softly in the distance.

“Oh no!” Alvin says, genuinely concerned. “We’re going to be late!”

The walk home after I drop the boys off at school is some of the only me-time I get during the day. After this, it’s all work, work, work. As I walk, I pull my phone from my back pocket and open my favorite guilty pleasure app, CelebGoss.

Unfortunately, the first thing pops up on the page is not an anonymous, vapid celebrity arrested for a DUI. Instead, it’s Victor.

Victora and Amelia, Back Together, Hotter than Ever, the headline reads, followed by dozens of photos of our future Alpha King and his supermodel mate lounging on the beach, her sipping cocktails, him groping her ass.

I feel my cheeks turn red and return my phone to my pocket. “Not interested,” I mutter. The last thing I need to see are pictures of Victor and his mate in the next chapter of their toxic relationship.

What are the chances that today, of all days, my sons ask twice about their father and then his picture is the first thing I see when I open my phone? Is the universe trying to tell me something?

I shake away the anxious thought and hurry home. I promised myself a long time ago that Victor would never know about our children. It’s a secret I plan to take to the grave.

1kfzkuw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfzkuw,Goa Trip Experience - 30 Apr to 6 May,"As I sit in the Dabolim airport departure lounge, thought of sharing some highlights from my recent Goa trip.

Trip Objective
Me and my partner have been to Goa before, so all we wanted to do was chill and escape the monotonous daily routine

Itinerary 
3 days in South Goa and 3 days in North Goa

Travel
Rented a self drive car from Vailankanni Auto Hires https://goacars.in/. Would highly recommend them. Had a very simple pickup and drop process from the airport. Charges were also very reasonable, and car was in a very good condition.

Stays
- De Garland in Palolem - Highly average experience. The service was not good, and hotel location is very secluded. Food was good, and that was the only highlight.
- Resort Terra Paraiso in Calangute - Good resort, walkable from Calangute beach. Parking is a bit challenging, but the staff is super helpful.

Cafes / Restaurants 
- The Mill Cafe, Palolem - Average experience. Might be better if you're going in a group but in this weather it's tough to sit there without AC
- Bibithaki Vegan Cafe, Palolem - Good experience. The food was tasty, and portion sizes were good. If you're a vegan then you'll definitely like this place
- Tattwa Cafe, Palolem - Pathetic experience as the food was tasteless and service took too long. There was no AC so definitely wouldn't recommend.
- Carvela Cafe and Bistro, Colva - Just had coffee there, so can't comment on their food. Ambience was nice and the owner was helpful. There's plenty of parking so easily accessible 
- Martin's Corner, Betalbatim - This is supposedly one of the most iconic places of Goa, but we had a very bad experience. The fish steak we ordered was smelly and other dishes also did not live up to the hype. Personally, I didn't like the experience.
- Gusto Gelato and Coffee, Calangute - it's a very small cafe in Calangute, but definitely worth visiting. The owner is super sweet and the food is top notch.
- Sanctuary Bar and Kitchen, Vagator - Lovely ambience and great food. We enjoyed the whole experience. Definitely a must visit place. There's ample parking available, so you can take your car there.
- Cafe Cotinga, Anjuna - This one's open till late, so can be a good post party place for coffee. 
- Baked In Goa, Calangute - A hidden gem as per me. It's a bit far from the main road, but the thin crust pizza was lip smacking

Beaches 
We weren't really planning to explore a lot, but still ended up covering a few good beaches.
- Butterfly beach - This beach has been made popular by the Instagram influencers. A bit difficult to reach, you'll have to park your car about 2-3 km away and trek the rest of the rest of the way. You can take a rented jeep also, but that too will drop you about 800m away and you'll have to trek through a forest for the rest of the way. Definitely worth the hassle!
- Galgibaga beach - An untouched beach, which is a bit difficult to find even using Google Maps. Search for ""Galgibaga beach parking"" for the correct location. It's absolutely non- commercialized as it's a nesting place for turtles, hence is managed by Goa government. Very serene and good to just sit and chill.
- Palolem beach - This has turned into a commercial hub now, hence is very crowded. Parking is available but costly. There are multiple cafes nearby which can be explored
- Varca beach - Another relatively less popular beach, but super beautiful. Easy to reach and park your vehicle. You can try visiting this to see a beautiful sunset.
- Calangute beach - Just like any other North Goa beach. Very commercialized and crowded even for an off season.
- Anjuna beach - Another North Goa favorite. The sea is quite rough, so is popular for water sports. 

My 2 cents for anyone planning to visit Goa during the off season
- If you're planning to stay near Palolem, better take a hotel on the beach itself. Any other location is quite secluded, especially post sunset. There aren't many street lights and many cafes are located in the bylanes.
- We loved the areas of Colva and Madgaon. Prefer these for staying in South Goa. Palolem is about an hour away, and it's relatively less crowded.
- The weather is HOT! And crazy humid. So be prepared for this. I'd suggest travel in early morning (before 10) or late evening (post 5)
- South Goa is FAR from Dabolim airport! Plan accordingly if you're coming by a late flight.
- Cabs are expensive, and difficult to find. Hence, prefer a self driven car or scooty. Also gives you the freedom to explore better 
- The road to Palolem goes through the western ghats so a lot of sharp turns and hilly roads with hardly any lights. If you're travelling for the first time or you're a novice driver, avoid late night travel
- The roads in Goa are BEAUTIFUL! I mean the government is doing a tremendous job in maintaining the roads really. Even a random drive takes you through some beautiful sceneries.
- We liked the cafes in North Goa over those in South Goa. Might be because of the off season, but the South Goa cafes were grossly understaffed and not ready to handle the footfall
- People are generally helpful, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
- There's parking available in most of the beaches for 4 wheelers also.
- Cafes in North Goa generally have limited parking. So confirm it before travelling. Scooties are generally preferable in North Goa.

Overall, this time of the year is a good time if you're looking for a relaxing time and not traveling a lot. Goa is beautiful, as always!",6,1746520880.0,goatravel,3,0.88,False

# Chapter 1

My ideal lover would be a guy who is not in a hurry to get laid, loves literature and books, and is polite.

My sister says that such men are extinct in the 21st century. She accused me of always daydreaming about nerd stuff, which is why I still haven’t cashed in my v-card.

I mean, why should I? I've never been in love before. I’m just waiting for something more intimate.

But I'm living in a fairy tale now that Daniel has shown up. We've been dating for a few months now after falling in love at first sight at a bookstore.

He's thoughtful and attentive and a good listener, which is often the role I play - after all, my specialty is counseling. He doesn’t try to push me to go too far too fast, which sets him apart from other guys and suits my own pace perfectly.

Today, in the bookstore where we first met, I take a sip of my cappuccino as I look over my boyfriend’s tall, lanky form, his curly chestnut hair falling into his green eyes. Daniel always dresses so nicely, today in perfectly-pressed grey pants, a shining silver watch at his wrist.

Wait, I think, narrowing my eyes and looking closer. Are those diamonds below the glass face?

I bite my lip, wondering why my boyfriend has a diamond watch. I mean, I’m just a broke grad student – is he rich?

There’s movement over Daniel’s shoulder, and as I look, my eyes go wide. “Daniel, there’s…a guy over there. And he’s staring right at us.”

Daniel turns to look directly at the brawny guy, well over six feet and chorded with muscle. His professional suit does nothing to disguise the roughness of his hands, the cruel scar that runs diagonally over his face, almost splitting his nose in two.

“Oh, um,” Daniel says, shrugging. “Don’t worry about him.”

“Don’t worry about him!?” I whisper, a little scared. “Daniel, he’s looking right at –“

“No, I mean, he’s with me.” Daniel gives me an apologetic smile as my mouth falls open in shock. “That’s Parker, he’s…well. He’s kind of my body guard.”

“Oh,” I say, pulling my mouth shut into an awkward O. I stare at Daniel. He needs a bodyguard? How rich is he?

“Yeah, just ignore him,” Daniel says, giving me a cool smile. “My dad gets overprotective,” he rolls his eyes at this. “Honestly, he’s so stressed out about safety that he could use a shrink like you to give him some counseling.” Daniel laughs at this, lightening the mood.

“Anytime,” I mutter, nervously playing with my long red hair, worrying about the mismatch between Daniel’s wealth and my church-mouse status. I’ve never met anyone before who has a bodyguard.

“Can I get you anything else?” Both Daniel and I look up at the baristo who smiles down at us, a really handsome blonde-haired guy who has an apron tied around his waist.

“No thanks, Colin,” I say, giving him a big grin.

“Actually, can we both get refills?” Daniel says, giving Colin a slow smile.

“Oh, actually…“ I say, looking up at the clock and pushing my hair back behind my ears. If I don’t leave now, I’m definitely going to be late for my job doing psych evaluations at the state prison.

“She’ll take hers to go then,” Daniel says, rising from our sofa. “Here, I’ll help you.” He follows Colin back to the coffee counter.

I start to pack up my bag, intent on catching the next trolly, when I notice Daniel’s phone vibrating on the table, a call coming in. When the number disappears, Daniel’s home screen shows a family photo. The tall man in the back is certainly his dad, the other maybe an older brother?

As I try to puzzle it out, the phone rings again – the same number. On impulse, I grab Daniel’s phone and sling my packed bag over my shoulder, heading towards the coffee counter.

“Daniel,” I say, slipping behind the counter, “you’re getting a phone call –“

But there’s no one back here. I look around, confused – I definitely just saw Colin and Daniel head this way…

I hear a noise from the storage room, a strange and muffled thump and a moan. I take two steps forward and peek around the door, maybe they both –

Oh my god. Not two feet from me, my boyfriend presses Colin up against the wall of the storage room, one fist wrapped in the fabric of his shirt – kissing him passionately -

Colin’s eyes are closed, his hands fumbling at the button of Daniel’s pants, his belt already undone, whispering his name – my boyfriend’s name –

“Are you kidding me!?” I yell, not even thinking as I hurl the phone at Daniel and his lover.

Both boys jump, leaping apart. “Fay – I – “ Daniel’s face is full of shock. Tears in my eyes, I run from the room and from the coffee shop.

“Fay!” Daniel spills out onto the street behind me. “You don’t understand!” He grabs my arm, pulling me back to him.

“I really like you,” he says, his eyes filled with apology. “You’re amazing - it’s just that my family wouldn’t understand, wouldn’t approve –“

“So what,” I asked, surprised. “You just want me to be your pretend girlfriend!? Sorry,” I rip my arm from his hand. “Not interested.”

“Please, Fay!” Daniel calls after me as I run away. “Please – I can make this right! How much do you want? One million? Three million? I can-"" I see him pull the checkbook out of his pocket.

""I don't want your money!"" I say, my voice mocking. Daniel blinks and I turn away. ""I’ll keep your secret, you don’t need to pay me off. I just don't want to see you again.""

And just like that, my fairy tale with Prince Charming was over.

I hurry down the street, my eyes filling with angry tears.

Two hours later, I’m seated at a plastic table in a cinder-block cell, my eyes dried up and my hair tied back in what I hope is a professional look. My leg jitters with nerves and, I think, a little bit of aftershock. I still can’t believe what Daniel did to me.

But I straighten up in my seat, taking a deep breath. I have to concentrate on my job now, and I’m incredibly nervous about my next assignment.

I’ve only been assigned basic white-collar criminals thus far, but today I have to make an assessment of Kent Lippert, the man known as our city’s Mafia King. His unmatched cruelty and the unbelievable lengths he takes to protect his power are infamous in this town.

I hear the hallway door clang open and stand up from my chair, pressing my hands against my blazer to straighten it. This is the most nervous I’ve been since I started this gig.

The guards bring Lippert around the corner and I’m surprised – I expected Lippert to be a fat, old, balding man – the kind of greasy lowlife who belongs in our city’s underworld.

But this man is trim and tall, moving with a kind of dangerous grace. My eyes follow the way his shoulders shift beneath the fabric of his uniform, the way that the guards quail, a little, as they unlock the cuffs on his hands.

I gasp as my eyes finally fall on Lippert’s face, my mouth going dry. His dark hair falling over his forehead, his square jaw, the deep frown lines etched over green eyes – oh my god. I’ve seen this man before. I saw him today, in a picture on my boyfriend’s phone –

And again, younger, etched in the features of my boyfriend’s own face.

Daniel isn’t just some rich kid. He’s the son of the Mafia King.",1,1746520729.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I (25F) have been dating my now-ex-boyfriend, Jake (27M), for about a year. Things were mostly great—shared Netflix binges, cute coffee dates, the usual. But Jake had one flaw: he *hated* my cat, Muffin. Muffin is a 4-year-old tabby, my furry soulmate, and the undisputed queen of my apartment. Jake, however, claimed he was “allergic” (spoiler: he wasn’t) and would dramatically sneeze whenever Muffin so much as looked at him.

Last week, I noticed Jake acting super shady. He was glued to his phone, whispering during calls, and dodging questions like a politician. I figured he was planning a surprise or maybe even cheating, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Big mistake.

Yesterday, I came home from work early and caught Jake in the act of *taking pictures of Muffin* in her cat carrier. Not cute Instagram pics—think Craigslist-ad-level photos with a blurry, distressed Muffin looking like she was pleading for her life. I asked what the hell he was doing, and he stammered, “Uh, just… documenting her cuteness?” Yeah, right.

I snatched his phone and scrolled through his messages. My jaw hit the floor. He’d been texting some random person about *giving Muffin away*. The messages read like a shady used-car deal: “Healthy cat, free to a good home, need gone ASAP.” He even described Muffin as “low-maintenance” (lie—she’s a diva) and said I was “on board” with it. EXCUSE ME?!

I lost it. I screamed, “Are you seriously trying to give away MY CAT behind my back?!” Jake tried to play it off, saying Muffin was “ruining our relationship” and that he was doing it “for us.” He claimed he’d found a “nice family” for her and thought I’d “get over it.” Get over it?! Muffin’s been with me through college, heartbreak, and a global pandemic. She’s not a couch you rehome on Facebook Marketplace!

In the heat of the moment, I told him we were done. I said if he thought he could secretly yeet my cat out of my life, he didn’t know me at all. I kicked him out, changed the locks (thanks, YouTube tutorials), and blocked his number. Muffin, sensing the drama, promptly knocked over a glass of water like the chaos agent she is.

Here’s where the FU comes in. This morning, I woke up to a barrage of texts from mutual friends saying Jake’s been telling everyone I’m the bad guy for “overreacting” and “choosing a cat over a human.” Apparently, he’s spinning it like he was just “trying to help” and I blew up our “perfect” relationship over “a pet.” Some friends are even siding with him, saying I should’ve “compromised” (?!). Now I’m second-guessing myself. Did I overreact? Should I have talked it out instead of going nuclear? I mean, he tried to *steal my cat*, but maybe I could’ve handled it better.

Muffin’s currently curled up on my lap, purring like nothing happened, but I’m a mess. I love her to death, but now I’m single, my friend group’s imploding, and Jake’s out there playing the victim. TIFU, Reddit. What do I do now?

TL;DR: Caught my boyfriend trying to secretly give my cat up for adoption, broke up with him on the spot, and now he’s telling everyone I overreacted. My cat’s fine, but my life’s a dumpster fire. Help?",0,1746520184.0,tifu,54,0.22,False
1kfzeji,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegaladviceGerman/comments/1kfzeji/landlord_problems/,Landlord problems,"Hi everyone, I am currently doing my PhD in Germany, coming from another EU country. 
I'm currently having some issues with my (previous) landlord. Long story short, I rented apartments from him for almost 4 years: 2.5 years in one apartment (which he later asked me to move from) (rent 500€), and close to 1.5 years in another (550€, that later increased to 580€ due to rising electricity costs). 
Never created any problems, but I also never got any contract, though I asked multiple times personally and via text (WhatsApp). 
In March I got a letter from him saying in a month he'd raise my rent to 800€ and that I had two choices : either leave or pay the new rent values. As a student I don't have that amount of money, and because I didn't know my rights, I packed all my things and left. 
Last week (30/04) I got a letter from him dated from the beginning of the month (which in my opinion is a fake date because it doesn't take 1 month for a letter to be delivered in our small village) addressed to my work place saying I had destroyed the whole apartment and that items were missing from the apartment (e.g. Coffee machine when the apartment never had one). 
I don't know what to do. I had friends help me with moving, as well as some other people, and they saw the apartment clean and organised when I left. But unfortunately as I was rushed to leave and find a new place to live, I didn't take photos of the state of the house when leaving. 
Besides that, there is some correspondence that I know went to my previous apartment regarding my vote by correspondence to my country's elections. I've called him about it (with a friend next to me) and he just said very rudely ""I don't know, sorry. Bye"" and cut the call. So basically I'm also being barred from voting because he's being difficult  

Should I get a lawyer involved? Should I prepare for a lawsuit? Can he even do anything? What documents should I prepare for the lawyer?

I wanted to sit and write down everything I wanted to be before this year ends, to list down goals and make plans that would lead up to them. So I sat down, staring at the blank paper, trying to translate my aspirations into words. I didn't know where to start. My hands, too fumbling to lift the floodgates of my thoughts. This happens all the time. Somehow, my enthusiasm loses its intensity on the road through the wreckage of my nerves, from the inside of my head to my fingertips.

Inside my head, I'm That Girl. I have an active, moving body, a consistent skincare routine for my dream skin, and the greens of my clean diet taste like heaven's fruit. In reality, though, I can barely muster the willpower to go on a five-minute stroll or resist the urge to snuggle into bed without even washing my face, and the effort to prepare a good meal turns my bones dry.

Inside my head, I eloquently list Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, gardening, tidying my room, completing my assignments ahead of deadlines, and hanging out with my friends over coffee, quality time, and things we love for the weekends. But in reality, I just lie down and do nothing. I let time pass me by, it doesn't wait.

Hey, been feeling a bit lonely lately and stressed with school so it’d be dope if I could connect with  some people! HMU if u wanna chat about whatever ! I’m a really nonjudgmental person and can talk about literally anything. I love memes (LMAO), going to explore coffee shops nearby, art, music, and sports. I also love to make my own music and have been playing guitar since I was 12. I’m in school for biochemistry and I’m in my last semester. I’d write more here but it’d be cool if we could connect and talk about our interests. I’m cool with discord or whatever platform. If you could include your fav food in the chat, that’d be great. Hope to meet yall!!",4,1746519514.0,r4r,1,0.84,False

1kfz81a,https://i.redd.it/jbmu6lfde4ze1.jpeg,"Got scammed, but I'm still happy","I bought a Bialetti Venus moka pot on a used/second-hand app.

The thing is, the seller listed a 6-cup model, but a 4-cup one arrived in the box.

I was so surprised at how small it is! In the end, I couldn't return it within the allowed timeframe, so I'm stuck with this coffee maker.

However, I'm happy because it's practically brand new, looks good all around. Also, it's an excuse to participate in this community, which seems to have good vibes and a lot of fun people who help others, very different from what you usually see in other Reddit forums. I'm in a couple of other groups (Iron Maiden and Metallica), and the people there are cool too.

Right now, I'm hoping to learn how to use it (I haven't got a clue).",5,1746519238.0,mokapot,4,0.86,False
