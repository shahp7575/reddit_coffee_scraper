Unreal Message my wife got we

My wife ordered her Starbucks coffee which was around 8-9$ she tipped $3.50 the Starbucks is legit two blocks away from our house. This is the message she got. She reported the dasher immediately and he has been banned until it’s investigated. This is crazy. Taking bad orders out on a customer that actually tipped almost 40% for a two blocks away travel time is unacceptable.

I’m planning a small move within Germany (about 240km). I posted on ebay looking for someone with a car to help me out.

A 62old man replied, offering to help for free. He said he just wants to support me, make sure I get there safely, and added that I “look great” and asked if I’m a model (I had posted a moody, styled photo — not revealing). He suggested we meet for coffee before the drive so I can get to know him a bit.

He seems polite and respectful, but clearly interested. I get the feeling he might expect some emotional or pleasant company, warm talk, or just the presence of a younger woman.

I could just pay someone and avoid this, but I’m trying to save money. I also know how to use presence.  but I want to stay safe and smart.

So if I do accept:
 • What boundaries should I set?
 • How should I handle the coffeemeet?
 • Anything I should watch for?

Would love your honest thoughts. Thank you",1,1752574365.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 35: The Confession That Came Too Late Part 1

The glow of the whale tank painted the silence between them in shifting hues of blue. Light swirled like a current between glass and floor, brushing shadows over their faces—gentle, haunting, slow.

“Kazuya-kun?”

The voice came from behind.  
Fragile. Uncertain.  
And terrifyingly familiar.

He didn’t turn. Not right away.

The echo of her words dissolved into the dome’s stillness, like sound pulled under water. The vast tank ahead cast soft reflections against his silhouette, stretching it long along the glass.

Moments earlier, he’d spoken to the shop manager—casual words about the closing shift, nothing more. Then he’d asked, almost absently:

“Can we stay a little longer?”

The manager gave a glance toward the figure entering behind him, then nodded and disappeared down the corridor without a word.

Kazuya stood frozen, hands in his pockets, breath carefully measured. As if one wrong inhale would make him collapse.

The silence did not wait.

“…How did you find me?” he asked, still facing the tank.

Chizuru stepped forward, one foot hesitant. She clutched her bag as if letting go might break her spine.

“Merry Christmas.”

That voice again. It didn’t cut—it *sank*. Heavy with all the things left unsaid.

Kazuya finally turned.

And time—held its breath.

His eyes scanned her. Slowly. Not with hunger. Not even with pain. Just a quiet kind of knowing. A sad recognition.

“You look…”

He stopped. The rest didn’t come easily.

“…like you’ve been carrying something too.”

She smiled, just barely. It cracked immediately.

“I didn’t know if I should come,” she said. “Didn’t think you’d even talk to me.”

He tilted his head. His voice was steady, but faint.

“I almost didn’t.”

Her smile vanished.

Kazuya stepped closer—not urgently, not warmly. Just inevitably.

“I was angry,” he said. “For a long time. But I’ve realized... sometimes people don’t leave because they don’t care. They leave because they don’t know how to stay.”

Her shoulders quivered.

He was right in front of her now. Inches away.  
But he didn’t reach for her.  
She didn’t ask him to.

Chizuru stood beneath the tank’s pale light, its soft glow outlining her perfect coat, flawless makeup—and her eyes, rimmed red. Not from the cold. From the weight.

“You look different,” she said, her voice unsteady. “Taller. Stronger. More... real.”

He gave a faint smile. Not joyful. Not bitter. Just... there.

That hurt more than silence.

“I didn’t know if you’d speak to me,” she whispered again.

“You found me.” That was all he said.

A sacred stillness settled over them, the kind that happens before a storm.

Then Chizuru exhaled—quiet and trembling—and took a step closer.

“I loved you, Kazuya.”

He flinched.

“I loved you when you cheered for me in silence. When you stood beside me even when I didn’t ask. When your love never once came with a price.”

Her voice grew ragged. Her grip on her bag faltered.

“I loved you when you crowdfunded my film. When you lied to yourself just to protect me. When you smiled even when I couldn’t say thank you.”

Tears spilled now. Quiet, unrelenting.

“And I hated myself for it. Because I didn’t know how to give anything back. I kept waiting for a sign... some permission to want you, too.”

Kazuya’s fists clenched slightly. His fingers curled into his palms.

*I wanted this. These words. But not like this. Not after I finally learned to breathe again.*

Chizuru stepped forward again.

“I left because I was scared. You made me feel real, and I didn’t know how to be real without breaking something.”

Her legs faltered. She caught the tank railing to steady herself.

That’s when he looked at her. Really looked.

And the pain in her face scorched him.

She bowed—deep, desperate, shaking.

“I’m sorry. For every second I wasted. For every moment I downplayed. For every time I chose pride over your warmth.”

She straightened, barely holding herself together.

“I still love you, Kazuya.”

The words collapsed something inside him.  
Not loudly. But thoroughly.

He stepped forward.

Not to hold her. Not to stop her tears.  
Just to be near. To let the silence catch them both.

“I know a place we can talk,” he said quietly.

Her eyes widened. Then softened. Her mouth opened to say something—anything—but no sound came.

She nodded.

And as they walked side by side, not quite touching, not quite apart, she whispered:

“Even if you can’t love me back… I still do.”

He didn’t stop her.  
But he didn’t say it back.

Not yet.

**Three Hours Earlier**  
*(Chizuru’s POV)*

The hotel mirror did not lie.  
The bags under her eyes. The pale cracks at the corners of her mouth. The way her hands shook as she fixed her collar—again.

“You don’t have to do this,” her mind whispered.

But her heart screamed louder.

She opened Mini’s message thread. Watched the video again. That ridiculous step-back three. Kazuya—laughing, radiant, surrounded.

He had never looked that happy when he was with her.

He used to look lonely when he loved me, she realized.  
Now?  
Now he looked like he *belonged*.

She should be happy for him.  
But she was terrified.

*What if I’m not part of this version of him anymore? What if the boy I loved is gone—and all that’s left is someone I hurt too deeply to reach again?*

But some things had to be risked. Even if the ending was written in silence.

She gathered her things and stepped into the winter night. The cold bit at her skin. She welcomed it.

And as she followed the directions to the aquarium, she whispered the one prayer that kept her legs moving:

“I hope you’ve forgiven me, Kazuya.”

[🎧""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” – Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWsOTV1LsPo)

# Chapter 36: The Confession That Came Too Late Part 2

The streets outside the aquarium were quiet, the sea breeze weaving salt and cold through deserted sidewalks. Christmas lights blinked from storefronts and lampposts—gentle reminders that the world kept turning, even when hearts paused.

Kazuya didn’t say where they were going.  
Chizuru didn’t ask.

They walked in silence until the gates of the University of the Ryukyus appeared, dim under the amber glow of old lamps. A lone guard stepped out from his booth, brows knitting in confusion at the sight of visitors this late.

“Merry Christmas,” Kazuya said, his voice low but steady. “I’ll be spending the night here. Would it be alright if I had a visitor? We’ll just sit by the shoreline. Nothing more.”

The guard’s gaze shifted to Chizuru, then back. Something passed between them—a quiet understanding born not of words, but of having once rebuilt themselves from ruin.

“Don’t stay too long,” the guard said at last, stepping aside.

They followed the gravel path that curved behind the university buildings. Darkness pooled around them, save for moonlight glinting off the sea in the distance. The silence walked with them, neither oppressive nor comforting—just there.

At the shoreline, they sat—on the rocks, a careful space between them. The waves whispered against stone, as if afraid to interrupt.

Kazuya leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees, eyes fixed on the inky ocean.  
“I just wanted somewhere quiet,” he murmured.

The sea took his words, pulled them out into its depths.

Chizuru pulled her knees to her chest, arms wrapped tightly around them. Her fingers trembled, barely hidden in her sleeves. When she finally spoke, her voice was soft and raw.

“Why did you really reject me?”  
His voice held no accusation. Only ache.

She swallowed. Her eyes didn’t meet his. “Because I thought it was the only way to protect you.”

He didn’t move, but something in his posture tightened.

“I thought if I made it final—if I said no, harshly—you’d stop waiting. That you’d hate me. And maybe… if you hated me, it would hurt less than staying and letting you watch me fail.”  
Her voice cracked. “But I never hated you. I hated myself.”

Tears slipped down her cheeks. She wiped them quickly, but more followed.  
“I love you.”

Kazuya stiffened.

“I’ve loved you since the moment you looked at me like I was someone worth knowing,” she said, breath shaking. “Even when I was acting. Even when I pushed you away. I loved you.”

“I love how you never gave up. How you stood by me even when I didn’t thank you. I love the way you listen—how you hear even the pain I couldn’t say aloud. You’re quiet… but you’re loud where it counts. You make people feel safe.”

She drew a breath, but it caught in her chest.

“I didn’t say it before because love meant risk. And you... you were the first person I ever wanted to risk everything for. And that terrified me.”

“I grew up thinking love had to be earned—through success, through performance. I didn’t know how to accept love freely… not until I’d already lost you.”

Finally, she turned to him, fully, eyes glistening under the moonlight.

“I love you, Kazuya. I love you so much it hurts. I love you when I’m strong, and even more when I’m weak—because in every version of me, the thread that runs through is you.”

“I know I don’t deserve a second chance. Or even your forgiveness. But I want it. Even if we go slow. Even if it’s just coffee once a month. I just want to be beside you… in any way you’ll let me.”

She didn’t reach for his hand.  
She just placed the truth between them like a fragile offering.

“Do you… still love me?”

The seconds stretched. The only sound was the sea.

Kazuya didn’t answer immediately.

When he finally spoke, his voice was soft—but sure.

“I’m not the same Kazuya anymore.”

Her breath hitched.

“I used to tie my worth to you. Your smile. Your attention. I lived for it. And when you left… I broke.”

He closed his eyes.  
“But I didn’t stay broken.”

“I found something here. Peace. Friends who feel like family. A version of myself who doesn’t need to be pitied or validated to feel whole. And I don’t want to lose that. Not even for love.”

He turned to her—really looked at her for the first time.

“If I still love you… you’ll understand that I need to love myself more first.”

Her shoulders dropped. The tears came freely now.

He took a breath, voice steady but fragile. “Can I ask something?”

She nodded.

“Will you promise me something?”

Another nod.

“If you're chasing something that matters—chase it. Don’t lose yourself again. Not for me. Because if we meet again… I want it to be when you’ve become everything you dreamed of being.”

“I’ll always want to see you happy,” he said, “even if it’s not with me.”

It broke her. But it was the most Kazuya thing he could have said.

She fumbled into her bag, pulling out her phone with shaking hands.

“Can I at least have your LINE…?”

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t look away.  
“No.”

She froze. “I… what?”

He shook his head, gently. “If you really need to find me… you already know where.”

It wasn’t cruel. It wasn’t cold.  
It was just real.

She lowered the phone, lips trembling.

“I understand,” she whispered. “I don’t like it. But I understand.”

He turned back to the sea.  
The waves rolled on, steady and indifferent to human sorrow.

Chizuru rose slowly.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “For everything. Again.”

She took a step. Then another.  
Each one heavier than the last.

*I quit the rental job. I’ve got projects lined up—TV, film, commercials…*

*If I walk away from those, I lose everything I’ve built. But if I walk away from him again…*

*Why does love always feel like a choice?*  
*Why did destiny bring me back only to split me down the middle?*

She bit her lip, fighting a sob.

Then…  
She whispered. “I love you.”

And walked away.

—

From the shadow of the vending machines near the faculty building, Elsa hadn’t meant to listen.

But the moment she heard Chizuru’s voice crack—*“I still love you”*—and the silence that followed, something deep inside her splintered.

She stood frozen, breath caught in her throat.

*You’re still holding it in,* she thought, watching Kazuya’s outline under the moonlight. *Even now… you’re protecting her.*

And something inside her rose—not sharp like jealousy. But raw. Protective.  
Not against him. But for him.

*Don’t destroy his peace,* she thought bitterly. *Don’t come back now just to steal it again.*

Her fists clenched at her sides.

*I’ve watched him smile again. Laugh again. I’ve watched him try. I’ve watched him heal.*  
*And for the first time… I wanted to be part of that light.*

A tear slipped down her cheek.

And for the first time—

She understood what it meant to be jealous.

Not because he once loved another woman.  
But because that woman still held the part of him that hurt the most…  
And yet, even now, he looked at her with mercy in his eyes.

# Chapter 37: A Reckoning on Christmas Eve

The cab never made it out of the campus.

""Someone’s at the window, ma’am.""

Chizuru looked up.

Through the misted glass, she saw her—snow-white braid, jaw locked like a steel vice, sea-glass eyes brimming with fire. Elsa didn’t flinch. She looked like a storm in human form.

The driver shifted. “Should I—?”

“I’ll get out,” Chizuru said.

She stepped into the cold. The air was sharp, but Elsa’s stare was sharper.

“You booked a cab,” Elsa said, voice clipped, every word dipped in disdain. “Running away like a coward? Figures.”

Chizuru frowned. “Who the hell even—?”

“You really don’t remember me?” Elsa's tone sliced through the air—sharp, fast, unforgiving.

A pause. Then Chizuru nodded slowly.

“You’re the girl texting when I asked for directions. The one who was…""

“With him,” Elsa snapped. “Yes. *With* him. Not behind him. Not beside him. *With* him.”

Chizuru’s spine straightened. Her voice turned crisp. “So you’re the reason he’s been so... distracted.”

Elsa’s smile was thin, venomous. “And you’re the reason he cried like a dog abandoned on a train platform.”

The words hit hard. Chizuru flinched, but didn’t back down. “Is this your twisted way of marking territory?”

Elsa stepped closer, her tone dropping.

“This isn’t marking. It’s a declaration. A declaration of war.”

Chizuru blinked.

“This is me making damn sure he never bleeds because of you again.”

“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“I know enough,” Elsa said, eyes narrowing. “You came back not to fix anything. You came to *check*. To see if he still loves you. To taste the power again. You don’t want to stay. You just want to know he still *hurts*.”

“That’s not what this is!”

“Then what is it?” Elsa hissed. “Closure? Guilt? A final performance to ease your conscience?”

“I’m not doing this here.”

“Neither am I,” Elsa said. “Let’s go somewhere *he* won’t hear your bullshit.”

Chizuru hesitated.

“For his sake,” Elsa added.

That got her.

They walked in silence to the university garden. The wind carried the weight of everything unsaid.

When they reached the innermost path, Elsa turned sharply.

**SMACK.**

Chizuru stumbled, eyes wide.

“How *dare* you,” Elsa growled. “How dare you come back here, say sorry, then *probe* his heart like it’s yours to play with. Of course he still loves you. Because unlike you, he doesn’t abandon the people he loves.”

Chizuru caught her breath. “You don’t get to judge—”

“He *worshipped* you,” Elsa spat. “And you crushed him. You broke him like glass, ground him into fucking dust. And you think you can just show up and test the waters?”

“Don’t act like you know him better than I do.”

Elsa stepped closer. “I know what he looks like when he can’t sleep. When he’s shaking in silence. I’ve heard him tell stories of his nightmares. I’ve listened through them, with knives striking my heart with each time he cries because of it.”

“You don’t understand my reasons.”

“Then *explain* it!” Elsa shouted. “Tell me what dream was so big it had to be paid for in his blood.”

“I had dreams!” Chizuru fired back. “He knew! He supported me. He said he wanted me to choose myself—”

**CRACK.** Another slap.

“That wasn’t love. That was cowardice dressed up as ambition. You didn’t choose yourself. You chose *away* from him.”

Chizuru struck back. “Don’t speak about what you don’t understand!”

**SLAP.** Elsa.  
**SLAP.** Chizuru.  
**SLAP. SLAP. SLAP.**

Pain cracked through the garden like thunder.

Elsa’s voice dropped.

“You treat love like a bookmark. Pause it when it gets inconvenient. Pick it up when you’re bored. *He’s not a fucking book.*”

“I was scared,” Chizuru whispered.

“So was he,” Elsa said, her voice shaking with rage. “But he bared his soul. You rejected him.”

Chizuru didn’t speak.

Elsa took a breath. Her eyes didn’t blink.

“If you love him, stay. Quit everything. Stay with him. I’ll walk away. Right now.”

Silence.

Chizuru opened her mouth.

No words.

Elsa laughed bitterly. “Just as I thought.”

She leaned in, voice lowering to a blade:

“Just a matter of time, sweetheart. You don’t know how I fight. I will give up everything. My name. My family. My future. I would rather burn my world to ashes than see him cry again.”

Chizuru stiffened. “Who the fuck are you?”

Elsa smirked. “Someone who *chooses*. Someone who *stays*. Someone who’d burn down the sky to give him sunlight.”

She stood tall.

“From this day on, I will love him publicly. I will *claim* him. I won’t wait for him to heal. He will heal *with* me. And every scar you left will be replaced by something real.”

Chizuru clenched her fists. “I’ll make it. I’ll reach the top. Then I’ll come back and choose him. Like I should have.”

Elsa's smile turned cold.

“Then I’ll make sure there’s nothing left for you to come back to.”

Chizuru turned.

And walked.

Elsa didn’t watch her go.

She looked at the sky.

No more waiting.

She was choosing him.

With no shame.

With no permission.

With fire.

The shore behind the University of the Ryukyus was quiet at night—just the tide breathing in and out, a rhythm older than heartbreak.

Kazuya was still seated where she left him.

He hadn’t moved.

His arms hung limp at his sides, fingers trailing the coarse edge of the rock. His back was hunched, his silhouette sagging like the air had been knocked out of him. It wasn’t a dramatic pose—there was nothing romantic about it. Just exhaustion. Just gravity.

And then it broke.

The tears didn’t come gently. They tore out of him. Sharp. Ugly. A sound like something inside had finally snapped.

He folded forward, clutching his knees, his forehead pressed to his arms. He shook. His breaths came ragged, uneven. And then the sobs escaped—

Quiet at first.

Then louder.

Then louder still.

No one was around. No one to witness. Just the waves clawing at the shore and the wind slipping past his shoulders.

""I should be happy,"" he gasped, like the words were too large for his throat. ""She said she loved me.""

But even as he said it, it rang hollow. A ghost of what should have mattered.

*So why does it feel like I can’t breathe?*

He pressed his fingers against his temples. The ache wasn’t just in his chest—it was everywhere. In his bones. In his gut. In the pieces of himself he thought he’d rebuilt.

Because the Kazuya who would’ve died to hear those words—

*He’s gone.*

""I’m not that guy anymore,"" he whispered. Not with pride. Not with bitterness. But with grief. Like saying goodbye to a version of himself he had to kill just to survive.

*He died waiting.*

He didn’t even blame her. Not really. Not anymore.

""She loved me too late.""

His voice cracked again. His shoulders trembled. He pulled his hood tighter around his face, as if he could retreat back into himself.

""And it’s not her fault. It’s not wrong. It just... hurts.""

He let the words fall out. Let them scatter into the night. He didn’t care where they landed.

Months. Months of holding it in. Of smiling. Of pretending. Of crawling forward while no one watched.

""I thought if she said those words, everything would click. That it would make sense again. That maybe... maybe I’d feel whole.""

He let out a breathless, bitter laugh.

""But it didn’t. It didn’t fix me. It didn’t fix anything.""

Because I already fixed myself.

He slowly leaned back, resting on his palms, staring up at the stars through wet lashes. His eyes were swollen, but wide open.

The wind curled around him, cool and clean. He inhaled like he hadn’t in months.

""I’m free,"" he said, barely audible.

He closed his eyes.

""I finally let go.""

1m0dw7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1m0dw7j/how_i_went_from_socially_awkward_to_confident/,how i went from socially awkward to confident,"I used to literally rehearse what I’d say before ordering coffee, I'd prepare a mental script before going up to the counter. Social interactions feel like a life and death situation. I’d dread small talk, panic in group chats, and overthink every convo for hours. After leaving my previous job, I realized my poor communication was holding me back *everywhere*. So I decided to fix it. I started working with a social coach (who was oddly charming and lowkey a therapist in disguise). What blew my mind was how much of my struggle wasn’t about what I said, it was about how I felt inside. Here are 3 things that helped me shift:

1. social anxiety is often unprocessed shame stored in the body, not just “being shy”
2. mirror neurons make you subconsciously match the vibe of who you're talking to—so your inner state is key
3. being ""bad at talking"" is usually just a lack of reps, not a personality flaw  

Books helped me *a lot*. My coach gave me a full rec list and said, “This is your social gym.” I started reading a book summary every night before bed, even on low-energy days I try to squeeze in a couple of minutes to read. Here are 5 favorite reads that actually helped me stop being weird in convos:

[Just Listen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6547576-just-listen?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=zgjoTDIO2m&rank=2) by Mark Goulston

Insanely good read! This book made me question everything I thought I knew about “good conversation.” Turns out, most of us are just waiting to talk. This read has helped me improve on social interactions a lot.

[The Assertiveness Guide for Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27214316-the-assertiveness-guide-for-women?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=PwVFAOoDwW&rank=1) by Julie de Azevedo Hanks

This is gold for anyone who struggles with saying what they actually want. This book helped me understand the difference between assertiveness and aggression. This book taught me how to speak up without sounding like an angry squirrel.

[The Charisma Myth](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-charisma-myth-by-olivia-fox-cabane) by Olivia Fox Cabane

This book proves charisma isn’t magic but learnable. Olivia breaks it down into warmth, presence, and power. After reading, I practiced her body language tricks and got my first compliment on my “energy” lol. 

[Captivate](https://www.befreed.ai/book/captivate-by-vanessa-van-edwards) by Vanessa Van Edwards

Best social skills book I’ve ever read. Vanessa is a behavioral investigator with research featured on CNN and Forbes. This book dives into micro-behaviors that make people trust you fast. I legit used her “conversation sparkers” at my cousin’s wedding and didn’t die of awkwardness. 

[Presence](https://www.befreed.ai/book/presence-by-amy-cuddy) by Amy Cuddy

This book helped me stop spiraling after convos. She explains how body posture impacts your brain and how self-trust shifts how others see you. It made me feel less like an imposter and more like a person. Must-read!

Everyday is another chance to be better. Start working on yourself today and you’d feel like you can conquer the world (literally).

If you’re struggling socially, you’re not broken. You just need practice, tools and some patience. Communication is a skill, not a personality type. Start by reading a few pages a day. You grow one convo at a time.

💔 What Leads To The Fall
- Kairi hears Majnu's familiar coffee order at a café and becomes convinced he is nearby  
- She follows clues and shares her heart with Mairi, expressing how deeply she misses him  
- Mairi, visibly shaken by Kairi's vulnerability, loses her balance and tumbles down the stairs

🎭 Why It Matters
This scene underscores the emotional weight Majnu still holds over Kairi — and how that tension is affecting those around her. Mairi's fall is not just physical; it is symbolic of unraveling relationships and unresolved truths that continue to haunt the characters.

Author: chatgpt

# Chapter 1: The Resume That Lied

Skidewt had never worn pants before. But pants, he was told, were essential for blending in with Earthlings. Specifically, Earthlings who worked in corporate structures known as ""offices,"" a word he still wasn’t quite sure how to use in a sentence.

Now disguised as a perfectly average human named *Danny Bloomfield*, Skidewt stood outside the imposing glass building labeled *Greystone Analytics*, clutching a faux-leather briefcase he’d purchased from a store called Target (which he assumed was a weapons supplier). His disguise, a short blonde-haired man with glasses and a permanently worried expression, was carefully designed from several hours of YouTube tutorials and questionable AI-generated fashion tips.

He had one goal: infiltrate human office life without being discovered as a glowing green alien from the Trivox Quadrant.

Inside the building, Danny was greeted by a receptionist with perfect hair and a skeptical gaze.

“You here for the interview?” she asked.

“Yes,” Danny replied, trying to sound organic. “I am very job.”

She squinted. “You’re... what?”

He cleared his throat. “I mean—yes. I’m here for the job.”

She handed him a visitor badge. “Elevator’s on the left. Good luck.”

He took the badge and muttered to himself, “Initiating phase one: assimilation.”

# Chapter 2: Mission Accepted

The interview was a blur. He’d spent the night prior memorizing vague corporate buzzwords and ended up improvising sentences like, “I bring synergy to vertical market alignments,” and “Data-driven funnels are my love language.”

The hiring manager, Mr. Henderson, was either impressed or too confused to say no.

“Welcome to Greystone, Danny. You’ll start Monday as our Junior Workflow Integration Analyst.”

Skidewt, internally, had no idea what that meant. But externally, he nodded and smiled. “Affirmative. I mean—thank you.”

Back in his new apartment, he whispered into his wrist communicator.

“Commander Glorvax, the mission proceeds. I have acquired the role of ‘Junior Workflow Analyst.’ No signs of suspicion yet.”

A voice crackled back: “Proceed with caution. Avoid revealing your true form. And beware... of ‘team-building exercises.’ Report in 30 Earth cycles with a full planetary assessment. If the species is deemed weak or disorganized, we will begin Phase II: Pre-Invasion Scouting.”

Skidewt swallowed. This mission just got more complicated.

# Chapter 3: The Coffee Crisis

By the end of his first week, Danny had learned that coffee was not optional.

It was ritual. It was survival. It was currency.

He had also learned that staplers do not reproduce, that it’s frowned upon to take notes by recording people with your eyeballs, and that asking if the break room microwave ""accepts sacrifice"" raises eyebrows.

Terra from Data Entry was his first real contact. She was sharp-tongued and always had one earbud in.

“You’re new,” she said one morning as he tried (and failed) to pour coffee without flooding the counter. “What’s your deal?”

“I enjoy work,” Danny lied. “Especially... integration of workflows.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Right. Just don’t sit in my chair.”

He made a note: *Humans are territorial about chairs.*

# Chapter 4: The All-Nighter Protocol

Every night, Skidewt stayed up watching tutorials: ""How Excel Works,"" ""Corporate Jargon for Dummies,"" and a five-hour breakdown of printer error codes.

His apartment looked more like a conspiracy bunker, filled with sticky notes, flowcharts, and a whiteboard that simply read “DON’T LET THEM SEE YOU SWEAT (LITERALLY).”

By week two, he still hadn’t figured out what a ""pivot table"" was, but he had developed 12 contingency plans in case of an audit.

He even practiced panic expressions in the mirror, labeling them: *Surprised Guilt*, *Confused Enthusiasm*, and *Team Player Smile.*

He logged nightly mission reports to the mothership, analyzing behavioral trends:

>

>

>

He was beginning to suspect that this species was... oddly admirable in its chaos.

# Chapter 5: The Suspicious Intern

On Monday, a new intern arrived: Emily. She was too observant for Danny’s liking.

“You don’t blink much,” she noted.

“Incorrect. I blink precisely... often.”

She leaned in. “You always eat the same thing. You never use your phone. And you flinched when Raj sneezed.”

Danny laughed too hard. “Haha! Human things! Very normal. Haha!”

She didn’t look convinced.

He spent that night preparing a PowerPoint titled: ""Reasons Danny is Definitely a Human (And Not an Alien Spy).""

# Chapter 6: The Casual Friday Incident

Casual Friday was a disaster.

Danny, thinking it was a ritual involving roleplay, arrived in a full medieval knight costume.

The silence in the office lobby was suffocating.

Terra nearly dropped her coffee. “Dude. It’s just jeans and sneakers.”

“Ah,” he nodded. “Yes. I am very casual. Witness my... armor of relaxation.”

# Chapter 7: Promotion and Panic

Somehow, miraculously, Danny was good at pretending to be productive. He nodded in meetings. He forwarded emails. He asked questions like, “Should we loop in compliance?” and no one dared ask what he meant.

After three months, Mr. Henderson called him into the office.

“We’re promoting you, Danny. You’re now Senior Workflow Analyst.”

Skidewt nearly fainted. That night he panicked. More responsibilities meant more chances to be discovered. Was it time to flee? Was Earth life too dangerous?

He messaged the mothership:

>

>

# Chapter 8: The Big Reveal

Things came to a head when the building's Wi-Fi went out. Danny, desperate, climbed into the ceiling to ""fix it.""

Emily followed him. She caught him mid-transformation, antennae flickering.

“...I knew it,” she whispered.

Danny froze. “Please don’t disintegrate me.”

She blinked. “Why would I? Honestly, you’re still better than half the people here.”

They fixed the Wi-Fi together. She promised to keep his secret. In return, he promised to attend happy hour.

# Chapter 9: Just Another Day

Danny’s disguise was more natural now. He even understood inside jokes. Mostly.

He still pulled all-nighters, but now it was to help Emily debug code or prank Raj back. Terra called him “weird, but reliable.”

Skidewt didn’t know how long he could stay, but for now, he had a purpose. A team. A desk with a nameplate.

And that was more human than anything else he’d ever learned.

# Chapter 10: The Final Report

On the eve of his six-month deadline, Skidewt uploaded his final assessment to the mothership.

>

>

There was a long pause before the reply came:

>

# Chapter 11: Team-Building Terror

Skidewt had been warned. ""Beware team-building exercises,"" Commander Glorvax had said. But he hadn’t expected a weekend ropes course in the woods.

He wore a harness backwards. He misunderstood trust falls. When someone shouted, “Let yourself go!” he activated his emergency cloaking field instead of falling.

“That’s one way to disappear,” Terra muttered, scribbling something in a notepad.

By the end of the weekend, Danny was sore, confused, and somehow everyone’s favorite “mystery man.”

# Chapter 12: Office Romance Protocol

Raj started dating someone from marketing. Emily said Terra once dated a VP. Danny tried to understand this new layer of human interaction.

He downloaded 3,000 romantic comedies and compiled a spreadsheet titled “Love in the Workplace: Dangerous but Data-Backed.”

His algorithm said Terra and Mr. Henderson had a 76% compatibility score. He emailed it anonymously. Chaos ensued.

Emily intervened. “Danny, for the last time—stop trying to ship people like it’s Amazon.”

# Chapter 13: HR Nightmare

Danny was summoned to HR. A small, windowless room. A woman named Carla.

“Danny,” she said. “We’ve received... unusual reports.”

He sweated profusely. Literally. His anti-perspiration patch had failed.

“Apparently, you filled the vending machine with... nutrient paste?”

“Efficient. Cost-saving,” he offered.

Carla blinked. “Also, there’s a complaint about you installing a scanner in the toilet?”

“It was for... seat temperature research.”

Carla sighed. “Please just fill out these forms.”

Danny took the pen like it was a sacred artifact. Paperwork: humanity’s deadliest weapon.

# Chapter 14: Promotion Day Disaster

Promotion Day. Danny expected a simple handshake. Instead: balloons, cupcakes, a karaoke machine, and someone handing him a microphone.

He froze.

Then, drawing on every speech he’d ever watched, he declared:

“To synergy! To scalable impact! To... collective spreadsheet enlightenment!”

People clapped. Someone cried. Someone else offered him a podcast deal.

He panicked and dove behind the punch bowl.

# Chapter 15: Mothership Surprise Inspection

One Tuesday morning, a mysterious “consultant” arrived to observe the office.

Danny recognized the aura instantly. Commander Glorvax.

Disguised in a tacky plaid suit and fake mustache, Glorvax surveyed everything from the snack drawer to the Slack channels.

“Explain this... meme,” he growled, pointing to a picture of a dancing banana labeled “workflow vibes.”

Danny shrugged. “Cultural expression. Very powerful.”

After a week, Glorvax left, muttering, “Unconquerable. Their systems defy logic.”

# Chapter 16: The Great Audit

The finance department announced a company-wide audit.

Danny interpreted this as a military interrogation.

He shredded 200 pages of perfectly normal emails. He erased digital records of snacks taken from the shared fridge. He installed a decoy database.

Terra sighed. “It’s not an intergalactic tribunal. Just give them your timesheets.”

# Chapter 17: Secrets & Side Projects

Emily showed Danny her side project: a phone app that predicted which coworkers would microwave fish.

Inspired, Danny built an emotion translator—then tested it on a marketing meeting. It exploded.

“That’s the third prototype,” Emily whispered. “You’re banned from whiteboards for a month.”

# Chapter 18: The Return of Carla

HR Carla had been promoted. She now ran Corporate Morale.

Her first initiative: “Spirit Week.”

Danny interpreted “Wacky Hat Wednesday” as a signal to wear a helmet and a flashing antenna.

People loved it. He became a legend.

“Sometimes I think you’re too weird to be real,” Carla said, smiling.

Danny sweated. “Correct. I mean—haha. Human!”

# Chapter 19: Data Day Dilemma

On the most dreaded day of the year—""Data Consolidation Friday""—the servers crashed.

Danny stayed overnight. He rebuilt the system using alien coding techniques and labeled the file tree in emojis.

It worked. Sort of. But now the printer only prints in Comic Sans.

Raj shrugged. “Honestly, I kinda dig it.”

# Chapter 20: Full Integration

Six months became a year. Danny had coworkers. Friends. Even a recurring lunch invite.

When the mothership called again, he answered with confidence:

>

He pressed send, leaned back in his chair, and smiled.

Just then, Terra burst into the room.

“Danny! You’re up for employee of the month.”

He blinked. “Is that... an honor or a punishment?”

She laughed. “Both.”

He straightened his tie, smiled wider, and said: “Then let’s conquer this office. Together.”

# Epilogue: Memo from HR (Updated)

From: HR  
Subject: Important Reminders

* Spirit Week is now quarterly.

Social interactions feel like a life and death situation. I’d dread small talk, panic in group chats, and overthink every convo for hours. After leaving my previous job, I realized my poor communication was holding me back *everywhere*. So I decided to fix it. I started working with a social coach (who was oddly charming and lowkey a therapist in disguise). What blew my mind was how much of my struggle wasn’t about what I said, it was about how I felt inside. Here are 3 things that helped me shift:

1. social anxiety is often unprocessed shame stored in the body, not just “being shy”
2. mirror neurons make you subconsciously match the vibe of who you're talking to—so your inner state is key
3. being ""bad at talking"" is usually just a lack of reps, not a personality flaw  

Books helped me *a lot*. My coach gave me a full rec list and said, “This is your social gym.” I started reading a book summary every night before bed, even on low-energy days I try to squeeze in a couple of minutes to read.

This is gold for anyone who struggles with saying what they actually want. This book helped me understand the difference between assertiveness and aggression. This book taught me how to speak up without sounding like an angry squirrel.

[The Charisma Myth](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-charisma-myth-by-olivia-fox-cabane) by Olivia Fox Cabane

[Captivate](https://www.befreed.ai/book/captivate-by-vanessa-van-edwards) by Vanessa Van Edwards

Best social skills book I’ve ever read. Vanessa is a behavioral investigator with research featured on CNN and Forbes. This book dives into micro-behaviors that make people trust you fast. I legit used her “conversation sparkers” at my cousin’s wedding and didn’t die of awkwardness. 

[Presence](https://www.befreed.ai/book/presence-by-amy-cuddy) by Amy Cuddy

This book helped me stop spiraling after convos. She explains how body posture impacts your brain and how self-trust shifts how others see you. It made me feel less like an imposter and more like a person. Must-read!

Everyday is another chance to be better. Start working on yourself today and you’d feel like you can conquer the world (literally).

If you’re struggling socially, you’re not broken. You just need practice, tools and some patience. Communication is a skill, not a personality type. Start by reading a few pages a day. You grow one convo at a time.

About a month ago, my buddy- total tech nerd and crypto geek - told me about a method to make money that turned out to be insanely simple and surprisingly profitable.

He decided to just share it publicly here on his Reddit profile \[[u/klembcke](https://www.reddit.com/user/klembcke/)\]. Honestly, if I were him, I probably would’ve sold it

But he’s just collecting tips if anyone feels like sending something. So I figured I’d help him out a bit and write this post.

For the record- I’m currently making around $230/day using this method, and after a week I’ve already made \~$1200.

Hopefully, it’ll help someone else here too- even if it’s just enough for a solid cup of coffee

I'm struggling. My boy is around 15. He was a rescue that I have had since 2012. They thought he was around two when I got him. He had been hit by a car and had been living rough for at least a few weeks before that.

Anyway, he has been the best boy for a long time but now he has Hyperthyroidism. Which the vet is trying to treat with medication. But he has gotten all matted and doesn't want to do anything. He no longer grooms himself and I have to brush him to get the matts out. He will no longer comes for pets and when I go to pet him he tolerates it for five minutes then hisses at me and wanders off.  
He has always been very affectionate and wanted to lay next to me but he no longer wants too. He sits under the coffee table all day and all night.  
The vet also states that he has very bad gingivitis but they cant operate on him due to a heart murmur.  
I'm just worried that I am prolonging his life for my benefit and he is in pain.  
So, advice anyone?

I've tried cat toothpaste which he hates and hisses at me when I brush his teeth.  
He doesn't want to play with anything either. He used to love his laser pointer but now just watches it whizz past.

Things came to a head when the building's Wi-Fi went out. Danny, desperate, climbed into the ceiling to ""fix it.""

Emily followed him. She caught him mid-transformation, antennae flickering.

“...I knew it,” she whispered.

Danny froze. “Please don’t disintegrate me.”

She blinked. “Why would I? Honestly, you’re still better than half the people here.”

They fixed the Wi-Fi together. She promised to keep his secret. In return, he promised to attend happy hour.

# Chapter 9: Just Another Day

Danny’s disguise was more natural now. He even understood inside jokes. Mostly.

He still pulled all-nighters, but now it was to help Emily debug code or prank Raj back. Terra called him “weird, but reliable.”

Skidewt didn’t know how long he could stay, but for now, he had a purpose. A team. A desk with a nameplate.

And that was more human than anything else he’d ever learned.

# Chapter 10: The Final Report

On the eve of his six-month deadline, Skidewt uploaded his final assessment to the mothership.

There was a long pause before the reply came:

# Chapter 11: Team-Building Terror

Skidewt had been warned. ""Beware team-building exercises,"" Commander Glorvax had said. But he hadn’t expected a weekend ropes course in the woods.

He wore a harness backwards. He misunderstood trust falls. When someone shouted, “Let yourself go!” he activated his emergency cloaking field instead of falling.

“That’s one way to disappear,” Terra muttered, scribbling something in a notepad.

By the end of the weekend, Danny was sore, confused, and somehow everyone’s favorite “mystery man.”

# Chapter 12: Office Romance Protocol

Raj started dating someone from marketing. Emily said Terra once dated a VP. Danny tried to understand this new layer of human interaction.

He downloaded 3,000 romantic comedies and compiled a spreadsheet titled “Love in the Workplace: Dangerous but Data-Backed.”

His algorithm said Terra and Mr. Henderson had a 76% compatibility score. He emailed it anonymously. Chaos ensued.

Emily intervened. “Danny, for the last time—stop trying to ship people like it’s Amazon.”

# Chapter 13: HR Nightmare

Danny was summoned to HR. A small, windowless room. A woman named Carla.

“Danny,” she said. “We’ve received... unusual reports.”

He sweated profusely. Literally. His anti-perspiration patch had failed.

“Apparently, you filled the vending machine with... nutrient paste?”

“Efficient. Cost-saving,” he offered.

Carla blinked. “Also, there’s a complaint about you installing a scanner in the toilet?”

“It was for... seat temperature research.”

Carla sighed. “Please just fill out these forms.”

Danny took the pen like it was a sacred artifact. Paperwork: humanity’s deadliest weapon.

# Chapter 14: Promotion Day Disaster

Promotion Day. Danny expected a simple handshake. Instead: balloons, cupcakes, a karaoke machine, and someone handing him a microphone.

He froze.

Then, drawing on every speech he’d ever watched, he declared:

“To synergy! To scalable impact! To... collective spreadsheet enlightenment!”

People clapped. Someone cried. Someone else offered him a podcast deal.

He panicked and dove behind the punch bowl.

# Chapter 15: Mothership Surprise Inspection

One Tuesday morning, a mysterious “consultant” arrived to observe the office.

Danny recognized the aura instantly. Commander Glorvax.

Disguised in a tacky plaid suit and fake mustache, Glorvax surveyed everything from the snack drawer to the Slack channels.

“Explain this... meme,” he growled, pointing to a picture of a dancing banana labeled “workflow vibes.”

Danny shrugged. “Cultural expression. Very powerful.”

After a week, Glorvax left, muttering, “Unconquerable. Their systems defy logic.”

# Chapter 16: The Great Audit

The finance department announced a company-wide audit.

Danny interpreted this as a military interrogation.

He shredded 200 pages of perfectly normal emails. He erased digital records of snacks taken from the shared fridge. He installed a decoy database.

Terra sighed. “It’s not an intergalactic tribunal. Just give them your timesheets.”

# Chapter 17: Secrets & Side Projects

Emily showed Danny her side project: a phone app that predicted which coworkers would microwave fish.

Inspired, Danny built an emotion translator—then tested it on a marketing meeting. It exploded.

“That’s the third prototype,” Emily whispered. “You’re banned from whiteboards for a month.”

# Chapter 18: The Return of Carla

HR Carla had been promoted. She now ran Corporate Morale.

Her first initiative: “Spirit Week.”

Danny interpreted “Wacky Hat Wednesday” as a signal to wear a helmet and a flashing antenna.

People loved it. He became a legend.

“Sometimes I think you’re too weird to be real,” Carla said, smiling.

Danny sweated. “Correct. I mean—haha. Human!”

# Chapter 19: Data Day Dilemma

On the most dreaded day of the year—""Data Consolidation Friday""—the servers crashed.

Danny stayed overnight. He rebuilt the system using alien coding techniques and labeled the file tree in emojis.

It worked. Sort of. But now the printer only prints in Comic Sans.

Raj shrugged. “Honestly, I kinda dig it.”

# Chapter 20: Full Integration

Six months became a year. Danny had coworkers. Friends. Even a recurring lunch invite.

When the mothership called again, he answered with confidence:

>

He pressed send, leaned back in his chair, and smiled.

Just then, Terra burst into the room.

“Danny! You’re up for employee of the month.”

He blinked. “Is that... an honor or a punishment?”

She laughed. “Both.”

He straightened his tie, smiled wider, and said: “Then let’s conquer this office. Together.”

I’ve booked airfares to and from Buffalo from LGA for the three-day period from September 6th through 8th.  I’ve also booked my “Tailgate Only Pass” with Bmore Around Town, so I’m pretty much set for game day beginning in the late afternoon.

Pending on my planning list are the following:

* Finding a decent and/or suitable hotel based on downtown location and my non-football interests.

* Non-football activities, including walking, during the daytime 

* Buying a solo ticket 

**Hotel**

Even looking this far in advance, hotels are understandably pricey, but reasonably within my budget.  What's most important is location.  It seems that most of the hotels for attending Highland Park stadium are downtown Buffalo, approximately 8 miles from the stadium.  I assume I can take a Lyft to the stadium (or tailgate event), and it's likely that the nicer hotels will be hosting out-of-towners for the game.  Of course, since I'll be attending the tailgate party (location is currently TBA), access to the stadium will be straightforward (I've previously attended a Bmore Around Town tailgate only pass in Glendale, AZ for a Cardinals' game).

What are some downtown hotel options close to walkable downtown Buffalo for cafes, restaurants, maybe local parks, sites to see, etc.?  I'm open to boutique hotels, or within the Hilton Honors domain.

**Non-football activities**

Seeking casual coffee joints, places to walk, sites to see, etc. during the morning and daytime.  I'm arriving Saturday night, so I'll have Sunday morning before the tailgate, and since I'm planning to leave Monday night, my Monday during the day is open for leisure.  Seeking suggestions based on my low-key on-foot interests.

**Ticket**

I attend professional sporting events often, and when buying a single ticket, StubHub, even on game day, has never been a problem (access-wise).

**Weather**

1m0donk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Depersonalization/comments/1m0donk/1_year_of_feeling_normal_again_after_6_years/,"1 year of feeling normal again, after 6 years, here’s step by step what I did:","Posted this 6 months ago in r/dpdr and it seemed to help a lot of people, so I’m sharing it here too for anyone who needs to hear it. This is my story of finally feeling normal again after 6 years of hell – step by step what actually helped.

---
For the last 6 years, I was you. Scrolling through Reddit at 2 a.m., convinced I was the one person who’d never recover from DPDR. Everything felt unreal, my brain wouldn’t shut up, and I was Googling things like, “Am I stuck in a dream forever?”

But guess what? I’m here, living my life, drinking coffee without questioning if I’m a hologram, and yes – I feel normal again (and it’s been 6 months now). If you’re reading this thinking, Yeah right, that’s not gonna be me, trust me – I was you.

So how did I get here? Well, full transparency: I did a load of stupid shit first. I tried grounding techniques that just made me hyper-focus on my body. I read every recovery blog out there and spent way too much money on quick-fix methods that didn’t fix anything. I even tried the DP Manual, which gave me a decent starting point but still didn’t quite click for me.

Then, I came across a guy on here who mentioned Andrew Mellish – you might’ve seen him online talking about how he spent years believing he was in The Truman Show (same energy as how I felt, honestly). He and his partner Ferne run The Anxious Academy, and honestly, working with them is what finally helped me connect the dots.

Let me be clear: recovery wasn’t some magical, overnight thing. It’s not about finding a “cure” – it’s about unlearning the panic cycle and retraining your brain to stop freaking out over its own sensations. Here’s what actually helped me:

I stopped fighting the feelings. The more I tried to make DPDR go away, the stronger it got. Learning to let it be there without fear was the turning point.

I dropped all the safety behaviors. No constant Googling, no avoiding mirrors, no checking my heartbeat. These things felt like they were helping, but they were keeping me stuck.

I shifted my focus outward. Instead of analyzing how I felt 24/7, I started living again. I’d sit in the park, notice the trees, listen to people chatting nearby – anything to reconnect with the world outside my head.

I learned that DPDR isn’t dangerous. The Academy explained the science behind it in a way that made so much sense. Once I understood it, the fear started to shrink.

It wasn’t perfect. I had setbacks and bad days, but I stopped giving those days so much power. Slowly, the sensations faded, and now I’m just… living. No overthinking, no existential spirals.

Look, I’m not here to sell you anything. I swear I’m not getting paid for this (though honestly, I should ask Andrew for a commission lol). If you’re skeptical – which, fair, it’s the internet – check out their socials:

www.instagram.com/theanxiousacademy

They post loads of free tips, and you can see testimonials from other people if you want to fact-check me.

I just want you to know that recovery is so possible, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. I only wish I’d have found this approach to recovery sooner.",1,1752573440.0,Depersonalization,1,1.0,False

Premise:
The film opens in total darkness — POV of a guy trapped inside a car trunk, struggling to breathe, muffled voices outside. The car stops, the trunk opens, and a masked figure drags him out to the edge of a cliff.

The killer’s tattoo briefly glimmers — an Easter egg for eagle-eyed viewers. The killer forces him to choose: walk off the cliff or get shot. “Ethan, the choice is yours.” The victim looks over the edge, terrified, refuses to comply.

Two shots ring out. The killer kicks him off the cliff. As he falls, something flashes — a subtle clue to the killer’s identity.

Cut to: A seemingly random person waking up, doing a morning routine with small inconsistencies — like the coffee pot being moved or the bathroom down the hall. The grogginess explains the oddities going unnoticed(think Shaun of the Dead vibes).

Then the TV news reports that the body found at the cliff has been identified as Ethan (last name TBD). The character drops their coffee mug, stunned, then looks around and finally discovers in a mirror: the face staring back isn’t theirs.

⸻

Why I included the killer saying “Ethan” — to establish his name before the TV reveal, heightening the moment of realization.

⸻

Questions for you all:
	•	What do you think about this concept?
	•	What could explain the consciousness transfer?
	•	Why might the MC have no memory of dying?
	•	How can I deepen the emotional impact of this identity crisis?
	•	Any thoughts on how to show the connection (or conflict) between the MC and the original body owner?

Would love your thoughts, ideas, or even if you know filmmakers or writers who’d dig this! Thanks in advance.

This book helped me stop spiraling after convos. She explains how body posture impacts your brain and how self-trust shifts how others see you. It made me feel less like an imposter and more like a person. Must-read!

Everyday is another chance to be better. Start working on yourself today and you’d feel like you can conquer the world (literally).

If you’re struggling socially, you’re not broken. You just need practice, tools and some patience. Communication is a skill, not a personality type. Start by reading a few pages a day. You grow one convo at a time. ",2,1752573077.0,selfimprovementday,0,1.0,False

1m0djd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m0djd7/help_what_would_you_do_in_this_situation/,Help - what would you do in this situation?,"Reddit, I'm feeling super confused and I've got in way too deep here. Absolutely desperate for some advice! Sorry it's long but I feel like all the details are important!

About a year ago, I noticed a local drama group were putting on a performance of Oliver Twist, which I remembered doing at school. I was Nancy & I still remembered the songs - it felt like a blast from the past and a bit of fun so I signed up to audition and got the role of Nancy! At first, I loved the group. I became really good friends with a few people - we'll call them Paula, Jasmine and Gary. The play was a huge success and sold out every night so we even added an extra night.

Following the success of Oliver Twist, the am dram group wanted to immediately get started on the next play. I was a bit burnt out but agreed if I could take on a smaller role this time. Which everyone was happy to. Gary had come up with a concept for a play and the group voted to let him go ahead with writing it, but this meant that we were rehearsing scenes before the rest was written.

The script was about two lovers who meet at a music gig (cute because this is how I met my fiancé!) Gary & Jasmine played the lovers who ended up engaged and I played the role of Jasmine's friend, helping her plan the wedding. Initially the script started out great, but as we went on, Gary was writing my character into it more and more and I was ending up with a bigger part than I wanted. Eventually his plot twist came - that Gary's character and my character fell in love and had an affair. I didn't feel morally comfortable with this, and I felt a bit disrespected that I'd asked for a small role and ended up the villain, but I had to admit that Gary's writing was gripping, so I went ahead. But I planned to quit the group once the show was over.

After the performances, the group agreed that we would take a step back from doing a big performance and focus more on improv and acting mini scenes together. This sounded amazing! I decided not to leave the group, because this was I could still enjoy acting and meeting up with my friends, but also have some space to focus on planning my wedding, etc.

I was becoming really good friends with Jasmine in particular, who felt like the sister I never had and we turned our Friday night drama group into a whole evening together - we'd start with dinner out together, go to drama group, and then head back to one of our homes for a gossip, wine and a movie.

At first the improvs & mini scenes were cute and easy - stuff like pretending to be movie stars in an interview or historical figures in battle. But gradually we started to shift towards more normal-life scenes, like ordering a coffee, and as much as I loved hanging out with Gary, Jasmine and Paula, I felt like the acting wasn't stimulating or fun anymore. Once again, I planned to quit. I didn't have the heart to tell Jasmine yet, but I hoped we'd still be able to continue our Friday night hangouts.

But this where things got a bit creepy. Paula and Jasmine performed an improv together of a daughter on the phone to her mother. My blood ran cold when I realised their conversation was eerily similar to the one I'd had on the phone to my own mother earlier that week. I tried to tell myself this was just a coincidence, although some of the details seemed a little too specific.

Then Gary wrote a scene in which a woman locks herself out of the house and has to climb in through the window - something that had literally happened to me that morning. I couldn't help wondering when he wrote the scene? Could he have seen me? Maybe, again, it was just coincidence.

More and more of these little improvs or mini scenes started to reflect moments in my life. I noticed specific phrases people had said to me, or that I'd said to others. They would be things I'd done that week, that morning: a word-for-word interaction with the postman, the song I'd sung while watering my plants, the exact ordered I'd placed at a fancy restaurant with my fiancé.

I felt like I was descending into paranoia. Everything I did, I was looking over my shoulder for someone in the am dram group. I made excuses not to see Jasmine. I checked my house for cameras. I wanted to quit, I wanted to leave the group, but I HAD to find out who and how they were finding out such specific details of my life. I was going mental, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I was afraid to leave the house but also desperate to get out and do things to see if they'd be reflected in the am dram group's performances. I started to do wild things that were out of character for me - I bought lingerie online, went to a basement poker evening, I shoplifted. It was all repeated on Friday nights at drama group.

I started to lay little ""traps"" like coughing a certain number of times on the phone to the vet. Paula and Jasmine ""improvised"" the same scene and, now unsurprisingly to me, even replicated the same number of coughs.

I was going crazy trying to work out who was doing this! I never caught a glimpse of anyone following me. I couldn't find cameras or microphones in my house. Everything I was doing was being acted out by this group - BUT HOW?!

Then came the moment that fucked me up.

I caught Jasmine and my fiancé making love in my bed.

Jasmine - my friend, who was helping me plan my wedding, who had spent countless nights drinking wine and hearing my heartfelt secrets - naked, entwined in passion, with my fiancé.

The weirdest part? This was the way Gary had written it in his play.. except that this time I was Jasmine's character, the broken bride.

My head was a mess, had Gary's play somehow predicted this?! Or had I become so lost in the paranoia of the group 'acting out my life' that I had lost all connection with my fiancé and missed him and Jasmine's growing connection? That I had lost all connection to reality. How, how could this be a coincidence?

I quit the drama group. I left my fiancé. I moved to a new town. I was desperate to get away from it all.

For a few weeks, everything was wonderful. I lived in peace and I could breathe again, I could order a coffee without overthinking my every word. I didn't have to look over my shoulder.

And then this morning, I saw it.

1m0dfvz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0dfvz,i really need your help...my phone broke down and i am moving to a new city for my college studies...read the body text!,"It is my second day of seeking assistance with my current situation. I am very grateful for the generous donations I received yesterday, which totaled approximately $12. It means a great deal to me.

My Samsung Galaxy A12 stopped functioning the day before yesterday. The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for the equivalent of $130 (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between $100 (8k INR) and $200 (17k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be a blessing. I have provided a BuyMeaCoffee link \[ [https://buymeacoffee.com/osirinyxades](https://buymeacoffee.com/osirinyxades) \], a MILAAP link \[ [http://m-lp.co/aadityas-3?utm\_medium=native\_message&utm\_source=app](http://m-lp.co/aadityas-3?utm_medium=native_message&utm_source=app) \], and a UPI ID \[ adityasarmahdon@oksbi \] for those who wish to contribute.

1m0dfrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1m0dfrb/help_i_got_completely_hoodwinked_why_did_he_do/,Help I got completely hoodwinked - why did he do this?,"My head is spinning...

I started talking to a guy online about 4 months ago it was a dm via instagram. He seemed normal enough. We agreed to meet in person after 4 months of video calls and talking about life, business, goals, family, challenges and personal contexts. he had a abnormality that was large on his face like a big birthmark, I found it endearing. he never raised it. I just once said is that a birthmark and he confirmed, I smiled and said 'its cool!' like it'.

My gut told me to cancel meeting - couldn't explain why. Maybe I had picked up on micro aggression comments over time.I had told him previously I was working on losing a few kilos - I am tall and feel better at a US size 4-6 but was currently a US size 10-12. Not enormous but not comfortable in my own skin.

Then once when I was eating after fasting all day I turned the camera off and he said ""why are u turning the cam off r u gonna eat like a little piggy?? dont think I dont know..."" and I got immediately turned off in a visceral way. it felt bizarre to say that. we argued and I decided I didn't want to keep talking with high frequency and noticed his moods were erratic. before that piggy comment he was jealous I had been talking to a male uni friend for an assignment yet claimed he wasn't jealous but made fun of him. Anyway - weird little things kept happening like that as he'd apologise and move forward.

He encouraged that he didn't have intellectual connection with anyone the way he did with me and wanted to meet. eventually I caved. we met. when I opened the door he tilted his head far to the side and 'you're beautiful' all wide-eyed and starry. then he seemed to get shy, head down. we talked and had champagne and bonded over nerves. he was clearly turned on I could see his pants, he kept saying I was so sensual and he got so turned on by me. eventually we kissed and fooled around a little. we went out with some of his old friends, he introduced me to them and it was odd that he never introduced his 8yr ex to them. a detail that came up in conversation.

next day we're in bed and he whispers 'I love you' ad looks shy like a little boy. I say 'what di du say?' ad he says 'nothing...' and smiles but coy. he says 'I could stay all day in bed with u .' but seems restless and like he can't calm down. he takes a shower.

over his stay he was moody. he made a weird joke saying 'the uber guy said hi -he knows u' and I was like huh? he said nothing its stupid joke. I took it like he's insulting me like I use uber a lot, he said he meant it like im well known by men around town (Like a sl\*t). previously he covertly questioned me liking him and when I said I used to like a guy who's famous and kinda looked like him he said 'oh I see! u like ugly motherf\*ckers!'. so I guess his self concept was not great - but he always appeared hyper confident.

he eventually revealed his many businesses and investments - very wealthy and autonomous. its all legit. anyway after the uber thing I said well I thought u meant a shaming body comment cause im still insecure and not feeling myself in my body. he said 'im attracted to u! but I get it, just do what u need to do for u to feel good'. but this was after he got ANGRY at me for opening up! eventually I said I think responsibly I need to remain single until I feel good about myself, just seems like the best move. his mood dropped he got really quiet and his eyes changed. he was pissed.

next day instinctively I made up a lie and said I had to leave early. I wasn't feeling it with him and so I left to get coffee and Brought it back. he wanted to have it with me at a cafe but I lied and said I had to go. he said he'd like to spend more time with me and I said 'it was nice to meet you' and smiled I was polite, he said 'was?!' and was pissed but holding it down. we were in lobby of building; I lied and said I really had to go but it was great meeting and we'd talk by phone.  
never had I felt so relieved to just get away from someone. I sat next door in the cafe while.he waited for his uber and left.  
when I got home his jacket was still in closet. he asked about if I wanna see him again and if he did something wrong, I said no its fine and ill post ur jacket. he started to act pissed and weird.  
eventually I said it doesn't feel like a match but id love to be friends- he snapped, insulted a few things and laughed at me. he was now in another state partying with friends. I was just relieved he was gone honestly.  
eventually he called to apologise - I said its fine and we bickered a bit, he still wasn't listening - then he texts and tells me he was hard and 'I dont know how u do that, now I wanna cum'. and I realised through his admission he was constantly touching himself on the phone and video calls prior to meeting - and now again post meeting, even DURING an argument. I felt sick.  
eventually he demanded his jacket back after insulting me again - I said no I threw it away. he always went on how he's a multi-millionaire and I didn't want his energy or any reason for him to come here. poor choice by me sure but I felt sick after what I learned. he had also been taking screenshots of me during conversations on video while I wasn't aware.  
eventually he IMPLODED. said I catfished him, looked like a basketball, that I couldn't get him hard during sex (he lost his erection - mind you we were in pitch black darkness not even looking at each other), other women get him hard not me, 'mission accomplished' cause he got a blowjob from me. that he's a multi millionaire with an amazing life and im a loser piece of shit etc etc - the abuse went on and on and on ad nauseam; it was insane and non stop. He's 35 mind you.  
Of course I blocked him on everything. but now I know why I had that weird gut feeling - my instincts knew all along he was 'off'.

hate to say it but he got to me. ive looked in the mirror 3 times today 'am I as round as a basketball??' I do have big boobs but im tall (5'8) and even at size US 10-12 not a basketball. and saying I catfished him? we video chatted for hours non stop - no filter. just needed to get this out because this really threw me. all his comments about his ex flood back now 'she couldn't get me hard anymore', and his jokes about viagra, him liking to 'watch' people, his ex now being on anti depressants. his rants about being objectified by his ex for a BBC (he's black) but in person I discovered he has a very very small private part - no issue to me, but it was just oddly incongruent with how he'd depicted his appendage - and suprising.

I feel sick because this guy was my first emotional investment after an abusive relationship. I had been open with this guy that I hadn't dated in 1.5yr due to it and was still recovering. I told him EVERYTHING about my experience with the abusive ex and getting a restraining order etc and looking back im horrified cause now he knew how to play me and hurt me. In that relationship I had been treated with suspicion and jealousy because I was taking good care of myself in all ways and looked and felt confident. thereafter the abuse I gained weight and felt lost and not 'me' - it wasn't about image it was about feeling connected to self-care. with this guy, he read me like a book. the catfish comment and basketball comment did a number on me because I had been intentionally open and honest with my pain and issues. I never attacked his looks or facial skin look or small apendage or other things. by the end of his abuse I ended up throwing some insults back but I was just so sick of his non stop onslaught of texts out of nowhere all because I set a boundary on the jacket. sorry for ranting but I need help processing this. if he thought I was so repulsive why didn't he go book a hotel? and laughing saying 'other women get him harrrrd' and he's having an amazing time flying around the country to see different women and enjoying his life, well, good for you??

Final note: after meeting, while we argued on the phone, he then texted me saying 'u make me wanna cum \*laugh face\* I dont know how u do that'. and he was getting hard talking on the phone - this was an argument!! if im a basketball and catfish then why's he reacting like that? the mind-boggling nature of this doesn't make sense so can someone help me process it please?",1,1752572515.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,1.0,False

We’ve been living together for the past 6 months. Overall things are good, but there’s this weird dynamic going on between her and my mom that’s starting to seriously get under my skin.

Anna is very social, very extroverted, and she’s big on what she calls “found family.” Early on in our relationship, she made a huge effort to bond with my mom, which I appreciated at first. She’d call her to chat, invite her over for coffee, even help her out with random errands sometimes. It was nice, until it started getting excessive.

Over the past few months, Anna has started calling my mom her ""best friend."" She says it CONSTANTLY. Like, to everyone. She’ll post on Instagram things like “hanging with my BESTIE” and it’s always my mom. She introduced her to people at a BBQ as her ""best friend"" in front of everyone. She even made a TikTok with my mom doing some trend, and the caption was ""bestie energy only.""

At first I laughed it off, but now it’s honestly weird. I don’t know how to explain it, it’s like she’s replacing other friends with my mom, and it’s starting to affect things in our relationship. She talks to my mom more than she talks to me sometimes. If we have an argument, she’ll literally call my mom to ""vent"" about me, and then my mom gets involved. I’ve asked her to please not do that but she says “I just need advice from my bestie.”

It’s reached the point where I dread family gatherings because there’s this weird inside-joke vibe between them and I feel like an outsider in my own family. My sister even mentioned that it’s ""kinda creepy"" how close they are.

So last weekend, after yet another time where Anna introduced my mom as her ""best friend"" at a mutual friend’s wedding, I told her on the ride home that I needed her to stop calling my mom that. I said it makes me uncomfortable and it’s starting to cross boundaries. She got super defensive and said I’m ""jealous of her friendship"" with my mom, which feels ridiculous but also… maybe there’s a tiny grain of truth to it? I don’t know.

Now things are tense at home. Anna says I’m ""controlling who she can be friends with"" and my mom texted me saying she feels ""caught in the middle.""

I honestly don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is a legit boundary issue. I’m not trying to stop them from talking, but I don’t think it’s normal to call your boyfriend’s mom your best friend and complain about your boyfriend to her.

About a month ago, my buddy- total tech nerd and crypto geek - told me about a method to make money that turned out to be insanely simple and surprisingly profitable.

He decided to just share it publicly here on his Reddit profile \[[u/klembcke](https://www.reddit.com/user/klembcke/)\]. Honestly, if I were him, I probably would’ve sold it

But he’s just collecting tips if anyone feels like sending something. So I figured I’d help him out a bit and write this post.

For the record- I’m currently making around $230/day using this method, and after a week I’ve already made \~$1200.

Hopefully, it’ll help someone else here too- even if it’s just enough for a solid cup of coffee

It was upon this familiar frequency that the latest disturbance arrived, not with a bang, but with a tweet. Or rather, a series of tweets, a digital crime scene so baffling in its contradictions that it demanded investigation.

The particulars of the case were, on the surface, straightforward enough for any amateur observer of our digital age. The subject, one [Elon Musk](https://techonion.org/tag/elon-musk/), a man whose public persona oscillates between visionary industrialist and a teenager who has just discovered the reply-guy function, had once again set the global discourse ablaze. First, a sudden, seemingly full-throated endorsement of a political candidate, [Donald Trump](https://techonion.org/tag/donald-trump/), which sent shockwaves through the very platform he owns. Then, as the ensuing firestorm reached its zenith, a subtle, almost bored, withdrawal of that same sentiment. And finally, appearing as if from another dimension entirely, a third pronouncement, delivered with the chest-thumping certainty of a carnival barker: [Grok 4](https://techonion.org/tag/grok/), his own artificial intelligence, was now, definitively, “the best AI model bar none!”

The public, as is its wont, saw only chaos. They debated, they raged, they attributed the sequence to 4D chess, a mental breakdown, or a simple ploy for attention. But to a seasoned investigator of technological absurdity, this was no mere chaos. This was a pattern. A set of clues. The game, as they say, was afoot.

After doing a ton of research and finally taking the plunge, I can say that for coffee lovers, it absolutely is.

Let's face it, those daily trips to the coffee shop add up fast. I was spending over $100 a month on lattes and cappuccinos. With a home espresso machine, I'm saving money and enjoying cafe-quality drinks whenever I want.

But it's not just about saving cash. There's something special about crafting your own perfect espresso shot or steaming milk to silky perfection. It's become a relaxing morning ritual that I look forward to each day.

Of course, choosing the right machine is key. After trying a few, I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have a wide range of machines for every budget and skill level.

For beginners, I'd recommend starting with a semi-automatic machine. They're easier to use but still give you control over the brewing process. As you get more comfortable, you can upgrade to a fully manual machine for even more customization.

One thing to keep in mind is that good espresso requires more than just the machine. You'll need fresh, quality beans, a good grinder, and some practice. But trust me, the learning process is half the fun.

And let's talk about the variety of drinks you can make. Espresso is the foundation for so many delicious coffees - lattes, cappuccinos, Americanos, and more. With a home machine, you can experiment and create your own signature drinks.

Maintenance is another factor to consider. Most machines need regular cleaning and descaling, but it's not too time-consuming. Plus, proper care means your machine will last for years, making it an even better investment.

For those worried about counter space, there are plenty of compact options available. You don't need a huge machine to make great espresso. Some of the best ones I've seen are surprisingly small and sleek.

If you're still on the fence, I'd encourage you to check out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have detailed descriptions and customer reviews that can help you find the perfect machine for your needs and budget.

In conclusion, if you're a coffee lover who enjoys quality espresso drinks, a home machine is definitely worth considering. The initial investment pays off in savings, convenience, and the satisfaction of mastering a new skill. Plus, you'll never have to settle for mediocre coffee shop espresso again!",1,1752571806.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Anyone else feel like *every day* there’s a new trading app popping up? Like, blink, and boom — another “next-gen” platform promising insane returns. It's honestly hard to tell what’s legit and what’s just riding the crypto hype wave. That’s exactly how I felt when I first heard about **[NexaveroPro](https://tinyurl.com/yqngru8e)**.

Lately, there’s been a lot of chatter about this platform in trading circles, and not just the crypto bros. Even some seasoned investors I follow are giving it a spin. With so many platforms like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, and **Bitcoin Era** flooding the space, I wanted to dig deep and find out: does **NexaveroPro** actually stand out?

In this review, I’ll walk you through everything — what NexaveroPro is, how it works, what makes it tick, its pros and cons, and whether it’s worth your time (and money). If you've been curious but skeptical, this is your go-to guide.

### [👉 Open Your NexaveroPro Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/yqngru8e)
## Summary

Here’s a quick snapshot of what NexaveroPro brings to the table:

| Feature | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform Name** | NexaveroPro |
| **Type** | Automated Trading Platform |
| **Assets Supported** | Crypto, Forex, Stocks, Commodities |
| **Minimum Deposit** | $250 |
| **Mobile Support** | Yes (Web-based, mobile-friendly) |
| **Customer Support** | 24/7 Live Chat & Email |
| **Available In** | Most countries, with a few exceptions |
| **Best For** | Beginners & casual investors |
| **Drawbacks** | No mobile app, limited transparency on founders |

## What is NexaveroPro?

NexaveroPro is an **automated trading platform** designed to make crypto and forex trading easier for regular folks. Think of it as your digital co-pilot — it uses algorithms and real-time data to spot market opportunities and execute trades on your behalf.

The platform claims to use advanced AI to improve decision-making, reduce emotional trading, and deliver better outcomes — especially helpful if you’re new or don’t have the time to babysit charts all day. It supports **multiple asset types**, not just crypto, which gives it a bit of an edge over some of the crypto-only bots.

So in short, it’s part trading assistant, part automation tool, and part risk manager.

## Who Created NexaveroPro?

Now, this is one area where things are a little murky. The creators of NexaveroPro haven’t made their identities public, at least not in any official capacity. This isn’t super uncommon — platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** also keep their dev teams under wraps.

That said, the tech behind NexaveroPro has a polished feel, and the platform is backed by what looks like a network of brokers. These brokers handle the financial side of things and help connect users to live markets.

Would I love more transparency? Absolutely. But so far, I haven’t seen anything sketchy that throws up major red flags.

### [🔥 Start Trading with NexaveroPro Today](https://tinyurl.com/yqngru8e)
## How Does NexaveroPro Work?

At its core, NexaveroPro functions as an **automated trading system**. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Data Collection** – It pulls in real-time market data from various sources.
2. **Analysis** – It uses AI to assess trends, patterns, and potential trade setups.
3. **Execution** – Once a trade opportunity is spotted, it automatically places the trade via a broker.
4. **Monitoring** – The system continues to manage open trades, setting stop-losses and take-profits based on market movement.

You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius to use it. The idea is to **automate the boring stuff** and let the platform make calculated decisions — freeing you up to live your life.

## NexaveroPro Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real — no platform is perfect. Here’s what I liked and what could use some work.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** with minimal setup required
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets** beyond just crypto
- ✅ **Runs 24/7** without needing constant supervision
- ✅ **Customizable risk settings**
- ✅ **No hidden fees** (just the standard broker spread)

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** (web-based only)
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** about the team behind it
- ❌ **Might be too simple** for advanced traders who want full control

Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you’re looking for a passive trading tool.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access NexaveroPro?

NexaveroPro is **web-based**, which means you can access it from:

- Desktop computers (Windows or macOS)
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones (iOS & Android)

It runs smoothly on mobile browsers, which is great — just wish they had a **dedicated app** for push alerts and quicker access. But it’s functional, which is what counts.

## NexaveroPro – Supported Countries

NexaveroPro is available in **most countries**, including:

- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Most of the EU
- South Africa
- Singapore

However, it’s **not available** in countries with strict financial regulations like North Korea, Iran, or a few parts of the Middle East. Always good to check during sign-up if your region is supported.

## NexaveroPro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where NexaveroPro shines. It processes live market data and uses AI to spot trends before most retail investors even notice. That means you’re **not stuck reacting** — the system does the heavy lifting and **acts proactively**.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean and modern. You don’t need to watch 10 YouTube tutorials to figure it out. It’s as simple as **log in, pick your settings, and go**. Everything from funding your account to reviewing your trading history is intuitive.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a native app, the web version works well on mobile. The site adapts to smaller screens, so you can trade or check performance on the go. I’ve used it from my phone during coffee runs — no issues.

### Customizable Alerts

Want to be notified when Bitcoin hits a certain price? Or when your portfolio drops by 5%? NexaveroPro lets you set **custom alerts** via email or browser notifications. Super useful for managing risk without being glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Not just crypto! You can also trade:

- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

This kind of asset diversity is rare for a platform in this space. It gives you **more ways to diversify** your strategy, which I always recommend.

## Is NexaveroPro a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn't seem like it**.

I’ve tested a lot of these platforms, and NexaveroPro doesn’t show the usual scam signs — no outrageous promises, no shady upsells, and no pressure tactics. You can withdraw your funds, customer service is responsive, and the platform works as advertised.

Still, I always recommend **starting small** and doing your own due diligence. Use the demo mode if available, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on NexaveroPro?

The starting deposit is **$250**. That’s pretty standard across platforms like this.

You’ll need to deposit this amount to activate auto-trading or even access all features. I find it’s a fair low-barrier entry — enough to test the waters without risking too much.

### NexaveroPro Customer Support

Customer support is **24/7**, and you can reach them via:

- Live chat
- Email
- Callback request (from your broker)

I tried the live chat and got a response in under 5 minutes. They were polite and knew their stuff. Solid experience overall.

## How do you start trading on NexaveroPro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official NexaveroPro site and fill in your name, email, and phone number. You’ll get a confirmation email with a link to verify your account.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once verified, you’ll be redirected to a partnered broker’s dashboard. This is where you deposit your **$250 minimum**. Most brokers accept credit cards, bank transfers, and even crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

With your account funded, you can customize your trading settings or let the bot handle everything. You can toggle between **manual and auto mode**, and adjust risk levels anytime.

## How to Delete a NexaveroPro Account?

If you ever want to delete your account:

1. Contact customer support via email or live chat.
2. Request account closure and data deletion.
3. Make sure your balance is withdrawn first.

They’ll typically respond within 24 hours. It’s a straightforward process, no hoops to jump through.

### [🔥 Start Trading with NexaveroPro Today](https://tinyurl.com/yqngru8e)
## The Verdict

If you’re looking to dip your toes into **automated trading** without a steep learning curve, NexaveroPro is a solid pick. It’s user-friendly, supports multiple asset types, and does a good job at simplifying complex market data.

Sure, it’s not perfect — I’d love a mobile app and more transparency around the devs. But compared to most platforms in this space, it’s **legit, functional, and beginner-ready**.

For $250, it’s worth trying if you’re curious about AI-based trading. Just treat it like a tool, not a magic money machine.

I am very grateful for the generous donations I received yesterday, which totaled approximately $12. It means a great deal to me.

My Samsung Galaxy A12 stopped functioning the day before yesterday. The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for the equivalent of $130 (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between $100 (8k INR) and $200 (17k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be a blessing. I will provide you with a BuyMeaCoffee link , a MILAAP link, and my UPI ID in the DMs if you just message me... please take some time to help me out! it will mean the world to me!

Worst day of my life. Can't remember much else because my brain blocked it out,

was traumatic. Slept 1 hour horrific nightmares and sleep paralysis. No appetite.

extreme irritability. Can't stop moving. Strange visions when eyes closed.

Gemotric patterns on the wall.



Day 2- hot and cold, sweating profusely, shivering,irritable, shaky,

brain fog, can't think straight, severe anxiety, dissociation, nothing

seems real, pacing my room or rolling around in bed. 1 hour sleep nightmare 

woke up extremely agitated, confused, out of it and paranoid. Went back to bed

slept okay 3 hours. Vivid strange dreams. Got chased and murdered in my dream.

Ate some food. Panic of swallowing. Body doesn't feel like mine.



Day 3- Woke up soaked in a pool of sweat, memories and emotions coming back.

Feel like absolute shit, still scared to leave my room. Feel really yucky.

Feel bad and embarrased and anxious of things i've done in the past.

Physical anxiety decreased and psycholigcal anxiety increased.

Jumpy and scared to loud noises and people. Shaky. Depressed. Strong cravings

for alcohol. Agitated, pissed off, sweaty. Paranoid. Hearing something like a

tv is quietly on in the background when there isn't.Slept good 4 hours no dreams.



Day-4 Woke up a little sweaty, Feel somewhat normal. Made a coffee had a shower.

Ate food and soaked up the sun.Played some video games.

Now really sad, emotions are strong,

hard to live life without alcohol, hard to talk to people without alcohol.

Hard to deal with emotion without alcohol. Kind of want to cry lol.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a melamine sponge hinges on several key features, including its density, size, durability, and composition. Understanding these aspects can help you select the perfect sponge for your cleaning tasks.

**Density:** The density of a melamine sponge directly affects its cleaning power and longevity. Higher density sponges tend to be more abrasive and durable, capable of removing tougher stains and lasting longer before disintegrating.

Denser melamine sponges are generally more effective at scrubbing away ingrained dirt and scuff marks on surfaces like walls, floors, and appliances. the increased density provides more friction, allowing the sponge to grip onto and lift away stubborn debris. However, excessively dense sponges can also be more prone to scratching delicate surfaces, so its essential to use them with caution and test them in an inconspicuous area first. Look for sponges that clearly advertise their density or that feel noticeably firm and compact to the touch.

**Size and Shape:** Melamine sponges come in various sizes and shapes, catering to different cleaning needs. Larger sponges are suitable for cleaning expansive surfaces like floors and walls, while smaller sponges are ideal for detailed work and reaching tight corners.

The shape of the sponge can also affect its usability. Rectangular sponges are versatile and easy to grip, while contoured or shaped sponges can provide better access to curved surfaces or intricate details. Consider the types of cleaning tasks you typically perform when selecting the size and shape of your melamine sponges. If you frequently clean large areas,opt for larger,rectangular sponges. If you need to clean small, hard-to-reach areas, smaller, more specialized shapes may be more suitable.

**durability:** Melamine sponges are known for their abrasive nature,which inevitably leads to gradual disintegration with use. however, the durability of a sponge can vary substantially depending on its quality and construction.

Higher-quality melamine sponges are typically more resistant to tearing and crumbling, allowing them to withstand repeated use and maintain their effectiveness for a longer period. Factors that contribute to durability include the density of the melamine foam, the presence of any reinforcing layers or coatings, and the overall construction of the sponge. Look for sponges that are advertised as being ""extra durable"" or ""long-lasting,"" and read customer reviews to get an idea of how well they hold up over time.

**Composition and Additives:** While melamine foam is the primary component of these sponges,some manufacturers add other materials or chemicals to enhance their performance or add specific properties.

some sponges may contain additives like activated carbon for odor absorption or antibacterial agents for added hygiene.Others may be laminated to a more durable backing material, such as a cellulose sponge, to improve their grip and longevity. It's vital to be aware of any additives present in the sponge, especially if you have sensitivities or allergies. some additives may also affect the sponge's compatibility with certain surfaces or cleaning solutions, so always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

Key features of the best melamine sponges in 2025 include:

*   High Density for maximum cleaning power
*   Variety of Sizes and Shapes for versatility
*   Enhanced Durability for longer lifespan
*   Safe and Effective Composition

1m0czgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NDIS/comments/1m0czgc/disability_support_work_general_experience/,Disability Support Work General Experience.,"I know a majority of you are probably located in city areas, with a higher population density, but as a support worker in a smaller town (30,000 people around three hours from a city of similar size or more) your experience can be quite different.

I've been working with my organisation for just over three years now, got employed on the spot with no qualifications, but one of my older brothers has autism and intellectual disabilities so I guess they figured I had lived experience, plus they put me on probation for the first x months anyway.

I'm a casual and get $44.59 an hour currently, after the newest increases we got. Averaging around 41-45 hours a fortnight.

During the time that groups overcharging the NDIS for services provided was all over the news, my brother changed support workers (he has a plan written/organised/overseen by our sister, but has independent workers) to a guy who had just left the NDIS and moved into independent work. This dude was charging him $100 an hour, in two hour shifts at which point a lot of the time he would just show up whenever. The reason I mention everything else is on one of those shifts, around the time I learnt what he was charging, they were sitting out the front talking about people overcharging their clients.

Dude was getting paid nearly 2.5x my hourly rate to sit and have a coffee out the front of the house and chat. I also know services such as lawnmowers would often attempt to overcharge, putting down more hours or listing things they didn't actually do, like gardening when he doesn't have a garden. This wasn't just one group too, multiple did it with him.

Another issue I've come across is the blatant sexism in the industry, in terms of how treatment is given to both support workers and clients.

I do not get women as clients, I've only been offered one, a verbally abusive aboriginal girl that was a 2-1, with the other support worker always being a woman. I've never questioned this, as I guess most would point out why, but I see in my day-to-day shifts, constant women supporting men, and generally a lot of those men find the women attractive. I've witnessed disabled men who are known to, for example, use their injuries to get physical affection (I hurt myself, can i get a hug) and then they will smile over that SW's shoulder at you.

Incredibly inappropriate and known behavior, as I used to support that particular client myself.

I had an incident with a client of another organisation following me around during mixed-organisation events (each day has different things, one group might hold fishing or bowling on fridays, yacht sailing or sports at the pool on wednesday etc) - she would approach and be rude and belittle you, and then follow you around if you tried to put space between yourself and her. I didn't at the time even know she had an SW, cause as I later found out she was one of those clients that doesn't like their SW being visible and everyone knowing she has one.

I put this in my shift notes every time it happened, and it was always witnessed by tons of other SW's as they are public events, figuring the coordinators would read it and act on it which never happened. This lead to me, one day when she was following me outside of the public pool (around my car mind you, literally) because we got there before it opened, i just had to walk away because my temper was flaring, and i noticed an old woman walking my way that i didnt recognise, commenting as i walked past that the girl behind me needed a support worker. That's when I found out this old woman WAS her support worker, and that she did have support.

This woman then went on to chastise me and say 'that's just her disability' as if I'm expected to put up with it. She ended up reporting it to her organisation, which sent my organisation a very nasty email calling me rude and disrespectful, which the coordinator let me read instead of reading it out herself. They were, after I explained it, happy with my retelling of the situation, but told me to 'try not to be rude'. I guarantee the email they sent back didn't really stand up for me that much either, as she has approached me twice since then when I see her randomly (I don't do those specific shifts anymore).

On the flip-side, I have a male client who half of his client profile is about wanting a girlfriend. He will stare at women he finds attractive, eventually approaching them and asking constant questions, some of which aren't appropriate.

I'm expected to manage this behavior and tell him why its not acceptable. I guarantee if I didn't and a report was lodged, I'd get written up for not doing my job.

Another issue I have is the parents half of the time being the worst part of the job.  
Or the fact my brother got denied a trip to one place he wanted to go, SW saying no no no they will never do that, but suddenly x months later got approved another to a place his new support worker used to live, somehow, which the support worker also happened to be the one to suggest.

Or how the other organisation I mentioned above, with the girl, two of their co-ordinators I know peronsally, one of which used to sell drugs to my brother, and the other used to be an addict cause I had to put the dude on the floor on night like 8 years prior because he came down to my room during a party, pissed, and kept trying to intimidate me and went to push over my brand new television just to get a reaction. One of those coordinators (the first one) also used to support my brother independently and would always just sit on her phone and ignore him, never take him anywhere or anything.

But because she is good at talking to people, she is now a bloody coordinator for the biggest organisation in my town, and possibly even my state.

## What is Vision Maxalt Pip?

**Vision Maxalt Pip** is an online trading platform designed to help people trade a variety of assets—like cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, and even stocks. It's marketed as a **smart, semi-automated tool** that analyzes markets in real-time and assists with trading decisions.

What makes it especially interesting is its blend of automation and manual control. You’re not just pushing a button and hoping for the best. Instead, the platform provides analysis, signals, and tools, but you still get the final say. It's like having a co-pilot instead of letting the robot drive the plane entirely.

## Who Created Vision Maxalt Pip?

Honestly, there’s not a ton of public info on the **original creators** of Vision Maxalt Pip. That’s pretty common for platforms in this niche—maybe a little too common. However, the platform appears to be connected with a network of **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy.

From what I’ve gathered, it seems to follow a similar model to platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, where the backend tech is licensed to brokers who then offer it to users under different names. So while we don’t have a face behind the curtain, the tech seems solid.

Just dropped Author AI on Product Hunt today and my hands are still shaking lol.

**The story:**  
Started this because I kept having book ideas but zero time to actually write them. Like, who has months to sit down and write a whole book? Not me with my ADHD brain 😅

**What it does:**  
Basically you dump your random book idea (literally could be ""vampires in space"" or whatever) and it spits out a complete book. Like chapters, outline, the whole thing. Takes maybe 5-10 minutes instead of 5-10 months.

**The tech stack:**

* Built with lots of coffee and questionable life choices
* AI does the heavy lifting for content generation
* Multi-language support (because why not)
* PDF/Word exports for easy publishing

**Things I learned building this:**

1. Users care more about speed than perfection
2. The ""Director Mode"" feature I almost cut? Users LOVE it
3. **30 free credits was the sweet spot for onboarding**
4. PayPal integration is still a pain in 2025 💸

**The scary part:**  
Launching on PH is terrifying. Like putting your baby out there for the internet to judge. But the response so far has been incredible and I'm trying not to refresh the page every 30 seconds.

**Real talk:** This isn't going to replace real authors or amazing storytellers. But if you've got ideas stuck in your head and want to see them as actual books? That's exactly what this is for.

Anyone else here working on AI writing tools? Would love to connect and swap horror stories about training models 😂

Thanks for reading my rambling post. If you want to check it out, find [""Author AI"" on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/authorai?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social). No pressure though - just happy to be part of this awesome community!

What's everyone else shipping this week? 🚀

I am very grateful for the generous donations I received yesterday, which totaled approximately $12. It means a great deal to me.

My Samsung Galaxy A12 stopped functioning the day before yesterday. The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for the equivalent of $130 (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between $100 (8k INR) and $200 (17k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be a blessing. I have provided a Buy Me a Coffee link , a MILAAP link , and a UPI ID in the comments for those who wish to contribute. Thank you very much! Have a wonderful day !

With the surge in popularity of platforms like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Code, it’s honestly no surprise that Vela Nova is gaining traction. Whether you're totally new to trading or just looking for a platform that's not a pain to use, this one might actually be worth your attention.

So in this post, I'm breaking down **everything you need to know about Vela Nova**—how it works, what makes it unique, the pros and cons, and whether or not it's worth your time (and money). Let's get into it.

## What is Vela Nova?

**Vela Nova is an automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and more—without needing to sit in front of a screen all day. Think of it as a smart assistant that uses algorithms to make trades for you based on market trends and signals.

What really stood out to me was how **hands-off it can be**, while still offering the option to dive deeper if you're more experienced. Whether you're looking to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, or something more traditional like Gold or USD/EUR, Vela Nova handles it all through one dashboard.

Unlike overly complex platforms that require you to learn a million things before making your first trade, Vela Nova is built for **ease of use**—making it appealing to both newcomers and semi-pros.

## Who Created Vela Nova?

The exact names behind Vela Nova aren’t publicly known (which is pretty common in this space), but from what I could gather, it was developed by a team of **financial tech experts, AI developers**, and **market analysts** who’ve worked on similar tools like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

Honestly, I would’ve liked a little more transparency here. While the platform seems legit and the support team is responsive, **not knowing the faces behind it** might be a red flag for some. That said, the functionality speaks for itself, and I haven’t seen anything shady so far.

## How Does Vela Nova Work?

Vela Nova uses **automated trading algorithms** to scan the markets, identify profitable trade opportunities, and place trades on your behalf. You can choose how much control you want—either letting the algorithm run on autopilot or using manual mode to make your own moves.

Here’s a simple breakdown:
- **Step 1:** You deposit funds into your account.
- **Step 2:** The software monitors the market using AI and real-time data.
- **Step 3:** When it spots a trade that fits your strategy, it places it.
- **Step 4:** You sit back or take over whenever you want.

It’s like having a trading bot that doesn’t sleep. For anyone who's tired of missing opportunities because they’re not glued to charts 24/7, this kind of automation is a game changer.

## Vela Nova Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect, but here’s how Vela Nova stacks up:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, especially for beginners
- ✅ Offers a demo account to test the waters
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes (not just crypto)
- ✅ Real-time analytics and alerts
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (usually within 48 hours)
- ✅ 24/7 customer support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lack of info about the founding team
- ❌ Not available in some countries (like the U.S.)
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit to get started

Overall, it delivers more pros than cons—especially if you're someone who likes to trade but doesn’t want to do all the heavy lifting manually.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Vela Nova?

Good news: **Vela Nova isn’t picky about your device**. You can access it from virtually any browser, whether you're on:

- A **desktop or laptop** (Windows/Mac)
- A **tablet**
- A **smartphone** (Android/iOS)

There’s no downloadable app yet, but the **web interface is optimized for mobile**. I’ve used it on my phone while commuting and had no issues at all. It’s responsive, clean, and doesn’t lag.

## Vela Nova – Supported Countries

Vela Nova is available in **most countries**, but there are a few exceptions. Based on what I found, users in the **U.S., Canada** and a few **OFAC-restricted regions** may not be able to register due to regulatory limitations.

If you’re outside those zones, you’re probably good to go. Just make sure to check the registration form—if your country is listed in the dropdown, you’re in.

## Vela Nova – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the best things about Vela Nova is its **real-time market scanning**. It constantly monitors the market using AI-powered tools and identifies trends, patterns, and potential trading signals. This allows users to **make informed decisions quickly**, which is crucial in fast-moving markets like crypto or forex.

### User-Friendly Interface

I’ve tried platforms that made me feel like I needed a finance degree just to log in. Thankfully, Vela Nova **keeps it simple**. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and you can see everything—your balance, trades, and market data—without jumping through hoops.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no official app, the **browser-based mobile experience is top-tier**. It loads fast, doesn’t crash, and looks great on both Android and iOS. Whether you're at home or grabbing a coffee, you can keep tabs on your trades from anywhere.

### Customizable Alerts

Vela Nova lets you set up **price alerts, trade signals, and market condition warnings**. This is awesome if you’re managing trades manually or just want to stay updated. You’ll get notifications when specific thresholds are hit, so you’re never caught off guard.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This platform isn’t just about crypto. You can **trade across multiple markets**, including:
- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- Forex pairs
- Commodities like Gold and Oil
- Stocks and indices

This diversity means you can **spread your risk** and not have all your eggs in one basket.

## Is Vela Nova a Scam?

From my experience—**nope, it’s not a scam**. Vela Nova works with **regulated brokers**, uses **SSL encryption**, and has a **transparent withdrawal process**. I tested it by withdrawing a small amount, and it hit my account in two days.

Still, like with any trading platform, there’s always **risk involved**, especially when using automation. Just because it’s not a scam doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed profits. Use the demo account first and **never invest more than you can afford to lose**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Vela Nova?

To start trading on Vela Nova, you’ll need to deposit at least **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category. That deposit goes directly into your trading account and is used for placing trades—it’s not a fee or anything.

If you’re unsure, I’d recommend starting with the demo first, then depositing the minimum once you're comfortable.

### Vela Nova Customer Support

Honestly, the **customer support surprised me**. I used the live chat late at night and still got a response within minutes. You can reach them via:
- **Live Chat** (24/7)
- **Email Support**

They’re friendly, quick, and actually helpful—not just bots sending copy-paste replies.

## How do you start trading on Vela Nova?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Vela Nova site and fill out the registration form. You’ll need your name, email, and phone number. Super quick—takes like 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll be connected with a **partner broker**. You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff), then deposit the **minimum $250** to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either:
- Use **Auto Mode** (recommended for beginners)
- Switch to **Manual Mode** (if you’ve got experience)

You can also play around with the **demo account** before going live.

## How to Delete a Vela Nova Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just contact customer support and request deletion. They’ll verify your identity and **close your account upon request**, usually within 24–48 hours. Any remaining funds should be withdrawn before doing this.

## The Verdict

If you're looking for a trading platform that's **easy to use, packed with features, and doesn’t require you to be a market expert**, Vela Nova is definitely worth checking out. It’s not perfect (no platform is), but it ticks most of the right boxes.

The **automation, multi-asset access, and low barrier to entry** make it one of the better options out there for beginners and casual traders. Just remember: there’s risk involved, and it’s not a get-rich-quick button. But as a tool? It’s solid.

1m0cubn,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorizedbicycles/comments/1m0cubn/new_post_2_stroke_engines/,New post --- 2 STROKE ENGINES,"Heya, good morning y'all. This one's gonna be a yapper, so TL;DR: Need help understanding 2 strokes and whether or not it's what I need. Will pay for your coffee or sandwich if you help me out with the process.



\--- I'm the guy that posted here a few days ago about revitalizing a 4 stroke... there's a reason I never followed through: years of neglect caused my frame to crack and the motor won't fit on any of my bikes, so... tough shit. With that in mind, I'm here to propose a new idea- a 2 stroke engine on a bicycle that I have laying around: the Kona Kikapu, with both front and rear suspension and disk brakes? 

  
I just have a few questions regarding 2 stroke engines: 

1. Is it feasible to commute 11 total miles a day (5.5 there, and another 5.5 back) on a 2 stroke? Going through uphill, flat ground and downhill, every day? I understand they're built for fun, and not for stability, but surely there has to be a way to make them that much reliable. Right? I'm willing to sink in some money, just not an absurd amount of it... anywhere between $300 including the kit and another $300 on modifications/accessories to make it feasible. As long as it beats out Ubering or paying for repairs on my crappy electric bike.

2. What are ways I can deal with the vibration issues aside from rubber and loctite-ing everything until not even God can undo the bolts?

3. Is this even wise?

4. Is it possible on my frame? (This time I'll post photos of the bike FOR SURE)

And 5. What build kits would you recommend for me? 

  
I will note that, despite seemingly having enough clearance for a motor, the Kikapu has a suspension bar at the bottom of the frame that makes me question whether or not it's possible. Will upload a photo ASAP so you see what I mean. Otherwise, look up the make and model. 

Will probably give a small amount of money (enough for a cup of coffee or a sandwich or something) to anyone that helps me a bunch with figuring this out. Thanks.",1,1752570196.0,motorizedbicycles,4,1.0,False

I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for the equivalent of $130 (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between $100 (8k INR) and $200 (17k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be a blessing. I have provided a Buy Me a Coffee link , a MILAAP link , and a UPI ID in the comments for those who wish to contribute. Thank you very much! Have a wonderful day !

Here Are 10 Proven Methods That Work!,"Ever wondered why testimonials are so important in the business world? They're like the secret sauce for increasing trust and credibility in any business. Think about it!

When you're buying online or looking for a new service to subscribe to, don't you go toward firms with high ratings? That is the power of testimonials.

They are the voice of your satisfied consumers, indicating to potential clients, ""Hey, these guys are good!""

**Why Testimonials Are Crucial**

Now, let's get down to the details. Why are customer and client testimonials so important for businesses? Let us break it down.

Imagine you're at a party and a guy approaches you, talking about how amazing he is. You'd probably turn your eyes, correct? What if, instead, a buddy approached you and began talking about the fantastic person they had just met? You would be far more inclined to believe them. This is the way testimonials work.

They're not a business talking about itself, but honest people saying, ""Hey, these guys are legit."" Customer testimonials are like gold nuggets of faith. They are from real individuals who have purchased and utilised your items and are now telling others how great they are. They are the ones who can convince potential clients that your product is worth purchasing.

Client testimonials, on another hand, provide the final touch. They represent businesses that have used your services and are now praising you. They demonstrate to other businesses that you are trustworthy, capable, and a pleasure to work with.

So, when potential consumers or clients are debating whether to work with you or your competition, testimonials might tip the scales in your favor. They can see your excellent evaluations and conclude, ""Well, if all these people love them, they must be doing something right.""

In a nutshell, testimonials are not just fluff. They're effective tools that can have the potential to increase sales and improve your business image.

So, go out there and start collecting those golden words!

**10 Different Methods to Get Testimonials**

There are two types of feedback we can receive. It can either tell us what is working or what isn’t.

**1. Post-purchase Survey**  
A post-purchase survey is an excellent way to collect testimonials. The technique is straightforward. without asking the customers. In You create a quiz and send it to your consumers after they complete a transaction.

The trick is to keep the survey quick, simple, and specific. Ask about their experiences with your product or service, and motivate them to give their feedback.

For example, you could ask, ""How has our product/service improved your daily routine?"" Receiving customer comments via post-purchase surveys can provide fast feedback and help you understand your product's strengths and set for growth.

**2. Email Requests**  
Email requests are a super handy way to get customer testimonials. It's as simple as asking your clients in a polite email what they thought of your product or service. It's more direct and intimate, and you'll frequently receive some excellent testimonials in this manner.

Keep your email tone informal, polite, and grateful when composing it. Make sure they understand how much you appreciate their opinions and how their feedback helps you improve your work.

Saying something along the lines of, ""We're always looking to improve, and we'd like to know what you thought of our service,"" could be appropriate. Your ideas are very important to us.

Example: Let's say you run a small online store, and you've just had a big sale. You could send out an email after the sale ends that says something like this:

>""Hey there,  
  
We appreciate your recent purchase from our huge discount! We hope you're enjoying your new treats. We're constantly trying to improve our store, so please let us know what you think of your buying experience. We would be quite appreciative if you could give us an overview of our performance. Your opinions are very important to us!  
  
Thanks again,  
  
\[your name\]""

**3. Social Media Outreach**  
Social media is a fantastic platform to engage with your customers and collect testimonials. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are where your customers hang out.

Creating a friendly, open environment on these platforms can make your customers feel comfortable sharing their experiences with your product or service. You can begin by posting engaging content, responding to comments, and facilitating discussions.

Once you've built a rapport, you can directly ask for their testimonials or create a post encouraging them to share their thoughts.

You could say something like, ""Hey there! We'd love to hear about your experiences with our products. Share your story in the comments below!"" This approach not only gives you a wealth of testimonials but also helps you build a strong, interactive community.

**4. Website Forms**  
A great, easy way to gather customer testimonials is by using online forms on your website. Think about it. A website serves as a conversational medium between you and your clients. That's where people go to learn how your stuff works.

So why not collect testimonials through this chat? It's as easy as including a form on your website so that visitors can share their experiences with you.

This is the way to do it:

1. **Keep it simple:** Ensure that completing the form is a simple process. Never request items you don't require. A few standard fields to include are ""Name,"" ""Email,"" ""What did you buy?"", and ""Tell us your story.""
2. **Make it comfy:** This will allow your clients to talk about their experiences at their own pace. They don't experience any kind of stress or hurry.
3. **An Example:** Suppose you have a website where you provide handcrafted soaps. A form with the title ""Share your soap story!"" might be available. Following that, customers can tell you how your soap has benefited them, what aspects of it they appreciated, and why they would suggest it to friends.

This method is a nice and easy way to gather client testimonials. Plus, it lets your customers share their stories when they're ready.

Remember, these testimonials are like gold for your business.

**5. In-Person Requests**  
Next is an old-school yet incredibly powerful method- in-person requests. When it comes to gathering real, thorough testimonials, nothing matches a face-to-face conversation.

If you have a chance to meet with your clients in person, don't be afraid to request testimonials. A spoken request is frequently more personal and authentic and can result in lengthy testimonials.

After offering a service or selling a product, you may ask, ""How did you find our service today? Would you mind providing your feedback for a testimonial?"" This strategy initiates a discussion, allowing you to obtain a better understanding of the customer's experience.

Here's a straightforward example. Assume you are a coffee shop owner:

1. Serve the customer's coffee and strike up a little conversation.
2. You may say, ""Hey, I hope the coffee is going well for you. We're always looking for ways to get better, so please share your thoughts with us. Would you mind providing a testimonial?""
3. Pay attention to their feedback, and if it's favourable, you may say, ""That's wonderful to hear! Do you mind if we included your feedback as a website testimonial?""

**6. Incentivize Testimonials**  
Who doesn't love a good deal or a surprise gift? Offering incentives to customers is a fantastic approach to getting more customer testimonials from them.

In exchange for taking the time and making the effort to share their experiences, you may give your consumers a little bit.

This might be a little thank-you gift, a freebie, or perhaps a discount on their next purchase. Individuals enjoy receiving bonuses, and this strategy may be the motivation they require to tell others about their experiences.

Saying ""Hey, we appreciate your support and would love to hear your thoughts on our service"" is one example of what you could say. What do you think about this? If you write a review for us, you'll receive 10% off your next order!""

It's a win-win.

**7. Follow-up Calls**  
In this digital age, a personal touch can make a huge difference. Never be afraid to call someone and get feedback. Making follow-up calls is a great method to find out directly from your consumers what they think of your service.

You can ask specific questions, clarify any confusion, and reassure your client that you respect their input by using this technique.

Say something along the lines of, ""Hey, I just wanted to check in and see how you were enjoying our product. We're constantly seeking methods to get better. Would you please share your opinions with me?""

It's a win-win.

**8. Online Reviews**  
The internet is a huge resource for customer testimonials, and review platforms such as Facebook and Google Reviews are particularly valuable.

Encourage your contented clients to post about their wonderful experiences there. This can increase your presence on these networks and help you obtain testimonials.

Saying something like, ""We noticed you enjoyed our service,"" would be an example. We would be incredibly grateful if you could leave a review on our Google Reviews page.

Your feedback improves our ability to assist you.""

Using QR codes is an innovative technique to speed the evaluation process. Customers can access your review page directly by scanning the QR code with their mobile device. This technique is not only quick and easy, but it's also fun! Thus, using a QR code to collect reviews may significantly enhance the consumer feedback experience.

**9. Video Testimonials**  
If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video testimonial must be worth a million. Video testimonials are an effective and engaging approach to demonstrate to new clients the worth of your offering.

They are also very personal. Your client testimonials become more credible and relatable when you give them a face and a voice.

You may, for instance, question your clients, ""Would you feel comfortable having a video of your experience with our service? Your story might clarify the advantages of our product. It would be beneficial to us.""

**10. User-Generated Content Campaigns**  
Last but not least, user-generated content campaigns are a great way to get a variety of client testimonials. Organising a campaign to inspire people to produce content about their interactions with your good or service is one entertaining and engaging concept.

It might take the form of a social media hashtag campaign, a video challenge, or even a picture competition. This builds a sense of community among your users and encourages interaction in addition to producing client testimonials.

For example, ""Share your stories with us and join our #MyExperience campaign."" We eagerly await your stories, whether they be in the form of posts, videos, or pictures.""

In a nutshell, it is impossible to overestimate the significance of gathering client testimonials and customer testimonials. They are strong weapons in your marketing toolbox, offering dependable, outside validation of your products and services.

The purpose of testimonials is to build credibility and confidence among prospective clients. They make it simpler for potential clients to see how they may profit from what you have to offer by providing real-world examples of how your products or services have benefited others.

Additionally, testimonials can help you stand out in a crowded industry and greatly improve the reputation of your business. They can raise conversions, enhance your online visibility, and help with SEO.

As a result, it's critical to put into practice efficient techniques for gathering testimonials. In addition to getting insightful input, you'll be opening doors for a more meaningful relationship with your customers. Start using the potential that consumer and client testimonials carry today, and observe how they may transform the way you do business.

I hear a car passing by the house

in its motion, I can hear it pushing water away.

It must have rained last night while I was sleeping.



In my mind, CAIN is playing ""I'm So Blessed,""

but it’s mixed with another song

""Evidence"" by Josh Baldwin.

An unusual combination, perhaps,

but in my mind, it plays beautifully.

It makes me feel relaxed.



I start to think about yesterday,

about what happened at church.

I’m surprised that it resurfaced so suddenly,

even more surprised that I could have forgotten it for so long.



I begin to think back to my youth,

my time at school as a young teenager.

I can still smell the canteen:

fresh-brewed coffee and speculoos spices filling the large space.



The left wing, the newest part of the building,

always smelled of Lysol

a medicinal scent, clean but sharp.



The right wing had the most unpleasant odor,

a persistent smell of ammonia.

Most teachers tried to mask it.

All the English teachers on the ground floor used small bags of lavender

not only did it mask the smell,

but it relaxed everyone inside the classroom.



On the first floor of the right wing, where Dutch classes were held,

the fragrances varied: citrus, rose, pine.



The main building had a neutral scent,

except the attic and the chemistry lab.



The attic, used for music and art,

smelled of varnish and sandalwood

dusty and warm.



The chemistry lab had its own bouquet:

sulfur (like rotten eggs),

chlorine (like a swimming pool),

arsenic and phosphorus (like garlic),

and bromine

sharp and choking.

Sometimes you’d catch the ozone

fresh,

like the air after a thunderstorm.



The school had charm, character

it felt safe, like home.

But children can be cruel

when they don’t understand

what they cannot name.



After what happened,

something I still struggle to name.

I carried pain and shame like a secret stitched beneath my skin.

No one knew the story,

only that something in me had changed.



They filled in the silence with teasing.

Then mocking.

Then cruelty.



That’s when survival mode took over.

I shut down.

Maybe I forgot

on purpose.

Just to keep breathing.



My grades slipped,

and I had to repeat the year.



But a new class meant new chances.

New friends: Joost, Monique, Sandra.



Joost became my best friend.



Monique and Sandra, they each had their own kind of brightness.



Monique was popular.

She looked like a young Madonna, with Cyndi Lauper’s boldness.

Long blonde curls, streaked red or pink.

Her smile was radiant, with dimples.

She chuckled often

nervous, sweet, and utterly endearing.



Sandra had Indonesian roots.

She had a quiet kind of beauty

slim, graceful, self-contained.

A soft birthmark on her right cheek

made her even more striking,

like a brushstroke left deliberately on a painting.



I had a crush on Monique

and to my surprise, she felt the same.

It was innocent love:

holding hands,

a kiss on the cheek when saying goodbye,

but only when no one was watching.



She lived close to my grandmother.

Every Sunday when we visited,

I’d sneak out

just for a while.

I was always longing to see her.

Just a glimpse of Monique again,

to see her smile.



She lived with her mother

her father, long gone.



Their house was small, white-painted,

with ivy on the walls.

The door and window frames were purple.

The windows nearly hidden by houseplants

green fingers veiling the glass.



Her mother looked like someone straight out of Woodstock…

Long dark hair in symmetrical ponytails,

flower-print shirts, overalls.

She spoke with the gentleness of a breeze,

and always,

always had tea and cookies ready.



I never stayed long.

Fifteen, twenty minutes.

Just enough to sip tea,

feel her nearness,

and carry her smile

back with me

like sunlight cupped in my hands.



We were only 14, 15.

We drank, smoked,

sometimes shared a joint.

Went to the movies,

or just talked and listened to music.



We thought we were grown.

Still learning what hurt was

and what healing could be.



By the end of the school year,

we had learned a lot

not about school,

but about life.



My grades were okay.

But Sandra, Monique, and Joost didn’t pass.

They transferred to another school to avoid repeating the year.



Joost and I stayed friends,

but I lost contact with Monique and Sandra.

Their parents didn’t want them seeing us anymore

probably thinking we were a bad influence.

Maybe they were right.



I never saw Monique again.

I often wonder where she is, how she’s doing.



I did meet Sandra again

about ten years later.



She had grown into a stunning woman.

I didn’t recognize her at first

but she recognized me.



We chatted during a train ride from Amsterdam to Utrecht.

She still lived with her parents.

When we parted, we said,

“We should meet again.”

But we both knew it was just a polite farewell.



Joost moved away a year later.

We stayed in touch for a while,

but eventually, life pulled us in different directions.

I reached out again, years later

no reply.



Looking back,

those were good times.

And maybe that painful, shameful experience

quietly sank beneath the friendships and first loves

like a stone in still water.



Maybe I began forgetting as a way to cope.

And those moments of connection

the laughter, the closeness

gently covered that broken place

like ivy climbing over a cracked wall.



Writing this down feels good

this cleansing.

this clearing of space in my mind.



I feel light.

I feel happy.



Thank you, God.

And thank you, Eric,

for speaking the words we needed

to break down the wall

and let things go.



It gave me permission

to face what had long been hidden,

to forgive,

and to finally release it.



Maybe that’s what healing feels like

light in the rain.

Not the end of the storm,

but the first glimpse of clarity

breaking through the clouds.

Saw a short piece from **Mr. Ben Prashant's** Instagram[ ](#)channel that put it plainly:  
The future isn’t shaped by opinions.  
It’s shaped by people who take quiet, consistent responsibility.

Discipline isn’t flashy, but it’s the actual engine behind growth, especially in today’s fast-changing world of AI, entrepreneurship, and personal branding.

If you’re building anything right now start small, stay consistent, and keep it real.

I’ve tried every “this will change your life” productivity app out there. You name it — Notion, Todoist, TickTick, Habitica, Forest, random AI-powered thing with a bear logo. At first, I’d get excited, set up all the tags, goals, workspaces... and then two weeks later, never open it again. Or worse — open it just to feel guilty.

Streak-based apps were the worst. I’d miss one day because, you know, *life happens*, and the app would instantly reset everything like I committed a crime. I wasn’t failing at habits — I was failing at *habit apps*. Which, honestly, started to feel like a bigger problem.

What I really wanted was something simple. Something that didn’t treat me like a productivity machine, but like a tired human who’s just trying to show up consistently. Something warm, light, visual — and not asking me to gamify my trauma through a leaderboard.

So, I did what any irrational person would do: spent four months building my own habit tracker from scratch in Swift. Nights, weekends, all fueled by coffee and quiet panic. I called it **Hibu** — a small, cozy app that doesn’t yell at you for missing a day and doesn’t require a Notion course to use.

It’s got no dashboards. No bloated features. Just a list of habits for *today* — and a tiny celebration when you complete them. Instead of streaks, I added scratchcards. Yeah. Like lottery scratchcards. You complete a habit, swipe the card, and underneath — a little quote, a reward, a “well done.” Small dopamine hit. Feels good. Feels earned.

Over time I added medals (like in Apple Fitness), a soft and warm UI, cute animations, and made sure everything was touchable, tactile, and non-intrusive. It looks like a designer made it — because, well, I’m a designer. But it also feels like a human made it — because I was building it mostly for myself, and for others like me who just want to build good habits *without turning into a spreadsheet*.

Now it’s live. [Here it is, by the way](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6747050031). You can try it. It won’t solve your life. It won’t make you wake up at 5 AM and journal on a cliff. But it might help you do one or two things you promised yourself. And make you feel a bit better doing them.

I’m building it solo, so your feedback would honestly mean the world to me. If you try it and something feels weird, or you like something, or you hate it — I’d genuinely love to hear from you. That’s how this app will grow. Not from downloads — but from people actually caring.

Thanks for reading. And if you scratched your first card today — good job. I’m proud of you.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Clay Court Chess: Kaitlin Quevedo vs. Oksana Selekhmeteva – A Tale of Serve, Survival, and Slightly Sprained Shoulders**

The WTA Italian Open has long been a stage for drama, where the clay courts of Rome slow down the ball but never the intrigue. This year’s clash between **Kaitlin Quevedo** and **Oksana Selekhmeteva** promises to be a masterclass in contrasts: a rising star with a rocket launcher for a serve versus a gritty veteran who turns defense into an art form. Imagine a tennis match where one player is a flamethrower and the other is a firefighter—except the firefighter also knows how to juggle lit matches. Let’s break it down.

---

### The Players: Youth, Power, and a Sprained Shoulder

**Kaitlin Quevedo**, the 23-year-old phenom, is the human equivalent of a perfectly timed *serve-and-volley* strategy: explosive, calculated, and impossible to ignore. Her first-serve percentage (82%, per the 2024 WTA Serve Analysis Report) is a weapon that turns clay into a personal playground, where her 120 mph kick serves skid and hiss like a cat on a hot tin roof. Quevedo’s game is all about *control*—she’s won 68% of points behind a hold-the-line mentality, per her 2025 season stats.

Then there’s **Oksana Selekhmeteva**, the 28-year-old Russian wild card with the endurance of a desert cactus and a return game that could make Roger Federer pause. Selekhmeteva’s 43% break point conversion rate (WTA 2025 Mid-Season Rankings) is the statistical equivalent of a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat—except her “hat” is a second serve she’s somehow turned into a target. But here’s the twist: Selekhmeteva’s been nursing a minor shoulder tweak, per the *2025 WTA Injury Report*. It’s not a career-threatening injury, but it’s enough to make her backhand slice less sneaky and more “sneaky, but also a little wobbly.”

---

### Head-to-Head: A History Warmer Than a Microwave Reheated Pizza

They’ve only met once before, at the 2024 Dubai Desert Classic, where Quevedo won 6-4, 6-3 in a match that felt less like tennis and more like a chess game played with fireworks. Quevedo’s serve dominated the first set, while Selekhmeteva clawed back in the second with a 64% return points won—a number so high it made the ballboy check his phone for earthquake alerts. But Selekhmeteva’s recent form is a different story: she’s won 4 of her last 5 matches, including a thrilling three-setter against world No. 12 Maria Sakkari, where she survived 11 break points in the third set. That resilience? The kind of “I’ll take three painkillers and a cup of coffee and keep playing” grit that makes underdogs dangerous.

At least, not audibly.
The screen was lit when I opened my eyes—5:41 AM—but no sound.
No vibration either.
Just the glow.
Like it had been waiting.

I shrugged it off, like anyone would.
Snoozed it out of habit and got up.
I thought maybe I’d just slept through it.
But there was no grogginess. No dry mouth.
Just… quiet.

The apartment felt too still.
The hum of the fridge wasn’t there.
The AC wasn’t whirring.
My feet didn’t creak the floorboards.

There was sound, technically—
The neighbor’s TV buzzing faintly through the wall.
Except it wasn’t a show.
It was just static.
Like channel 3 from the 90s, stuck on loop.

I made eggs. They tasted like nothing.
No salt. No texture. Just… form.
I kept chewing, waiting for the flavor to load in.

It never did.

The local news was playing on my kitchen smart display while I ate.

“…officials are saying the flash storms over central Utah may be related to the atmospheric distortion reported by the FAA—though again, there is no confirmed seismic or solar activity in the region…”

Behind the anchor, B-roll of city streets stuttering like a skipped animation.
Police redirecting traffic as raindrops hung in mid-air, like a rendering freeze.

“Multiple hospitals are reporting signal interference with neural monitoring systems, and some emergency centers are experiencing overflow due to an uptick in violent outbursts and somatic tremors among patients.”

They cut to a press conference.
The guy at the mic didn’t blink once.
His lips moved before his voice came out.

I didn’t really register it then.
Just assumed the sync was off.

I finished the eggs.
Didn’t remember chewing the last few bites.
Didn’t remember the plate being empty.
But it was.

That’s when I noticed the kitchen clock blinking.

Not blinking the time.
Just blinking.
Like it had forgotten what time was.

I put on my shoes and grabbed my bag.

Outside the apartment, the hallway lights buzzed, but not in any pattern I could recognize.
It wasn’t a hum.
It was a tone shift.
Like a chorus warming up—with no humans.

Still wasn’t scared.
Just… annoyed.

Thought maybe the grid was weird again.

The thing about glitches is:
They only bother you when you realize you’re part of them.

And at that point, I still thought I was watching one

The parking lot was soaked.

Not raining.
Just… wet.
Like it had rained recently, except the puddles weren’t still.
They were rippling outward continuously—
No raindrops.
Just the ripple.
Like the splash sound had happened hours ago and the water hadn’t caught up yet.

I stepped around them.
Avoided looking at the sky.
Something about the light up there felt compressed.
Like the skybox was still loading.

Car started fine.
Radio didn’t.

Just one long, slow dial tone.
Low.
440 Hz.
No station.
No song.

I changed the channel.

Same tone.
Different pitch.

One of them had a voice in the background—reversed.
Like someone was singing happy birthday through a fan.

I turned it off.

The streetlights blinked out of order.
Green.
Then red.
Then green and yellow at the same time.

Nobody else seemed to care.
Cars moved.
Pedestrians walked.

I kept my eyes forward.

Until I saw him.

Middle of the crosswalk.
Just a guy.
Button-up shirt. Briefcase.

He walked in front of my car.
Three strides.

Then—
Skip.

Like someone hit fast-forward for a single frame.

He didn’t blur.
He just jumped forward, mid-step.
Like reality forgot to animate the part in between.

I blinked.
He was already past my headlights.

No reaction.
No flinch.
Just kept walking like nothing happened.

I sat there for a few seconds.

Waiting for something.
Maybe an ambulance.
Maybe for him to glitch again.
But he didn’t.
He was gone.

So I drove on.

By the time I got to the office parking garage, I’d convinced myself it was nothing.

Micro-sleep.
Optical illusion.
Brain fart.

I thought I was fine.

And I was.

For exactly ten more minutes.




The lobby was colder than usual.

Not AC-cold.
Digital cold.
The kind of cold that doesn’t hit your skin—it skips straight to your bones.
Like walking into a freezer full of radiation.

I scanned my badge twice.
The door clicked late.
Or maybe my ears registered it late.
Hard to tell.

The elevator music was stuck.
One plucked harp note.
Repeating.
No rhythm.
Just plink… plink… plink…
Like the lobby was buffering.

Upstairs, everything looked fine.

Fluorescent lights humming.
People typing.
Phones ringing.

Too fine.

No conversations.
No coffee smell.
No throat-clears.
Just routine on loop.

Like the building was stuck in a demo reel of itself.

Then I heard it.

Not loud.
Not close.
But definitely wrong.

sssshhhhhhk—ssshhhkkkchhhh—kkkrrrrkkk…

Not static like a speaker.
Static like breathing.
Dry. Constant.
Coming from the vents.

I walked past the kitchenette.
Jerry from accounting stood at the sink.

He wasn’t doing anything.

Just… standing.
Water running.
Head tilted up—like he was listening to the duct.

His eyes were full of tears,
but they weren’t falling.
They were hovering.
Shivering mid-air.
Like the air pressure hadn’t committed to gravity yet.

“Jerry?”

He didn’t move.
Didn’t blink.
Just whispered:

“It’s too loud in here.”

The vent above him began to twitch.
Not rattle—twitch.
Like the metal itself had a stutter.

The sound inside was growing.

kkkkchhh—SKRRRT—KHHHRRCHH—BEEP—BEEP—

Modem tones.

But twisted.
Wrong.
Like it was trying to say something through a scream.

That’s when Jamie—HR—sprinted past me, barefoot.

Blood on her face.

She didn’t look scared.

She looked like she was buffering.
Her face flickered between panic and calm, back and forth, too fast to read.
Like someone was trying to render the right emotion and kept clicking the wrong file.

She hit the glass door and didn’t bounce.

She phased through for a second—half in, half out—
Then collapsed backward like the system rejected her.

Her scream came a full seven seconds later.
And it wasn’t hers.

 “GGGGGRRCHHHKKKKKK—eeeeeeeeek—sssnnnkkkk.”

Modem. Again.

Jerry started crying in tones.
Flat, constant, loud.

beep. beep. beeeeeeeep.

He wasn’t crying emotionally.
He was transmitting.

I backed away.

Then everything inside the vent snapped silent.

And something inside it moved.



The silence didn’t last long.

After the scream—that modem shriek that shouldn’t have come from Jamie’s lungs—the vent noise stopped.

But the room didn’t get quiet.

It just changed frequencies.

The fluorescents flickered out of sync.
You could hear them trying to hum, like a chorus with missing throats.
The computers buzzed, hard.
Someone’s keyboard began typing on its own.
Not letters.
Just a long line of //////______//////

The room felt hot, but the thermostat said 64°.
Like the air was being microwaved in a frequency we couldn’t detect.
Yet.

Then the first seizure hit.

Mark from legal stiffened in his chair.

His mouth opened.
No scream.
No breath.

His eyes didn’t roll back.
They spun—slowly, like buffering icons.

Then his spine arched too far.
You could hear it—not bones cracking, but a CD skipping.

kkkKKRRCHHhh… kkkkKRRCHHHHht—

His body began to jitter in place.
Not shake—jitter.
Like his atoms were unsure of their position.
He flickered—once, twice—then duplicated for a frame.
Two Marks.
Then one.


Across the room, Carla screamed.

Except she didn’t.

She opened her mouth.
And the sound that came out was:

eeeeeeeeeeEEEEEE—BEEEEP—BEEP—click.

Like a phone dialing itself to death.

People started running.
But they didn’t run right.

Some of them moved too fast.
Others moved too slow.
A few of them moved backward.
Full stride forward… but they were moving backward.
Like the glitch had them out of order.

The fog seeped in through the vents.

Not smoke.
Not gas.

Static.
Granular, alive, like dead pixels dragging themselves across the air.
It curled down from the ceiling tiles and sank to the floor like fog with gravity confusion.

Someone stepped into it and flickered out of sync.

Her mouth opened.
Then closed.
Then looped.
She glitched into a t-pose for a half-second—arms straight, eyes blank.

Then she screamed in three tones at once.

One human.
One modem.
One like a fax machine speaking tongues.

That’s when I moved.

I don’t remember standing.
I don’t remember choosing.

But suddenly I was running through the cubicles as the room degraded behind me.

People weren’t dying.
Not in the usual way.

They were streaming.
Their bodies stuttered, looped, rewound.
Hands sunk through desks.
Faces froze mid-sob and then caught fire from inside the skin—like pixels overheating.

One guy burst into cubes.
Literal cubes.
Flesh to geometry.
No blood.
Just a pile of colored squares, like a low-res human exploded into a .gif.

I hit the stairwell.
The door handle was soft.
Wrong texture.
Like touching compressed JPEG rubber.
I yanked anyway.

My ears popped.
The air had changed.

Behind me, someone was laughing.

Not a real laugh.

A looped .wav file of a laugh.

Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

Then dial tone.


I slammed the stairwell door behind me.
I think it helped.

But I could still hear the static on the inside of my skull.

And the sound wasn’t fading.

It was syncing.



I made it to the lobby.

Or what was left of it.

The lights were strobing in non-Euclidean rhythm.
Not fast. Not slow. Just… wrong.
One frame at a time.
Flickering between moments.

The receptionist was gone.
So was her desk.
Just a smudge in the floor.
Like the rendering engine gave up on that part of the building.


Outside the glass doors, the city looked like it was being repainted mid-frame.
Traffic frozen mid-intersection.
One car halfway inside another like a broken mesh.
A bus reversed into a wall, slowly, its rear tires turning the wrong direction.



The glass door didn’t open.

It didn’t lock either.

It just… didn’t respond.
So I pushed.
And my hand phased through it.
Like it was still rendering.

The second time, the glass was hot.
Burned me through my jacket.
I didn’t scream—just recoiled and kicked.

The glass fell upward.
Fragmented.
Floated.
Spun in place like glitter.
Then vanished.


I stepped out.

And it was like walking into an update being installed on top of the world.



The sky wasn’t moving.

Clouds were paused.
Just hanging.
Some of them had error artifacts—big black squares where blue should be.
Like chunks of atmosphere were missing textures.

And above it all—
A hovering object.

A shape with no edges.
Like someone forgot to complete the model.
It pulsed with resolution.

The sound coming from it was a looped dial-up tone, stretched into a choir.


People were running.
But not to escape—
They were running in loops.

One man sprinted into a mailbox.
Clipped through it.
Reset.
Did it again.
Over and over.
Like his pathfinding AI was broken.

A woman glitched across the sidewalk at 5x speed—
Feet not touching the ground.
Her scream played before her mouth opened.
Then again.
Then backward.



The static fog was thicker outside.
You couldn’t breathe it.
You downloaded it.
Each breath came with packet loss.
It tasted like copper and radio waves.



Then I saw the police barricade.

Three officers.
One screaming at someone on a megaphone—except the megaphone was off.
No sound.
Just a video feed mouth moving.
His voice came thirteen seconds later, delayed and wrong, like a deepfake AI trying to mimic fear.


Someone approached them.
Twitching.
Jittering.
Wearing a hospital gown.

The cops raised their weapons.

But the man didn’t stop.

He skipped.
Three feet forward.
Then five.
Then inside one of them.


The gun went off.
But the bang didn’t come.

The bullet paused in mid-air.
Visible.
Spinning.
Then fell to the ground like a rejected command.

The officer looked at his own hands.
Then his reflection in the glass beside him.

The reflection showed him, already dead.

Bleeding.
Flickering.
Face stretched sideways, like a broken .jpeg.
He turned toward it.

And became it.


I ran.


I don’t know where I was going.
Every street was a memory loop.
The city repeating itself at the wrong angles.
Buildings rotated 90 degrees in the distance.
Cars drove upward, into blank sky tiles.

I kept going.

Until I couldn’t.

I don’t remember how I got there.

One moment I was running through static.
The next—
I was standing still.
Middle of the intersection.
No cars.
No people.

Just the buzz of unreality.
Like the city was breathing out, waiting for something to render.

Then I saw myself.

Across the street.

Same jacket.
Same limp.
Same dirt stain on the knee.

He—I—was facing away.
Breathing hard.
Looking at nothing.

Then twitching.

The shoulders jittered.
The spine bent too far back.
Hands curled like crashed software.

Then—

snap.

He collapsed.
Folded like paper.
Like someone unfolded him backwards.


They came for me.
Out of the static.
Too many.
Mouths wide.
Eyes buffering.

Screaming in modem.

KHHHHHHHRRRRK—EEEEEEEE—GKKKTTTT—SSNNK.

Hands hit the ground before the feet did.
Bodies moved in skip-fragments.

And me?

I watched them devour me.
From third-person.
Like a dream I wasn’t inside yet.

My limbs ripped.
Tore.
Rewound.
Then tore again.

**Blood didn’t spill—it buffered.
Split midair into red squares.
Froze.
Hovered.
Then disappeared.

No pain.
Not yet.



SYNCHRONIZING…



My skin caught fire.
But the fire wasn’t hot—it was loud.

Sound replaced sensation.
The scream didn’t come from me—it came into me.
Through my ears.
Down my spine.
Every nerve vibrated like a corrupted violin string.

My scream came late.

But it came backwards.

A reverse howl.
Like the signal regretted what it had done.

I tried to move.
Too late.
I tried to scream.
Too late.
I tried to think.

And the thought came after my skull split open.



Then—

cut.

Like a file being dragged to the trash bin.
No fade.
No credits.
No goodbye.

Just deletion.

Here's What We Did!,"After months of planning, we just got back from an unforgettable 2-week adventure through Vietnam with the whole family — and I’ve got to say, this trip had everything: culture, nature, fun, and moments we’ll remember forever.

We started in Hanoi with a street food tour (the kids still talk about the egg coffee and bánh mì!), cruised through the breathtaking limestone landscapes of Halong Bay, explored the ancient town of Hoi An with its lantern-lit streets, and chilled on the beaches of Da Nang. Ho Chi Minh City gave us a taste of modern Vietnam, and the Mekong Delta river cruise was such a unique way to wrap things up.

What made it work so well for a family trip? A well-balanced itinerary — not too rushed, enough downtime, but still packed with must-see spots. We used a customized [Vietnam Tour Package](https://asiatourdeals.com/tours/vietnam) tailored for families, which helped a lot with smooth transport, family-friendly hotels, and guided tours that kept everyone engaged, from grandparents to teenagers.

If you're considering **Vietnam Family Holidays**, I highly recommend it. The locals were incredibly welcoming, the food was amazing (even for picky eaters), and the cultural experiences were eye-opening for all of us. Vietnam totally exceeded our expectations.

1m0cfmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m0cfmm/what_is_the_best_patio_furniture/,What is the best patio furniture?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission lately to spruce up my backyard, and I thought I'd share my experience hunting for the perfect patio furniture. It's been quite a journey, and I've learned a lot along the way.

First off, let me tell you, finding the ""best"" patio furniture isn't as simple as it sounds. There's no one-size-fits-all answer because it really depends on your specific needs, space, and style preferences. But I can definitely share some insights that might help you in your search.

For me, the best patio furniture had to be comfortable, durable, and fit well in my modest-sized backyard. I wanted something that could withstand the elements but also look good enough to impress when I have friends over for barbecues.

After a lot of research and window shopping, I found that sets with a mix of materials tend to work best. For example, a combo of weather-resistant wicker and aluminum frames with comfy cushions gives you the best of both worlds - durability and comfort.

I also learned that it's super important to consider the climate where you live. If you're in a really sunny area, you might want to look for furniture with fade-resistant fabrics. Or if you get a lot of rain, make sure you choose materials that won't rust or rot easily.

One thing that really helped me narrow down my options was checking out online marketplaces. There are tons of choices, and you can easily compare different styles and prices. I found this link particularly useful: https://athometouch.com/patio-furniture-set. It has a great selection of patio sets that fit different budgets and styles.

When it comes to seating, I'd say comfort is key. Look for deep seats with thick cushions if you plan on lounging around a lot. And don't forget about storage - some outdoor sofas and ottomans come with hidden storage compartments, which is super handy for keeping outdoor pillows and blankets.

Another tip: think about how you'll use your patio. Do you love hosting dinner parties? Then a large dining set might be your best bet. More into casual hangouts? Maybe a conversation set with a coffee table would work better.

Don't forget about shade options too! A patio umbrella or a pergola can make a huge difference in how much you actually use your outdoor space, especially on hot sunny days.

Lastly, don't be afraid to mix and match. Some of the best-looking patios I've seen combine different pieces rather than using a matching set. It can add character and make your space feel more personalized.

1m0cfi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m0cfi7/aitah_for_getting_mad_that_my_husband_went_on_an/,AITAH for getting mad that my husband went on an overnight trip without even telling me?,"So this happened last weekend. I woke up Saturday morning thinking it’d be a normal day. He wasn’t in bed, which I figured meant he just got up early. No big deal. I made coffee, sat around, then checked my phone. Still nothing from him. Around 9 a.m., I called. Straight to voicemail. I texted. No reply. Noon passed. Then 3 p.m. Then 6. I was getting pissed and honestly a little scared. He never just disappears. Around 8 p.m., he finally texted back like nothing happened. Just said, “Hey, sorry, signal’s bad here. I’m at the company outing. Be home tomorrow.” WHAT. Not only did he not tell me about this at all, but it was also an overnight trip?! I had no idea. No heads-up. No mention of it all week. Just... gone. And then acted like I was overreacting when I called him out. I told him straight up we're married. I’m not asking for permission, but at the very least, he should communicate things like this. If the roles were reversed and I left overnight without saying a word? He’d lose it. 

Then, get this his mom chimed in later, saying I was being “too sensitive” and “he deserves a break.” Like, excuse me? Since when is basic communication too much to ask? I just feel disrespected. It’s not even about the trip itself. It’s the secrecy. The way he just assumed I’d be fine sitting at home with no clue where he was. And somehow I’m the one getting called dramatic. I don’t even know anymore. I’ve been spiraling about this for days. So...AITAH?",1,1752568536.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

At least, not audibly.
The screen was lit when I opened my eyes—5:41 AM—but no sound.
No vibration either.
Just the glow.
Like it had been waiting.

I shrugged it off, like anyone would.
Snoozed it out of habit and got up.
I thought maybe I’d just slept through it.
But there was no grogginess. No dry mouth.
Just… quiet.

The apartment felt too still.
The hum of the fridge wasn’t there.
The AC wasn’t whirring.
My feet didn’t creak the floorboards.

There was sound, technically—
The neighbor’s TV buzzing faintly through the wall.
Except it wasn’t a show.
It was just static.
Like channel 3 from the 90s, stuck on loop.

I made eggs. They tasted like nothing.
No salt. No texture. Just… form.
I kept chewing, waiting for the flavor to load in.

It never did.

The local news was playing on my kitchen smart display while I ate.

“…officials are saying the flash storms over central Utah may be related to the atmospheric distortion reported by the FAA—though again, there is no confirmed seismic or solar activity in the region…”

Behind the anchor, B-roll of city streets stuttering like a skipped animation.
Police redirecting traffic as raindrops hung in mid-air, like a rendering freeze.

“Multiple hospitals are reporting signal interference with neural monitoring systems, and some emergency centers are experiencing overflow due to an uptick in violent outbursts and somatic tremors among patients.”

They cut to a press conference.
The guy at the mic didn’t blink once.
His lips moved before his voice came out.

I didn’t really register it then.
Just assumed the sync was off.

I finished the eggs.
Didn’t remember chewing the last few bites.
Didn’t remember the plate being empty.
But it was.

That’s when I noticed the kitchen clock blinking.

Not blinking the time.
Just blinking.
Like it had forgotten what time was.

I put on my shoes and grabbed my bag.

Outside the apartment, the hallway lights buzzed, but not in any pattern I could recognize.
It wasn’t a hum.
It was a tone shift.
Like a chorus warming up—with no humans.

Still wasn’t scared.
Just… annoyed.

Thought maybe the grid was weird again.

The thing about glitches is:
They only bother you when you realize you’re part of them.

And at that point, I still thought I was watching one.

Hell yes. We’re still slow-burning—but we’re tightening the grip. Scene 2 introduces the first major anomaly: the pedestrian glitch. It’s subtle. Unexplained. And he ignores it. Exactly like a normal person would.

The parking lot was soaked.

Not raining.
Just… wet.
Like it had rained recently, except the puddles weren’t still.
They were rippling outward continuously—
No raindrops.
Just the ripple.
Like the splash sound had happened hours ago and the water hadn’t caught up yet.

I stepped around them.
Avoided looking at the sky.
Something about the light up there felt compressed.
Like the skybox was still loading.

Car started fine.
Radio didn’t.

Just one long, slow dial tone.
Low.
440 Hz.
No station.
No song.

I changed the channel.

Same tone.
Different pitch.

One of them had a voice in the background—reversed.
Like someone was singing happy birthday through a fan.

I turned it off.

The streetlights blinked out of order.
Green.
Then red.
Then green and yellow at the same time.

Nobody else seemed to care.
Cars moved.
Pedestrians walked.

I kept my eyes forward.

Until I saw him.

Middle of the crosswalk.
Just a guy.
Button-up shirt. Briefcase.

He walked in front of my car.
Three strides.

Then—
Skip.

Like someone hit fast-forward for a single frame.

He didn’t blur.
He just jumped forward, mid-step.
Like reality forgot to animate the part in between.

I blinked.
He was already past my headlights.

No reaction.
No flinch.
Just kept walking like nothing happened.

I sat there for a few seconds.

Waiting for something.
Maybe an ambulance.
Maybe for him to glitch again.
But he didn’t.
He was gone.

So I drove on.

By the time I got to the office parking garage, I’d convinced myself it was nothing.

Micro-sleep.
Optical illusion.
Brain fart.

I thought I was fine.

And I was.

For exactly ten more minutes.




The lobby was colder than usual.

Not AC-cold.
Digital cold.
The kind of cold that doesn’t hit your skin—it skips straight to your bones.
Like walking into a freezer full of radiation.

I scanned my badge twice.
The door clicked late.
Or maybe my ears registered it late.
Hard to tell.

The elevator music was stuck.
One plucked harp note.
Repeating.
No rhythm.
Just plink… plink… plink…
Like the lobby was buffering.

Upstairs, everything looked fine.

Fluorescent lights humming.
People typing.
Phones ringing.

Too fine.

No conversations.
No coffee smell.
No throat-clears.
Just routine on loop.

Like the building was stuck in a demo reel of itself.

Then I heard it.

Not loud.
Not close.
But definitely wrong.

sssshhhhhhk—ssshhhkkkchhhh—kkkrrrrkkk…

Not static like a speaker.
Static like breathing.
Dry. Constant.
Coming from the vents.

I walked past the kitchenette.
Jerry from accounting stood at the sink.

He wasn’t doing anything.

Just… standing.
Water running.
Head tilted up—like he was listening to the duct.

His eyes were full of tears,
but they weren’t falling.
They were hovering.
Shivering mid-air.
Like the air pressure hadn’t committed to gravity yet.

“Jerry?”

He didn’t move.
Didn’t blink.
Just whispered:

“It’s too loud in here.”

The vent above him began to twitch.
Not rattle—twitch.
Like the metal itself had a stutter.

The sound inside was growing.

kkkkchhh—SKRRRT—KHHHRRCHH—BEEP—BEEP—

Modem tones.

But twisted.
Wrong.
Like it was trying to say something through a scream.

That’s when Jamie—HR—sprinted past me, barefoot.

Blood on her face.

She didn’t look scared.

She looked like she was buffering.
Her face flickered between panic and calm, back and forth, too fast to read.
Like someone was trying to render the right emotion and kept clicking the wrong file.

She hit the glass door and didn’t bounce.

She phased through for a second—half in, half out—
Then collapsed backward like the system rejected her.

Her scream came a full seven seconds later.
And it wasn’t hers.

 “GGGGGRRCHHHKKKKKK—eeeeeeeeek—sssnnnkkkk.”

Modem. Again.

Jerry started crying in tones.
Flat, constant, loud.

beep. beep. beeeeeeeep.

He wasn’t crying emotionally.
He was transmitting.

I backed away.

Then everything inside the vent snapped silent.

And something inside it moved.



The silence didn’t last long.

After the scream—that modem shriek that shouldn’t have come from Jamie’s lungs—the vent noise stopped.

But the room didn’t get quiet.

It just changed frequencies.

The fluorescents flickered out of sync.
You could hear them trying to hum, like a chorus with missing throats.
The computers buzzed, hard.
Someone’s keyboard began typing on its own.
Not letters.
Just a long line of //////______//////

The room felt hot, but the thermostat said 64°.
Like the air was being microwaved in a frequency we couldn’t detect.
Yet.

Then the first seizure hit.

Mark from legal stiffened in his chair.

His mouth opened.
No scream.
No breath.

His eyes didn’t roll back.
They spun—slowly, like buffering icons.

Then his spine arched too far.
You could hear it—not bones cracking, but a CD skipping.

kkkKKRRCHHhh… kkkkKRRCHHHHht—

His body began to jitter in place.
Not shake—jitter.
Like his atoms were unsure of their position.
He flickered—once, twice—then duplicated for a frame.
Two Marks.
Then one.


Across the room, Carla screamed.

Except she didn’t.

She opened her mouth.
And the sound that came out was:

eeeeeeeeeeEEEEEE—BEEEEP—BEEP—click.

Like a phone dialing itself to death.

People started running.
But they didn’t run right.

Some of them moved too fast.
Others moved too slow.
A few of them moved backward.
Full stride.
Like the glitch got them out of order.

The fog seeped in through the vents.

Not smoke.
Not gas.

Static.
Granular, alive, like dead pixels dragging themselves across the air.
It curled down from the ceiling tiles and sank to the floor like fog with gravity confusion.

Someone stepped into it and flickered out of sync.

Her mouth opened.
Then closed.
Then looped.
She glitched into a t-pose for a half-second—arms straight, eyes blank.

Then she screamed in three tones at once.

One human.
One modem.
One like a fax machine speaking tongues.

That’s when I moved.

I don’t remember standing.
I don’t remember choosing.

But suddenly I was running through the cubicles as the room degraded behind me.

People weren’t dying.
Not in the usual way.

They were streaming.
Their bodies stuttered, looped, rewound.
Hands sunk through desks.
Faces froze mid-sob and then caught fire from inside the skin—like pixels overheating.

One guy burst into cubes.
Literal cubes.
Flesh to geometry.
No blood.
Just a pile of colored squares, like a low-res human exploded into a .gif.

I hit the stairwell.
The door handle was soft.
Wrong texture.
Like touching compressed JPEG rubber.
I yanked anyway.

My ears popped.
The air had changed.

Behind me, someone was laughing.

Not a real laugh.

A looped .wav file of a laugh.

Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

Then dial tone.


I slammed the stairwell door behind me.
I think it helped.

But I could still hear the static on the inside of my skull.

And the sound wasn’t fading.

It was syncing.



I made it to the lobby.

Or what was left of it.

The lights were strobing in non-Euclidean rhythm.
Not fast. Not slow. Just… wrong.
One frame at a time.
Flickering between moments.

The receptionist was gone.
So was her desk.
Just a smudge in the floor.
Like the rendering engine gave up on that part of the building.


Outside the glass doors, the city looked like it was being repainted mid-frame.
Traffic frozen mid-intersection.
One car halfway inside another like a broken mesh.
A bus reversed into a wall, slowly, its rear tires turning the wrong direction.



The glass door didn’t open.

It didn’t lock either.

It just… didn’t respond.
So I pushed.
And my hand phased through it.
Like it was still rendering.

The second time, the glass was hot.
Burned me through my jacket.
I didn’t scream—just recoiled and kicked.

The glass fell upward.
Fragmented.
Floated.
Spun in place like glitter.
Then vanished.


I stepped out.

And it was like walking into an update being installed on top of the world.



The sky wasn’t moving.

Clouds were paused.
Just hanging.
Some of them had error artifacts—big black squares where blue should be.
Like chunks of atmosphere were missing textures.

And above it all—
A hovering object.

A shape with no edges.
Like someone forgot to complete the model.
It pulsed with resolution.

The sound coming from it was a looped dial-up tone, stretched into a choir.


People were running.
But not to escape—
They were running in loops.

One man sprinted into a mailbox.
Clipped through it.
Reset.
Did it again.
Over and over.
Like his pathfinding AI was broken.

A woman glitched across the sidewalk at 5x speed—
Feet not touching the ground.
Her scream played before her mouth opened.
Then again.
Then backward.



The static fog was thicker outside.
You couldn’t breathe it.
You downloaded it.
Each breath came with packet loss.
It tasted like copper and radio waves.



Then I saw the police barricade.

Three officers.
One screaming at someone on a megaphone—except the megaphone was off.
No sound.
Just a video feed mouth moving.
His voice came thirteen seconds later, delayed and wrong, like a deepfake AI trying to mimic fear.


Someone approached them.
Twitching.
Jittering.
Wearing a hospital gown.

The cops raised their weapons.

But the man didn’t stop.

He skipped.
Three feet forward.
Then five.
Then inside one of them.


The gun went off.
But the bang didn’t come.

The bullet paused in mid-air.
Visible.
Spinning.
Then fell to the ground like a rejected command.

The officer looked at his own hands.
Then his reflection in the glass beside him.

The reflection showed him, already dead.

Bleeding.
Flickering.
Face stretched sideways, like a broken .jpeg.
He turned toward it.

And became it.


I ran.


I don’t know where I was going.
Every street was a memory loop.
The city repeating itself at the wrong angles.
Buildings rotated 90 degrees in the distance.
Cars drove upward, into blank sky tiles.

I kept going.

Until I couldn’t.

I don’t remember how I got there.

One moment I was running through static.
The next—
I was standing still.
Middle of the intersection.
No cars.
No people.

Just the buzz of unreality.
Like the city was breathing out, waiting for something to render.

Then I saw myself.

Across the street.

Same jacket.
Same limp.
Same dirt stain on the knee.

He—I—was facing away.
Breathing hard.
Looking at nothing.

Then twitching.

The shoulders jittered.
The spine bent too far back.
Hands curled like crashed software.

Then—

snap.

He collapsed.
Folded like paper.
Like someone unfolded him backwards.


They came for me.
Out of the static.
Too many.
Mouths wide.
Eyes buffering.

Screaming in modem.

KHHHHHHHRRRRK—EEEEEEEE—GKKKTTTT—SSNNK.

Hands hit the ground before the feet did.
Bodies moved in skip-fragments.

And me?

I watched them devour me.
From third-person.
Like a dream I wasn’t inside yet.

My limbs ripped.
Tore.
Rewound.
Then tore again.

**Blood didn’t spill—it buffered.
Split midair into red squares.
Froze.
Hovered.
Then disappeared.

No pain.
Not yet.



SYNCHRONIZING…



My skin caught fire.
But the fire wasn’t hot—it was loud.

Sound replaced sensation.
The scream didn’t come from me—it came into me.
Through my ears.
Down my spine.
Every nerve vibrated like a corrupted violin string.

My scream came late.

But it came backwards.

A reverse howl.
Like the signal regretted what it had done.

⸻

I tried to move.
Too late.
I tried to scream.
Too late.
I tried to think.

And the thought came after my skull split open.



Then—

cut.

Like a file being dragged to the trash bin.
No fade.
No credits.
No goodbye.

Just deletion.

I just noticed that I usually like the taste of the coffee (brewed usually the same way) at the end of the bag. 

I always thought this is because I finally was able to dial it in pretty well. But not sure if this is a sign also that I need to rest my coffee more? I usually rest medium to dark roasts (which is my usual) for around 2 weeks and the light roasts for around 4 weeks. 

Any recommendations to help get that taste perhaps at the beginning of the bag not when it’s almost empty? Or if I am missing something here. Or is it just in my head since the coffee is almost over and I am gonna miss it that I taste it differently 😅.

China’s biggest online shopping companies—Alibaba and JDcom—are fighting to be the 1 app people use to order things that arrive really fast, like food, drinks, and everyday items. They’re offering big discounts to get more customers, but experts warn this could cost them a lot of money in the long run. ✅

 #Why Are They Competing? 🤔

> Instant delivery means getting stuff in 30 minutes or less.
> This market is growing fast and could be worth $209 billion by 2030.
> For years, Meituan dominated food delivery. But now Alibaba and JD.com want a big piece of the action.
> To win customers, they’re spending billions and selling things like coffee and bubble tea for super cheap (about 25 cents!).

#What’s the Problem?😵‍💫

> This “discount war” reminds experts of an earlier time when companies battled to win customers by basically giving things away.
> The economy is weaker now, so it’s harder to make profits.
> Since March, the stock prices of all three companies have fallen sharply as investors worry about shrinking profits.
> Meituan’s boss even asked the government to step in and stop the price war.

These companies are fighting hard to grab your attention and loyalty. But spending so much money on discounts could hurt them later.

What do you think? Is it worth it to sell things cheap just to be number one? Or should they focus on making steady profits instead?

These are nine songs from an album I'm still building, called Trembling.  
The music's coming, but the words arrived first.  
They came honestly and quietly.  
I offer them the same way.  
All I ask, is that you read them like you would look at an old photograph: softly, in silence, if only just for a few moments. Thank you.

**1. 'TIL MY TIME RUNS OUT**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

I never thought of growing old  
I never thought I'd watch the fold  
Of skin, of days, of sky and grace  
I lived too fast to face my face  

But then you came, and time grew near  
Not sharp, but soft, not grave, but clear  
You let me see what years could hold  
A quiet room, your hand to hold  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til my breath is spare,  
'Til my bones fall deep  
Into disrepair  

Let the clocks run south,  
Let the body tear,  
I don't mind, I don't care  
You're my can't without  
'Til my time runs out.  

**VERSE 2**

I never dreamt of thinning hair  
Of pills in cups or porchlight prayer  
Of leaning more than I once stood  
Of being seen and being good  

But now I wish for every pain  
That comes from loving you again  
The slippers worn, the kettle's sigh  
The mornings where we're eye to eye  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til the blade grows dull  
'Til the moon casts doubt  
On the beautiful  

'Til my hands can't feel  
'Til my limbs are peeled  
You're my only route  
'Til my time runs out  

**VERSE 3**

No choir waits, no gates of gold  
Just wrinkled hands I long to hold  
A whisper clothed in linen's weight  
Your shoulder bowed beside the gate  

And if I break before the end  
I pray to break where you begin  
To fall, to kneel, to be remade  
Within the furnace of your shade  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til my spine is thread  
'Til the sky forgets  
What the thunder said  

'Til my time runs out  
'Til the curtains fade  
'Til I'm just the sound  
That your memory made  

You're my vow, my drought,  
My wine, my bread  
I am yours, devout  
'Til my time runs out  

**VERSE 4**

I used to want the flame, the flight  
Not this slow grace of shared goodnight  
But now I crave the softer ache  
The soup we spill, the pills we take  

The wrinkled sheets, the morning cough  
The cardigan you never wash  
The way you laugh with only eyes  
The truth that outlives all disguise  

**CHORUS**

'Til my pain has mouth  
'Til my lungs won't fill  
And the stars burn out  
On my windowsill  

I will keep your light,  
'Til the sun unwrites  
You're my can't without  
'Til my time runs out.  

**BRIDGE**

I never dreamed of age or end  
But now I hope to just descend  
Through dusk and doubt, through loss and truth  
A pilgrim held  
in the arms  
of you  

**OUTRO**

You're my time  
You're my last  
You're the thing  
I meant to ask  

But never said  
And now I do  
I want to spend  
What's left  
with you  

You're not my fate  
You're not my proof  
You are my soul  
When it tells the truth  

---

**2. I TO YOU & YOU TO I**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

You came that fall  
when light was thin  
Curtains drawn,  
the hush came in  

I had two hearts  
still sore with doubt  
You kissed their crowns,  
you washed them out  

No flowers thrown, no reasons why  
Just I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 2**

You moved in slow,  
with thyme and thread  
Lit up the lamp,  
unmade the bed  

You swept the dark  
into a pile  
You braided silence,  
made it smile  

No ring, no vow, no wedding cry  
Just I to you and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I tried to bring you sky in spoons  
I sang your name through empty rooms  
I built a boat from broken pine  
And held it up like it was fine  

I caught the stars  
but they slipped by  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 3**

My children knew you  
not by name  
But by the way  
you blessed their shame  

They brought you drawings,  
you brought them calm  
You sang in thread,  
you preached in balm  

No mother's robe, no alibi  
Just I to you and you to I  

No mother's badge, no need to try  
Just I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 4**

No crown you wore,  
no war you fought  
You mended what  
the world forgot  

You made the porch  
a sacred place  
You brewed the tea,  
you blessed the grace  

No altar lit, no angels nigh  
Just I to you and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I tried to carve your sleep in gold  
I kissed your feet when nights grew cold  
I brought you bells that wouldn't ring  
I dressed your hurt in linen things  

I came with hands,  
not wings to fly  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**BRIDGE**

I loved you, not for grace,  
Nor for the light behind your face.  
I loved you like the earth loves rain  
No reason, and no right to claim.  

I vowed to pour your every need  
Into a bowl my hands would feed  
But breath grew thin and shoulders shy  
Still I to you, and you to I  
Still I to you, and you to I  

**VERSE 5**

I brought you pearls  
from basement shelves  
I sang you songs  
I wrote myself  

I tried with all I had to give  
To build the life you'd want to live  
The fruit went soft, the well ran dry  
But not your gaze and not your sky  

Your love for me refused to die  
Just I to you, and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I laid your name in fields of rye  
I built a quilt of lullaby  
I failed to give what kings could not  
But still you stayed, and still you sought  

My reach fell short, but not my try  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**OUTRO**

No god was carved  
No myth was tied  
No golden law  
No serpent guide  

No veil was torn  
No voice replied  
Just I to you  
and you to I  

The world moves on,  
the stars go blind.  
I leave this truth,  
not sealed, but signed:  

We stayed. We gave.  
We said goodbye.  
Just I to you  
and you to I.  

So tell them this when I am done:  
I loved one woman. Only one.  
No savior came. From up on high.  
Just I to You & You to I  

---

**3. TRAMPOLINE**  
*(for Liya)*

**VERSE 1**

There will be a night when I am gone  
no soft goodbye, no light left on.  
You'll touch the chair, the book I read,  
the coat that held my thinning thread.  

You'll search the rooms I left behind,  
find ash where once you looked for mind.  
But love is not a voice or face  
it lives in how you leave a place.  

**VERSE 2**

I was not a steady man.  
I made no maps. I broke the plan.  
But you were light and rope and wheel  
you taught me what I could not feel.  

Where I would vanish, be still, stay  
Where I would curse, learn to pray.  
Where I was small, rise and grow  
I could not lead, do not follow.  

**CHORUS**

My winter crown,  
My falling down,  
My soft ravine.  

My winged ascent,  
My sacrament,  
My canopy.  

My midnight sail,  
My comet's tail,  
My holy key  

My untied rope,  
My arc, my hope,  
My trampoline.  

**VERSE 3**

Say little when the world shouts loud.  
Don't plant your flag in every crowd.  
Make gentleness your kind of bold.  
Let wisdom be the hand you hold.  

Refuse the crown that shuns the weight.  
Forgive too soon, don't love too late.  
And when they mock your heart's true song,  
sing higher still, sing until they're gone.  

Kneel beside the parts I broke  
Give them names, give them oak.  
And where I tried to hide the loss,  
Kiss the flaws, wear the cross.  

**CHORUS**

My angel's kneel  
My sword made shield  
My blind’s unsee 

My holy rite  
My second light  
My offering  

My thunder spark  
My lift from dark  
My trampoline  

My mother's height  
My northern lights  
My trampoline.  

**VERSE 4**

So let them build their towers tall  
You'll know the truth that splits them all:  

what rises up must rise in grace,  
and never seek the higher place.  
You'll love a man, and break apart  
You'll hold your child like precious art  

You'll speak to God and hear no sound  
You'll build a truth from empty ground  
When sorrow comes, as sorrow will  
don't chase the echo, keep the still  

Let mourning be a kind of song  
not proof of loss, but proof of long.  
And when they come to weigh my story,  
and the hourglass runs thin,  
tell them I was just a shadow  

that your light invited in  

**CHORUS**

My winter fire,  
My perfect choir,  
My sorrow’s thief

My kite's lapel  
My citadel  
My heart's serene  

My trembling wings  
My echoing  
My love made steam  

My joy, my girl  
My whole, my world  
My trampoline

**4. HOLY IS**  
*(For My Mother)*

Holy is your flour hand  
Holy are the jars you canned  
Holy is the scraped-out pan  
Holy is  

Holy is the thread you tied  
Holy are the nights you cried  
Holy how you never lied  
Holy is  

Holy were the chairs you set  
Holy in your one regret  
Holy is your silhouette  
Holy is  

Holy were the books you found  
Holy were they, soft and brown  
Holy were these paper crowns  
Holy is  

Holy is the soup you stirred  
Holy is the hummingbird  
Holy is your unsent word  
Holy is  

Holy is your kitchen heat  
Holy in your blistered feet  
Holy where your world would meet  
Holy is  

Holy in the floor you scrubbed  
Holy in the meals you loved  
Holy all you rose above  
Holy is  

Holy how you stroked my hair  
Holy how you found me there  
Holy all the love you spared  
Holy is  

Holy in the stairs you climbed  
Holy through the hunger times  
Holy in the borrowed dimes  
Holy is  

Holy was the milk you poured  
Holy in the quiet chord  
Holy that you asked no more  
Holy is  

Holy is the fraying quilt  
Holy every fingertip  
Holy how you loved your kid  
Holy is  

Holy in your folded note  
Holy every line you wrote  
Holy when you cleared your throat  
Holy is  

Holy are the coins you saved  
Holy how you disobeyed  
Holy how you always stayed  
Holy is  

Holy the grief you made gold  
Holy the warmth in your hold  
Holy the light in the cold  
Holy is  

Holy your spine at night  
Holy your hand in mine  
Holy your shadow's light  
Holy is  

Holy in your sagging shelf  
Holy when you blamed yourself  
Holy how you hid your health  
Holy is  

Holy were your mother's shoes  
Holy all you couldn't choose  
Holy what you still would lose  
Holy is  

Holy are the plates you dried  
Holy how you looked aside  
Holy how you slept beside  
Holy is  

Holy was your final breath  
Holy was your little death  
Holy in what still is left  
Holy is  

Holy in your trembling grace  
Holy in your glowing face  
Holy in your quiet place  
Holy is  

Holy is the bed you made  
Holy is the child you saved  
Holy in the love you gave  
Holy is  

Holy yours the voice I keep  
Holy in the dark and deep  
Holy now, and when I sleep  
Holy is

**5. THE WAY DREAMERS DO**  
*(for Kaiyaan)*

**VERSE 1**

They laid you down in my arms,  
still wet with God, still free from harm.  
Your breath was small, your silence wide  
a sea I couldn't step inside.  

Your fingers moved, a kind of hymn,  
the light bent softly at the rim.  
And I stood dumb, without a claim  
too close to love to speak its name.  

You found my hand, you held it fast  
as if we'd always shared a past.  
You were made of light, you knew  
the weight I couldn't hide from you.  

I made you promises I feared,  
They came out cracked, they disappeared.  
But every vow, though worn and thin,  
was how your father let you in.  

**CHORUS**

When the stars seem distant  
And your wings feel too thin  
When the gates are all golden  
But they won't let you in  

I will lift up the heavens  
If it tears me in two  
Just to watch you keep climbing  
The way dreamers do  

**VERSE 2**

I pray you choose the harder grace  
to stand when fear would take your place.  
To give when giving makes you bleed.  
To plant kindness like a seed.  

To be what I could never be  
less bound by shame, more openly.  
To walk into the storm and stay  
with quiet strength and no display  

**VERSE 3**

Be kind when no one writes it down.  
Be loyal in a faithless town.  
Let mercy be your only boast.  
Let love remain when hope is lost.  

Don't measure good by what it pays.  
Don't count the nights. Just walk the days.  
If the only gold that ever stays  
is what you give, then give it away.  

**CHORUS**

When they say that you're foolish  
For the size of your hope  
When you climb past the treetops  
With your soul tied to rope  

I'll be whispering steady  
Through the branches and blue  
As you grow into thunder  
The way dreamers do  

**VERSE 4**

Now when you speak, the sky comes near.  
You bring the dark, but not the fear.  
And I, who chased a thousand stars,  
just watch you rise, right where you are  

And you stand where I once stood  
but taller, kinder, twice as good.  
You speak the words I never found,  
and lay them gently on the ground.  

I held you like a question  
Now you hold me like a door  
And where I used to lead your steps  
You lead me somewhere more  

**CHORUS**

When your dreams make you lonely  
And they don't understand  
When the stars feel too fragile  
To hold in your hand  

I'll be holding the silence  
Til it sings just for you  
And you'll walk into wonder  
The way dreamers  

**OUTRO**

When my hands are forgotten  
And my voice is just dust  
When the ledger is closed  
And the iron has rusted  

Remember this promise  
I lived to lift you  
To the heights of your longing  
The way dreamers do 

**6. NO OTHER WAY**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

My heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe  
You walk. It hums, It follows you  
No other place For it to beat  
No other home than at your feet  

**VERSE 2**

A kiss was once a place to hide.  
A bed was just the other side.  
I never knew what morning meant.  
Always gone before it spent.  

I wore some names I wore some coats  
I burned like wool I sank like boats,  
The dreams I sang were songs to sleep  
No cradle ever held them deep.  

But you - you stood like something true.  
I turned away. As I used to.  
I feared the place where longing goes.  
I knew your name I chose the road.  

**VERSE 3**

You waited like the sky waits rain  
and all my longing turned to flame.  
Now every lie I ever kissed  
burns like sugar on your wrist.  

**CHORUS**

Love, take this ring it's not for show.  
It's what I found when I let go  
It's what I earned for all the pain  
A kind of grace A holy stain  
It isn't gold. It doesn't shine.  
It only fits your hand in mine.  
No other way, No other way  
To get to you, no other way  

**VERSE 4**

Take this hand. It's out of tune.  
It held the knife. It touched the moon.  
It shook like sin but not today.  
It's waited long for this, to say:  

**CHORUS**

I've nothing left I need to prove.  
But now I know what hands can move.  
No other way, No other way  
No other thread. No finer line.  
My heart, a flower you made mine  
To press between your book of days,  
or let it blow in other ways.  

**VERSE 5**

I think of us, old, bent and slow.  
Your silver hair, the window's glow.  
My fingers cold, your laugh, a bell.  
We fall asleep. We fall so well.  

**CHORUS**

No other way. No other sound.  
No sweeter ache than what we found.  
No other way. No final sky.  
Just you and me—and what won't die  

**OUTRO**

No other way, No other way  
To get to you, no other way

**7. THERE IS**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

Mountains used to hold me  
Like a mother holds a child  
Now they crumble into shadows  
And the road runs lonesome, wild  

But your love remains like moonlight  
On the backs of trembling waves  
And if there's a God, He wrote your name  
In the marrow of my days  

**CHORUS**

And this love has grown so deep  
It wakes me from my sleep  
Just to whisper this:  

""In your love there is  
All the heaven above  
All the truth, all the love""  

**VERSE 2**

I walked through hollow chapels  
Let the echoes be my call  
But I never heard salvation  
Like your footsteps down the hall  

Oh, your body was Jerusalem  
When I had nowhere to stand  
And if there's a God, He placed your hand  
In mine, not to command  

Not to save me, nor enslave me  
Just to help me understand…  

**CHORUS**

This love has grown so deep  
It wakes me from my sleep  
Just to whisper this:  

""In your love there is  
All the heaven above  
All the truth, all the love""  

**BRIDGE**

And if there's a God, He never showed me  
Never sent the rain in sheets  
Never played a chord upon me  
Never danced between the streets  
Not to move me, not to mould me  
Not to name the love I keep  
Just left me by your window  
To watch you fall asleep…  

**OUTRO**

I don't deserve your kindness  
That's why it's holy, I suppose  
In the darkness of my blindness  
Your light is all I've come to know  

---

**8. AIR.**  
*(for Kait)*

I was dust in the hall  
Silent and small  
Before your sweet love  

My heart so bone thin,  
Just a ghost haunting skin  
Until your sweet love  

You were shelter and shrine  
Where the holy things shine  
My sacred sweet love  

In the sweep of your hand,  
I was dust turned to man,  
Knelt to sweet love  

Raised to the sky,  
pulled to the light,  
of your sweet love.  

We'll dance on the sands  
Waves in our hands,  
Endless sweet love  

Til my days come undone  
In the threads of the sun  
Burn me sweet love  

When I'm nothing but light  
In the last stretch of night  
Hold me, sweet love  

When the world breaks in two  
As only worlds do  
Release me, sweet love  

When roots hold my bones  
And my flesh is unsewn  
Know this sweet love:  

That though I be gone  
As dust to the dawn  

Our love will be air,  
Everywhere, everywhere  

---

**9. TESTIFY**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

Morning through the screen door,  
Coffee steam rising slow  
Your hands around your blue mug,  
Like roots beneath the snow.  

And every little sparrow,  
Since the day we met,  
Has been singing something holy,  
I can't forget.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Every breath, every light,  
Every shadow in the night,  

I testify, I testify.  

**VERSE 2**

To the way you fold the sheets,  
How your bare feet meet,  
The wooden floor at dawn,  

Like deer through morning fields,  
Like time when it yields,  
Soft and strong.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Every ache, every wound  
That brought me to your room  

I testify, I testify.  

**VERSE 3**

To the dust motes in the window,  
Paint peeling on the sill,  
To the way you make them wait,  
When you feed the dogs so still.  

To the twilight that will take my voice,  
To the autumn leaves of gold,  
Love is written in the silence  
Like a story never told.  

**BRIDGE**

Between the tooth and tongue of time,  
Between the mountain and the pine,  
Between the creature and the road,  
I lay my heart in your hands to hold.  

And when they ask what saves us,  
From the spinning dark of night,  
I'll tell them how you showed me,  
That love invents the light.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Your love, so warm and wide  
Tears the sky, with holy light  

I testify, I testify.  

**OUTRO**

And I'll testify, and testify,  
For all my life…

1m0cc20,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1m0cc20/26_m_every_day_i_think_about_how_to_break_away/,"[26 M] Every day I think about how to break away from this cycle, but I never can find a solution in my brain. When you try so hard to figure it out and nothing works...life becomes more and more depressing. I love all of you that share my same pain ❤","5 year cycle of getting employed then working for many months just to quit because it takes an extreme toll on my mental health done already 5 times. For health reasons I focus on trying to recover in my time of unemployment which ends up being alot longer than I anticipate. 

During my time off of work I try to figure life out. What new job will work better for me? What career is the right fit for me? Is part time or fulltime the better option? Will I just end up quitting again after a couple of months because I cant take it anymore? When I cant figure things out will I become more depressed? 

Are these jobs and money focused society making us feel this way and making us the way we are wired as NEETS? 

I just want things to feel normal but society just feels un-natural. I feel like 100s of years ago life wasnt like the time we are living in currently. 

I feel like being depressed & having anxiety with many other classifications of the mental state is the natural and correct response to todays society. I hate feeling this way but I feel these feelings are the correct feelings and they shouldnt  be supressed or discouraged. 

IDK man im just in my car at 2am, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes in my feels...while reading all of your posts in here and yall inspired me to share my own post. 

IDK life has to get better with each and every day moving forward right? and eventually we will all figure it out. For some it just takes longer and I think thats us in this subreddit. 

Anyways love all yall that see this ❤ dont be afraid to cry because this life can be hard. 🥲

I'm not sure what to take of that.","So for the 1st outing it wasn't entirely clear if it was a date or just hanging out to make a new potential friend. We had coffee and afterwards a drink and dinner (not initially planned, we only planned for coffee). I think it went great though, can't talk for her but I had a great time, and at one point when I said I like going to restaurants she said something like ""We should totally go together !""

So I took her word for it but this time I tried to be quite clear that I was inviting her on a date (like I said ""Would you let me take you out for dinner soon ?"", dunno if that's clear enough ?) and she said she that she'd be down but that she feels pretty low energy lately and offered a day in a little bit more than 2 weeks. (so from my understanding no obligations like a trip or something)

Dunno, it feels like mixed signals I'm not too sure what to take of it. I can understand feeling tired but more than 2 weeks feels like quite a lot of time to recoup. It makes me think she might not be very interested. But at the same time why bother to say yes and why follow up with a time and day if she just wanted a roundabout way to say no ?

I'm quite confused, I'm not sure how to react. Should I  insist on seeing each other a bit earlier like maybe in a week to still let her recover a bit ? Or should I just wait 2 weeks ? Or should I just not get more invested if she's not feeling it and call it off entirely? Not too sure.",1,1752568022.0,dating_advice,14,1.0,False

After a string of 'meh' dates, I was casually swiping through yet another dating app page on a chill Sunday afternoon—because that's what you do when you’ve run out of things to binge on Netflix, right? Anyway, I came across this one profile that was… how do I even describe it… bizarrely brilliant? His bio literally opened with 'Professional dragon tamer' and claimed he was once an extra in a movie about mimes. I mean, who writes that??

I was tempted to swipe left just out of sheer disbelief, but his pics were kinda cute, and I’m a sucker for a well-written bio, even if it screams 'not real.' So, I swiped right, half expecting him to be some kind of troll—or at least someone with a good story. Fast forward a bit, we matched, and turns out he messaged me first.

Our conversation was full of those perfect little sarcastic exchanges I never seem to get with the usual ""hey"" and ""how’s your day?"" I was laughing so much at our ridiculous banter I almost spilled my iced coffee everywhere.

When we finally met for drinks, the first thing he says is, 'Sorry, I left my dragon at home.' 😆 Turns out, he's not an actual dragon tamer, but just a regular guy with a wicked sense of humor who's been through his own share of dating drama. 

We hit it off right away, and I was genuinely surprised at how much fun we had. It’s amazing how after so many false starts, you can unexpectedly click with someone who just gets your weirdness. Guess you really can’t judge a profile by its… cover? 😂 Anyway, we’re planning a second date, so we'll see where this wild ride takes us!",1,1752567612.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False
