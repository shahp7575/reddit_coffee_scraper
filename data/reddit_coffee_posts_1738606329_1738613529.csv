I‚Äôm lost and need some input, it started off last year when I started experiencing upper abdominal pain and at the time my immediate family tested positive for h pylori and I tested positive as well in June last year. I got antibiotics and initially did not finish the medication I think I needed about 4 days left I really can‚Äôt say why I didn‚Äôt finish them. Went back to the doctor he did retest me and it came back negative and tested blood work at this time and nothing was found in blood work. At this point I started burping everyday, I stressed to my doctor how much I was struggling with the pain and the anxiety of having stomach pain everyday and burping which I had not ever experienced he told me I should get my anxiety under control, and that he should trust the experts that he didn‚Äôt think it was anything serious. I also want to mention I was still drinking coffee after treatment which I didn‚Äôt realize was not a good idea. He then gave me a referral to GI specialist but my insurance changed and I wasn‚Äôt able to see the GI doctor. I have already made an appointment to see my new pcp. I suffer from OCD as it is and it‚Äôs mostly based on my health. I‚Äôm so scared of this being something serious.

I joined this company of July 2024 - WFH job. Today I got called in by my manager. She said we have decided to let you go and we hope we can agree this mutually or we would need to go down the dismissal procedure. I asked her why and she said I have a long list but I would rather not. I mentioned the one month agreement in the contract from both parties. She said, we would rather not and just part ways now. I asked her, I'd be dismissed under what conditions? 

Things that she mentioned was

 - I wasn't on camera all the time (they want you on camera all the time, which I was 95% of the time other than when I was on break or neeing some space from being on camera (its draining)) 
- I said ""I was over it"" - it was January and I'm a Bookkeeper doing Self Assessments for clients. Of course I was over it, I was tired and being micromanage. Plus a colleague left a team meeting as she was clearly over it, but we still performed to the highest standard.
- Apparently I had people in the background of my video - it was my partner bringing me coffee. 
- One time someone was using a shredder while I was talking to her? I don't own a shredder. 
- I was working from Multiple locations.( I had done, between my family home and my partners home) however always had an office space to work from? 

She then said if you agree mutually we would provide a good reference to future employees or if we have to go down the dismissal route, we will let employers know we dismissed you.

I am looking at upgrading, on a somewhat tight budget. I'm no espresso oficionado, but make myself an espresso/lattes 5+ days a week. I had a Klarstein Passionata I got as a Christmas gift 4ish years back and it finally crapped the bed.

Budget is about $400, and had picked up a Breville Bambino for $300, but after reading suggestions was ready to return that and order apps new Gaggia Evo Pro off Amazon (US-SoCal area). While i try to avoid Amazon and use a local retailer, I dont see anything local and it's discounted a bit on Amazon @ $450 where everywhere else I'm seeing it it's either $500 new, or $400ish off of a private seller where I'd likely be on my own with any issues. 

My questions are (1) Is this truly worth the $150 price difference over the Bambino, for a novice coffee maker? 
And (2) Amazon has a 4 year extended warranty listed, through Asurion. Is it worth the extra $60 to have the machine covered for an additional 2 years, or are most fixes something I would be able to handle myself? ",1,1738612933.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Since then I've considered starting a physical business near my home and being my own boss. I think some ideas that have come to mind are a pool hall, aquarium/pet store, coffee shop. But since I live in NYC, I would probably face a lot of competition and high rents. What's also hard is I have a mortgage on a house with a family and kids, so it would also be financially risky if it were to fail.

Unfortunately I don't have a business background nor have worked in any of the industries I listed above. The pool hall would have the largest upfront costs but would generate lots of revenue over the long-term, the profits unfortunately would mostly be made from food and drinks...and at that point it's more like a restaurant if that is the case. I used to be into aquatic fishes and aquariums as a hobby when I was younger. There's a lot of young families in my neighborhood, but I'm not sure if there's a market for this compared to when I was younger when there were aquariums everywhere...I feel like most of the revenue would come from selling equipment and most people would rather buy online these days. I don't care about coffee, but I feel like would required the least overhead but also generate the least revenue. 

Does anyone have experience with a brick & mortar business and/or have focus on the industries I mentioned above -- What's your experience? How long did it take you to become profitable? Did you have to market your business a lot or the customers came naturally? Did you take a loan or use your own savings?

I've had moments in the past where I struggled...but lately it's a lot more often.  

I do pelvic floor relaxation and glute/core strengthening. I take nitric oxide supps like l-citruline and L-arginine.  I do take daily 5mg Cialis...which used to be 2.5mg daily or even 5mg every 3 days.  

I've been cutting back big time on caffeine, which used to consist of a Celsius or monster zero in the morning, maybe an afternoon coke zero, and a pre workout powder around 6pm for my workout...so 400-500mg caffeine a day. This has gone on for years, tbh...and even with that caffeine (I'm tolerant,) I usually got erections as needed just fine, and even Cialis worked fine when needed. 

Now it seems I'm just more limp than usual, sometimes even feeling smaller/tighter (thinner) than I'm used to, versus a healthier plump feeling.  

I've cut back drastically on porn, my caffeine now consist of 2 black only coffee in the morning, maybe a mini afternoon coke zero, I do my exercise, I do my hip thrusts, I do my pelvic floor stretches and relaxation, I take my supplements, I do my cardio (stair master for 20-30m), I just keep expecting/hoping something ""clicks"". 

Spouse and I basically have a dead bedroom, which isn't because of my ED...I think I may have ED because of the lack of intimacy, desire, excitement from my spouse which has harmed my confidence.  We've been arguing more, so I know my stress/anxiety is higher...so yea I think part of my issue is psychological...but still feel like something physical isn't right. 

I don't think I have a venous leak...I do struggle to maintain an erection sometimes, but other times it stays up for a bit with minor stimulation...and id think venous leak would make things consistent. 

45 days ago give or take, I tried taking ground cloves based on something instead on here...and I think I took a coq10..and for whatever reason that particular day, I ended up getting a great erection that didn't want to go down. 

I've never recreated it... I cannot figure out why there are moments of awesomeness and moments of desperation when all other variables seem consistent.

I recently started going down the coffee rabbit hole when I invested some money into an espresso setup and I absolutely love it so far. I'm looking at finding other ways to make coffee and was drawn to the pour over method. I was gifted a Stagg EKG Pro from my registry and am super excited to get to use it, but now I have the day old question of... which brewer do I use if I'm so used to espresso?

I know pour over is MUCH different than espresso, so I guess me explaining the kinds of flavors I like would help.

Typically I enjoy a darker roast or medium roast coffee, but am interested in going outside of the box and trying something new like light roasts and things like that. It's not uncommon of me to add flavored syrups or enjoy my coffees iced as well. I find dark roasts tend to complement the kinds of syrups I add as well, such as hazelnut or caramel, which I find complement the chocolate-y flavors associated with dark roasts.

However, he does spend 500-700‚Ç¨ each month on guitar gear. He never wants to go out really, unless it does something for him: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to this city, i want to possibly buy a guitar there.‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to mcdonalds.‚Äù But it‚Äôs just because he‚Äôs hungry and hasn‚Äôt eaten yet. 

In the 4 years we‚Äôve  been dating, we never  went to an amusement park or a zoo, even though i‚Äôve asked him a million times. 
 
He‚Äôs  bought me flowers twice, even though i‚Äôve communicated to him how much i love flowers. We have sex about once every two weeks, but he never initiates. Also, He has never made me c*m. Doesn‚Äôt even try. After he c*ms, he immediately goes to sleep.
 
Something else that bothers me is that he‚Äôs not romantic. No flirting, no nice comments, 
no romantic gestures. He never ever plans anything. 

We don‚Äôt even watch a movie together at the end of the day or cook together. He thinks living together IS the quality time. 

When i bring it up, he either says i‚Äôm ungrateful and i‚Äôm never happy, or brings up times we went out and did stuff with our friend group. But we never spend quality time together. 

once every 10 days, give or take, we do something nice with friends and we have a really fun weekend. But it‚Äôs not as a couple, but as a friend group. 

However, He‚Äôs a really sweet guy in general. Super sweet and a lovely personality. Also, He always picks me up from the station and always let‚Äôs me drive with him to his work (i go to school in the same area) When i need to go to the hospital, he does drive me there. When i need him to pick me up or drive me somewhere, he 9/10 times does it. 

i‚Äôve communicated it like a 1000 times, but it only got worse. TL;DR It‚Äôs my first relationship so and i was extremely abused as child, so i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs normal? Am i ungrateful? Or am i settling because i don‚Äôt know any better? Please give me some insight.",1,1738612567.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

1igy8ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1igy8ce/how_to_cope_with_unjustified_silent_treatment/,How to cope with unjustified silent treatment?,"I (34F) have had a close friendship with a male coworker (46M), but it‚Äôs been difficult to navigate at times and I‚Äôve very nearly walked away several times in the last year. He is incredibly avoidant, and I noticed last year that it‚Äôs not just romantically, he is so avoidant that it appears to spill over into his friendships, but particularly to me of late.

He hasn‚Äôt been a very good friend to me in the last few months and has largely been absent and cold, but I must stress that nothing has happened or been said between us to justify this whatsoever. He can be incredibly moody and is known amongst his friends to just suddenly not speak to them for days or even weeks at a time, and I mean almost completely ignoring them in person when he encounters them. 

I noticed a pattern of him ignoring me and distancing himself after we‚Äôd spend time together outside of work and we‚Äôd become closer as friends‚Äî he is notoriously private and fiercely independent, he is largely alone and hasn‚Äôt had a relationship in almost a decade now, with just the occasional casual fling here and there that he always put an end to before very long‚Äî he has confided in me about personal, private things that I know he hasn‚Äôt told many others, and we have such a lovely connection and get along so well together. We‚Äôve had so many nights of laughing until our faces hurt and hours of both intellectual and ridiculous conversations, we part ways happy and feeling close, and then it‚Äôs almost always followed by cold indifference, nonchalance and even the silent treatment from him, and it always gets brushed under the carpet eventually and we go back to how things were before. 

I snapped at him around 5 months ago when he did this yet again and I lost it with him a little; I clearly communicated to him that him ignoring me for no reason was cruel and uncalled for, and I‚Äôd rather anything else than to be ignored as I cannot bear it. He tried to lighten the mood and reduce the tension by joking, but I could see he was very uncomfortable with my confrontation and only seemed able to communicate that he was sorry over text afterwards and asked if I wanted to get together outside of work soon‚Ä¶ as I said, that was 5 months ago now and I haven‚Äôt seen him outside of work at all since then, which is the longest we have gone not spending any time together. He‚Äôs had a few moments maybe around 4 months ago of being his usual, sweet, ‚Äúnormal self‚Äù, but these were fleeting and he has grown more and more distant since then, until he let me and another good friend of ours down for drinks after work one day just before Christmas, but texted me and asked if him and I could get together over the holidays and do something then, to which I replied that we could, and I told him what days I was busy and stated that I would leave up to him to decide and contact me when he wanted to do something together, and we have quite literally not spoken at all since. This was almost 2 months ago now. We came back to work after the festive period and I was upset with him having not heard from him at all, and he has completely ignored my existence and I‚Äôve felt I‚Äôve had no choice but to follow suit with how difficult it is to communicate with him about how he makes me feel and his general lack of care, despite the fact it is not in my nature to behave this way. I have had to communicate with him a couple of times for work purposes in the last couple of weeks and I‚Äôve been reduced to tears each time afterwards; he has been so cold and indifferent, and has made me feel so little and like I am nothing. It‚Äôs so upsetting; this is someone who I have introduced to some members of my family, who I have loosely planned to go on some trips away with, someone who left his mother in his home for a whole morning alone on her birthday just 6 months ago because he was so eager to spend Sunday morning having breakfast and coffee with me and visiting a flower market together. 

I‚Äôm usually a pretty emotionally regulated and rational person, but I genuinely feel as though being treated the way I am and being given this incessant silent treatment is causing me to literally begin descending into madness. It‚Äôs so dehumanising and I feel silly for feeling completely heartbroken and confused. I‚Äôm also furiously angry and horrified. Leaving my job and finding another is not completely straightforward or an immediate option for me right now, and even though I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs come to this, I do understand that this is something I now have to seriously consider.

1igy5su,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1igy5su/the_roles_reversed_and_i_feel_like_a_hypocrite/,The roles reversed and I feel like a hypocrite,"I (now 32F then 30F) was living a pretty chaotic life basically partying all the time, doing drugs, casual hook ups, festivals traveling non stop then I met this guy (28M) and we hooked up - he didn‚Äôt do drugs, he was really into his health and sports, had a great group of friends and was still fun; come to find out he‚Äôs been with less than a handful of girls in his life, doesn‚Äôt watch porn or masturbate, his every day is full of activities and training and hobbies still made time for grabbing coffee and hanging out and I got a huge crush on him. We were getting pretty close until a party where some guy grabbed me and kissed me I pushed him off and then I kissed my friend putting on a big girl on girl show and kept going with our night and it pissed him off basically; we got into a big fight and I realized we were just too different he was so rigid and disciplined and followed every rule and while it attracted me at first since I didn‚Äôt - I felt judged for it and felt we weren‚Äôt really sexually compatible either since he only wanted me but didn‚Äôt really pursue me and we would hook up once in a blue moon but it bothered him I got my needs met elsewhere (but it‚Äôs not like he did anything about it!). I was crushed, I felt judged and rejected and icky. I went out and found myself in a threesome and I was just really not enjoying it anymore. It‚Äôs like something clicked and Anyway the whole thing was quite eye opening and I realized I really craved some discipline and a deeper connection (even if not with him). So I got a dog, I bought a house in currently focused on renovating, I haven‚Äôt done drugs in a year, haven‚Äôt smoked in 6 months and I haven‚Äôt had a drink in 3 months and I haven‚Äôt had sex since that threesome (so my last O was him almost a year ago). I still go out sometimes with friends but not as often and I‚Äôm not taking or doing anything so I call it a night pretty early. 

Last week a friend of mine was dj at a club (one I used to go to a lot) but I had been invited to a different private party so I didn‚Äôt make it, especially since I was tired and went home around 2am. I got home and I‚Äôm doing my whole skincare routine getting into bed and I see my phone had a million messages from him, completely incoherent about how he went to the club looking for me and he wants to see me - I told him if he wanted to see me he should just ask to see me not go looking for me where he thinks he‚Äôll run into me and ignored the rest of his messages. I talked to my dj friend today apologizing I didn‚Äôt make it to his party and he told me that that guy was there looking for me and he got so drunk, like sloppy messy drunk. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling a bit gross. The fact that he was sloppy drunk asking for me is so so icky, the fact that he texts me drunk but not really when he‚Äôs sober is super super icky to me, especially since it was his control and discipline that attracted me to him in the first place. But at the same time I feel like a bit of a hypocrite - like I‚Äôm judging him how he judged me. 
It‚Äôs awkward because all my friends know how crushed I was when we decided to call whatever that was off; and now he‚Äôs chasing me around by talking to my friends ( he texted my friends looking for me in different ocassions including showing up to a party uninvited that he knew I would be at). 
Should I be giving him another chance? Am I an asshole for judging him in the same way he judged me? I tried ghosting him / cutting him off but it doesn‚Äôt really work when he knows all my friends and keeps showing up places.
I‚Äôm also happy I turned my life around and don‚Äôt want to get sucked back into the chaos. I‚Äôm working on myself and though I‚Äôm looking to date, I want something long term, I really want someone who elevates me not weighs me down if that makes sense? ",0,1738612324.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

Trump has famously never had coffee or tea in his life. He also doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol, reportedly influenced by his brother‚Äôs struggles with alcoholism. That said, he does drink a lot of Diet Coke, which still has some caffeine, but much less than coffee.

Biden, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt drink coffee at all either! He prefers orange juice in the morning and has been a lifelong non-coffee drinker.

It‚Äôs wild to think that two U.S. presidents - who were very different in almost every other way - both ran the country without relying on caffeine.

Do you think this is just a coincidence, or is coffee more of a working-class habit while high-level politicians and executives tend to avoid it? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1igy3dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TFTGS/comments/1igy3dy/a_reflection_of_tftgs_and_vol4_review_minorvague/,A reflection of tftgs and vol.4 review (minor/vague spoiler warnings),"My experience with creepypastas began like many, when I was a teenager. I particularly enjoyed listening to spooky stories on long family road trips. Something about the relative safety of the car's close proximity and the eeriness from entertaining thrillers mixed very well for me.

I was first referred to TFTGS by someone from the r/StairsintheWoods subreddit. Which is one of my other all-time favorites. I loved the lack of resolution or explanations, and it made the stakes feel deeper and more realistic, as over the top as it was. And when I finished it, I got the mother of all story hangovers. I was desperate to fill the void, and somewhere in between the publishing of the 1st and second book is when I believe I discovered the mcp narrated blogposts on youtube. The rest was history from there. 

It unlocked an aesthetic I always appreciated but could never put into words. To this day I still have to ponder on why it's so appealing. What I will dub the ""gas station aesthetic"" got me through many difficult moments in my life. From disassociating the endless moments of army basic training, to enduring insurmountable stress from schoolwork the gas station always had this eye in the storm comfort. Truly Jack has almost always had it worse than I did so the fact that he was able to overcome his odds in so many tales made me feel that much more confident in myself. And it truly helped me to cherish those quiet moments in times of much turbulence. 

There were many nights when I have been up late cramming, I would pretend I was in a booth at the gas station. If I was alone, I would imagine Jack Quietly sipping his coffee while reading an old book. To keep myself focused I would imagine Jerry asked what I was working on and had to explain it to him. And I haven't even gotten into the humor

I mention all of this to preface my ultimate appreciation for this series, because I want to get into some criticisms but wanted to first make it perfectly clear I don't mean it in any way to discourage Jack or anyone connected to his creation process. Nothing is perfect and all of my favorite books have flaws. \*cough cough The Stand cough cough\* But it would be dishonest of me and unhelpful to say, ""everything's perfect, change nothing, no room to improve."" If people disagree with my thoughts that's totally fine, to each their own! 

  
As I have described to friends and Family TFTGS is always better when Theres a little funny in the spooky, and not a little spooky in the funny. And unfortunately, it feels as the series has gone on the spooky has shrunk but the funny has grown. again, to some this may not even be an issue, and I can totally respect that but in the spirit of my honest opinion there are portions of the books that I wish I could have acted as Matthew McConaughey did in Interstellar. I just want to reduce the quirky sarcasm meter by 10 to 25 % in certain parts throughout the series. It is what I believe the hosts of Creepcast were trying to say in their review of the series when they covered it. (but maybe put more eloquently by me) I definitely do not want this feedback to seem harsh or cutting. This is a common note for me the guardians of the galaxy series are another property I have the same feelings about. So, as Jack and his team continue to create fun and awesome stories, I hope they see this as a polite challenge to dare let the darker more intense aspects of their works dominate larger portions of the narrative. using humor more sparingly. Which, I believe will enhance all aspects of the work. 

all of the books have these attributes and deficits vol. 4 being no exception. There are many very interesting character/character interactions that I found deeply engaging such as Jacks backstory/familial exploration. And the dynamics of the factional warfare revolving primarily around roger also did well to keep me invested. Generally speaking, as I said, I could have simply done with a reduction of some of the comedic undercuts.

Another note I am ambivalent about even posting has to do with pacing, I definitely need to re-read the volume a few more times so that I can feel more confident about my thoughts, but it felt like there could at times, be an issue of slow down and hurry up. certain sequences felt slow while other parts of the story seemed like they went so fast I had to re-read them just to comprehend what happened. If anyone else agrees with me, I will know I am not crazy. There also felt to be subtle theme of procrastinating which if intentional is truly brilliant and would certainly reduce some of that criticism from me notorious time mismanager.

As a finale to the series, I was thoroughly satisfied. I was not hoping all loose ends would be tied up and would have been a little upset if they tried to. The showrunners of lost will tell you ending a series with lots of uncertainty is not easy. But I feel Jack did a standout job. The answers I got were the most important ones. The ending felt sloppy but in a glorious way. The only substance I want to put out there is I feel like the stakes could have been raised if there were a few more deaths of the main characters. Horrible I know, I hate myself for it too but as I have grown older, I have grown sicker and sicker of the overuse of plot armor. and making a joke about it doesn't really excuse it. The resolution of the pain god truly made me howl with laughter at 2:45 am so I'm not that upset about it either. overall, I would give volume 4 seven out of ten stars. God Bless!

my order of favorites from the series from least favorite to favorite goes:

D: vol 4. 7/10

C: vol 2. 8.5/10

B: vol 3. 9/10

A: vol 1. 9.5/10

I wish I could also have the same energy for hobbies and work, instead, all I think of is sleep basically. It's like I have no inner drive, no inner flame which keeps me going and motivated. I am not depressed though, I just physically feel old. 

What else could I try out? I am desperate for help, because it keeps getting worse and worse the older I get. All I am is ""fck this shit I wanna sleep"", and then actually sleep for half the day. I am so desperate that I thought of hypnosis (to brainwash me to be blind to negative physical feelings, so I won't acknowledge that I am tired or something). I just don't have many options left to try out. Chakra work? Pressure points? Nootropics? Meditation? I am willing to try everything out, I just need a good instruction what to exactly do.",4,1738611975.0,selfimprovement,7,0.83,False

I have been working on dialing in my shop‚Äôs coffee on the Swiss Tone Touch 3 machine. I was wondering if anyone has experience with it and getting it to a point where it can beat or match a hand brew. 

I have tried a quite a few different recipes and beans but I have had issues with the brew tasting thin. The best I have gotten it is treating it similar to a continuous mellow dripper (turned the flow way low to 1g-1.5g/sec). The water is piped the same way 

Some other things I have tried also include
(Grind size: Finer and Courser)
(Brewer: V60 02 and Orea V3)
(Temperature: up to 100C Higher and low as 80C)
(Temperature Fluctuations starting at 96C then dropping the temp to 80C for the final pour)

Teeth whitening is an exciting cosmetic procedure that can transform your smile and boost your confidence. But after investing time and money into achieving those pearly whites, many people wonder about the crucial post-treatment care, especially when it comes to eating and drinking. Understanding the right eating guidelines can help you maintain your brilliant results and prevent sensitivity or potential staining.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?

During a professional teeth whitening treatment, your tooth enamel becomes temporarily more porous and sensitive. The whitening agents open up the microscopic pores in your teeth, making them more vulnerable to staining and potential discomfort. This temporary state means you'll need to be extra careful about what you consume immediately after the procedure.

Immediate Post-Treatment Eating Guidelines

Right after teeth whitening, your mouth requires special attention. Here are the critical guidelines for eating and drinking:

1. Wait at Least 2 Hours Before Eating
- Immediately after treatment, avoid eating for a minimum of two hours
- Allow your teeth time to begin remineralizing
- Prevent potential staining or sensitivity

2. The 48-Hour White Diet

For the first 48 hours after teeth whitening, follow the **""white diet""**:
- Stick to clear, white, or pale-colored foods and drinks
- Avoid deeply colored or pigmented items
- Focus on foods like:
  - White rice
  - Chicken
  - Fish
  - Tofu
  - Cauliflower
  - Plain yogurt
  - Water

Foods and Drinks to Avoid

During the critical 48-hour window, completely avoid:
- Red wine
- Coffee
- Dark tea
- Colored sauces
- Berries
- Tomato-based products
- Chocolate
- Colored sodas
- Dark juices

Why These Restrictions Matter

The temporary porosity of your tooth enamel makes it extremely susceptible to staining. Dark-colored foods and beverages can quickly compromise your fresh whitening results. The microscopic pores in your teeth can easily absorb pigments, potentially reversing the whitening effect.

Recommended Eating Strategy

Recommended eating approach for optimal results:
1. Start with room temperature foods
2. Choose bland, light-colored options
3. Avoid extremely hot or cold items
4. Use a straw for drinking to minimize contact with teeth
5. Take small bites and chew carefully

Managing Potential Sensitivity

Some individuals experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening:
- Use sensitive toothpaste
- Avoid extremely hot or cold foods
- Choose soft, easy-to-eat items
- Stay hydrated with water
- Consider over-the-counter pain relievers if needed

Long-Term Dietary Considerations

After the initial 48-hour period, gradually reintroduce regular foods. However, maintain good oral hygiene and consider these long-term strategies:
- Rinse mouth after consuming staining foods
- Use a straw for potentially staining drinks
- Brush teeth regularly
- Consider touch-up whitening treatments

Professional vs. At-Home Whitening

Dietary restrictions may vary slightly between professional and at-home treatments:
- Professional treatments often require stricter initial guidelines
- At-home kits might have more flexible post-treatment recommendations
- Always follow specific instructions provided by your dental professional

When to Consult Your Dentist

If you experience:
- Extreme sensitivity
- Prolonged discomfort
- Unexpected reactions
- Concerns about your whitening results

Contact your dental professional for personalized advice and guidance.

Conclusion

Navigating the post-teeth whitening eating guidelines might seem challenging, but following these recommendations ensures your bright smile remains stunning. By being mindful of your diet for the first 48 hours and maintaining good oral hygiene, you'll protect your investment and enjoy a radiant, confident smile that truly shines. Remember, patience and careful attention during the initial recovery period will help you achieve the best possible long-term whitening results.",1,1738611927.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

1igxtel,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1igxtel/aio_about_my_friends_venmo_request/,AIO about my friends Venmo request?,"I‚Äôm going to try to keep this as short as possible while still giving y‚Äôall all of the necessary info. 

So a little background: My friend Allison (31F) and I (30F) have been friends for over 15 years. She now has 2 kids that I absolutely adore and I‚Äôve been a part of their lives since they were born. 

We‚Äôve had a few arguments/falling outs when we were dumb teenagers but we always found our way back to each other and made up. Our dynamic the last several years has been good but there is one thing eating at me and I‚Äôm realizing now i might have to address it. 

Allison has a lot of great qualities, but one thing about her is she has always been extremely stingy since the day I met her in 8th grade. Everything has to be split 50/50 down to the penny. There has never been the same understanding I have with my other friends where we happily buy one another a meal and next time the other person pays. There‚Äôs a mutual generosity/give & take with my other friends and it does end up being about 50/50 in the long run, we‚Äôre just not counting every cent. 

She is like this with everyone in her life. Just one example, I remember once in our 20s her roomie asked for maybe 2 tablespoons of almond milk for her coffee bc she was out. Allison said ‚Äúyeah sure‚Äù and then hit her with a $2 Venmo request for the almond milk üíÄ Shes not quite as petty anymore but the stinginess still shines thru lol. 

I would be understanding if her upbringing reflected her frugality but the thing is, she has never struggled for money a day in her life. She grew up very wealthy never wanting for anything material and continues to be well off today. I know she‚Äôs inherited an unbelievable about of $$ and her husband makes a great salary and fully supports her financially. However, I DID grow up fairly poor. We never missed a meal but my sister and I grew up working from the time we were 8 years old in our family businesses to help our parents get by. I‚Äôve always had 2-3 jobs to try to make a life for myself as I didn‚Äôt start out light years ahead of everyone with a trust fund. I still have to work 2 jobs and I live in an expensive state so I‚Äôve struggled to build up any savings. 

Sorry that was so long winded, let‚Äôs get into what is bringing everything to a head.
Normally I‚Äôm just quietly annoyed by the nickel and diming but I comply and split everything 50/50 w/o complaint, but this morning I may have hit my limit. Here was the situation: her oldest daughter is 6 and showing a lot of interest (and talent) when it comes to art. I have painted as a hobby since middle school and we thought it would be fun to plan an art night with her daughter. I offered to host at my place and she offered to bring dinner over. This little girl is like a niece to me and I wanted to make it a special evening for her, so I went to the store and got her special dairy free ice cream (she has allergies), a stuffy, other snacks, and table cloths to protect my table and floor. She had a little painting kit but I offered for her to use any of my brushes or paints she wanted. I provided a giant canvas for all of us to paint together, & if you‚Äôre not familiar, large canvases and art supplies are very expensive. We ordered food (I got a $12 appetizer) and Allison went to pick it up while her daughter and I started painting. Overall it was super fun, her daughter had a blast and loved her stuffy and snacks. 

Imagine my reaction when I wake up to a $13 Venmo request for my damn appetizer from last night (she added a dollar for the transfer fee lol). I wish I could say I was shocked but I‚Äôm just deeply annoyed and I feel resentful after years of this. For the life of me, I cannot understand this mentality and I grew up without means. I probably spent at least $40 between supplies and groceries and the thought never crossed my mind to request money from her. Am I overreacting by feeling angry and resentful? How would you respond if you were in this situation or should I just ignore it? Do I double down on her stinginess and send her a Venmo request for the difference of what I spent vs her? Help!!

I used to feel smug ‚Äî confident even ‚Äî about my ever-growing collection of cast iron cookware. I had skillets of all sizes, a Dutch oven, a griddle, even one of those little mini skillets that I convinced myself I needed for single-serving brownies (which, let‚Äôs be honest, always turned into ‚Äújust eat the whole thing out of the regular-sized pan‚Äù situations). But there was a problem. Storage space.

Now, like any rational person, I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just stack them! Efficient! Organized! What could possibly go wrong?‚Äù Oh, you naive fool. The first few days, everything seemed fine. I had carefully nested them, thinking I had cracked the code to kitchen storage. But then, one fateful morning, disaster struck.

It started with a gentle nudge ‚Äî just a tiny miscalculation while reaching for the coffee mug precariously balanced near the skillet tower. And then the clang. That horrendous, soul-crushing noise that can only mean one thing, metal meeting metal in an ill-fated embrace. My heart stopped. My breath caught in my throat. The dog, sensing my distress, bolted from the room as if fleeing an impending apocalypse.

I slowly turned my gaze downward, dreading what I would see. There it was ‚Äî my beloved skillet, the one I had painstakingly seasoned to absolute perfection, the one that had seen me through everything from perfectly crispy bacon to tragically overcooked steaks ‚Äî sitting there, chipped. My spirit shattered into as many pieces as my now-ruined pan.

For those unfamiliar with the emotional devastation of cast iron damage, let me paint you a picture. Imagine spending months training for a marathon, only to trip over your own shoelaces at the starting line. Or crafting the perfect souffl√©, only to watch it deflate into a sad, eggy pancake. That‚Äôs what it felt like.

And before you even ask, no, a little chip is NOT ‚Äújust cosmetic.‚Äù That chip is a sign that I have failed. A scarlet letter of negligence. A mark of my hubris. Not to mention, once that enamel starts to go, rust moves in like an opportunistic little gremlin, ready to claim my pan for the abyss.

So, my fellow kitchen warriors, I beg you ‚Äî do not stack your cast iron skillets unless you have some deep, personal need for emotional destruction. Store them properly, with a layer of protection in between if you must nest them. Better yet, hang them up like medieval weapons, proudly displaying them as the battle-tested relics they are. The sound of one cast iron skillet chipping is enough to haunt your dreams forever.

They would go directly to the first server, ignoring all signs, other people, barriers, arrows etc and then look surprised when the server pointed them at the line. And this was in Italy.

1igxk30,https://i.redd.it/8dpchbyq6zge1.png,Leading Through the Winter Slump: Evidence-Based Strategies for Maintaining Team Morale,"**TL;DR:** The winter slump can drain team morale and productivity, but leaders can combat this with clear communication, empathy, and strategic motivation. Acknowledge challenges, foster trust through transparency, and use small morale-boosting actions to keep teams engaged and resilient.  

---

Winter months often bring unique challenges for teams and leaders alike. After the holidays, energy levels drop, motivation wanes, and the darker, colder days can make everything feel harder. For teams, this can mean a noticeable dip in morale and productivity. For leaders, it‚Äôs a pivotal time to step in, not just to manage performance but to set the tone for resilience and growth.  

Let‚Äôs unpack some evidence-based strategies for leading effectively during this tricky season:  

### 1. **Lead with Clear and Consistent Communication**  
Communication is always critical, but it‚Äôs especially important during low-energy periods like the winter slump. When people are feeling disengaged or uncertain, they look to leadership for clarity and direction.  

- **Be visible:** Regular check-ins, even brief ones, keep the team aligned and remind them that you‚Äôre present and invested.  
- **Be transparent:** Acknowledge the challenges your team is facing, and share what‚Äôs being done to address them. Transparency fosters trust and helps combat feelings of uncertainty.  
- **Show empathy:** Pair decisiveness with compassion. Let your team know you understand their struggles and are there to support them.  

üëâ For example: Open a team meeting by acknowledging the seasonal challenges, then shift focus to a shared goal or recent success. This frames the conversation positively without ignoring reality.  

---

### 2. **Foster Motivation Through Small, Meaningful Actions**  
Motivation doesn‚Äôt always come from big, sweeping gestures. Often, small, consistent efforts to boost morale are the most effective.  

- **Celebrate wins:** Recognize individual and team achievements, no matter how small. Recognition creates momentum.  
- **Create moments of connection:** Organize informal team activities like a coffee break chat or a fun, low-pressure challenge.  
- **Prioritize well-being:** Introduce small wellness initiatives, like providing healthy snacks or encouraging movement breaks.  

üëâ Example: A client I worked with introduced ‚ÄúFlex Fridays‚Äù during the winter months‚Äîgiving employees an extra hour in their day to focus on personal projects, self-care, or family time. It was simple but had a huge impact on morale.  

---

### 3. **Balance Empathy with Expectations**  
One of the hardest tasks for leaders during this time is maintaining performance standards while accommodating the real challenges people face. It‚Äôs a delicate balance, but the payoff is worth it.  

- **Set realistic goals:** Break larger projects into manageable tasks to make progress feel achievable.  
- **Offer flexibility:** When possible, adapt schedules or provide options for remote work to help employees balance work and personal needs.  
- **Be proactive with support:** Regularly check in with your team one-on-one to identify and address challenges early.  

---

### 4. **Model Resilience as a Leader**  
Leadership is about setting the tone. If you want your team to stay resilient, they need to see that same resilience in you.  

- **Share your own experiences:** Normalize struggles by sharing how you stay motivated or overcome challenges.  
- **Take care of yourself:** Make sure you‚Äôre prioritizing your own well-being‚Äîyour energy and focus have a direct impact on the team.  
- **Stay positive:** Focus on opportunities for growth and success, even during tough times. Optimism is contagious.  

---

### Why This Matters  
Leading through the winter slump isn‚Äôt just about surviving the season‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to build trust, strengthen team dynamics, and lay the foundation for future success. By showing up with empathy, clarity, and intentional strategies, leaders can turn this challenging time into a period of growth and connection.

So a little background: My friend Allison (31F) and I (30F) have been friends for over 15 years. She now has 2 kids that I absolutely adore and I‚Äôve been a part of their lives since they were born. 

We‚Äôve had a few arguments/falling outs when we were dumb teenagers but we always found our way back to each other and made up. Our dynamic the last several years has been good but there is one thing eating at me and I‚Äôm realizing now i might have to address it. 

Allison has a lot of great qualities, but one thing about her is she has always been extremely stingy since the day I met her in 8th grade. Everything has to be split 50/50 down to the penny. There has never been the same understanding I have with my other friends where we happily buy one another a meal and next time the other person pays. There‚Äôs a mutual generosity/give & take with my other friends and it does end up being about 50/50 in the long run, we‚Äôre just not counting every cent. 

She is like this with everyone in her life. Just one example, I remember once in our 20s her roomie asked for maybe 2 tablespoons of almond milk for her coffee bc she was out. Allison said ‚Äúyeah sure‚Äù and then hit her with a $2 Venmo request for the almond milk üíÄ Shes not quite as petty anymore but the stinginess still shines thru lol. 

I would be understanding if her upbringing reflected her frugality but the thing is, she has never struggled for money a day in her life. She grew up very wealthy never wanting for anything material and continues to be well off today. I know she‚Äôs inherited an unbelievable about of $$ and her husband makes a great salary and fully supports her financially. However, I DID grow up fairly poor. We never missed a meal but my sister and I grew up working from the time we were 8 years old in our family businesses to help our parents get by. I‚Äôve always had 2-3 jobs to try to make a life for myself as I didn‚Äôt start out light years ahead of everyone with a trust fund. I still have to work 2 jobs and I live in an expensive state so I‚Äôve struggled to build up any savings. 

Sorry that was so long winded, let‚Äôs get into what is bringing everything to a head.
Normally I‚Äôm just quietly annoyed by the nickel and diming but I comply and split everything 50/50 w/o complaint, but this morning I may have hit my limit. Here was the situation: her oldest daughter is 6 and showing a lot of interest (and talent) when it comes to art. I have painted as a hobby since middle school and we thought it would be fun to plan an art night with her daughter. I offered to host at my place and she offered to bring dinner over. This little girl is like a niece to me and I wanted to make it a special evening for her, so I went to the store and got her special dairy free ice cream (she has allergies), a stuffy, other snacks, and table cloths to protect my table and floor. She had a little painting kit but I offered for her to use any of my brushes or paints she wanted. I provided a giant canvas for all of us to paint together, & if you‚Äôre not familiar, large canvases and art supplies are very expensive. We ordered food (I got a $12 appetizer) and Allison went to pick it up while her daughter and I started painting. Overall it was super fun, her daughter had a blast and loved her stuffy and snacks. 

Imagine my reaction when I wake up to a $13 Venmo request for my damn appetizer from last night (she added a dollar for the transfer fee lol). I wish I could say I was shocked but I‚Äôm just deeply annoyed and I feel resentful after years of this. For the life of me, I cannot understand this mentality and I grew up without means. I probably spent at least $40 between supplies and groceries and the thought never crossed my mind to request money from her. Am I overreacting by feeling angry and resentful? How would you respond if you were in this situation or should I just ignore it? Do I double down on her stinginess and send her a Venmo request for the difference of what I spent vs her? Help!!

¬†

What are your thoughts?¬† At this point, I‚Äôm going to see the GI (Feb 11) and lay out all the symptoms to him.¬† I‚Äôm not convinced that my problem is GI related.¬† I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs more a whole body issue going on that is presenting at GI related.¬† A lot of symptoms point to parathyroid, but labs are normal-ish.¬† Based on research, I‚Äôm not convinced that the borderline calcium and Vitamin D aren‚Äôt telling of something.¬† What about hypothyroid?¬† A lot of symptoms point to this.¬† I‚Äôm trying to push my PCP to perform thyroid labs, but he wants GI opinion before he orders more test.¬† Diabetes seems to fit most of the symptoms as well.  My glucose and a1c has always been on the high side of normal.  Gallbladder issues that testing is showing okay on?  Hepatotoxicity / DILI from antibiotics?  Ulcer?

I‚Äôve done quite a bit of research in various Philly subs and felt it was time to share what I personally am looking for in moving to Philly this year once I land a job in the vicinity. 

I‚Äôm a mid 20s woman (and lesbian but ‚Äúpassing‚Äù) coming from rural NJ, and appreciate Philly for its walkability, historic charm, and, from what I have heard, sense of community among neighbors. I‚Äôd love to find a place to live where i feel relatively safe to walk to coffee shops/other shops and chat with neighbors, while of course practicing common sense safety lol. 

I‚Äôm undecided on having my car; perhaps in the beginning while I see how I like it and I would reevaluate down the line. I would love to bike as much as possible so will be educating myself on bike routes!

So far I have loved the looks of places like Old City, Society Hill, and Fitler Square. If there‚Äôs anywhere similar in vibe on the outskirts I‚Äôm open to that as well. I‚Äôd be a hell of a lot closer to civilization than where I currently live ü§£

Given my identity and being new to city living, the safest I can find within a reasonable budget is a top priority. I‚Äôm not super concerned with access to nightlife, I‚Äôd prefer on the quieter side and love coffee shops, tree lined streets, green spaces, and a sense of friendly community.

Alright, its going to be a long one and I need your suggestions as I am completely out of my mind. 

We two met each other last year around May and was introduced by a common friend. The moment I saw her, I had a crush on her. The common friend had told me earlier that she's with someone. So, I did not went ahead with the feeling. We started hanging out  with the group normally and i started enjoying the time with her. 

Skip a couple months, we started doing trips together just us, going to coffee shops, hot chocolates etc. She also started enjoying my company she said that. I do drive her around here and there quite a few times a month. We meet every week with our group for coffee catchup. We both actually felt the warmth and became very good friends in a short span of time. Started liking the company. 

And back while when we were going on a trip that she's single and is on dating app. It brought my feelings back again. I gave myself time, a couple months from Oct, just to realize that the feelings i have for her are not ""passing feeling"". As I do not want to confess at the start, and then the person gets attached and then I lose the feelings, do not wanted to hurt her. Every single day from that onwards, my feeling for her only grew and i started LIKING her A LOT every single day. 

She is a very good person, and looking for a long-term in fact permanent committed relationship. She's humble, loyal, down-to-earth, matured and a very happy-go-lucky girl. Whenever i look into her eyes, i feel a kind of spark and feel something. I love when she opens her hair, she looks so pretty. Her smile is very unique, i haven't really saw anything like that. I am an introvert guy, silent, less talkative. And she's completely opposite. Extroverted, talkative, excellent story telling skills. I was actually looking for a such a person who is completely opposite than me. I value the differences and I feel if we have that, we can create unique experiences every single day. Whenever I am around her, it feels like something connects, and something fits. We started spend good amount of time together, went on road trips, shopping, grocery shopping, etc. 

With all these influx of emotions, I decided to finally let her know last week. She loves watching stars so I decided to take her to a place in the night out of the city lights, for stargazing. Enjoyed the drive, and spend the time watching stars. I had her hot chocolate and we shared good moment sipping the hot chocolate. I got a feeling that it is the right time to let her know, I told her can i ask you something. I then went ahead and asked if we could go on a date together. She took a pause and told why do we wanna ruin the friendship we have together. And she told me to let her know what everything is going in my mind. I let her know every single thing I felt, that how much I like her and how much she means everything to me, how much her company means to me. Every single thing. 

This is what she said. Heads up, it didn't turn in my favor. She thinks she is not ready for it and when i confessed my feelings to her, she kind of little freaked out. ""Not ready"" is a strong word, but she's not in a state to do this. She said she has a past trauma, and its so bad that it keeps coming in intervals and she had it recently where she breaks down and reaches him. She feels this void and want to focus on herself atm. With all this going around, she won't be able to give the love i need. She's currently ""empty"" - referring to a glass. And even if she ignores, and come with me , it won't be genuine. I felt her pain in her eyes while she was explaining this. I told her I am not in a state to rush, i wanna take baby-steps and i am ready to wait. Because that's what love is right, you wait and don't rush. I told her I don't have any expectations, I just wanna give you love and we can deal this shit together. I will make sure to give you a lot. But, she said for how long will i wait, she's not sure how long it will be and its not a good idea to keep me holding. Told me move on, go on other hinge dates, eventually you will find someone who's ready to ""give"" and not just receive. 

After hearing all this, it killed me inside. I cried the shit out of me after returning. This sucks a LOTTT. The thing is, for the first time, i never felt irritated or angry or feel like punching when she explained. Instead, I felt at peace and calm. Only thing is I am hurt a lottt, feeling like someone tore the book out in between. My love for her is genuine and I don't wanna give up on her. I want to take her out of the feeling she is going. I don't feel like giving up because for all that I know, she's worth it. Its rare to find a person like her with good human, heart and behavior and i do have the feeling of keeping her. 

Please guys help me, is it worth waiting for her? I need some suggestions.",0,1738610058.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

1igx6bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1igx6bd/mf_the_awakening/,[MF] The Awakening,"You wake up and something feels‚Ä¶ wrong. It‚Äôs subtle at first, just a quiet unease, like a whisper in the back of your mind. You brush it off, telling yourself that maybe you‚Äôre just tired, just off-balance.

But then you step outside.

No one smiles. No one waves. The streets are lifeless, yet full of people. Every face looks tired, beaten down, cold. Conversations are mechanical, void of warmth or joy. Even the advertisements seem more predatory than usual‚Äîshouting at you, demanding something from you, but offering nothing in return.

You pull out your phone. You scroll through social media.

Eighty percent of what you see is corruption, manipulation, fear-mongering, lies disguised as truth, anger disguised as justice. Everything is meant to divide. Everything is meant to control.

And yet‚Ä¶ nobody seems to notice.

Then there‚Äôs your bank account. You check it out of habit, and your stomach clenches. Your paycheck‚Äîit‚Äôs lower. Not by much, just enough that most people wouldn‚Äôt notice. But you do. And it keeps happening. The deductions, the taxes, the fees.

Where is it all going?

You ask people. They shrug. You ask more. They look at you like you‚Äôre insane. You keep asking, and soon, they stop responding altogether.

Panic. You run through the streets, desperately looking for something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat makes sense. You check news reports. The government has passed another law stripping away another right. Nobody seems to care. You see a protest being dismantled on TV‚Äîarmed men in riot gear dragging people away like livestock. Nobody reacts.

Then, the final crack.

An alleyway. Two officers beating a man senseless, his body limp, his screams muffled by the sound of their boots crushing into him. You freeze, waiting for someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto stop them.

Nobody does.

That‚Äôs when you understand.

You‚Äôre not in another world.

You‚Äôre just finally seeing the one you were already in.

You do the only thing you can think of‚Äîyou speak out.

You write a post, exposing everything you‚Äôve seen, every injustice, every manipulation, every twisted reality that nobody else seems to notice. You expect people to react, to wake up, to see what you see.

But they don‚Äôt.

Instead, they turn on you.

Your phone floods with threats. On the streets, people glare at you like you‚Äôre diseased. Someone throws a half-empty coffee cup at you. Another person spits at your feet.

You‚Äôve been branded as dangerous. Not because you lied, but because you told the truth.

And then, the government notices you.

At first, it‚Äôs small things. Your social media posts disappear. Your bank account shrinks further. You get a notice in the mail‚Äîa fine for something you didn‚Äôt do.

Then, they escalate.

Forced entry at your home. A silent, creeping dread builds in your chest as you check the security cameras. Two men. Dark clothing. Weapons drawn. Orders from the government.

You post the footage online.

And that‚Äôs when everything changes.

The people who ridiculed you start asking questions. The death threats turn into messages of support. The illusion cracks, and soon, there‚Äôs no stopping it.

You build a movement. A resistance. You give the people a voice, a place to share their truths. And as the rebellion grows, so does the government‚Äôs desperation.

Until finally, they resort to the one thing they know best‚Äîviolence.

The streets of Washington, D.C. are flooded with people.

Thousands‚Äîno, millions‚Äîmarch forward, a tidal wave of defiance crashing against the walls of power. The military moves in, their orders clear: Crush them. Silence them. Destroy them.

But the people don‚Äôt stop.

The gas, the batons, the rubber bullets‚Äîthey push through it all.

They bleed for this moment.

They die for this moment.

And when the final barricade is broken, when the last soldier falters in the face of something greater than fear, you step forward.

You‚Äôre bloodied, beaten, broken. You‚Äôve lost people. You‚Äôve lost pieces of yourself.

And yet, as you stand before the gates of the White House, looking out at the sea of faces‚Äîyou have never felt stronger.

The murmur of the crowd fades.

Then, silence.

Every breath is held.

And you begin.

‚ÄúLook around you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at what it took to get here. Look at the blood on these streets. The friends we‚Äôve lost. The wounds we carry. Look at the price we have paid just to be heard. To be seen. To be treated as human beings.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet, still‚ÄîSTILL‚Äîthey will call us criminals. STILL, they will say we are the problem. That we are the ones who need to be silenced. That we are dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut tell me this‚Ä¶ Who is more dangerous? The man who speaks the truth? Or the one who would kill to keep it buried?‚Äù

A rumble in the crowd. They are listening. They are feeling it.

‚ÄúFor years, they have robbed us. Not just of money, not just of land, but of something far greater. Of our dignity. Our hope. Our future. They have kept us divided. They have made us fight each other while they sat in their towers, counting their gold and writing laws designed to keep us weak.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo more.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday, we take it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday, we remind them that power belongs to the people‚Äînot to the corrupt, not to the liars, not to the cowards who sit behind bulletproof glass and order soldiers to slaughter their own countrymen.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey will call us radicals. Revolutionaries. Terrorists.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause if fighting for freedom makes us dangerous‚Äîthen by God, we will be the most dangerous people this world has ever seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey cannot kill an idea. They cannot silence a movement. And they sure as hell cannot stop us now.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook around you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are not few.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are millions.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we will not stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot until every chain is broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot until every lie is burned away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot until we are free.‚Äù

The Final Moment

The crowd erupts.

Not in applause‚Äîin war cries.

The world has woken up.

And nothing will ever be the same again.

Un peu a propos de moi, je suis un √©tudiant international et heureusement j‚Äôai class seulement dans la soir√©e. Je suis libre tout le jour. Donc je suis en train the chercher un travail √† temps partiel.

¬†

J‚Äôai fait des ¬´¬†walk ins¬†¬ª et me postuler en ligne et √©tonnamment j‚Äôavais des entrevues! Par exemple √† Starbucks (2 fois), Tommy Caf√©, Second Cup, Mandy‚Äôs et autres (ind√©pendants). Le mellieur saison a √©t√© Septembre. Mais malheureusement aucun me embauch√©¬†:(

Mais malheureusement aucun ne m'a embauch√© :( J'ai √©t√© ¬´ embauch√© ¬ª dans un caf√© brunch et j'y ai travaill√© pendant 3 jours, puis ils m'ont dit que lorsqu'il y aurait plus de clients, ils me rappelleraient, j'y suis all√© parfois mais la r√©ponse √©tait la m√™me. Et non, ces 3 jours n'ont pas √©t√© pay√©s.

¬†

J‚Äôai d‚Äôexp√©rience dans le nettoyage commercial par 1 an et en tant un b√©n√©vole j‚Äôai d‚Äôexp√©rience par 8 mois en tant service √† la client√®le.

Ou cherche-je un travail? En tenant compte de mon exp√©rience, je veux chercher quelque travail que c‚Äôest dans quelque ces endroits.

¬†

Suis-je pr√™t pour travailler sans pay√©? Oui! Mais pas de cette mani√®re. Je peux simplement dire que je cherche du travail en tant que b√©n√©vole.

¬†

Ou je veux travailler en tant un b√©n√©vole? J'aimerais travailler dans l'industrie alimentaire (restauration) et faire une carri√®re dans ce secteur, en particulier dans les caf√©s, les p√¢tisseries et les boulangeries.

¬†

Qu'est-ce que j'en veux ? J'ai donc h√¢te d'apprendre √† pr√©parer diff√©rents pains et g√¢teaux ou d'apprendre √† utiliser une machine √† expresso (encore mieux si le Latte Art est inclus). Je sais qu'il existe des cours de barista et de p√¢tisserie, mais m√™me si j'en ai envie, je ne peux pas me permettre de payer ces cours, alors je me demandais s'il y avait d'autres moyens d'acqu√©rir cette exp√©rience et j'ai pens√© √† celui-ci. Donc si quelqu'un souhaite avoir une aide suppl√©mentaire dans son caf√©/restaurant/boulangerie/p√¢tisserie (par exemple pour nettoyer la cuisine/les plats/les tables, prendre les commandes, sortir les poubelles ou autre) m√™me si c'est ¬´ gratuitement ¬ª, vous pouvez me le faire savoir ! Une chose que je tiens √† pr√©ciser, c'est que m√™me si j'ai h√¢te d'apprendre √† faire de la p√¢tisserie et √† pr√©parer toutes sortes de caf√©s (encore mieux avec Latte Art), je ne m'attends pas √† ce que ce soit comme un cours professionnel √† plein temps, je sais que quelque chose comme √ßa prend beaucoup de temps et d'efforts √† enseigner (la m√™me chose vaut pour la pr√©paration et la cuisson des pains/g√¢teaux/cookies/etc).¬† Je serai donc plus qu'heureux si c'est quelque chose de basique.

¬†

Je maintenant suis un b√©nevol√© dans un food court mais je veux autres taches comme ceux que j'ai mention√©. Il n y a pas de machine espresso et est interdit que les b√©n√©voles utilisent le friteuse/four.

¬†

Sorry if this counts as ‚Äúsolicitation‚Äù it‚Äôs not my intention, I just want to see which places/people might be able to take my application.

¬†

Hello! So i was wondering if any of you in this sub is either a business owner or knows a business that I can send my application. I used to do walk in or just apply online and surprisingly I got interviews! The best season was September. I got interviewed in places like Starbucks (2 times), Second Cup, Mandy‚Äôs, Tommy Caf√© and a few other independent business but none hired me :( 

Well I got ‚Äúhired‚Äù in one caf√© brunch and worked there for 3 days and they later just told me that when there is more customers they will call me again, I go sometimes but same answer. And no those 3 days have not been paid.

¬†A little background, I‚Äôm an international student and thankfully I only have classes at the evening/night meaning that I have the whole day free. So right now I am looking for a part time job.

I have experience in commercial cleaning for 1 year and 8 months of experience in customer service (volunteerings).

Where do I look to work for? Taking into account my previous experience I am looking to work in any job that is relatable to this.

I am really working to work unpaid? Yes I am! but not let‚Äôs put it that way. I can just say I am looking for work as a volunteer.

Where exactly I would work as a volunteer? I would love to work in the food (restauration) industry and do my career in this industry, specially in coffee shops/pastries/bakeries.

¬†

What do I expect if I work like this? So what I am looking forward to learn specially is how to prepare different breads and cakes or specially learn how to use an espresso machine (even better if Latte Art is included). I am aware that there are Barista and Baking courses but as much as I want, I can not afford to go to those courses so I was wondering if there are other ways to get said experience and I thought on this one. So if anyone would like to have like an extra help in their caf√©/restaurant/bakery/pastry (for example in cleaning the kitchen/dishes/tables, taking orders, taking the trash out or something else) even if it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor free‚Äù you can let me know! One thing I want to be clear about is that despite I look forward to learn to bake and to prepare all kinds of coffee (even better with Latte Art) I \*do not\* expect that this going to be like a full time professional course, I know something like this takes a lot of time and effort to teach (the same thing goes towards preparing and baking breads/cakes/cookies/etc). ¬†So I will be more than happy if it‚Äôs something basic.

¬†

I am currently volunteering in a food court and a foodbank which has been amazing! But unfortunately there is no espresso machine and volunteers aren‚Äôt allowed to bake, so I am looking for other alternatives.

Some may seem harmless at first, but over time, they can drain energy, motivation, and overall health. Recognizing these habits and actively working to replace them with better ones can lead to significant improvements in well-being and productivity.

One common habit that holds people back is constantly trying to meet the expectations of others at the expense of their own dreams. When people prioritize others' needs over their own, they often end up feeling drained and unfulfilled. It is important to set boundaries and recognize that saying no to things that do not align with personal goals is not selfish but necessary for growth.

Another major obstacle is the tendency to delay taking action. Many people wait for the ""perfect time"" to start something, whether it be a new project, a healthier lifestyle, or a personal goal. However, time does not wait, and delaying action only prolongs stagnation. The best approach is to start, even in small steps, and build momentum from there. Progress is made through consistency, not perfection.

Sleep is often sacrificed in the pursuit of productivity, but neglecting rest has serious consequences on physical and mental health. Establishing a regular sleep routine, preferably going to bed before 10 p.m. and waking up with natural light, can enhance energy levels, cognitive function, and overall well-being. Prioritizing rest is a non-negotiable aspect of a balanced and successful life.

Many people begin and end their days consumed by their phones. Checking social media and notifications first thing in the morning can hijack attention and set a reactive tone for the day. Instead, starting the morning with natural light, movement, and a clear mind allows for a more intentional and productive start. Similarly, avoiding screens before bed improves sleep quality and mental clarity.

Excessive caffeine consumption is another habit that can lead to long-term energy depletion. While coffee provides a temporary boost, relying on it too much keeps the body in a constant stress response. A better approach is to hydrate first in the morning and delay caffeine intake by at least an hour. Additionally, limiting coffee consumption in the afternoon helps regulate energy levels and prevents sleep disturbances.

Physical activity is essential for maintaining health, yet many people neglect movement as they age. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, from muscle stiffness to chronic illness. Engaging in daily movement, whether through walking, stretching, or an enjoyable physical activity, keeps the body strong and prevents premature aging.

Breaking these habits requires self-awareness and commitment. While change is not always easy, making gradual improvements in these areas can lead to lasting benefits. Identifying and replacing energy-draining habits with positive routines will create a stronger foundation for long-term success and well-being.",1,1738609606.0,Dietandhealth,0,1.0,False

Some may seem harmless at first, but over time, they can drain energy, motivation, and overall health. Recognizing these habits and actively working to replace them with better ones can lead to significant improvements in well-being and productivity.

One common habit that holds people back is constantly trying to meet the expectations of others at the expense of their own dreams. When people prioritize others' needs over their own, they often end up feeling drained and unfulfilled. It is important to set boundaries and recognize that saying no to things that do not align with personal goals is not selfish but necessary for growth.

Another major obstacle is the tendency to delay taking action. Many people wait for the ""perfect time"" to start something, whether it be a new project, a healthier lifestyle, or a personal goal. However, time does not wait, and delaying action only prolongs stagnation. The best approach is to start, even in small steps, and build momentum from there. Progress is made through consistency, not perfection.

Sleep is often sacrificed in the pursuit of productivity, but neglecting rest has serious consequences on physical and mental health. Establishing a regular sleep routine, preferably going to bed before 10 p.m. and waking up with natural light, can enhance energy levels, cognitive function, and overall well-being. Prioritizing rest is a non-negotiable aspect of a balanced and successful life.

Many people begin and end their days consumed by their phones. Checking social media and notifications first thing in the morning can hijack attention and set a reactive tone for the day. Instead, starting the morning with natural light, movement, and a clear mind allows for a more intentional and productive start. Similarly, avoiding screens before bed improves sleep quality and mental clarity.

Excessive caffeine consumption is another habit that can lead to long-term energy depletion. While coffee provides a temporary boost, relying on it too much keeps the body in a constant stress response. A better approach is to hydrate first in the morning and delay caffeine intake by at least an hour. Additionally, limiting coffee consumption in the afternoon helps regulate energy levels and prevents sleep disturbances.

Physical activity is essential for maintaining health, yet many people neglect movement as they age. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, from muscle stiffness to chronic illness. Engaging in daily movement, whether through walking, stretching, or an enjoyable physical activity, keeps the body strong and prevents premature aging.

Breaking these habits requires self-awareness and commitment. While change is not always easy, making gradual improvements in these areas can lead to lasting benefits. Identifying and replacing energy-draining habits with positive routines will create a stronger foundation for long-term success and well-being.",1,1738609434.0,menshealth,0,1.0,False

1igwxnd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1igwxnd,A few photos from my LA to San Diego-ish minitour,"This was a fun little 4 day tour I took to escape the Seattle gloom last week.

Landed around 10 at LAX, assembled my bike, and reached my camp site at Crystal Grove State Park in Laguna Beach by 3 or so that evening. Bicycling in LA wasn't as bad as I remember, but it was still a culture shock as a visitor from a far more bike friendly city. I don't think I encountered a single bike lane between LAX and the LA River bike path, and I didn't see a single other cyclists on the street!

The next day I roughly followed the Pacific Coast Highway south past San Clemente. There were bike paths for a good portion of that ride, but I got a little confused because one bike path lead directly into a fenced off portion of Camp Pendleton. There were a few very strict no trespassing signs, but a local cyclists told me we were allowed to use the path so I biked with him for a few miles. Eventually that path dead ended at one of the Western entrances to Camp Pendleton and I had to jump on the 5 expressway for a few miles. My camp that night was near the Torrey Pines nature preserve.

A note on camping: I was using a very minimal setup - drop cloth, sleeping pad, quilt, and inflatable pillow. Even though the days were in the upper 70s and low 80s the nights got super cold, especially because I usually ended up camping near water to avoid visitors. On my first and second nights camping I woke up by 5 each morning very cold. Not enough to be in danger, but definitely cold enough that I would bring a tent if I did this ride again next January.

On the morning of day three I did a quick visit to San Diego's North Park neighborhood for the most hipster-ass coffee I could find. Again I was struck by the lack of bike lanes. City planners in southern California seem to see bicycles as a leisure activity, so there are great bike lanes by the water but rarely any lanes that would protect bicycle commuters or easily connect different neighborhoods. It's a shocking change from Seattle where the vast majority of my riding time is spent in protected bike lanes no matter where in the city I'm traveling to (on my 16 mile work commute I only spend 3 miles sharing the road with no bike lanes at all).

From North Park in Seattle I bicycled towards the town of Ramona northeast of San Diego. This was a short easy ride, with the highlight being Wildcat Canyon road, a 15 mile ride with almost no car traffic past California's oldest dam. In Ramona I got a hotel room for the night because temperatures this far inland were going to be in the mid-30s overnight.

The next morning I was met by my LA bike friends Nyle and Akeem (they were also my ride back to LA!). They had a gravel [route](https://strava.app.link/bOEaFTg0GQb) picked out and we spent the day on having a blast with it. Probably the best day of gravel riding in my life TBH - started with easy gravel fire roads, then turned into a fully dirt BMX and ATV course, and then finished with the prettiest singletrack of my life along the Pomo Valley. Definitely a challenge on 38mm semi-slick tires!

We drove back to LA that evening, and I woke up Sunday to torrential rain. Which was probably for the best as I was feeling sore and biked-out. Spent the day doing touristy stuff, packed up my bike that evening, and flew back to Seattle on the 7am flight.

Absolutely fantastic trip. (I'm the guy cheesing in in the last photo).",25,1738609380.0,bikepacking,1,0.96,False

1igwxc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1igwxc1/completed_first_week_of_adf/,Completed first week of ADF,"F 33 6‚Äô2‚Äù SW: 192 CW:188 GW 170-165

TL;DR:
Fasted M-W-F, ate near TDEE on other days. Hunger was manageable but strongest in the evenings. Sleep was a bit rough on fasting days. Had some GI distress, likely from electrolytes not being dialed in. Lost 4lbs, would like to continue to see a weightloss of 2 pounds weekly. Will continue ADF for the foreseeable future, with the possibility of including some longer fasts on occasion.

So I just wrapped up my first full week of ADF and overall it was a really positive experience. My main goal is weight loss, but I also really wanted to introduce some much needed structure and mindfulness to my routine. After a holiday season of eating all the things and spending way too much on takeout, I figured it was time to buckle down and get back on track.

How I Structured the Week:
Fasting Days (M-W-F): I drank coffee with a splash of milk, the occasional Diet Coke, tea at night, and tons of water with electrolytes.

Eating Days (T-Th-Sat): Ate near my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), sticking to whole foods and avoiding takeout.

Sunday: OMAD to transition back into the fasting cycle smoothly.

Exercise: Strenuous Pilates reformer workouts on Tuesday & Thursday.

What Went Well:
Hunger was manageable ‚Äì It came in waves, mostly around my usual mealtimes, but it wasn‚Äôt unbearable. Evenings were the hardest, but I expected that.

No takeout or junk food ‚Äì Kept it all whole foods, which made me feel better overall.

Pilates workouts felt good ‚Äì No significant drop in performance, which was a relief.

Energy was solid when hydrated/electrolytes were on point ‚Äì When I stayed consistent with water & electrolytes, I felt fine.

Challenges & What Needs Adjusting:
GI distress was real ‚Äì Easily the worst part of the week. I think my electrolytes weren‚Äôt dialed in properly, so I‚Äôll be tweaking that moving forward.

Sleep struggled on fasting days ‚Äì It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but I definitely found it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep when fasting.

Energy levels fluctuated ‚Äì Sometimes I felt totally fine, others I felt sluggish, which I think ties back to hydration & electrolytes.

Background & Why I‚Äôm Doing This:
I‚Äôve done keto/low-carb in the past, along with intermittent fasting (OMAD, 16:8), and had success with weight loss before. But after gaining some weight over the holidays and generally feeling out of control with my habits (food, spending, and exercise), I knew I needed something more structured. ADF seemed like a great fit.

Plan Moving Forward:
Stick with ADF for the foreseeable future and fine-tune my approach.

Focus on dialing in electrolytes to help with GI issues & energy levels.

Maybe attempt a 48-hour fast in February and see how that feels.

If things go well, I might experiment with longer fasts down the line.

Overall, it was a solid first week. Definitely some things to tweak, but I feel good about continuing. If anyone has tips for managing electrolytes or sleep on fasting days, I‚Äôd love to hear them.",2,1738609358.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I've been trying to write this post for a week now because there is so much I want to try and say. So much background and context I want to cram into a couple-hundred words, but lack the ability to adequately convey all the details without massive digressions and long tangents.The long and short of all I want to say is this:  
A sense of connection and community, shared in physical space, can save lives. Especially now. Especially when so much of our digital world and its media landscape is drowning in fear and run on anxiety and quick emotional highs.

I know this is true, because I have lived it. I have also seen and been a part of it from the sidelines. In these times, community, even when it's just friends meeting over coffee, cards, or coding, is resistance to all of this chaos. It can be the thing that encourages people to take a stand with their family, reach out to a friend who has been drifting away, or stand up to injustice working its way into their workplace. So many posts in these past two weeks have made mention of community and social groups: finding and starting them, their importance to history, and how they connect us to each other **outside of the internet.** They are just a footnote to all of the much bigger issues swirling around the media maelstrom at the moment, but if there's one thing I know better than anything on the list of resistance activities, it's how to build, run, and maintain a social group. Also: I'm betting I'm not the only one here. Even if the only group you've ever run or been part of is your DnD group for the last five years, the fact that it's been going this long means you've learned a thing or two and probably have valuable advice to share.

Now, you may balk at the thought of starting an activism group, or feel like you don't have the time or the skillset to run a community garden or sports league, even if you feel a calling to, and that's fine. The big, important things, really do grow from the small silly ones. Because running a successful group, that uplifts and encourages its membership has less to do with *what* the group does, and everything to do with *how* the group does it. If what you have the energy and the headspace for right now is a book club that meets in your favourite cafe every Tuesday, then go for it. A community, when it runs, builds itself up. My current Yoga instructor started coming to our Wednesday sessions on the beach, ran a session on Yoga which became the catalyst for her to start teaching classes at a studio in town. I have friends who have met partners, or been inspired to change careers, or start their own communities, found new hobbies. . . Hell, right this minute, as I am typing, I'm arranging an easter camping trip with a friend who was born on another continent. A community does not need to aim to change the world in order to change the world.

So, Witches, what is your social group and how long has it been going? What do you feel is the thing that holds it together and makes it special? How has being a part of your community benefitted you and those around you?

Or, what is the one you would start if you could? What feels difficult or challenging about that? What's the biggest thing standing in your way right now? How can *this* community help you get started on that journey today?

I'm off to work now and will be sans-phone for most of the day, but I'll be in and out when I can. Just remember: a focus on connection first and the person across from us over any specific goal is what matters most. Great things come from *that.*",9,1738608931.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,2,1.0,False

I've always used z-clips or slotted holes for my builds to compensate for wood movement.  Is this just a bad design or are there use cases where this is acceptable?

1igwodr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1igwodr/ribbon_man/,Ribbon Man,"There was an official name for the site. The one used in all the paperwork and reports.


Unofficially, we just called it the Bramble Barrow.


A couple of campers far off any beaten path had discovered it completely by chance. They'd been trying to find a way around the thick, thorny growth they'd found themselves in when one tripped over something sticking up from the ground. That something turned out to be the peak of a buried structure, which led to phone calls and police tape and, eventually, us.


I was part of a hybrid American/Scandinavian (leaving it intentionally vague) group of archeology grad students who, through some string pulling and a renowned department head willing to oversee us, landed the job of uncovering the site. At the time, it felt like we'd won the lottery. We'd been to numerous excavations over the years, but always as visitors, still learning the ropes. This one was going to be *ours*. The perfect final project before we graduated into full fledged archeologists.


The first order of business was clearing away the underbrush. There was a lot of it, a whole wirey, tangled blanket that had grown for so long, the branches had become interlocked, turning it all to one, unruly plant hellbent on fighting us off with long, bristling thorns. Because we couldn't be sure how deeply the structure was buried, or if anything of value might be scattered at varying depths around it, we were forced to contend with the bramble by hand, carefully carving our way through with chainsaws, hatchets, and machetes. We spent an equal amount of time clearing the plants and pulling stinging thorns from ourselves. The clothes we wore didn't matter; they had a nasty habit of finding their way down to flesh.


Eventually we hit barren soil and the digging could begin. What started as a peak oh-so-gradually formed into the stone frame of a barrow opening.


Or what should have been an opening.


Where we expected to find a door, there was only a wall of solid stone. 


‚ÄúWhat do you make of this?‚Äù Pierce, another American I'd known since our first year of university, beckoned me over to the portion of the barrow he'd been working on.


I followed his pointing finger to a symbol carved deeply into a rock. It resembled a hook with a trio of lines scored across it and a circle around its straight end. 


‚ÄúI'm not sure. I don't think I've seen this before.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat's about to change really quickly.‚Äù


He waved his hand up and down the wall, showcasing the same symbol etched over and over again across the stones.


We called over one of the Scandinavian crew members, Inka, we knew to have a special interest in runes and religious symbols, but even she didn't immediately recognize it and took photos to look it up once we were back on campus.


It took weeks of painstaking labor, but we eventually uncovered the whole of the Bramble Barrow‚Äôs entrance and could finally begin chipping our way to its interior. 


There are certain grave goods we expect to find in a tomb like this: weapons, remnants of fur and linen, bones from sacrificed animals, whatever the deceased needed to make their way in the afterlife. We quickly deduced this particular person had either been incredibly frugal and those that buried him respected that lifestyle in death, or he'd been denied even the bare necessities. The latter didn't make much sense since a burial place such as this was usually reserved for respected members of Viking society, but all we found when we first glimpsed the inner chamber was a raised stone platform upon which lay its sole, shroud-wrapped inhabitant and a collection of sealed pottery.


‚ÄúMore symbols all over, especially around the body,‚Äù Pierce said, breaking the tomb's centuries old silence.


‚ÄúI see Mjolnir repeated from here, along with elhaz and uruz,‚Äù Inka said. ‚ÄúProtection, mostly. A warrior, maybe?‚Äù


I shrugged, intrigued and excited. ‚ÄúLet's get some more light in here and find out.‚Äù


***


We called him Ribbon Man. 


Not immediately, but after we saw him for what he was.


He was extremely well preserved, wisps of his pale hair peeking out from beneath his shroud, which covered all of him except his sunken face, which retained its eyelashes, sparse and fine, but still there on his closed lids. His visible skin, though dehydrated and fragile, was intact, giving a very rough approximation of who he'd once been.


We left him in his original burial wrapping, which we realized was painted with more of the hooks, runes, and Thor's famous hammer, and carefully prepared him for the long journey back to campus. 


Half of our group remained on site to continue the dig while the rest of us accompanied the deceased to the lab, where we could barely contain our excitement. The odds of finding such a specimen were astronomically against us, yet here we were, sitting around a discovery upon which we could stake our names and build our careers. What previously unknown secrets might we unveil? What could he tell us about his society? About himself? I stared at the crate containing him all the way back to the city.


I had the honor of peeling the shroud with a surgeon's care from his body. One layer, two, three. Thirteen. Every one decorated with the same symbols. It had been affixed tightly around him, like a baby's swaddling, Pierce said, if the mother was tired of hearing it cry. Not a description I would have used myself, but he wasn't wrong.


Finally I reached the last layer. 


I unwound it from around his head, revealing a thin braid of blonde hair. My colleagues rolled him gently to and fro, allowing me to reveal more and more of him. 


Laid out before us, fully nude and without any ornamentation, we saw them. The thin cuts running up and down his leathery skin. It was unlike anything any of us, including our department head who was supervising, had ever seen.


‚ÄúIt's all very uniform,‚Äù Inka said, leaning in so close her respirator almost touched the arm she was studying. ‚ÄúIt must be ceremonial.‚Äù


‚ÄúAn empty chamber and sliced up skin,‚Äù I mused aloud. ‚ÄúMaybe he was a sacrifice?‚Äù


‚ÄúThe edge there is curled,‚Äù Inka pointed out. ‚ÄúIt looks like‚Ä¶like it can be peeled back?‚Äù


We debated briefly before I took the tweezers from my sterile tray. We agreed if there was any resistance, I would stop immediately, but the skin was all too ready to come away the moment I gave it the tiniest, most cautious tug. It unfurled into a strip, still attached at the underside of the arm.


Like a piece of weathered, ancient parchment, the interior was scrawled over with black runes.


We traded mystified frowns. Our supervisor took the tweezers, ushered me aside, and began peeling skin as I had the shroud.


By the time he was finished, the corpse's skin looked like so many ribbons stretched out around it. 


‚ÄúWhat do they say?‚Äù Pierce asked softly. 


Not even our supervisor, an expert in the Viking Era and fluent in its language, could say. 


We stayed late into the night, documenting everything we could, trading theories, determining who we might call for insight. I don't recall who coined the name, but it took no time at all before we were calling him ‚ÄúRibbon Man‚Äù. It was exhilarating and exhausting and, by the time we were forced from the lab, my head was swimming. 


All the way back to my apartment, I thought of the Ribbon Man and his partially flayed flesh. The messages contained within. Instead of providing answers, every new discovery only deepened the mystery. Questions burst like fireworks in my mind, but instead of fading, they hung in the air, bright and burning, overlapping into an indecipherable jumble. I doubted right up until my head hit the pillow that I would get any sleep. 


It came immediately, but it was shallow, and while hovering between awake and sleep, the shadows at the foot of my bed seemed to shift into a sunken face with bottomless black sockets. In my daze, uncertain, but nervous to the point of goosebumps, I curled my legs slowly toward me, trying to determine if the dark was playing further tricks on me or if there really were long, bony fingers curling around my footboard. Grave-cold air swirled up my legs, chilling me even through my blankets, and I lurched for my light, only to reveal my small studio apartment as it always was, and me its only inhabitant. I scoffed at myself for allowing my excitement to bring Ribbon Man home with me.


Despite such a poor night's rest, I was up at dawn and eager to return to campus to continue unraveling the Ribbon Man.


‚ÄúHey, you ok?‚Äù Pierce asked when he joined me an hour later, cup of coffee from a nearby shop in hand.


‚ÄúFine, just didn't get much sleep.‚Äù


‚ÄúOk, but what's that have to do with your leg?‚Äù


‚ÄúMy leg?‚Äù I looked down to see splotches of red standing out brightly against the light fabric of my pants. I tugged the cuff up to see a shallow cut seeping along my ankle. ‚ÄúShit, must have snagged it on something. I was in a rush this morning and wasn't paying attention to much of anything except getting back here. Didn't even notice.‚Äù


‚ÄúNeed a bandaid?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt looks like it's stopped bleeding. I'll just clean it up after I finish cataloging these pictures.‚Äù


It was easy to forget about something so trivial when there was so much to get done in the day ahead. There were samples to be taken, x-rays to perform, and endless write ups to muscle through. I loved every minute of it to the point of obsession.


To the point I was still working after everyone else went home. 


I hardly noticed how quiet the lab became once I was on my own. My Walkman was keeping me company while I studied results of some tests we'd run on fibers pulled from Ribbon Man.


The first brush of cold air across the back of my neck, exactly like the one that had crept over me in my bed, was shaken off a stray breeze from a fan left on in one of the offices.


The second, close enough to disturb my hair, made me tear my headphones off and spin on my stool. 


The lab was empty except for me and Ribbon Man.


He was on the table, same as always, tendrils of skin spread out like a grisly flower in bloom. I shook my head, suddenly overtaken by a yawn, and stood to stretch. I hadn't realized how stiff I'd become, bunched up on my stool. 


‚ÄúGuess I should get going,‚Äù I said aloud, growing uncomfortably aware of the silence surrounding me.


The lab seemed bigger when I was the only one in it. The lights, harsher against the tile floors and avocado green metal cabinets. Though it made me feel silly to do so, I hurriedly put away my files and grabbed my Walkman to leave, only to jerk to a halt as I passed Ribbon Man.


One of the petals of flesh, all of which had been covered in runes, was blank. 


More disturbing, Ribbon Man's lids were open, revealing vacant, black sockets.


The walk back to my apartment gave me time to talk myself down from the panic that had seemed so imminent in the lab. A change in air pressure could explain the relaxing lids. It was possible not *every* strip of skin had writing on it, I'd just been fixated on those that did. It all seemed fairly obvious out in the clear night with cars trundling by and lights glowing in so many windows. Since when was I the superstitious sort? I‚Äôd been on numerous excavations and examined more than one corpse; none of it had ever bothered me. I was just glad no one had been there to see me spook myself. 


Sleep that night was more tenuous than the one before. I tossed and turned, dreams spinning relentlessly through my head. *He* was in all of them, standing in my room, his skin hanging like swishing ribbons from his body. His footsteps were slow and stiff as he approached my bed, like he could barely get his legs to shuffle forward. He leaned over me like I had leaned over him, his ribbons dangling across my face as his empty gaze bored into me.


I froze, limbs stretched and stiff, muscles taut and heart pounding in my ears.


I couldn't move as he staggered to my leg and took hold of my ankle, a prisoner to him or perhaps only sheer terror. I couldn't scream as he tilted his head back and reached into his gaping mouth, extracting a narrow blade from deep in his throat between his thumb and forefinger. I couldn't do anything at all as he cut along my flesh and peeled it in strips up to my knee.


He hunched low over my carved leg. With the same knife, he pierced his desiccated tongue through and used the blood (blood that he shouldn't have had in his body) dripping from its tip to begin drawing runes upon the inside of my flayed skin. When he was done, he spat a thick, foul smelling wad on the flesh and folded it back into place.


I woke with a short scream that almost hit the same pitch as the telephone ringing from the kitchen. The sun bleeding through my blinds told me exactly who was calling. I must not have set my alarm or, in my weariness, I'd shut it off when it rang, and now I was late. 


I barely gave myself time to pull on my clothes before bolting out the door.


The lab was empty when I arrived, and it was only then I remembered the press conference regarding our find. The rest of the team must have gone without me, unable to wait any longer. I sank on to my stool, head throbbing, eyes dry, mouth full of cotton. Worst was the incessant sting up and down my leg, though when I looked, it appeared to be fine. I attributed it to bug bites and resolved to look for bed bugs when I got home.


My dreams must have been interpreting the bites in the most nightmarish way possible, I told myself, and grabbed the top most file left on the increasingly precarious pile. 


My colleagues had gotten work done while I was sleeping off my nightmares. The most recent document added was a facsimile from a linguistic expert, who recognized the strange text as a cypher based on Elder Futhark, the ancient runic alphabet. The research into its use and full translation were incomplete and, as such, the help she could provide was limited.


She noted references to a transfer or trade, though she couldn't determine what the subject was. She recognized patterns often found in religious contexts, but the exact meanings were a work in progress. Her overall summation was that the text was ceremonial in nature with indications toward some kind of death or burial ritual, but she couldn't be certain beyond that.


Her notes obviously mentioned Ribbon Man as the source, but the notes continued, stating no other finding bore the same markings. Curious as to what she was referring to, I flipped the page to a list of the pottery discovered alongside him in the Bramble Barrow.


I'd forgotten all about it.


A chill dragged along the back of my neck. My skin prickled.


I turned the page again, to the grainy, black and white photos attached with exhibit numbers.


A pottery jar in each photo, and beside them, stretched out with careful precision and held in place along the furled edges with specimen pins, was skin. Human skin. Intact, retaining the shape of the body they'd been cut from, but every few inches, it was cut into strips, like ribbons.


An unfolded flap showed it free of any cyphered text.


She concluded by saying the runes upon the door, walls, and shroud were protection and wards ‚Äì svefnthorn, what I had thought of as a hook, was a symbol used to imbue sleep upon an enemy, Mjolnir, the hammer wielded by Thor, protector of humanity ‚Äì and their placement indicated they were being used to keep something *in*, not out.


I sank on to the stool, flipping back and forth between the Ribbon Man report, the pottery, the symbols. There was a nagging thought at the back of my mind, one I couldn't immediately identify, but that was growing from a whisper to a roar.


I stared at the photo of the Ribbon Man, far less detailed on paper than he was on the table behind me, then at the skin found within the pottery.


*Transfer or trade*


*Death or burial*


*Keeping something in, not out*


I could hardly swallow past the fear lodged as a lump in my throat as the roar took shape into an impossible terror.


It was only the dreams making me so irrational, I tried to tell myself. I was connecting dots that weren't there.


But the more I tried to dispel this insane notion that was coming together inside me, the more my leg ached with a fiery, stinging pain, until I threw the reports aside and stood, fingers clenched in my hair. I paced in a limping, zigzagging line, each one bringing me closer to Ribbon Man. I stopped next to his table, gripping its edge and muttering at how crazy I was becoming. What this obsession was doing to me.


I was just overtired. The nightmares were taking a toll.


I'd been working too much, going from the field where conditions were always rough straight to endless hours in the lab.


I was‚Äì


A row of the Ribbon Man's strips of skin were unmarked, plain flesh. 


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I uttered, touching them bare handedly, suddenly unaware of protocol and preservation. ‚ÄúThere was‚Ä¶.there was text. There weren't this many blank!‚Äù


His empty sockets stated upward, abyssal black and bottomless.


In the corner of his mouth, caught in the deep crease around his withered lips, was a dried speck of something thick and dark. 


I reeled back, yanking up my pant leg. There was no way. It was only a nightmare! My leg was fine! I propped it up on the stool and ran my fingers over my shin. It was normal, completely fine‚Ä¶.


My nail caught.


The skin pulled.


The slice was so fine, I almost didn't see it, even with the tip of my pinky nail wedged in it.


I looked at the Ribbon Man, lying still and staring, then at my leg.


I bit down on a bunched up towel to muffle my screams when I made the first incision, following the guideline already laid out in my skin. It took some searching, but I found a second only inches away. The room had dropped to an icy cold temperature, but sweat poured down my face and back. I gasped, panting into the towel, tears spilling down my cheeks, and cut again.


Nausea hit first when I pinched the tattered edges, the lines no longer precise and so clean as to be invisible. Then my vision dotted with stars and I thought I might pass out. I swayed, leaning heavily against the counter beside me, and swallowed hard. Bile fumes filled my mouth.


I peeled.


Dark runes were etched on the inside of my flesh.


*Transfer or trade*


The words from the report repeated over and over again. 


*He* was doing this to me. 


The blank, ribboned skin found in the pottery flashed through my mind.


He'd done it before. Until he was caught. Until he was sealed with his prior victims in the Bramble Barrow.


Until we tore through everything meant to stop us, all the warnings, and freed him.


My stomach boiled almost to the tipping point. I gagged, head pounding with my erratic heartbeat. 


What he was, whatever was *in* him, wanted out. 


I couldn't let it.


There was no muffling my screams when I hacked off the skin of my leg, revealing muscle and tendon beneath and spilling pools of blood across the tiles. Clutching the marked strips of my own body, I hauled myself to my feet, intent on finding matches or a lighter. Anything I could use to destroy the Ribbon Man.


‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù


Someone caught me under my arms and I was suddenly looking up at my department head's face, drawn into a horrified frown. Behind him, my fellow students fanned out in a concerned, whispering line.


‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù I struggled against his grip, weak with blood loss. ‚ÄúWe have to burn him!‚Äù


‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù


‚ÄúCall an ambulance!‚Äù


‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶skin?‚Äù


Their voices were too loud, yet strangely distant. I shook my head, still fighting, and waved the strips of my skin overhead.


‚ÄúLook! He's alive! He was trying to possess me!‚Äù


Their confused, scared expressions made no sense. Couldn't they see the writing? Wasn't it clear?


I looked at the flesh clutched in my fist, ready to spread it out like parchment for them, but I found there was nothing to show. No ink. No runes. Only torn skin. I whirled, dragging my department head with me.


Ribbon Man lay on the table, eyes closed, ribbons spread all around. Every one of them covered in runes.",6,1738608773.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called ‚Äòyuen-yeung‚Äô, sir,‚Äù Captain Robert Ho, III handed over the thermos while correcting him. ‚ÄúHow many times do I gotta tell you that?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Matt loved the Hongkonger drink, made from mixing equal parts coffee and tea. ‚ÄúHmmmm, what‚Äôd you use this time? Not Ceylonese, I know that for sure.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYunnanese, because Jonas wouldn‚Äôt shut up about it,‚Äù Bob said with mocked annoyance.  
  
‚ÄúHawk Lead to Hawk Two, come in, over,‚Äù Matt went on the radio.  
  
‚Äú*Hawk Two, go ahead, over,*‚Äù Captain Jonas Tsung-ming Tsai answered from¬†*Pu‚Äôerh Paula*, currently on their starboard.  
  
‚ÄúThanks for the leaf, Hawk Two. It was good.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú*My pleasure, sir. Have you given any thoughts to the proposal?*‚Äù  
  
The proposal was about a beverage company - specialising in tea, obviously - where the entire 18th Group from pilots to mechanics would be shareholders. There was no shortage of interested persons, but it needed an initial infusion of capital to get things started.  
  
Naturally, Matt and Bob, both scions of prominent families, became Jonas‚Äô main focus in his recruitment campaign.  
  
‚ÄúThe answer is the same, Captain Tsai: I‚Äôll let you know if I don‚Äôt die. Hawk Lead, out.‚Äù Matt signed off and turned to Bob. ‚ÄúPersistent little shit, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPersistent enough that I‚Äôm inclined to say yes,‚Äù Bob nodded.  
  
‚ÄúYou looked at the plan?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI did. Did you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, ‚Äù Matt took a deep breath and made his decision. ‚ÄúAh, what the hell, I‚Äôll need a new job when this is over.‚Äù  
  
Bob pumped his fist in the air.  
  
‚ÄúBut,‚Äù Matt added. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre doing this, we‚Äôre gonna do it right. I‚Äôm bringing Madame Chiang on board. We can use the backing, financially or otherwise.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo arguments from me.‚Äù  
  
That was the moment when the radio came to life.  
  
‚Äú*Tallyho, tallyho! Multiple bandits, eleven o‚Äôclock! Red Leader, engaging!*‚Äù a Szechuan-accented voice called out.  
  
‚ÄúGo get‚Äôem, Steinway,‚Äù Matt, at 31 confirmed kills, said with a hint of envy.  
  
‚ÄúYou think he‚Äôs gonna get his 100th kill?‚Äù Bob asked.  
  
‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt stop trying, that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù Matt commented before going on the radio. ‚ÄúHawk Lead to all Hawks, watch your spacing. Be ready to take evasive actions.‚Äù

I noticed he wasn't wearing socks. He then places both his feet on the sofa, and I immediately notice a super strong scent that smelled similar to cat piss. I move from the sofa and my friend notices it was due to the strong smell. She confronts me on that and I tell her he should wear socks. She answered he was in a hurry that day and didn't have time to put them on. Finally she said that I offended her by moving off the sofa treating her son like someone that stinks lol.

1igweyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1igweyf/what_exactly_are_you_incentivizing/,What *Exactly* Are You Incentivizing?,"
Sorry it's been a while, folks. Nothing notable has happened at the Lacking Tea of late. This story is over a decade old...

Rewards programs! Corporate loves them! What a great way to get folks to come back! Surely there is no way they could ever go wrong!

Of course they go wrong. And stop calling me Shirley.

For those needing a little comfort in these times, Buttercup the Emotional Support Unicorn is over by the coffee station, ready to give love and sparkles to those in need, or just let you unwind brushing and braiding her hair.

So our hotel, like many, *many* others has a rewards program. Standard three tier setup - basic, shiny, and extra shiny. Earn points, get free stays, and feel a sense of entitlement above those with lower membership tiers or the dirt-wallowing troglodytes who aren't members at all.

Corporate wanted all their wonderful guests to get such splendid benefits! (And collect their email and contact information) But people don't just sign up for these programs themselves! 

The burden is passed to the humble FDAs, who have been given the onerous task of asking every. single. guest. if they would like to sign up for the hotel's Rewards Program. However, in typical corporate fashion, it is assumed that the FDAs *could* be working harder at this, that they *could* be signing up a lot more people.

Enter the great and glorious Incentive Program! Reach these sign-up goals and get valuable(ish) prizes, as well as the respect (hah) of your manager! Get a lovely corporate T-shirt, or coffee mug with fifty sign-ups in six week period! Also, fun themes! Posters with Old West themes, or Sportsball, or bunnies! 

So that's the preface, on to the actual story.

Now, some of my clever readers may have already spotted a few flaws with this system. The biggest one is that it is patently unfair. Note that the goals are the same if your hotel is twenty rooms or three hundred. Observe the tracking sheet - did I mention the tracking sheet? - where everyone's weekly totals are shown, shaming those who underperform and praising those who get lots of people to sign up. The morning folks with a handful, the evening folks with three times as many, and the night auditors?

If you guessed we got zero, you get a gold star.

I respect and admire the manager at the time, and he was genuinely good at his job. But this is something we had a bitter argument about. He simply could. not. believe. that I wasn't able to get more than one or two new members a month. I tried to explain that I was trying, but I would see *maybe* one or two guests a night, and they would almost always already be members. He didn't care. Get the numbers up, or risk getting my hours cut. After all, if Brett could get *fifty* a week, why couldn't I?

A word on Brett. He was fairly new, maybe three months or so. Not quite a slacker, but hardly a hard worker either. But somehow he was an absolute wizard at getting people to join our membership program. He was signing up three times more than the rest of us combined! Uncanny! 

This made Brett the manager's golden boy. He could do no wrong, because the manager was getting kudos from the higher ups. Apparently our hotel was in the top five percent for new members (adjusted for hotel size, they weren't complete failures at statistics...). So the manager was getting loads of praise, bonuses, and so forth.

So I tried. I busted my ass. I bothered *everyone* about that damn loyalty program. But I just wasn't seeing anyone during the night shift, and those I did were already signed up. I managed to get about three a week, while Brett was hitting numbers to match the top tier goal *weekly*. 

Again, my clever readers have probably gained an inkling what happened...

I chalked it up to the unfairness of life in general, then I stumbled upon something. At the time, we were having a *big* problem with phantom reservations. It was a method for shady folks to test if a stolen credit card number was still good. Just make a hotel reservation for a few weeks out. This meant we would have a few no-shows with bad cards. Very very annoying. 

This is where the power of a good Night Auditor comes into the light.

This particular night, we had two of them. Sigh. Fine, cancel the reservation, note that the card was declined and... wait a minute... Why does this reservation have a loyalty number? If this is a false reservation, it wouldn't be from a loyalty member. Checking the update log for the reservation, the loyalty number was added that evening, by Brett. They wouldn't have called to add a number, why would...

That was when I realized what had happened. Brett was *cheating*. He was signing up *all* incoming reservations for membership. Every. single. one. The reason nobody else could get any sign-ups was because he had already beaten them to it.

It should be noted that this is *very* much against policy for *all* corporate membershis. I think it may even be illegal in some places to sign someone up for a loyalty program without consent or even asking. Brett would be in *deep* trouble when the manager found out.

Or so I thought.

Remember that because of his 'amazing' prowess at signing up people, Brett was my manager's favorite person. So when I told him what was going on, he reacted with raw hostility. How *dare* I accuse Brett, and claim his 100% success rate was fraudulent! The affrontery! Then he dropped a bombshell: in recognition of Brett's glory, he was getting promoted to Assistant Manager!

I damn near quit on the spot.

Probably should have. But I didn't. I stopped even trying at the incentives. So did everyone else. The chart would be Brett with a few dozen sign-ups, and everyone else showing zeros. We were done.

However, there was a silver lining. Brett did *not* like being Assistant Manager. Way too much actual work. *Thinking* work, at that. He didn't even last a month before he left. No idea where, but presumably something that he could slack off on more.

Corporate finally realized the issues that the incentive program would cause, and quietly discontinued it until they could figure out a better system. My manager was no longer being lauded for his prowess, but was able to climb the corporate ladder to Regional Manager after a while.

And me? I currently am sipping my hot cocoa out of an insulated corporate rewards program mug that Brett left behind. Petty, but delicious. Take some time to say goodbye to Buttercup, and have a wonderful day.

Teal deer; corporate gives rewards to those who hit reward program sign-up goals, so one employee cheats and signs up everyone.

I'm paying $1000 extra for a Grinder. P.A.G.3+ (J8 Twin) and P.A.G.2 (E8). What is the difference in these grinders? Marketing fluff? Will I obtain a greater extraction from my bean? Is there any benefit to this feature worth paying the upgrade?

I had my hormones checked and everything is fine and regular. Not on any medication. I‚Äôm vegetarian so perhaps not getting enough protein. 
I did start a probiotic and read sometimes that causes weight gain. I‚Äôll be quitting that and taking my L-Glutamine. I also have been taking zinc, vitamin D, and L-methylfolate.

I wanted to give you all an **exclusive pre-release look** at some updates we‚Äôre rolling out in our testing methodology before the full video drops [this Friday](https://www.youtube.com/vacuumwars). Since you‚Äôre the experts and enthusiasts who really care about the nitty-gritty details of robot mop performance, I thought you‚Äôd appreciate the full rundown. All of this has dramatically impacted our overall[ best robot vacuum rankings](https://vacuumwars.com/best-vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/) as well.

# The Backstory

Over the past year, I‚Äôve been pretty obsessed with finding an **objective way to test and score robot vacuum‚Äìmop combos** (and even upright electric mops). [I developed a system](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1fkoz8o/best_robot_vacuum_mops_tested_vacuum_wars/) that I‚Äôm still really proud of:

* **Stain Test Setup:** We set up 9 stains on our test floor (4 coffee stains and 5 grape juice stains) with **precisely measured amounts of fluid** using a syringe. Each stain is assigned a points value based on its level of difficulty.
* **Testing Protocol:** Each robot gets **4 attempts** to remove the stains. The points for each run are weighted differently:
* **1st run:** Points √ó 4 **2nd run:** Points √ó 3 **3rd run:** Points √ó 2 **4th run:** Points at face value (We even have a modified version of this test for upright electric mops, which I detailed in a recent video.)

I tested a ton of products using this system over the last few months, and the results dramatically shook up our [top 20 rankings](https://vacuumwars.com/best-vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/) ‚Äì not just for robot vacuums but also for hard floor cleaners. In fact, I even went on record in a recent video stating that, based on our tests, **robot vacuums seemed as good as (if not better than) upright hard floor cleaners** because they‚Äôre automated and require less maintenance, a video I now regret and have since made ""unlisted"".

# The Big Flaw: Water Usage

However, there‚Äôs a major flaw I overlooked early on: **water usage.** Here‚Äôs the issue:

* **The Test Bias:** In our stain removal tests, the more water a unit uses, the better it performs at lifting those stubborn coffee or grape juice marks. But‚Ä¶ More water means more streaks and, ultimately, dirtier-looking floors. This inadvertently creates a perverse incentive for manufacturers to program their robots to **use excessive water** during mopping tests.

# Different Mop Systems:

* **Spinning/Fixed Pads:** These systems aren‚Äôt great with lots of water; too much liquid just spreads around and leaves streaks. They need a **precise balance**‚Äîenough water to clean, but not so much that it leaves a mess.
* **Roller Mops (found on some upright and robot vacuums):** These can use more water because they typically have a squeegee-like action that removes excess water and stores the dirty water onboard.

The problem is that many robots, as previously ranked by Vacuum Wars, might actually be overrated because our tests unintentionally **rewarded high water usage** when they **should have been penalizing it.**

# Our New Approach: Measuring Water Usage

To fix this, I developed an **objective way to score water usage**:

* **Method:** We weighed a paper towel (on a very sensitive scale) **before and after wiping down the surface after** a run on a 4x4 section of the test area. This was done on both the low and max water settings.

# Findings:

* Across 31 robot vacuums, the **average water left behind** was about **1 gram**.Some models (like certain Sharks) left behind as much as **3 grams**.Others, such as the **Samsung and Roborock S8 MaxV**, left almost no water.
* **Frustrating Inconsistencies:** Many robots showed little to no difference between their low and max water settings. For example, the **Roborock Qrevo Curv** recorded 2.1 grams on max and 2.0 grams on low‚Äîbasically, you‚Äôre stuck with too much water either way.Additionally, while individual models (like the Dreame L40) gave consistent water usage numbers (around 1.8 grams over multiple tests), **there was little consistency across a single brand**. The Dreame x40, for instance, consistently used much less water than the L40, as if every model comes with its own ‚Äúwater setting‚Äù personality.

I‚Äôve spoken directly with some manufacturers, and t**hey agree that this is a firmware issue that could be fixed**

Note: Less water isn‚Äôt automatically better. Some models that use very little water perform poorly at mopping because you need a minimum amount to lift stains. It‚Äôs all about finding that perfect balance.

# Re-Evaluating Upright Hard Floor Cleaners & Roller vs. Pad Systems

We applied the same paper towel weighing method to upright hard floor cleaners. Turns out, they generally use much less water to achieve similar mopping results. This revelation forced me to reconsider my previous claim that robot vacuums are superior moppers. Upright hard floor cleaners do have a consistency edge when it comes to water management.

When it comes to robot vacuums with roller systems, the results are mixed:

* The Eureka J20 and Eufy S1 (both roller systems) ranked #1 and #2, respectively, if you only consider water usage and dried stain test scores.
* However, the 3i S10‚Äîalso with a roller system‚Äîranked near the bottom (#26) using the same metrics.
* **Additional Consideration on Metrics:** When I mention these metrics, I‚Äôm referring solely to water usage and dried stain test scores. If only these two factors were considered, the rankings would look dramatically different from our current top 20 list‚Äîbecause many more factors go into ranking a robot vacuum beyond just mopping performance. For example, our website features a dedicated section that focuses exclusively on mopping data, which includes additional criteria such as the mopping features on an auto-empty bin, the inclusion of lifting pads, whether the mop station has auto-washing capabilities, hot water usage, and more. Essentially, the best mop for dried stains isn‚Äôt necessarily the best overall mop, and that, in turn, isn‚Äôt the same as the best overall robot vacuum.

So while having a roller might help, it‚Äôs not a guaranteed win.

# What‚Äôs Changing Moving Forward

1. I‚Äôve taken down the video where I claimed upright hard floor cleaners weren‚Äôt as good as robot vacuums. They‚Äôre actually a bit better in terms of water management and consistency.

# Updated Testing Methodology:

1. Step 1: Run tests on the max water setting, scoring both stain removal and water usage (with penalties for excessive water).Step 2: Have another tester run the test on medium power, scoring again for stains and water.Additional: An extra water penalty test is done for the low power setting.Result: All scores are averaged, so our new mop rankings reflect the best stain removal with the least water left behind.

The updated algorithm has already radically changed[ our top 20 list](https://vacuumwars.com/best-vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/). Notably, the Roborock Qrevo Curv‚Äîour number one pick for several weeks‚Äîhas now dropped to #5, while the Qrevo Edge has taken the top spot.

# Final Thoughts & Call to Action

If you already own a model that uses too much water, I‚Äôd recommend:

* Sticking to its lowest water setting, and
* Contacting the manufacturer with this video (when it goes live) to request a firmware update that provides a genuinely lower water option.

I‚Äôm committed to continuously improving our testing to help consumers make the most informed decisions possible‚Äîand I appreciate your understanding as we fix our earlier oversight.

Stay tuned for the full video release this Friday, and as always, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and suggestions.

Please note that none of this should be considered definitive, I could have made mistakes, and probably did here too, so take it all with a grain of salt. I know there are anomalies and your guess is as good as mine as to why they exist.

1igvzw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1igvzw5/long_term_depression_and_anxiety_mental_health/,"Long term depression and anxiety, mental health","I have posted on several of these pages over the last 6 months and done a lot of research on my own.  I quit smoking 14 months ago, and am still not feeling mentally well.  I have some depression and anxiety, which I had prior to quitting, and am also on medication for both of those things.  I have had no other life changes, quit smoking cold turkey after 35 years of it.  Mornings are terrible, I don't jump out of bed any more and go to have coffee and smoke, so I am lethargic in the mornings and cannot get out of bed.  I cannot find anything to replace all of that dopamine first thing to start the day.  I have no physical withdrawals from quitting, that ended long ago, it is all just mental.  I don't do as many of the things that I used to enjoy, and don't always want to leave the house due to some sort of anxiety.  I have read and researched about PAWS, not sure if I am dealing with some of that or not.  I have also changed antidepressants as well, and also started a booster to try and help, and it does not seem to be making a difference.  Once again, the ONLY thing that has changed in my life the last 14 months is quitting smoking. I am healthy overall, in my mid 50's, don't drink or use any other type of drugs. There is one thread on reddit that talks about depression and anxiety can last for a couple of years after quitting, and I have often returned to that post to read it again.

Are there a lot of folks out there that have gone through the same things that I am dealing with so long after quitting?  Any tips or suggestions?",4,1738607149.0,stopsmoking,2,0.84,False

I just need help.

I‚Äôm a senior in college. I graduate this December. Since I was young, I‚Äôve struggled a lot with focus, attention, and being on top of the things that I need to do to succeed. I ‚Äúplayed averages‚Äù throughout my entire primary schooling, and that has continued until recently, having been on the precipice of losing my academic scholarships for a while, but barely making it by. I‚Äôve tried planners, sticky notes, whiteboards- anything and everything that would be recommended to someone who might have ADHD. I am actively trying to receive a diagnosis for myself so that I might be able to try adhd medicine, but that‚Äôs a process I need to hold myself to.

Despite all this, there is always SOMETHING. I am doing the things I need to do as per usual, but I am barely making it by. I do not have a car, I do not have money in savings. Between my low hour job and artwork commissions, I am barely making enough money to pay bills. If I was doing commissions faster this would not be an issue, but I‚Äôm not motivated, my work is slow, and I cannot work efficiently. 

I have not brushed my teeth in weeks, I am neglecting using a retainer I pay $90 a month for because I can‚Äôt be bothered to take care of myself before I go to bed, and because I‚Äôve already missed / rescheduled a million appointments for it. My outfits are not coordinated, I only eat one meal a day at dinner time, and the rest of the time I‚Äôm either playing video games or trying to work on artwork

Counseling and therapy is something I can get for free. Despite this, I forget things. I have missed so many appointments that I need to discuss my situation with the director to see if I can even take advantage of that service any more. It‚Äôs pathetic.

Sometimes I feel like I get my life in order, like I have a handle on things, but often times I‚Äôll wake up in the morning to realize I forgot something important the day before, and it sends me into a self hating panic attack that leaves me exhausted and upset for the rest of the day. Perhaps I stopped trying once I realized I would always forget something no matter how hard I try.

I‚Äôm doing the things I need to do to survive, but I feel like I hate myself, and I‚Äôm not happy. I‚Äôve done great things like get published in an academic journal during my time at school, but, it feels meaningless. I‚Äôm taking anti depressants and all those do is stop me from lashing out at my friends and family in an irrational way. Self harm / suicide is not something I would ever want to do, I know things get better, but sometimes I feel the desire to bite myself, or pour boiling water from my coffee onto my arm, because maybe it will finally wake me up.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know where to start. Clearly I need some kind of routine, but every time I‚Äôve tried in the past I can‚Äôt execute it, or I‚Äôll forget something, it feels hopeless.

I have friends and many people I know in real life but I feel like those connections are thin. I have many close online friends of 4+ years that I video call with often, but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm so lonely.

There are people out there (people READING this) who would KILL to be in the spot I am right now. I am privileged, and I know that. I am wasting away any potential I have, and I genuinely, genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. Im scared, and I need advice.",2,1738607137.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1igvzo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubstituteTeachers/comments/1igvzo0/just_getting_this_off_my_chest/,Just getting this off my chest,"Let me say this first: I'm a proud educator, but also terrible at waking up early & getting out of bed. Last week I did the unspeakable... I woke up WHEN school was starting. üò™

It was after a few weeks of getting to assignments only to find out I'm not needed for the first period and just twittling my thumbs, so I guess I got what was coming to me. I rushed getting ready, skipped my shower and coffee and every other routine except clean clothes. It was a multi-day job and luckily I knew I wasn't needed until second period. That much was a sigh of relief!

The front desk secretary who gives me my badge, sub plans, etc, called and asked if I was coming. I mentioned that ""I got a late start on accident, but luckily I'm not needed until second period."" But then she mentioned I needed to be at the school at the right time no matter what (She said 7:15 when Kelly says 7:30... Not sure what that was about).

Flash forward to this morning; I'm intentionally setting my routine to get there at 7:30. Got to bed early and all those things. It's only a 20 minute drive so I leave my front door at 7:10. Except it was 26¬∞F and there was a layer of ice on all my windows... Fml. I spend a few minutes scraping my windshields while my car warms up and head to school. 

It's 7:35, which is late depending on if you think it's a 7:30 OR 7:15 arrival time. So the secretary waves me off to go meet to the assistant principal. He's a young guy‚òÜ like me, and when he talks to me he gently reminds me that I'm supposed to arrive on time. I told him about last week and how it was a total accident, and how today I just had to scrape my car windshield. He seemed to be totally understanding, and gave me the other general reminders to follow teacher guidelines, leave sub notes (which I do both of!) And to let the admin know if there's any way they can help me get my job done better.
‚òÜI'm non binary but I teach in a conservative area so everyone knows me as a guy.

The room I had to go to this morning was locked, and while the secretary was pretty stern with me when I first walked in, she was pretty jokey and lighthearted the second time around. That's a good sign right? 

I genuinely want to give my all to each student and teacher I interact with. But waking up in the morning has never been my Strongsuit. The only thing I fear will get me up in the morning is the looming threat of getting fired üò£

Anyone experience a morning like this before? Do I need to make up for this mistake? Any engagement (That doesn't blatantly bully me) is appreciated!

1igvz7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/maleinfertility/comments/1igvz7t/how_to_deal_with_the_mental_crisis_of_sterility/,How to deal with the mental crisis of sterility?,"TL:DR: how do I deal with having a family with my partner considering my sterility? I feel like I'm in a mental crisis.

This is like the fourth time trying to write this, and just thought, screw it and I need to be done with this.

I (27M) am sterile due to a chromosomal disorder from birth (I am a XO45/46XY mosaic male) and there was always a significant risk that I would be sterile.
Since I was able to comprehend, my mother has been extremely supportive by telling me about my medical condition and I could not have asked for a better mother to support and raise me. I was raised to always be open about my disorder to educate people in how it affects me and those like me, especially when it came to the dating scene.

When I was 17, my endocrinologist suggested that should attempt to harvest any sperm i may have due to that would be the point I would be most fertile and to freeze it until I wanted kids. Unfortunately, after a 6 hour surgery (which is usually 2 but due to the amount of reconstructive scar tissue it took them a lot longer) it was determined that i had no sperm at all - not even germ cells or immature sperm cells. I had to get a biopsy due to not having the pipe work downstairs, if you know what i mean.

After receiving that news, I accepted it for what it was, as that was always the most likely situation and over the next 10 years, i grew up understanding and overall accepting my disorder as a part of who I am, knowing that I will never have my own children or family.

During the dating scene as a young adult with having no success due to being ghosted after stating i cannot have kids, I slowly became contented with loneliness (extra points to you if you know that reference üòâ) and not ever having a family.

Fast forward to about 6 months ago, I caught up with an old friend that her (29F) and i had engaged in high school shenanigans for a coffee and she (29F) bought along her, at the time, 9 month old son. The moment him and I met, he crawled across the coffee table for me to hold him (she stated he has never done that before with a man) and him and I instantly connected with each other.
The second time I met him at her house, her son had fallen asleep on me while she did some house work that she wasn't able to do otherwise, which again was a huge thing.
Due to knowing each other for about 15 years, we hit it off very quickly and quickly got into a relationship with each other.

As the relationship processed, as did her son's speech, as a child does, and he first called me ""dad,"" and it hit me like a ton of bricks, and was probably the first time I ugly cried due to being told ill never be a father to my own children. During that time, all three of us had gotten really close, and his own father is not involved at all due to an active IVO, I have now become the active male role model for my now partners child.
My partner knows about my disorder, and she is the only woman that I have dated that had totally accepted that, and gave discussed how we would grow our little family.
Due to having her own fertility issues (PCOS), we have discussed using IUI and a doner sperm in order to grow our family. My (21M) brother has offered to donate for us so any child in my family will be as genetically mine as possible. I am so grateful to him for this as it means the world to me.

More recently, due to other mental health struggles of my own, I've begun thinking that as much as I want to grow my family, I dont know if I would ever see any subsequent children as my own. I know they aren't mine by blood, and will be on the birth certificate, I fear that I will see them no different than to my partner kid - meaning I will not see them as mine at all. I fear that I will reject them or not care for them as I should.
I want to make it clear that i want nothing more than to continue to go through IUI with my partner, and to grow our family, but at this point, it almost feels to me in my head that my partner is screwing another man and having his child - in know that isn't the case but I can't get that out of my head.
As it is, I already have a hard time with my now 15 month old stepson calling me dad and I feel this will extend to any other child my partner and ""I"" bring into this world.

Although I have basically been conditioned my entire life to accept this as the most likely scenario, I feel like I'm in a mental crisis of fear, anger and sorrow about my future, this current relationship and my now family who I love so dearly as it is.

I am currently actively engaged in psychology services but haven't raised this with my psychologist just yet.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or is this a case of ""suck it up if I want to have a family?""",1,1738607104.0,maleinfertility,1,1.0,False

**Puravive At A Glance:**

Natural Ingredients: Non-GMO, vegetarian, gluten-free.

Boosts Metabolism: Elevates brown adipose tissue (BAT) for fat burning.

Easy to Use: Mixes seamlessly with coffee, tasteless and dissolvable.

Increases Energy: Improves energy levels throughout the day.

**How Does Puravive Work?**

Puravive primarily works by boosting the levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is crucial for burning calories and generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. Research indicates that individuals with higher BAT levels typically maintain lower body weight, as their bodies can effectively convert stored fat into energy. When BAT levels are low, thermogenesis decreases, leading to fat accumulation. By enhancing BAT, Puravive aims to activate thermogenesis, which enables the body to burn fat more efficiently. This mechanism supports healthy weight loss while also promoting overall metabolic health and increased energy levels, making it a powerful addition to a weight management routine.

**Puravive's unique formulation features eight powerful, all-natural ingredients, each playing a vital role in its weight loss effectiveness:**

Luteolin: A natural flavonoid that enhances levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT), promotes thermogenesis, and provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, contributing to overall health.

Kudzu: Traditionally used in herbal medicine, kudzu is known for its antioxidant properties. It boosts BAT levels while promoting cardiovascular and liver health, making it a valuable ingredient.

Holy Basil: Renowned for its stress-relieving effects, holy basil increases BAT concentration, balances blood sugar levels, and rejuvenates the body, supporting holistic well-being.

White Korean Ginseng: This adaptogenic herb is celebrated for its ability to boost energy levels, support fat burning, and enhance cognitive function, helping users stay active and focused.

Amur Cork Bark: A tropical plant that elevates BAT levels while promoting digestive health. It also supports heart and liver function, making it beneficial for overall wellness.

Propolis: A resinous substance rich in over 300 antioxidants, propolis enhances brown fat levels and has demonstrated potential in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes.

Quercetin: A plant flavonoid with strong anti-inflammatory properties that helps improve blood pressure and sugar levels. It also promotes increased BAT, supporting weight management.

Oleuropein: Derived from olive leaf extract, oleuropein aids in weight management, helps balance blood pressure, and enhances heart health, providing a multifaceted approach to wellness.

These ingredients work synergistically to support metabolism, boost energy, and promote healthy weight loss, making Puravive a comprehensive option for those looking to enhance their weight management journey.

**How Does Puravive Work?**

Puravive primarily works by boosting the levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is crucial for burning calories and generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. Research indicates that individuals with higher BAT levels typically maintain lower body weight, as their bodies can effectively convert stored fat into energy. When BAT levels are low, thermogenesis decreases, leading to fat accumulation. By enhancing BAT, Puravive aims to activate thermogenesis, which enables the body to burn fat more efficiently. This mechanism supports healthy weight loss while also promoting overall metabolic health and increased energy levels, making it a powerful addition to a weight management routine.

**Puravive's unique formulation features eight powerful, all-natural ingredients, each playing a vital role in its weight loss effectiveness:**

Luteolin: A natural flavonoid that enhances levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT), promotes thermogenesis, and provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, contributing to overall health.

Kudzu: Traditionally used in herbal medicine, kudzu is known for its antioxidant properties. It boosts BAT levels while promoting cardiovascular and liver health, making it a valuable ingredient.

Holy Basil: Renowned for its stress-relieving effects, holy basil increases BAT concentration, balances blood sugar levels, and rejuvenates the body, supporting holistic well-being.

White Korean Ginseng: This adaptogenic herb is celebrated for its ability to boost energy levels, support fat burning, and enhance cognitive function, helping users stay active and focused.

Amur Cork Bark: A tropical plant that elevates BAT levels while promoting digestive health. It also supports heart and liver function, making it beneficial for overall wellness.

Propolis: A resinous substance rich in over 300 antioxidants, propolis enhances brown fat levels and has demonstrated potential in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes.

Quercetin: A plant flavonoid with strong anti-inflammatory properties that helps improve blood pressure and sugar levels. It also promotes increased BAT, supporting weight management.

Oleuropein: Derived from olive leaf extract, oleuropein aids in weight management, helps balance blood pressure, and enhances heart health, providing a multifaceted approach to wellness.

These ingredients work synergistically to support metabolism, boost energy, and promote healthy weight loss, making Puravive a comprehensive option for those looking to enhance their weight management journey.

1igvykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/KibbexKpop/comments/1igvykl/liv_pure_reviews_weight_loss_supplement/,"Liv Pure Reviews: Weight Loss Supplement, Ingredients, Customer Feedback, Pros and Cons!","When I first heard about¬†**Liv Pure**, a natural supplement aimed at supporting liver detoxification and promoting weight loss, I was both intrigued and skeptical. Having tried various health products over the years with mixed results, I wasn‚Äôt sure if this would truly stand out. After using Liv Pure consistently for three months, I feel confident sharing my detailed experience, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness.

‚Äã

# Why I Chose Liv Pure‚Äã

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn‚Äôt new, but Liv Pure‚Äôs dual-action approach intrigued me. The supplement promised not just to detoxify the liver but also to enhance fat-burning processes, all while being made from natural ingredients like milk thistle, acai, and other plant-based extracts. With glowing online reviews and a growing reputation in the wellness community, I decided to give it a shot.  
‚Äã

# First Impressions‚Äã

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand. The capsules were standard-sized, making them easy to swallow, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve encountered with other supplements. The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.  
‚Äã

# The First Month: Detox and Adjustments‚Äã

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure‚Äôs liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn‚Äôt relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement‚Äôs effects.  
‚Äã

# Month Two: Visible Changes‚Äã

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn‚Äôt call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

What I appreciated most was the balanced approach of the supplement. Unlike some weight loss products that can feel overly aggressive, Liv Pure‚Äôs effects were steady and sustainable. I also felt a stronger sense of overall well-being, which I attribute to the supplement‚Äôs liver-supporting ingredients.

  
[‚û§CLICK HERE TO Discount (Limited Stock) ‚Äì ‚ÄúOFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://107b2mopr3jfao0cjuytx09r56.hop.clickbank.net)‚Äã

# Month Three: Long-Term Benefits‚Äã

By the third month, the results were undeniable. I had lost a total of 12 pounds, and my energy levels were at an all-time high. I felt more active and less fatigued, even after long days at work. My skin also appeared clearer, which I believe is a byproduct of improved liver health.

One unexpected benefit was the impact on my mood. Liv Pure‚Äôs natural composition seemed to contribute to better mental clarity and reduced stress levels. Whether this was due to the supplement itself or the confidence boost from feeling healthier, I can‚Äôt say for sure‚Äîbut the overall effect was remarkable.

* **Natural Ingredients**: Knowing that Liv Pure was made with natural components like acai and milk thistle gave me peace of mind. These ingredients are well-known for their detoxifying and antioxidant properties, and they seemed to work harmoniously in this formula.‚Äã
* **Ease of Use**: Taking two capsules a day was simple and didn‚Äôt feel like a chore. The absence of side effects made it easy to incorporate into my daily routine.‚Äã
* **Holistic Benefits**: Beyond weight loss, I noticed improvements in digestion, energy levels, and overall vitality.‚Äã
* **Science-Backed Approach**: The dual-action mechanism of supporting liver health while boosting metabolism felt grounded in science, which gave me confidence in the product.‚Äã

# Challenges‚Äã

While my experience with Liv Pure was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few aspects worth noting:  
‚Äã

1. **Results May Vary**: My husband also tried Liv Pure, but his results were slower. While he did experience better energy levels, his weight loss wasn‚Äôt as pronounced. This underscores that individual results can vary depending on factors like metabolism and lifestyle.‚Äã
2. **Availability**: Liv Pure is only available online, which might be inconvenient for those who prefer in-store purchases. Additionally, it‚Äôs important to purchase from the official website to avoid counterfeit products.‚Äã
3. **Cost**: While I found the price reasonable for the benefits I received, it might be on the higher side for some. However, the multi-bottle discounts and occasional promotions help offset the cost.‚Äã

# Comparison with Other Products‚Äã

Before trying Liv Pure, I had experimented with other liver detox and weight loss supplements, but none delivered the same comprehensive benefits. Many products focus solely on weight loss, often ignoring the role of liver health. Liv Pure‚Äôs unique approach to addressing both aspects felt more holistic and effective.

# Why I Chose Liv Pure‚Äã

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn‚Äôt new, but Liv Pure‚Äôs dual-action approach intrigued me. The supplement promised not just to detoxify the liver but also to enhance fat-burning processes, all while being made from natural ingredients like milk thistle, acai, and other plant-based extracts. With glowing online reviews and a growing reputation in the wellness community, I decided to give it a shot.  
‚Äã

# First Impressions‚Äã

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand. The capsules were standard-sized, making them easy to swallow, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve encountered with other supplements. The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.  
‚Äã

# The First Month: Detox and Adjustments‚Äã

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure‚Äôs liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn‚Äôt relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement‚Äôs effects.  
‚Äã

# Month Two: Visible Changes‚Äã

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn‚Äôt call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

What I appreciated most was the balanced approach of the supplement. Unlike some weight loss products that can feel overly aggressive, Liv Pure‚Äôs effects were steady and sustainable. I also felt a stronger sense of overall well-being, which I attribute to the supplement‚Äôs liver-supporting ingredients.

# Month Three: Long-Term Benefits‚Äã

By the third month, the results were undeniable. I had lost a total of 12 pounds, and my energy levels were at an all-time high. I felt more active and less fatigued, even after long days at work. My skin also appeared clearer, which I believe is a byproduct of improved liver health.

One unexpected benefit was the impact on my mood. Liv Pure‚Äôs natural composition seemed to contribute to better mental clarity and reduced stress levels. Whether this was due to the supplement itself or the confidence boost from feeling healthier, I can‚Äôt say for sure‚Äîbut the overall effect was remarkable.

* Avoid sugary coffee and syrups, as they turn coffee into a dessert rather than a[¬†healthy drink](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/is-it-possible-to-gain-weight-by-drinking-beer/).

[Lifestyle](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/simple-lifestyle-changes-to-protect-your-brain-40-years-ahead/)¬†coach Luke Coutinho advises against consuming coffee first thing in the morning, as it can harm gut health and disrupt the body‚Äôs natural balance. Instead, he suggests starting your day with a glass of water, followed by a balanced meal, before having coffee.

Additionally, Coutinho points out that¬†[coffee should¬†](https://worldmagzine.com/commodity/gold-is-approaching-its-strongest-buy-signal-in-four-months/)not be turned into a sugary treat. Adding syrups or sugar to your coffee is essentially making it a dessert, which can interfere with your diet and health goals.

# The Right Way to Drink Coffee According to Luke Coutinho‚Äôs Wellness Advice

Luke Coutinho warns against consuming coffee first thing in the morning. He emphasizes the importance of starting the day with water to hydrate your body, followed by a¬†[nutritious meal](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/beyond-diet-and-exercise-the-vital-role-of-relationships-in-health-and-longevity/)¬†before drinking coffee. This practice helps maintain hormonal balance and prevent the stress hormone cortisol from spiking excessively.

Coutinho also criticizes the trend of adding sugar and syrups to coffee, pointing out that it turns a healthy beverage into a dessert. For those who struggle with sugar, he recommends gradually switching to black tea or coffee, which can help form healthier habits over time.

Additionally, the lifestyle coach cautions against consuming coffee on an empty stomach, particularly with additives like ghee or coconut. He advises that coffee should always be consumed after a meal to avoid negative effects on the¬†[digestive system](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/foods-recommended-by-an-ayurvedic-expert-to-relieve-chronic-constipation/)¬†and hormonal balance.

For those aiming for fat loss or detox, Coutinho suggests that no single food or drink, like black coffee, will directly remove fat. A holistic approach involving a balanced diet, regular movement, and mindful lifestyle choices is key to achieving lasting health results.

My laptop originally came with a PremaMod BIOS, as it was purchased secondhand. After verifying in Linux, I discovered that it lacked Thunderbolt support. Seeking for bios, I found the Dsanke BIOS for Clevo on GitHub, which does include Thunderbolt support.

I came across several guides suggesting the use of an EFI Shell to flash the BIOS. However, I encountered a roadblock: I couldn't find a compatible meset.efi for Kaby Lake on this model. While there was a version available for the P775TM1 (which uses Coffee Lake and can be flashed via EFI Shell), I wasn't confident enough to proceed, as I didn‚Äôt want to risk bricking my laptop.

Instead of using EFI Shell, I opted to flash the BIOS using FreeDOS. This method requires the use of meset.exe along with the appropriate BIOS flash file, both of which can be found in the Clevo BIOS repository: [http://repo.palkeo.com/clevo-mirror/](http://repo.palkeo.com/clevo-mirror/) with username and pass is repo

# Victor | Human Variant | Chronurgy Wizard | lvl.2

* *TLDR; Victor is a Human Variant (Feat:Resilient(CON)) level 2 Chronurgy Wizard who suffers from insomnia.*

Hey! We're starting a new campaign, and I wanted to try something different‚Äîsomething a little more fun than my usual characters. So, meet Victor. 

# Appearance /

Victor has the look of a man who hasn‚Äôt slept properly in years. His long, unkempt blonde hair is a tangled mess, often pushed back but never truly in place. A scruffy beard clings to his jaw, more out of neglect than style. Deep bags hang under his tired eyes, and a faint redness betrays his dependence on coffee to stay functional. 

He wears a faded blue bathrobe covered in stars, the stitching frayed, with a half-moon embroidered on the back. His matching slippers are just as worn, shuffling against the floor as he moves. Ink stains and coffee spills mark his fingers, and the scent of old parchment and over-brewed caffeine clings to him. Despite his ragged state, there‚Äôs an odd charm to him‚Äîan exhausted scholar, lost in his studies and time itself.

# Backstory /

Victor was born into a prestigious family of wizards, each member boasting impressive magical accomplishments that spanned generations. From a young age, the weight of expectation pressed down on him like an invisible force, dictating his every move. His parents, renowned for their mastery of the arcane, expected nothing less than excellence, and his older siblings‚Äîprodigies in their own right‚Äîset an impossibly high standard for him to follow. 

However, Victor was different. Unlike his siblings, who seemed to grasp magic with effortless ease, he struggled. Spells that should have been second nature fizzled in his hands, and no matter how hard he studied, he always lagged behind. His family's disappointment grew with each failed incantation, their once-encouraging words turning into cold criticisms. 

Despite his shortcomings, Victor was accepted into a prestigious magic academy‚Äîthough not because of his own merits. The weight of his family's legacy all but ensured his enrollment, as no institution would dare reject a member of such an esteemed lineage. Yet, once inside, the illusion of belonging quickly shattered. Surrounded by prodigies, Victor's inadequacies became even more apparent. His spells were inconsistent, his control lacking, and his grasp of theory was always a step behind. Professors showed little patience, some outright stating that he was a disgrace to his family name. 

Eventually, the academy had enough. Citing his poor performance and inability to meet even the minimum standards, they expelled him. His family was livid. They had tolerated his failures within their own halls, but to be publicly shamed in such a manner was unacceptable. He was cast aside, written off as a failure, and treated as though he never truly belonged in the first place. Whispers spread among distant relatives, his name spoken only in hushed tones, and his parents all but erased his existence from their discussions. 

With nothing left for him, Victor took the first opportunity to leave. He abandoned the grand halls of his childhood home and disappeared into obscurity. Alone and burdened by his past, he dedicated himself to his studies‚Äînot to prove his family wrong, but for himself. 

He delved into arcane tomes, seeking knowledge outside the rigid structures of traditional wizardry. It was during these endless nights of study that he stumbled upon dunamancy‚Äîthe study of time and potential. It fascinated him in a way nothing else had. Where traditional magic had always eluded him, dunamancy felt different. It was more abstract, more fluid‚Äîsomething he could grasp. It gave him purpose. 

Now, Victor spends his days in solitude, pouring over ancient texts and refining his understanding of time itself. His failures still haunt him, the echoes of his family's disappointment never far from his mind. His insomnia worsens, fueled by relentless study and the lingering fear that, no matter how much knowledge he gains, he may never be enough. But even so, he persists.

So I‚Äôve been taking 36mg Concerta XL for over a month after going up from 27mg the month before. I haven‚Äôt had many negative side effects at all on either dose. I can still drink coffee, my appetite is ok etc. 

I slept in yesterday and skipped my dose it was too late in the day. I was busy yesterday so didn‚Äôt notice any anxiety but I did feel super tired. I took my dose as normal today and have been crippled with the most intense anxiety with no obvious cause. I feel like I could burst in to tears. I hadn‚Äôt felt super anxious when I was taking it consistently, if anything my emotional regulation had been better.

Is it normal to be overwhelmed by a dose after taking just one day off? Does this mean my dose is too high? If anything I had nearly been thinking it was too low, as I‚Äôve had no negative side effects at all and my focus still isn‚Äôt where I would like it to be. I know a lot of people take days off their meds but I was surprised at how awful I felt back on it after only one day off. Up until today my experience on medication was overwhelmingly positive.

1igvsy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machinists/comments/1igvsy0/drilling_a_spoon/,Drilling a spoon‚Ä¶,"This is a dumb question with hopefully a simple answer.

I run a residential construction firm but spent a few summers in a tool & die shop in college (mostly spent on a Bridgeport or surface grinder making repair parts).

Given my business of building things I have built a lot of projects for my kids teachers. Everything from physics experiment setups to weaving frames to simple stage set pieces.  
My youngest son‚Äôs art teacher asked me to drill an 1/8‚Äù hole in the center of 80 spoons for some kinetic art project she is having them do.  
No problem‚Ä¶ I thought.  
She handed me a package this morning of 100 spoons I assume she got off Amazon. No writing except (Soup spoon, Qt 100), no markings on the spoons, no idea what kind of metal. They are very shiny, mirror like finish, no grain like you see on Stainless steel.

Made a simple centering jig/ clamp for my big floor stand drill press, chucked in a 135 degree HSS bit that is new(ish), set RPMs at 3500 and tried to go to town. Bit just bends and walks, would not bite.

Tried to center punch and blunted a decent Dasco punch without much of a mark in the spoon.

Tried 1/16‚Äù and even a 1/4‚Äù  bits to not much effect. They just walk on the curved surface or don‚Äôt bite. Played with 300, 1500, and 5000 rpm.

Drilled an old stainless steel spoon I had sitting around for stirring coffee to check my thinking with no problem.

I was finally able to press a hardened finish nail (for hand nailing oak) through one with a big c clamp but it was time consuming.

Metal seems very hard but brittle, would not bend in my vise until right before it just broke.

1igvrv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1igvrv0/dust_blood_and_ants_avoid_majestic_elegance_costa/,"Dust, blood, and ants. Avoid Majestic Elegance Costa Mujeres.","This will be a long review, but I'll sum it up in a few sentences at the bottom.

We stayed in Majestic Elegance Costa Mujeres for our honeymoon and we wish we hadn't. I've attached photos below to support my claims.

Upon arriving, we headed to our room and the first thing we noticed was the smell of damp/mold. It didn't take long to discover the room hadn't been cleaned...at all. It was dusty and we found blood and stains on the bedsheets. Whose blood was it? No idea.
Straight away, a bad start for a place charging thousands of dollars.

We complained at reception and asked for a new room. We were told it was high season, there were no rooms available, and we would just have to wait for the room to be cleaned. After 11 hours of flying, this isn't exactly what we were expecting to hear. We just wanted to sleep for a few hours. We got a few coffees and watched as the cleaners spent two hours cleaning the room. 
We were impressed by the level of cleaning, as they used torches and had at least 5-6 people working. For this reason, we did not insist on getting an upgrade. We were there to enjoy our honeymoon and didn't want to be awkward.

And then the ants appeared.

At first they were just up around the jacuzzi. Went back to reception, complained, ants were dealt with. ...and then they appeared in our room. We complained again and they were dealt with again. At this stage, we were neither offered a new room, nor were we offered an apology.

I should also mention, not one person congratulated us on our honeymoon. We stayed in 3 star hotels in Ireland as a minimoon and every.single.one of them congratulated us. It was actually shocking to be ignored at a 5 star hotel.

Okay, back to the ants. So we were kept in the same room with no apology, but of course it gets worse. As the week went on, our cleaner (Alexis), decided to stop cleaning our room. To this day we have no idea why. We tipped Alexis everyday, so it's not as if we were being cheap. 
This was a big problem, because in addition to the bed not being made, the floor was not being swept. This probably wouldn't have mattered... except for the fact the ants kept coming back...and dying in our room. Whatever was sprayed was killing the ants (and doing god knows what to us), but it was leaving a corpse heap in the room. This led to a little yellow lizard deciding to visit us to eat the ants. He ran under the bed and unfortunately I don't have a photo for that.

So, after 4 days of having to go to reception to get our room cleaned, we went to guest services. We patiently explained all our issues. We did not lose our temper, we calmly showed pictures of what was happening and asked for a change in rooms.

Success! A room change...to a room of the same quality, not an upgrade. But still, if the room was going to be cleaned we were happy. And then we looked around the room. There was dust above and behind the bed, dust above the minibar, parts of the room were broken (see photos), a plug socket was loose (pretty dangerous if we had kids with us), the usb sockets beside the bed only had 1/4 of the sockets working.

Back to guest services. Once again, we patiently described the issues. We didn't ask for a room upgrade. We just asked them to dust properly and fix the sockets.
The hotel assured us that they would address all the issues the next day.

We spent the next day travelling to Isla Mujeres and arrived back around 8pm. We were delighted to find the room had been cleaned. Great, our phones are on low battery so let's charge them.
None of the sockets worked.
We could see they had been replaced, but nobody bothered to check that they actually worked.
And we thought to ourselves, if they didn't fix the sockets properly, did they dust properly.
No. No they did not. There was dust above the minibar, bed, and behind the headboard.

We were so angry. We had been ready to accept a room of the same quality and the only thing we asked the hotel to do was to clean it properly. And they couldn't even do that.

Back to reception and we brought every single point up with them. It was suggested that sometimes people lie about room conditions. We didn't exactly appreciate the implication that we were lying, especially since we had proof for each and every complaint. We showed guest services the photos.

And the response was, sorry, we'll get the manager involved. Wait until 16:30. We had planned to go into the city, but what was the point? This needed to be resolved.

16:30 comes around and we get to speak to Roberto. Roberto gets us to explain the entire story again, after he assured us that he has read the complaints we have already made.
He offers us a spa treatment and a plunge pool in the adult section.

Great, probably should have done this 4 days ago, or better still, the start of the trip. We are exhausted and so tired of complaining. We accept. Roberto is happy, polite, and apologetic. He assured us that everything will be sorted and the spa treatment is already sorted.

After all of this, a spa treatment is a brilliant way to start relaxing. We head down aaaaaand, they are not aware of any free booking. Apparently we need an actual voucher or written proof. The manager here rings reception. Okay, they will provisionally allow us to make a booking. 30 minutes gone from our day for something that was assured.

We pack our bags and go to reception. Roberto sees us, apologises for the confusion, and assured us that the room will be ready by 17:30.
Okay, great, we'll wait in reception.
17:30 comes around, room isn't ready, waiting until 18:00.
18:00 comes around waiting until 18:30.
At 18:15 a man finally brings us to the room. Yay. No time to relax though, we've a butler to wait for...and wait for..and wait for...and finally he appears. He tells us he won't be able to organise much for us as we were leaving in two days. He promises a fruit basket and a free bottle of liquor that he will drop up later that night.
Happy days, time to enjoy what is left of the holiday.
Unpacked, got dinner and went to bed. Didn't get to use the plunge pool as it was too late in the day and every cold.

We called the spa to see if we can get a later booking as we'd like to explore the adult part of the hotel (it is closed off to members of the Family Section).
The spa says, sure, but you're not getting the hydrotherapy. It was a bit of a slap in the face, as the hydrotherapy is standard before any spa treatment. Whatever, why would we expect any favours at this stage? The massage was fine, but they had a hell of a job trying to get the stress out of us.

We spent the rest of the day trying to get our free bottle of liquor. We were promised it throughout the day ('I'll deliver it in the morning, I'll delivers it by lunch...etc').
We finally had to just tell our Butler that we were getting on a plane the next day, could they please just deliver the bottle as they promised they would? At 19:00, we got our fruit basket. A bit random and would have been great in the morning.
At 19:30, out butler appeared with the bottle of liquor, 30 minutes before he would have finished for the day. It felt a bit insulting as we were the bottom of the pecking order and would have been ignored all together if we had not kept messaging him. We still tipped him as he delivered the bottle and fruit basket, even if it was very late.

The final bit of drama was upon leaving. We were handed a receipt after our bands were taken. No one explained what this was important for leaving the property.
When we got outside, security aggressively demanded the ticket. They had been very friendly all throughout the holiday, but the way they turned was intimidating. 
It was a final sour note to end a very stressful holiday.

If you do not see this review, the hotel has removed it. I will be posting it on Google and TripAdvisor as well.


TLDR: The hotel room was dirty on arrival (with blood on the bedsheets), the room was frequently not cleaned (despite us tipping), and we had ants. The restaurants and bars are good, so if you can ignore the ants and dust, you'll probably enjoy your stay...provided they actually clean your room.
