I am married, we have been together for 11 years and have a child. 

Last year, I reconnected with someone that over the years, we always managed to ‚Äòre-appear‚Äô for one another, but timing was never right. We had a little fling when we were 21, but it didn‚Äôt eventuate into anything as at that time I didn‚Äôt want anything serious and he was full force. 

In reconnecting last year, it was clear there was always going to be something between us. I pulled away, telling him I couldn‚Äôt do this as I was married. Nothing happened between us for 4 months, it was just coffee catch ups and general chat. 
One day he told me I was his ‚Äúone that got away‚Äù and he‚Äôd loved me for 13 years and had never stopped. I fell in love with him too. My marriage wasn‚Äôt in a great place and I had already thought of leaving and then HE asked me to leave. I reached a point where I made the decision to leave.

Two weeks later, on a Sunday night he told me couldn‚Äôt see his life without me and he loved me beyond anything. Monday morning, he told me he couldn‚Äôt handle it right now and needed things to stop. Like it was nothing. I cried and I embarrassingly begged him not to leave. My whole world was literally destroyed within minutes. 
He would try and talk to me as a friend, telling me he would ‚Äòalways be there if I needed him‚Äô. No contact lasted 3 weeks and I broke, just wanting to see how he was. Mistake. He spoke like nothing ever happened between us. A week later he messaged me on my birthday saying ‚ÄòHey! Happy Birthday!‚Äô
A week after that I called him because my emotions were too overwhelming and I just needed to try and understand what had gone wrong. Mistake. He told me very much only wanted ‚Äòcasual‚Äô or ‚Äòfriends with benefits‚Äô and that he couldn‚Äôt handle anything. 

It‚Äôs been about 5 weeks since this and I‚Äôm still so broken. I know it‚Äôs still early days, but this was truly the love of my life and I feel so broken. I ended a marriage, believed every word he said, he made it so believable that we were meant to be because we always found a way back to one another. 

Will he be back? Is this the avoidant pattern? I don‚Äôt know what to do? I know I can‚Äôt contact him and that he has to be the one to come back and even then, that doesn‚Äôt mean he wants to rekindle things straight away - it‚Äôs his attachment style - but my attachment style is anxious and this is soul destroying.

Men‚Äôs underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

Emma Ockerman
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read


From Labubus **(1)** and men‚Äôs underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they‚Äôre accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here‚Äôs how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a ‚Äúsignificant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.‚Äù

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year ‚Äî an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the ‚ÄúSahm rule,‚Äù **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating ‚Äî and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise ‚Äî here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here‚Äôs the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


‚ÄúI love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,‚Äù Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

‚ÄúThe cardboard box industry is incredibly large ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking close to $100 billion in revenue,‚Äù Wooten said. ‚ÄúWhat I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it‚Äôs four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don‚Äôt have that about the cardboard box industry. It‚Äôs so much more important.‚Äù

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

‚ÄúThis is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,‚Äù Wooten said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.‚Äù


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It‚Äôs been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men‚Äôs underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It‚Äôs also been said, however, that many of those ‚Äúindicators‚Äù are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** ‚Äî midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men‚Äôs underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

‚ÄúI cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,‚Äù said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

‚ÄúGreenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?‚Äù Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more ‚Äúchoiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt spend, it just means that they aren‚Äôt necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,‚Äù Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks ‚Äî at which point the US was already in a recession ‚Äî Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Est√©e Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,‚Äù according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,‚Äù Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the ‚ÄúLipstick Index,‚Äù and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle treat economy,‚Äù or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,‚Äù Swartz said. ‚ÄúMy opinion would be that when there‚Äôs a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.‚Äù

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


‚ÄúYou can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,‚Äù Swartz said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We‚Äôve also seen weakness in the luxury space.‚Äù

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own ‚ÄúSkelly‚Äù and noted that ‚Äúthere are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.‚Äù Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August‚Äôs decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

‚ÄúThough I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,‚Äù he wrote. **(17)** ‚ÄúIn 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,‚Äù he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúshare any sales specifics around any products,‚Äù though ‚Äúwe continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.‚Äù

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot‚Äôs Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

‚ÄúIf people aren‚Äôt buying those ‚Äî and it‚Äôs been a hot-ticket item in past years ‚Äî then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,‚Äù Bagniewski said.

1np2bo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1np2bo6/the_adelantados_fountain/,The Adelantado's Fountain,"I tore my backpack off and dropped it onto the curb. The oppressive humidity clung to my back like a slimy hand. I severed every relationship I had here years ago except for Levi. We had talked on the phone often while I was away. He was my last frayed connection to this place and a good friend since we were kids. That‚Äôs why I called him first when I got the news from my sister about our dad.

I scanned the parking garage for Levi but saw nobody I recognized. I remembered Levi as tall and heavyset, with thin arms and a gut like a turtle shell. His hair grew in a dense, knotted afro that resembled a dark cloud atop a face that always seemed to smile.

A man came from behind a row of parked cars calling my name, arms extended as if to give me a hug. His hair was long and curly but fell in thin, greasy strands in front of his face like old doorway beads. I could smell him before he got too close. I forced a smile and a hug, holding my breath as we embraced.

‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre finally back,‚Äù Levi said, letting me go as I caught my breath.

I took an extra step back, feeling an ocean of distance between us. ‚ÄúYeah, just wish it was under better circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúCircumstances don‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôre here now and that‚Äôs what counts. It‚Äôs what your dad would‚Äôve wanted,‚Äù he said, staring at me with caring eyes that seemed to sink into his face the longer I looked.

The mention of my dad made my heart drop. My mouth dried up as the familiar sensation in my throat returned. It burned and tore into my neck until it crawled its way into my ears. It was an affliction that no doctor could explain when I was younger and hadn‚Äôt been with me since I left the Gulf Coast. My words became trapped behind it. I leaned over to cough before I told Levi the real reason I was back. ‚ÄúHe came back, Levi. He‚Äôs alive.‚Äù I got the words out before being thrown into a coughing fit, desperately looking through my backpack for some water and trying to control my breathing. My mind felt like a whirlwind. I thought about how I could explain to Levi how this was even possible but, in the end, I didn‚Äôt need to. I met Levi‚Äôs gaze again. His smile was from ear to ear. ‚ÄúHe was never supposed to stay gone.‚Äù Confused, I decided to let the comment slide. He had been closer to my dad the last decade. Maybe it was just his way of saying he missed him.

We rode in silence for a while. Green cow pastures rolled by my window. The large green expanses melted away into rows of hollow strip malls, liquor stores, and parking lots. The sidewalks were captured by the Florida crabgrass years ago.

People don‚Äôt smile around here. Most people stayed in their cars or inside their homes, but every once in a while, you could see someone outside. They were normally craning their entire bodies in inhuman ways, eyes closed and mouth agape, panhandling at the red lights, scaring motorists with their erratic, violent gestures of frustration or excitement.

As we neared my parents‚Äô house, I spotted the turn that led to the jetty that Levi and I would launch from on our fishing trips. I lifted my head from the passenger window and sat up and shouted in excitement, ‚ÄúHoly shit, remember my dad‚Äôs old skiff? We would send off from there, right?‚Äù Levi‚Äôs road trance broke and he turned to me. ‚ÄúYep, that old jetty has a lot of history.‚Äù He cleared his throat, making a gurgling noise that sounded like he was underwater. ‚ÄúWanna see it?‚Äù he asked. I accepted. My stomach had been twisting in tighter knots as we approached my parents‚Äô house, and I was in no rush to see them. Levi made a U-turn and peeled off down the long road to the jetty.

Everything was different than how I remembered it. The long road to the pier was cracked and potted everywhere like a warzone. The grass that grew on either side reached my chest from years of neglect. The old pier at the jetty had collapsed in the last hurricane and lay half buried by the seawater. Its old wooden supports jutted out of the water as if they were straining for air. What happened? The community I remembered would‚Äôve never let a pier waste away like this. ‚ÄúSchool hasn‚Äôt started here yet, has it? This place used to be packed with kids taking out their dad‚Äôs boats all summer long,‚Äù I said to Levi, my eyes still fixed on the canal. Levi pulled out a pack of cigarettes and handed me one. ‚ÄúThe hurricane didn‚Äôt just tear down the pier, it washed something up out of the mud and brought it with the tide. People started saying the water was cursed. You know how folks talk.‚Äù I sat back in my seat and let out a long sigh. I was in town for almost an hour and already felt as if I couldn‚Äôt recognize it.

I called out to Levi to follow me outside to smoke. I cracked my door open first and was immediately assaulted by the most putrid smell. I gagged. It smelled like a mixture of rotting algae, dead fish, and saltwater. I slammed the door shut looking for any relief from the stench, but it was no use. Levi had already exited the car and left his door open and was now smoking a cigarette and leaned against his hood. I lit the cigarette and took a heavy inhale, trying to replace the noxious odor with the familiar poison of cigarette smoke. It worked well enough. Levi flicked the ash off his cigarette and spit into the canal. ‚ÄúLooks different than you remember, huh? You remember that time we went shark fishing?‚Äù

I laughed at myself. ‚ÄúYeah, you mean when that chum bag got demolished and I almost shit myself?‚Äù

Levi cackled through a plume of smoke. ‚ÄúYup! We caught that sucker though. Tasted like steak from what I remember.‚Äù

I smiled as I pulled another puff of the cigarette. I was leaned up against the hood when my phone rang. Marlene. I answered with fake enthusiasm. ‚ÄúHey, sis.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù She sounded impatient, like I was late for something. I didn‚Äôt even tell her I had landed.

‚ÄúOn my way now with Levi. I should be there soon,‚Äù I said apologetically.

‚ÄúGood, hurry up, dad‚Äôs excited to see you. We all are.‚Äù The pit moved from my stomach into my chest as I paced up and down the shore. I assured her I would be there soon and hung up.

I stepped out from behind the car and saw Levi, ankle-deep in the water. He reached down and wet his fingers. Lifting them up slowly, it looked like he wiped an X across his face. Then he just stood there. His eyes were closed but looked as if his gaze was fixed on something. I figured he was just cooling off. Florida heat will make you do weird shit. At least I knew why he smelled so bad. I told him we‚Äôd better get going.

I watched Levi slowly walk out of the water. Each step he took was like he was lifting his shoe out of quicksand. Behind him, the water, it was‚Ä¶gurgling. The spot where Levi had stood began erupting into a boil and made a sound unlike anything I‚Äôd ever heard. I had spent my life on these shores, and I had never heard the water sound like that. It sounded almost human. Like a deep, low drone you might hear when your grandad gets up from the couch. I glanced at Levi to see if he noticed, but he was too busy wiping the mud off his shoe on a rock. ‚ÄúAt least the fish stuck around,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a laugh. Levi shot me a smile and a halfhearted laugh as he opened the door and climbed inside the car. I followed, slamming the car door and rolling up the window tight.

I spent a few moments outside the house. Just listening.

When I was a kid, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays went to the World Series. Levi and I had rushed back after playing Halo over at his house to find parked cars that lined both sides of the street as we turned onto the cul-de-sac. My house was on the corner lot. The hooting and hollering poured out of our windows, shattering the silence of our quiet suburban street. Our porch shined bright as a crowd cried out in disappointment. The Phillies had scored another home run. On the other side of the house, my sister shrieked along with her friends in terror as they watched *Jeepers Creepers*. With all the commotion, my mom‚Äôs sharp laugh could be heard over it all, no doubt a few rounds deep in her favorite brandy.

There was nothing now. Not even the TV. Just complete silence as I stood outside the door.

I raised my fist to knock on the door but was greeted by my mom, who swung the door open. She wrapped her arms around me and squeezed me so tight I wondered how so much strength could come from such a small woman. I hugged her back with my free arm, squeezing her tight for a moment before letting it fall unsurely. She held on for a few beats too long, making me uncomfortable. Her hair was frazzled with a cigarette tucked in her ear, but her face was smiling. Her voice sounded nervous, almost like it was rehearsed. ‚ÄúCome in, come in, are you hungry? Oh, he‚Äôs just resting. He‚Äôs been waiting for you,‚Äù she said, slurring every other word.

I stood awkwardly in the living room. The color of the carpet had rotted into the same dark green of frogs Levi and I would catch in the neighborhood. The wallpaper was in tatters and stained yellow with decades of cigarette smoke. The leather on my dad‚Äôs old La-Z-Boy had been torn and fixed with electrical tape so often that the seat became just a mound of frayed material. Just below, my eyes were drawn to a large yellow stain that left a haunting, human-shaped ring in the middle of the floor. I pondered where it could‚Äôve come from when my mom interrupted, ‚ÄúYou must be tired from your trip. Do you want something to eat?‚Äù she asked in a singsong voice while she poured herself another sip of brandy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Mom, really. Where‚Äôs Dad?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel like wasting time anymore. The burning in my throat I had felt since getting off the plane wasn‚Äôt going anywhere until I could see my father. The walking, talking miracle.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting, dear. Why don‚Äôt you put away your clothes first? Or here, have some brandy,‚Äù she announced as she moved from the fridge to the sink, then to the shot glasses, fussing with anything that would give her purpose. I was getting irritated. This didn‚Äôt feel right.

I grabbed ahold of her shoulders and turned her to face me. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù I commanded, looking her dead in the eye. She shifted her eyes toward the bedroom and said softly, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in there.‚Äù I let her go and walked to my parents‚Äô bedroom, wrapping my fingers around the knob. I turned it but waited a moment before pushing it open. I decided to call out first. ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hear you right now, dear, he‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù Mom said, still standing in the kitchen.

I pushed the door open slowly. The room was filled with darkness, and I was filled with a heaviness as my heart began pounding inside my chest. A damp smell hit me first. Like the canal, only mixed with death and the smell of booze. Then the sound of running water. Why would they put a fountain in here? As I pushed the door open completely, I could see the shape of my dad turned away from me. Listening closely, I could hear him snoring. But the sound I heard coming from my dad wasn‚Äôt something that should come from a human. It was sickening. Squelching and sputtering. Coughing and hacking. It sounded like he was underwater. My eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw the source of the running water.

My knees shook as I struggled to keep myself upright. It came from him. With each sputter and burst of air came a steady stream of dark greenish-red water flowing from his mouth. Not just a dribble, but a stream expelling in violent bursts onto the sheets, soaking the ground below the bed. In the darkness, I could see his figure writhing with each exhale as he choked up more water. But through it all, he slept otherwise peacefully, never stirring or disrupting his sleep. I slammed the door shut and allowed my knees to buckle. My mom came up behind me and rested her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the story of Lazarus, son,‚Äù she said in my ear, ‚Äúonly Lazarus was called forth by Jesus. The Adelantado called your daddy back.‚Äù

When I was around nine, my parents took me and my sister for a road trip to New York City. I remember sitting in the backseat with my sister thinking that this trip was never going to end. Surrounded by fast food burger wrappers, I tried reading a book, only to quickly find out that‚Äôs exactly how you get carsick. With nothing else to do, my sister and I played the punch buggy game, where you call out Volkswagen Beetles and punch each other in the arm. We went back and forth for the entire 20-hour drive. At one point I had almost drifted off to sleep when my sister noticed something coming up in the distance. She stood up in the middle seat and leaned forward to get a better look. I had figured it was another one of the ten thousand alligators or wild hogs we passed. However, as we approached and saw her face shine with a mischievous smile, I knew it had to be something else. ‚ÄúPunch buggy!‚Äù she shouted as she laid into me repeatedly, punching me thirty or forty times as the Volkswagen dealership faded in our rearview mirror.

That was the memory that popped into my mind while staring at *The Sacrament of the Last Supper* painting by Salvador Dal√≠. It was a gift we got on that same trip. My dad had hung it up in that exact same spot over the dining room table over twenty years ago. It never really meant anything to us. Just a weird piece of art my parents showed off just for the hell of it. Once they were ‚Äúborn again,‚Äù it took on a whole new sanctity. That was about fifteen years ago, well before I joined the Navy.

I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking each time I listened to the sounds coming from my dad‚Äôs bedroom as I sat at the dinner table. Each time he breathed, my heart sank, and my eyes slammed shut in anticipation of the eventual sound of gurgling water. Across from me, Marlene took a bite off her plate and shot me a smile, as if the sound was just background music to her meal. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall hear that, right?‚Äù I finally asked in a low voice, almost drowned out by the rattling silverware. ‚ÄúYour daddy‚Äôs always snored, hon,‚Äù Mom responded, slurring her words. I ignored her. She had been a mess of brandy and tears since I walked in, refusing to let me call an ambulance for my father because ‚ÄúThem doctors don‚Äôt understand God‚Äôs will.‚Äù I had hoped my sister would be more reasonable. ‚ÄúMarlene, what the fuck happened to him?‚Äù I said, staring into her eyes. She chewed her food before responding.

‚ÄúWhen we found him, he was stone cold dead, Jack.‚Äù She wiped her mouth with a napkin. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve just choked on his vomit because we found him laying right there.‚Äù She pointed to the stain on the floor next to his recliner. ‚ÄúMom was at work, so there was nobody there to help him up. He died, just right there,‚Äù she said in a quiet voice that trembled with sadness and regret. ‚ÄúMom found him after she got off of work and called the pastor.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not the ambulance?‚Äù I blurted out, annoyed and frustrated.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mom shouted. ‚ÄúYou know your father is terrified of doctors,‚Äù she said, stumbling from her seat towards the liquor cabinet.

‚ÄúBecause he needed prayer, Jack. We sat up all night, just praying. Asking the Adelantado to return him.‚Äù Her dull, trembling tone was gone, replaced now by a righteous confidence I had never seen in her. ‚ÄúAnd it worked. By the next morning he was good as new,‚Äù she shrilled. ‚ÄúJust needs his rest is all.‚Äù I froze in disbelief. It felt like an eternity had passed before Levi joined in the conversation.

That‚Äôs when it clicked. The Adelantado. A royal name for Ponce de Le√≥n, the explorer of the 16th century who came to Florida looking for the Fountain of Youth. It was a legend told to schoolchildren around here. I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head.

‚ÄúListen, Jack.‚Äù He leaned forward in his seat, resting his arms on the table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone a while. Things have changed.‚Äù His eyes drew downward to his hands, which lay folded in front of him. ‚ÄúYou remember Pastor Scott, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Of course I did. Everyone in town did. He called himself a pastor, but I‚Äôve never met one like him. His sermons felt more like a rally. Folks screaming hallelujah and shaking uncontrollably. Some even ‚Äúspoke in tongues.‚Äù People around town ate it up. Especially my mom. To me, he was a fanatic. An overly cheerful, cult-like freak that preyed on people like my parents. He was just another reason I left.

My family had met him right after my sister left our house with my nephew. She ran off with a man we barely knew and we didn‚Äôt see her for seven years, with no warning. Just a note on the coffee table I discovered after coming home from school. I remember being a kid, in a dark and still house. A sense of longing. Watching my mother take to making jewelry to cope with the sadness. I remember her at our kitchen table, stringing together beads alone, trying to preoccupy herself. There were no Super Bowl parties after that. No more get-togethers. No more friends. Just us in that silent house. Rotting away.

That‚Äôs when my mom met Pastor Scott. A newcomer to our area. He bought a dilapidated pool bar on the coast, chalked white with sea spray. I remembered it as a place Levi and I could sneak a beer when we were teenagers, but now the pool tables and barstools were gone. Replaced by makeshift pews with polished floors from knees bent in reverence. It was a novelty in our area and attracted weirdos, addicts, and freaks from across the town. ‚ÄúThe Salvation Saloon: On the same bar stool where someone got stoned on Saturday night, someone else gets saved on Sunday morning,‚Äù hung on an old neon sign off the highway.

My parents never gave a damn about religion before that, but much to my chagrin, they began attending the Salvation Saloon while in the throes of their grief. Gradually, they began talking like Pastor Scott. Repeating his lines from church week after week. Slowly, I began feeling like the only sane one left in the house. I refused to set foot inside that place, electing instead to hang out at Levi‚Äôs house, my safe space away from this twisted version of religion.

Levi looked at my mom, then to Marlene. His mouth curled into a smile as he looked down at the table and said in a familiar dramatic, firebrand tone, ‚ÄúIt was his prayer that brought him back. Not them dang doctors. The Adelantado transformed your dad‚Äôs corpse into a fountain. A fountain of proof, for anyone with eyes to see, and made him whole.‚Äù

I sat back in my chair. Nothing made sense anymore. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you even talking about, Levi? You were raised Jewish!‚Äù My voice cracked, shocked at the change in my best friend. ‚ÄúMy dad is choking to death in the next room. There‚Äôs a puddle ankle-deep coming from underneath the door, and you all are acting like this is some fucking revival tent!‚Äù My mind couldn‚Äôt handle any more of this. Before I had left, I was always able to count on Levi as my escape to normalcy once my parents found the church. I would‚Äôve never thought he could be spewing this same nonsense. ‚ÄúWhen did you start believing in this shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúSince your dad brought me to‚Äî‚Äù

I spat my food out on the table before he could finish his sentence. My mom had cooked what used to be my favorite meal: bacon-wrapped chicken. But while chewing on my last bite, it had changed. It stuck to my teeth, stretching like hot glue between my molars. Black juice escaped out of my mouth and ran down my chin while the piece I had ejected squirmed on the table.

‚ÄúToo good for your mama‚Äôs cooking, Jack?‚Äù Mom yelled as she filled her glass.

I looked at my plate to find the wrapped chicken breast looking back at me before I keeled over. I put my head between my knees while gagging and hacking. The burning was back. Starting in my throat as before, then quickly licking up into my ears until they began to ring as if I was underwater. Nobody came to help. They looked at me with blank faces as if they had seen this before. Their lips moved as they gathered around me. I reached my hand out for help but received no reprieve. I gained some purchase on the tablecloth and pulled, sending the food crashing to the floor. I looked over at my mom, who held her glass up high, before everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was in my old room. The sheets smelled like mildew and smoke. The fan circled lazily above me. My mind raced as I lay in bed, unable to rest between the sounds and smells of the house. I was exhausted. So much had happened. So much had changed. I felt lost, like the people I loved no longer existed. It felt like I had lost a piece of who I was. I tried to think of simpler times. Of my dad. Not as he was in the next room over, but when he was the smartest person I knew.

We had taken the skiff out late one night for a fishing trip. I was about ten years old and had never been out so late with my dad before. We planned and packed meticulously the night before, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting off the bus, running straight home, and making sure everything was in place. The tackle box, the poles, our cooler, safety gear, flashlights. I checked all of it just as my dad had taught me. I was already at the door when he walked in. Even now I could picture him in his dirty work overalls, trying to untie his boots while I pestered him nonstop with a million questions about how we would see the fish at nighttime. Or if our flashlights and lanterns would provide enough light to hook our bait, met with a low ‚ÄúMhm‚Äù or ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù He moved slowly from taking off his mud-covered boots, to getting changed, to hitching the boat. All while remaining sharp and cold in his demeanor. As we took off to the jetty, he said to me, ‚ÄúNight fishing can be dangerous, son. Currents are strong around here. If you fall, don‚Äôt let the water take you.‚Äù I nodded, way too preoccupied with thoughts of being out under the stars with my old man to care about something as mundane as a safety brief.

We pushed off and headed up the coast, towards a spring called Weeki Wachee. It was a popular local destination with clear blue water. It took its name from the Ta√≠no Indians who told Ponce de Le√≥n about the Fountain of Youth. Even as a ten-year-old, the legend occupied no space in my mind. I was just excited to be out there with my dad. Under the moonlight in the middle of the ocean. The excitement drove me crazy.

When we got there, we cast our lines and sat in silence for a while, waiting for a bite. The moonlight was eaten by the water that appeared as a pool of inky black tar in the darkness. After a while I felt a tug on my pole. Then another. On the third tug, I was pulled off my feet and sent clear into the water. I tried to scream but only managed to let out a quick yelp before my voice was snuffed out by the brackish water. I held onto my pole as whatever gripped it dragged me deeper and deeper before I began to panic as the air in my lungs was expelled and I breathed in. Right at that moment, I felt a hand grab my hair, pulling me out and back onto the boat. I coughed uncontrollably as my dad turned me over and began pounding my back, yelling frantically, ‚ÄúGet it out, get it out!‚Äù I hurled up what I could before we packed up and headed home. Dad didn‚Äôt say a word. He seemed even more solemn and serious than before as he drove the boat directly back to the jetty.

I almost fell asleep when a sound erupted from the walls. The coughing and gurgling noises exploded, causing me to sit up and shake with fear. That‚Äôs when I heard it. My dad, calling my name.

I rushed to my parents‚Äô bedroom, splashing through the pool of water that seeped into the kitchen, and threw open my parents‚Äô door. That is where I saw my dad. Or what was left of him.

He sat upright in a pile of fabric pulp. His head lolled to the side as his mouth gaped open, his jaw unhinged and hung unnaturally low into his lap like it wanted to tear itself away. His skin, swollen and waterlogged, looked like meat left to brine for too long, splitting at the seams with every small movement he made.

Then his chest. Christ. It had ruptured. Burst open, exposing his ribs cracked apart like a weathered hull. Laying bare his heart that pulsed powerfully with thick, tar-colored sludge as if it wanted out. His lungs heaved like two drowned sponges.

The sheets swam in the puddles around him, and I swear I could see movement. The water seemed to tingle with life, and I could see small figures knotting and unknotting all around him. Finding new forms.

I looked up at his face. It was pale and swarmed with veins. His beard hung to his face, matted and interrupted by sharp tears in his jaw. And his eyes. Replaced by a waterfall of blood pouring out of his face. Mixing with the water still seeping out of his mouth. The greenish-red mixture dripped down what was left of him as he jerked his head quickly in my direction. ‚ÄúDo you see, son? Do you see? The fountain. Drink. It‚Äôs already inside you.‚Äù",1,1758686083.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged and entertained, blending both relaxing and mentally stimulating activities. One of my favorite pastimes is brewing my own coffee. There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about the entire process from selecting the beans, grinding them fresh, to carefully controlling the water temperature and brew time. It‚Äôs almost a ritual that wakes up my senses and prepares me for the day ahead. Experimenting with different brewing methods like French press, pour-over, or AeroPress allows me to appreciate the nuances in flavor and aroma, turning a simple cup of coffee into a personal craft.

Another passion of mine is diving into the world of true crime. I‚Äôm fascinated by the psychological and investigative elements behind real-life mysteries and crimes. Whether it‚Äôs reading detailed case studies, listening to true crime podcasts, or watching documentaries, I find myself drawn to understanding the motives and unraveling the puzzle behind each story. True crime media challenges me to think critically and analyze evidence alongside experts, making it a deeply engaging hobby.

Closely related to this interest is my love for mystery media in general. From thrilling mystery novels and films to TV shows that keep me guessing until the very end, I enjoy stories that challenge my mind and spark curiosity. I like piecing together clues and theorizing about what might happen next, which adds an interactive layer to my entertainment.

I also keep up with the news regularly. Staying informed about current events is important to me as it connects me to the world around me and helps me understand different perspectives. It‚Äôs a way to stay grounded and aware of societal changes, politics, and global developments.

When it comes to gaming, I‚Äôm drawn to strategy games and survival games, especially those with a horror twist. The challenge of planning and decision-making in strategy games appeals to my logical side, while survival games test my ability to adapt and persevere in hostile environments. Horror elements add an extra layer of adrenaline and suspense, making the experience even more thrilling and immersive.

Overall, my hobbies reflect my love for thoughtful engagement, whether it‚Äôs brewing the perfect coffee, unraveling mysteries, or navigating tense game scenarios. Each activity offers a unique way to relax, learn, and challenge myself. ",2,1758686080.0,MbtiTypeMe,3,1.0,False
1np2ba5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1np2ba5/the_adelantados_fountain/,The Adelantado's Fountain,"I tore my backpack off and dropped it onto the curb. The oppressive humidity clung to my back like a slimy hand. I severed every relationship I had here years ago except for Levi. We had talked on the phone often while I was away. He was my last frayed connection to this place and a good friend since we were kids. That‚Äôs why I called him first when I got the news from my sister about our dad.

I scanned the parking garage for Levi but saw nobody I recognized. I remembered Levi as tall and heavyset, with thin arms and a gut like a turtle shell. His hair grew in a dense, knotted afro that resembled a dark cloud atop a face that always seemed to smile.

A man came from behind a row of parked cars calling my name, arms extended as if to give me a hug. His hair was long and curly but fell in thin, greasy strands in front of his face like old doorway beads. I could smell him before he got too close. I forced a smile and a hug, holding my breath as we embraced.

‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre finally back,‚Äù Levi said, letting me go as I caught my breath.

I took an extra step back, feeling an ocean of distance between us. ‚ÄúYeah, just wish it was under better circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúCircumstances don‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôre here now and that‚Äôs what counts. It‚Äôs what your dad would‚Äôve wanted,‚Äù he said, staring at me with caring eyes that seemed to sink into his face the longer I looked.

The mention of my dad made my heart drop. My mouth dried up as the familiar sensation in my throat returned. It burned and tore into my neck until it crawled its way into my ears. It was an affliction that no doctor could explain when I was younger and hadn‚Äôt been with me since I left the Gulf Coast. My words became trapped behind it. I leaned over to cough before I told Levi the real reason I was back. ‚ÄúHe came back, Levi. He‚Äôs alive.‚Äù I got the words out before being thrown into a coughing fit, desperately looking through my backpack for some water and trying to control my breathing. My mind felt like a whirlwind. I thought about how I could explain to Levi how this was even possible but, in the end, I didn‚Äôt need to. I met Levi‚Äôs gaze again. His smile was from ear to ear. ‚ÄúHe was never supposed to stay gone.‚Äù Confused, I decided to let the comment slide. He had been closer to my dad the last decade. Maybe it was just his way of saying he missed him.

We rode in silence for a while. Green cow pastures rolled by my window. The large green expanses melted away into rows of hollow strip malls, liquor stores, and parking lots. The sidewalks were captured by the Florida crabgrass years ago.

People don‚Äôt smile around here. Most people stayed in their cars or inside their homes, but every once in a while, you could see someone outside. They were normally craning their entire bodies in inhuman ways, eyes closed and mouth agape, panhandling at the red lights, scaring motorists with their erratic, violent gestures of frustration or excitement.

As we neared my parents‚Äô house, I spotted the turn that led to the jetty that Levi and I would launch from on our fishing trips. I lifted my head from the passenger window and sat up and shouted in excitement, ‚ÄúHoly shit, remember my dad‚Äôs old skiff? We would send off from there, right?‚Äù Levi‚Äôs road trance broke and he turned to me. ‚ÄúYep, that old jetty has a lot of history.‚Äù He cleared his throat, making a gurgling noise that sounded like he was underwater. ‚ÄúWanna see it?‚Äù he asked. I accepted. My stomach had been twisting in tighter knots as we approached my parents‚Äô house, and I was in no rush to see them. Levi made a U-turn and peeled off down the long road to the jetty.

Everything was different than how I remembered it. The long road to the pier was cracked and potted everywhere like a warzone. The grass that grew on either side reached my chest from years of neglect. The old pier at the jetty had collapsed in the last hurricane and lay half buried by the seawater. Its old wooden supports jutted out of the water as if they were straining for air. What happened? The community I remembered would‚Äôve never let a pier waste away like this. ‚ÄúSchool hasn‚Äôt started here yet, has it? This place used to be packed with kids taking out their dad‚Äôs boats all summer long,‚Äù I said to Levi, my eyes still fixed on the canal. Levi pulled out a pack of cigarettes and handed me one. ‚ÄúThe hurricane didn‚Äôt just tear down the pier, it washed something up out of the mud and brought it with the tide. People started saying the water was cursed. You know how folks talk.‚Äù I sat back in my seat and let out a long sigh. I was in town for almost an hour and already felt as if I couldn‚Äôt recognize it.

I called out to Levi to follow me outside to smoke. I cracked my door open first and was immediately assaulted by the most putrid smell. I gagged. It smelled like a mixture of rotting algae, dead fish, and saltwater. I slammed the door shut looking for any relief from the stench, but it was no use. Levi had already exited the car and left his door open and was now smoking a cigarette and leaned against his hood. I lit the cigarette and took a heavy inhale, trying to replace the noxious odor with the familiar poison of cigarette smoke. It worked well enough. Levi flicked the ash off his cigarette and spit into the canal. ‚ÄúLooks different than you remember, huh? You remember that time we went shark fishing?‚Äù

I laughed at myself. ‚ÄúYeah, you mean when that chum bag got demolished and I almost shit myself?‚Äù

Levi cackled through a plume of smoke. ‚ÄúYup! We caught that sucker though. Tasted like steak from what I remember.‚Äù

I smiled as I pulled another puff of the cigarette. I was leaned up against the hood when my phone rang. Marlene. I answered with fake enthusiasm. ‚ÄúHey, sis.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù She sounded impatient, like I was late for something. I didn‚Äôt even tell her I had landed.

‚ÄúOn my way now with Levi. I should be there soon,‚Äù I said apologetically.

‚ÄúGood, hurry up, dad‚Äôs excited to see you. We all are.‚Äù The pit moved from my stomach into my chest as I paced up and down the shore. I assured her I would be there soon and hung up.

I stepped out from behind the car and saw Levi, ankle-deep in the water. He reached down and wet his fingers. Lifting them up slowly, it looked like he wiped an X across his face. Then he just stood there. His eyes were closed but looked as if his gaze was fixed on something. I figured he was just cooling off. Florida heat will make you do weird shit. At least I knew why he smelled so bad. I told him we‚Äôd better get going.

I watched Levi slowly walk out of the water. Each step he took was like he was lifting his shoe out of quicksand. Behind him, the water, it was‚Ä¶gurgling. The spot where Levi had stood began erupting into a boil and made a sound unlike anything I‚Äôd ever heard. I had spent my life on these shores, and I had never heard the water sound like that. It sounded almost human. Like a deep, low drone you might hear when your grandad gets up from the couch. I glanced at Levi to see if he noticed, but he was too busy wiping the mud off his shoe on a rock. ‚ÄúAt least the fish stuck around,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a laugh. Levi shot me a smile and a halfhearted laugh as he opened the door and climbed inside the car. I followed, slamming the car door and rolling up the window tight.

I spent a few moments outside the house. Just listening.

When I was a kid, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays went to the World Series. Levi and I had rushed back after playing Halo over at his house to find parked cars that lined both sides of the street as we turned onto the cul-de-sac. My house was on the corner lot. The hooting and hollering poured out of our windows, shattering the silence of our quiet suburban street. Our porch shined bright as a crowd cried out in disappointment. The Phillies had scored another home run. On the other side of the house, my sister shrieked along with her friends in terror as they watched *Jeepers Creepers*. With all the commotion, my mom‚Äôs sharp laugh could be heard over it all, no doubt a few rounds deep in her favorite brandy.

There was nothing now. Not even the TV. Just complete silence as I stood outside the door.

I raised my fist to knock on the door but was greeted by my mom, who swung the door open. She wrapped her arms around me and squeezed me so tight I wondered how so much strength could come from such a small woman. I hugged her back with my free arm, squeezing her tight for a moment before letting it fall unsurely. She held on for a few beats too long, making me uncomfortable. Her hair was frazzled with a cigarette tucked in her ear, but her face was smiling. Her voice sounded nervous, almost like it was rehearsed. ‚ÄúCome in, come in, are you hungry? Oh, he‚Äôs just resting. He‚Äôs been waiting for you,‚Äù she said, slurring every other word.

I stood awkwardly in the living room. The color of the carpet had rotted into the same dark green of frogs Levi and I would catch in the neighborhood. The wallpaper was in tatters and stained yellow with decades of cigarette smoke. The leather on my dad‚Äôs old La-Z-Boy had been torn and fixed with electrical tape so often that the seat became just a mound of frayed material. Just below, my eyes were drawn to a large yellow stain that left a haunting, human-shaped ring in the middle of the floor. I pondered where it could‚Äôve come from when my mom interrupted, ‚ÄúYou must be tired from your trip. Do you want something to eat?‚Äù she asked in a singsong voice while she poured herself another sip of brandy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Mom, really. Where‚Äôs Dad?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel like wasting time anymore. The burning in my throat I had felt since getting off the plane wasn‚Äôt going anywhere until I could see my father. The walking, talking miracle.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting, dear. Why don‚Äôt you put away your clothes first? Or here, have some brandy,‚Äù she announced as she moved from the fridge to the sink, then to the shot glasses, fussing with anything that would give her purpose. I was getting irritated. This didn‚Äôt feel right.

I grabbed ahold of her shoulders and turned her to face me. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù I commanded, looking her dead in the eye. She shifted her eyes toward the bedroom and said softly, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in there.‚Äù I let her go and walked to my parents‚Äô bedroom, wrapping my fingers around the knob. I turned it but waited a moment before pushing it open. I decided to call out first. ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hear you right now, dear, he‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù Mom said, still standing in the kitchen.

I pushed the door open slowly. The room was filled with darkness, and I was filled with a heaviness as my heart began pounding inside my chest. A damp smell hit me first. Like the canal, only mixed with death and the smell of booze. Then the sound of running water. Why would they put a fountain in here? As I pushed the door open completely, I could see the shape of my dad turned away from me. Listening closely, I could hear him snoring. But the sound I heard coming from my dad wasn‚Äôt something that should come from a human. It was sickening. Squelching and sputtering. Coughing and hacking. It sounded like he was underwater. My eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw the source of the running water.

My knees shook as I struggled to keep myself upright. It came from him. With each sputter and burst of air came a steady stream of dark greenish-red water flowing from his mouth. Not just a dribble, but a stream expelling in violent bursts onto the sheets, soaking the ground below the bed. In the darkness, I could see his figure writhing with each exhale as he choked up more water. But through it all, he slept otherwise peacefully, never stirring or disrupting his sleep. I slammed the door shut and allowed my knees to buckle. My mom came up behind me and rested her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the story of Lazarus, son,‚Äù she said in my ear, ‚Äúonly Lazarus was called forth by Jesus. The Adelantado called your daddy back.‚Äù

When I was around nine, my parents took me and my sister for a road trip to New York City. I remember sitting in the backseat with my sister thinking that this trip was never going to end. Surrounded by fast food burger wrappers, I tried reading a book, only to quickly find out that‚Äôs exactly how you get carsick. With nothing else to do, my sister and I played the punch buggy game, where you call out Volkswagen Beetles and punch each other in the arm. We went back and forth for the entire 20-hour drive. At one point I had almost drifted off to sleep when my sister noticed something coming up in the distance. She stood up in the middle seat and leaned forward to get a better look. I had figured it was another one of the ten thousand alligators or wild hogs we passed. However, as we approached and saw her face shine with a mischievous smile, I knew it had to be something else. ‚ÄúPunch buggy!‚Äù she shouted as she laid into me repeatedly, punching me thirty or forty times as the Volkswagen dealership faded in our rearview mirror.

That was the memory that popped into my mind while staring at *The Sacrament of the Last Supper* painting by Salvador Dal√≠. It was a gift we got on that same trip. My dad had hung it up in that exact same spot over the dining room table over twenty years ago. It never really meant anything to us. Just a weird piece of art my parents showed off just for the hell of it. Once they were ‚Äúborn again,‚Äù it took on a whole new sanctity. That was about fifteen years ago, well before I joined the Navy.

I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking each time I listened to the sounds coming from my dad‚Äôs bedroom as I sat at the dinner table. Each time he breathed, my heart sank, and my eyes slammed shut in anticipation of the eventual sound of gurgling water. Across from me, Marlene took a bite off her plate and shot me a smile, as if the sound was just background music to her meal. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall hear that, right?‚Äù I finally asked in a low voice, almost drowned out by the rattling silverware. ‚ÄúYour daddy‚Äôs always snored, hon,‚Äù Mom responded, slurring her words. I ignored her. She had been a mess of brandy and tears since I walked in, refusing to let me call an ambulance for my father because ‚ÄúThem doctors don‚Äôt understand God‚Äôs will.‚Äù I had hoped my sister would be more reasonable. ‚ÄúMarlene, what the fuck happened to him?‚Äù I said, staring into her eyes. She chewed her food before responding.

‚ÄúWhen we found him, he was stone cold dead, Jack.‚Äù She wiped her mouth with a napkin. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve just choked on his vomit because we found him laying right there.‚Äù She pointed to the stain on the floor next to his recliner. ‚ÄúMom was at work, so there was nobody there to help him up. He died, just right there,‚Äù she said in a quiet voice that trembled with sadness and regret. ‚ÄúMom found him after she got off of work and called the pastor.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not the ambulance?‚Äù I blurted out, annoyed and frustrated.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mom shouted. ‚ÄúYou know your father is terrified of doctors,‚Äù she said, stumbling from her seat towards the liquor cabinet.

‚ÄúBecause he needed prayer, Jack. We sat up all night, just praying. Asking the Adelantado to return him.‚Äù Her dull, trembling tone was gone, replaced now by a righteous confidence I had never seen in her. ‚ÄúAnd it worked. By the next morning he was good as new,‚Äù she shrilled. ‚ÄúJust needs his rest is all.‚Äù I froze in disbelief. It felt like an eternity had passed before Levi joined in the conversation.

That‚Äôs when it clicked. The Adelantado. A royal name for Ponce de Le√≥n, the explorer of the 16th century who came to Florida looking for the Fountain of Youth. It was a legend told to schoolchildren around here. I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head.

‚ÄúListen, Jack.‚Äù He leaned forward in his seat, resting his arms on the table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone a while. Things have changed.‚Äù His eyes drew downward to his hands, which lay folded in front of him. ‚ÄúYou remember Pastor Scott, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Of course I did. Everyone in town did. He called himself a pastor, but I‚Äôve never met one like him. His sermons felt more like a rally. Folks screaming hallelujah and shaking uncontrollably. Some even ‚Äúspoke in tongues.‚Äù People around town ate it up. Especially my mom. To me, he was a fanatic. An overly cheerful, cult-like freak that preyed on people like my parents. He was just another reason I left.

My family had met him right after my sister left our house with my nephew. She ran off with a man we barely knew and we didn‚Äôt see her for seven years, with no warning. Just a note on the coffee table I discovered after coming home from school. I remember being a kid, in a dark and still house. A sense of longing. Watching my mother take to making jewelry to cope with the sadness. I remember her at our kitchen table, stringing together beads alone, trying to preoccupy herself. There were no Super Bowl parties after that. No more get-togethers. No more friends. Just us in that silent house. Rotting away.

That‚Äôs when my mom met Pastor Scott. A newcomer to our area. He bought a dilapidated pool bar on the coast, chalked white with sea spray. I remembered it as a place Levi and I could sneak a beer when we were teenagers, but now the pool tables and barstools were gone. Replaced by makeshift pews with polished floors from knees bent in reverence. It was a novelty in our area and attracted weirdos, addicts, and freaks from across the town. ‚ÄúThe Salvation Saloon: On the same bar stool where someone got stoned on Saturday night, someone else gets saved on Sunday morning,‚Äù hung on an old neon sign off the highway.

My parents never gave a damn about religion before that, but much to my chagrin, they began attending the Salvation Saloon while in the throes of their grief. Gradually, they began talking like Pastor Scott. Repeating his lines from church week after week. Slowly, I began feeling like the only sane one left in the house. I refused to set foot inside that place, electing instead to hang out at Levi‚Äôs house, my safe space away from this twisted version of religion.

Levi looked at my mom, then to Marlene. His mouth curled into a smile as he looked down at the table and said in a familiar dramatic, firebrand tone, ‚ÄúIt was his prayer that brought him back. Not them dang doctors. The Adelantado transformed your dad‚Äôs corpse into a fountain. A fountain of proof, for anyone with eyes to see, and made him whole.‚Äù

I sat back in my chair. Nothing made sense anymore. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you even talking about, Levi? You were raised Jewish!‚Äù My voice cracked, shocked at the change in my best friend. ‚ÄúMy dad is choking to death in the next room. There‚Äôs a puddle ankle-deep coming from underneath the door, and you all are acting like this is some fucking revival tent!‚Äù My mind couldn‚Äôt handle any more of this. Before I had left, I was always able to count on Levi as my escape to normalcy once my parents found the church. I would‚Äôve never thought he could be spewing this same nonsense. ‚ÄúWhen did you start believing in this shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúSince your dad brought me to‚Äî‚Äù

I spat my food out on the table before he could finish his sentence. My mom had cooked what used to be my favorite meal: bacon-wrapped chicken. But while chewing on my last bite, it had changed. It stuck to my teeth, stretching like hot glue between my molars. Black juice escaped out of my mouth and ran down my chin while the piece I had ejected squirmed on the table.

‚ÄúToo good for your mama‚Äôs cooking, Jack?‚Äù Mom yelled as she filled her glass.

I looked at my plate to find the wrapped chicken breast looking back at me before I keeled over. I put my head between my knees while gagging and hacking. The burning was back. Starting in my throat as before, then quickly licking up into my ears until they began to ring as if I was underwater. Nobody came to help. They looked at me with blank faces as if they had seen this before. Their lips moved as they gathered around me. I reached my hand out for help but received no reprieve. I gained some purchase on the tablecloth and pulled, sending the food crashing to the floor. I looked over at my mom, who held her glass up high, before everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was in my old room. The sheets smelled like mildew and smoke. The fan circled lazily above me. My mind raced as I lay in bed, unable to rest between the sounds and smells of the house. I was exhausted. So much had happened. So much had changed. I felt lost, like the people I loved no longer existed. It felt like I had lost a piece of who I was. I tried to think of simpler times. Of my dad. Not as he was in the next room over, but when he was the smartest person I knew.

We had taken the skiff out late one night for a fishing trip. I was about ten years old and had never been out so late with my dad before. We planned and packed meticulously the night before, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting off the bus, running straight home, and making sure everything was in place. The tackle box, the poles, our cooler, safety gear, flashlights. I checked all of it just as my dad had taught me. I was already at the door when he walked in. Even now I could picture him in his dirty work overalls, trying to untie his boots while I pestered him nonstop with a million questions about how we would see the fish at nighttime. Or if our flashlights and lanterns would provide enough light to hook our bait, met with a low ‚ÄúMhm‚Äù or ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù He moved slowly from taking off his mud-covered boots, to getting changed, to hitching the boat. All while remaining sharp and cold in his demeanor. As we took off to the jetty, he said to me, ‚ÄúNight fishing can be dangerous, son. Currents are strong around here. If you fall, don‚Äôt let the water take you.‚Äù I nodded, way too preoccupied with thoughts of being out under the stars with my old man to care about something as mundane as a safety brief.

We pushed off and headed up the coast, towards a spring called Weeki Wachee. It was a popular local destination with clear blue water. It took its name from the Ta√≠no Indians who told Ponce de Le√≥n about the Fountain of Youth. Even as a ten-year-old, the legend occupied no space in my mind. I was just excited to be out there with my dad. Under the moonlight in the middle of the ocean. The excitement drove me crazy.

When we got there, we cast our lines and sat in silence for a while, waiting for a bite. The moonlight was eaten by the water that appeared as a pool of inky black tar in the darkness. After a while I felt a tug on my pole. Then another. On the third tug, I was pulled off my feet and sent clear into the water. I tried to scream but only managed to let out a quick yelp before my voice was snuffed out by the brackish water. I held onto my pole as whatever gripped it dragged me deeper and deeper before I began to panic as the air in my lungs was expelled and I breathed in. Right at that moment, I felt a hand grab my hair, pulling me out and back onto the boat. I coughed uncontrollably as my dad turned me over and began pounding my back, yelling frantically, ‚ÄúGet it out, get it out!‚Äù I hurled up what I could before we packed up and headed home. Dad didn‚Äôt say a word. He seemed even more solemn and serious than before as he drove the boat directly back to the jetty.

I almost fell asleep when a sound erupted from the walls. The coughing and gurgling noises exploded, causing me to sit up and shake with fear. That‚Äôs when I heard it. My dad, calling my name.

I rushed to my parents‚Äô bedroom, splashing through the pool of water that seeped into the kitchen, and threw open my parents‚Äô door. That is where I saw my dad. Or what was left of him.

He sat upright in a pile of fabric pulp. His head lolled to the side as his mouth gaped open, his jaw unhinged and hung unnaturally low into his lap like it wanted to tear itself away. His skin, swollen and waterlogged, looked like meat left to brine for too long, splitting at the seams with every small movement he made.

Then his chest. Christ. It had ruptured. Burst open, exposing his ribs cracked apart like a weathered hull. Laying bare his heart that pulsed powerfully with thick, tar-colored sludge as if it wanted out. His lungs heaved like two drowned sponges.

The sheets swam in the puddles around him, and I swear I could see movement. The water seemed to tingle with life, and I could see small figures knotting and unknotting all around him. Finding new forms.

I looked up at his face. It was pale and swarmed with veins. His beard hung to his face, matted and interrupted by sharp tears in his jaw. And his eyes. Replaced by a waterfall of blood pouring out of his face. Mixing with the water still seeping out of his mouth. The greenish-red mixture dripped down what was left of him as he jerked his head quickly in my direction. ‚ÄúDo you see, son? Do you see? The fountain. Drink. It‚Äôs already inside you.‚Äù",1,1758686049.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

The oppressive humidity clung to my back like a slimy hand. I severed every relationship I had here years ago except for Levi. We had talked on the phone often while I was away. He was my last frayed connection to this place and a good friend since we were kids. That‚Äôs why I called him first when I got the news from my sister about our dad.

I scanned the parking garage for Levi but saw nobody I recognized. I remembered Levi as tall and heavyset, with thin arms and a gut like a turtle shell. His hair grew in a dense, knotted afro that resembled a dark cloud atop a face that always seemed to smile.

A man came from behind a row of parked cars calling my name, arms extended as if to give me a hug. His hair was long and curly but fell in thin, greasy strands in front of his face like old doorway beads. I could smell him before he got too close. I forced a smile and a hug, holding my breath as we embraced.

‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre finally back,‚Äù Levi said, letting me go as I caught my breath.

I took an extra step back, feeling an ocean of distance between us. ‚ÄúYeah, just wish it was under better circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúCircumstances don‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôre here now and that‚Äôs what counts. It‚Äôs what your dad would‚Äôve wanted,‚Äù he said, staring at me with caring eyes that seemed to sink into his face the longer I looked.

The mention of my dad made my heart drop. My mouth dried up as the familiar sensation in my throat returned. It burned and tore into my neck until it crawled its way into my ears. It was an affliction that no doctor could explain when I was younger and hadn‚Äôt been with me since I left the Gulf Coast. My words became trapped behind it. I leaned over to cough before I told Levi the real reason I was back. ‚ÄúHe came back, Levi. He‚Äôs alive.‚Äù I got the words out before being thrown into a coughing fit, desperately looking through my backpack for some water and trying to control my breathing. My mind felt like a whirlwind. I thought about how I could explain to Levi how this was even possible but, in the end, I didn‚Äôt need to. I met Levi‚Äôs gaze again. His smile was from ear to ear. ‚ÄúHe was never supposed to stay gone.‚Äù Confused, I decided to let the comment slide. He had been closer to my dad the last decade. Maybe it was just his way of saying he missed him.

We rode in silence for a while. Green cow pastures rolled by my window. The large green expanses melted away into rows of hollow strip malls, liquor stores, and parking lots. The sidewalks were captured by the Florida crabgrass years ago.

People don‚Äôt smile around here. Most people stayed in their cars or inside their homes, but every once in a while, you could see someone outside. They were normally craning their entire bodies in inhuman ways, eyes closed and mouth agape, panhandling at the red lights, scaring motorists with their erratic, violent gestures of frustration or excitement.

As we neared my parents‚Äô house, I spotted the turn that led to the jetty that Levi and I would launch from on our fishing trips. I lifted my head from the passenger window and sat up and shouted in excitement, ‚ÄúHoly shit, remember my dad‚Äôs old skiff? We would send off from there, right?‚Äù Levi‚Äôs road trance broke and he turned to me. ‚ÄúYep, that old jetty has a lot of history.‚Äù He cleared his throat, making a gurgling noise that sounded like he was underwater. ‚ÄúWanna see it?‚Äù he asked. I accepted. My stomach had been twisting in tighter knots as we approached my parents‚Äô house, and I was in no rush to see them. Levi made a U-turn and peeled off down the long road to the jetty.

Everything was different than how I remembered it. The long road to the pier was cracked and potted everywhere like a warzone. The grass that grew on either side reached my chest from years of neglect. The old pier at the jetty had collapsed in the last hurricane and lay half buried by the seawater. Its old wooden supports jutted out of the water as if they were straining for air. What happened? The community I remembered would‚Äôve never let a pier waste away like this. ‚ÄúSchool hasn‚Äôt started here yet, has it? This place used to be packed with kids taking out their dad‚Äôs boats all summer long,‚Äù I said to Levi, my eyes still fixed on the canal. Levi pulled out a pack of cigarettes and handed me one. ‚ÄúThe hurricane didn‚Äôt just tear down the pier, it washed something up out of the mud and brought it with the tide. People started saying the water was cursed. You know how folks talk.‚Äù I sat back in my seat and let out a long sigh. I was in town for almost an hour and already felt as if I couldn‚Äôt recognize it.

I called out to Levi to follow me outside to smoke. I cracked my door open first and was immediately assaulted by the most putrid smell. I gagged. It smelled like a mixture of rotting algae, dead fish, and saltwater. I slammed the door shut looking for any relief from the stench, but it was no use. Levi had already exited the car and left his door open and was now smoking a cigarette and leaned against his hood. I lit the cigarette and took a heavy inhale, trying to replace the noxious odor with the familiar poison of cigarette smoke. It worked well enough. Levi flicked the ash off his cigarette and spit into the canal. ‚ÄúLooks different than you remember, huh? You remember that time we went shark fishing?‚Äù

I laughed at myself. ‚ÄúYeah, you mean when that chum bag got demolished and I almost shit myself?‚Äù

Levi cackled through a plume of smoke. ‚ÄúYup! We caught that sucker though. Tasted like steak from what I remember.‚Äù

I smiled as I pulled another puff of the cigarette. I was leaned up against the hood when my phone rang. Marlene. I answered with fake enthusiasm. ‚ÄúHey, sis.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù She sounded impatient, like I was late for something. I didn‚Äôt even tell her I had landed.

‚ÄúOn my way now with Levi. I should be there soon,‚Äù I said apologetically.

‚ÄúGood, hurry up, dad‚Äôs excited to see you. We all are.‚Äù The pit moved from my stomach into my chest as I paced up and down the shore. I assured her I would be there soon and hung up.

I stepped out from behind the car and saw Levi, ankle-deep in the water. He reached down and wet his fingers. Lifting them up slowly, it looked like he wiped an X across his face. Then he just stood there. His eyes were closed but looked as if his gaze was fixed on something. I figured he was just cooling off. Florida heat will make you do weird shit. At least I knew why he smelled so bad. I told him we‚Äôd better get going.

I watched Levi slowly walk out of the water. Each step he took was like he was lifting his shoe out of quicksand. Behind him, the water, it was‚Ä¶gurgling. The spot where Levi had stood began erupting into a boil and made a sound unlike anything I‚Äôd ever heard. I had spent my life on these shores, and I had never heard the water sound like that. It sounded almost human. Like a deep, low drone you might hear when your grandad gets up from the couch. I glanced at Levi to see if he noticed, but he was too busy wiping the mud off his shoe on a rock. ‚ÄúAt least the fish stuck around,‚Äù I muttered, forcing a laugh. Levi shot me a smile and a halfhearted laugh as he opened the door and climbed inside the car. I followed, slamming the car door and rolling up the window tight.

I spent a few moments outside the house. Just listening.

When I was a kid, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays went to the World Series. Levi and I had rushed back after playing Halo over at his house to find parked cars that lined both sides of the street as we turned onto the cul-de-sac. My house was on the corner lot. The hooting and hollering poured out of our windows, shattering the silence of our quiet suburban street. Our porch shined bright as a crowd cried out in disappointment. The Phillies had scored another home run. On the other side of the house, my sister shrieked along with her friends in terror as they watched *Jeepers Creepers*. With all the commotion, my mom‚Äôs sharp laugh could be heard over it all, no doubt a few rounds deep in her favorite brandy.

There was nothing now. Not even the TV. Just complete silence as I stood outside the door.

She wrapped her arms around me and squeezed me so tight I wondered how so much strength could come from such a small woman. I hugged her back with my free arm, squeezing her tight for a moment before letting it fall unsurely. She held on for a few beats too long, making me uncomfortable. Her hair was frazzled with a cigarette tucked in her ear, but her face was smiling. Her voice sounded nervous, almost like it was rehearsed. ‚ÄúCome in, come in, are you hungry? Oh, he‚Äôs just resting. He‚Äôs been waiting for you,‚Äù she said, slurring every other word.

I stood awkwardly in the living room. The color of the carpet had rotted into the same dark green of frogs Levi and I would catch in the neighborhood. The wallpaper was in tatters and stained yellow with decades of cigarette smoke. The leather on my dad‚Äôs old La-Z-Boy had been torn and fixed with electrical tape so often that the seat became just a mound of frayed material. Just below, my eyes were drawn to a large yellow stain that left a haunting, human-shaped ring in the middle of the floor. I pondered where it could‚Äôve come from when my mom interrupted, ‚ÄúYou must be tired from your trip. Do you want something to eat?‚Äù she asked in a singsong voice while she poured herself another sip of brandy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Mom, really. Where‚Äôs Dad?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel like wasting time anymore. The burning in my throat I had felt since getting off the plane wasn‚Äôt going anywhere until I could see my father. The walking, talking miracle.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting, dear. Why don‚Äôt you put away your clothes first? Or here, have some brandy,‚Äù she announced as she moved from the fridge to the sink, then to the shot glasses, fussing with anything that would give her purpose. I was getting irritated. This didn‚Äôt feel right.

I grabbed ahold of her shoulders and turned her to face me. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù I commanded, looking her dead in the eye. She shifted her eyes toward the bedroom and said softly, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in there.‚Äù I let her go and walked to my parents‚Äô bedroom, wrapping my fingers around the knob. I turned it but waited a moment before pushing it open. I decided to call out first. ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hear you right now, dear, he‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù Mom said, still standing in the kitchen.

I pushed the door open slowly. The room was filled with darkness, and I was filled with a heaviness as my heart began pounding inside my chest. A damp smell hit me first. Like the canal, only mixed with death and the smell of booze. Then the sound of running water. Why would they put a fountain in here? As I pushed the door open completely, I could see the shape of my dad turned away from me. Listening closely, I could hear him snoring. But the sound I heard coming from my dad wasn‚Äôt something that should come from a human. It was sickening. Squelching and sputtering. Coughing and hacking. It sounded like he was underwater. My eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw the source of the running water.

My knees shook as I struggled to keep myself upright. It came from him. With each sputter and burst of air came a steady stream of dark greenish-red water flowing from his mouth. Not just a dribble, but a stream expelling in violent bursts onto the sheets, soaking the ground below the bed. In the darkness, I could see his figure writhing with each exhale as he choked up more water. But through it all, he slept otherwise peacefully, never stirring or disrupting his sleep. I slammed the door shut and allowed my knees to buckle. My mom came up behind me and rested her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the story of Lazarus, son,‚Äù she said in my ear, ‚Äúonly Lazarus was called forth by Jesus. The Adelantado called your daddy back.‚Äù

With nothing else to do, my sister and I played the punch buggy game, where you call out Volkswagen Beetles and punch each other in the arm. We went back and forth for the entire 20-hour drive. At one point I had almost drifted off to sleep when my sister noticed something coming up in the distance. She stood up in the middle seat and leaned forward to get a better look. I had figured it was another one of the ten thousand alligators or wild hogs we passed. However, as we approached and saw her face shine with a mischievous smile, I knew it had to be something else. ‚ÄúPunch buggy!‚Äù she shouted as she laid into me repeatedly, punching me thirty or forty times as the Volkswagen dealership faded in our rearview mirror.

That was the memory that popped into my mind while staring at *The Sacrament of the Last Supper* painting by Salvador Dal√≠. It was a gift we got on that same trip. My dad had hung it up in that exact same spot over the dining room table over twenty years ago. It never really meant anything to us. Just a weird piece of art my parents showed off just for the hell of it. Once they were ‚Äúborn again,‚Äù it took on a whole new sanctity. That was about fifteen years ago, well before I joined the Navy.

I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking each time I listened to the sounds coming from my dad‚Äôs bedroom as I sat at the dinner table. Each time he breathed, my heart sank, and my eyes slammed shut in anticipation of the eventual sound of gurgling water. Across from me, Marlene took a bite off her plate and shot me a smile, as if the sound was just background music to her meal. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall hear that, right?‚Äù I finally asked in a low voice, almost drowned out by the rattling silverware. ‚ÄúYour daddy‚Äôs always snored, hon,‚Äù Mom responded, slurring her words. I ignored her. She had been a mess of brandy and tears since I walked in, refusing to let me call an ambulance for my father because ‚ÄúThem doctors don‚Äôt understand God‚Äôs will.‚Äù I had hoped my sister would be more reasonable. ‚ÄúMarlene, what the fuck happened to him?‚Äù I said, staring into her eyes. She chewed her food before responding.

‚ÄúWhen we found him, he was stone cold dead, Jack.‚Äù She wiped her mouth with a napkin. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve just choked on his vomit because we found him laying right there.‚Äù She pointed to the stain on the floor next to his recliner. ‚ÄúMom was at work, so there was nobody there to help him up. He died, just right there,‚Äù she said in a quiet voice that trembled with sadness and regret. ‚ÄúMom found him after she got off of work and called the pastor.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not the ambulance?‚Äù I blurted out, annoyed and frustrated.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mom shouted. ‚ÄúYou know your father is terrified of doctors,‚Äù she said, stumbling from her seat towards the liquor cabinet.

‚ÄúBecause he needed prayer, Jack. We sat up all night, just praying. Asking the Adelantado to return him.‚Äù Her dull, trembling tone was gone, replaced now by a righteous confidence I had never seen in her. ‚ÄúAnd it worked. By the next morning he was good as new,‚Äù she shrilled. ‚ÄúJust needs his rest is all.‚Äù I froze in disbelief. It felt like an eternity had passed before Levi joined in the conversation.

That‚Äôs when it clicked. The Adelantado. A royal name for Ponce de Le√≥n, the explorer of the 16th century who came to Florida looking for the Fountain of Youth. It was a legend told to schoolchildren around here. I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head.

‚ÄúListen, Jack.‚Äù He leaned forward in his seat, resting his arms on the table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone a while. Things have changed.‚Äù His eyes drew downward to his hands, which lay folded in front of him. ‚ÄúYou remember Pastor Scott, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Of course I did. Everyone in town did. He called himself a pastor, but I‚Äôve never met one like him. His sermons felt more like a rally. Folks screaming hallelujah and shaking uncontrollably. Some even ‚Äúspoke in tongues.‚Äù People around town ate it up. Especially my mom. To me, he was a fanatic. An overly cheerful, cult-like freak that preyed on people like my parents. He was just another reason I left.

My family had met him right after my sister left our house with my nephew. She ran off with a man we barely knew and we didn‚Äôt see her for seven years, with no warning. Just a note on the coffee table I discovered after coming home from school. I remember being a kid, in a dark and still house. A sense of longing. Watching my mother take to making jewelry to cope with the sadness. I remember her at our kitchen table, stringing together beads alone, trying to preoccupy herself. There were no Super Bowl parties after that. No more get-togethers. No more friends. Just us in that silent house. Rotting away.

That‚Äôs when my mom met Pastor Scott. A newcomer to our area. He bought a dilapidated pool bar on the coast, chalked white with sea spray. I remembered it as a place Levi and I could sneak a beer when we were teenagers, but now the pool tables and barstools were gone. Replaced by makeshift pews with polished floors from knees bent in reverence. It was a novelty in our area and attracted weirdos, addicts, and freaks from across the town. ‚ÄúThe Salvation Saloon: On the same bar stool where someone got stoned on Saturday night, someone else gets saved on Sunday morning,‚Äù hung on an old neon sign off the highway.

My parents never gave a damn about religion before that, but much to my chagrin, they began attending the Salvation Saloon while in the throes of their grief. Gradually, they began talking like Pastor Scott. Repeating his lines from church week after week. Slowly, I began feeling like the only sane one left in the house. I refused to set foot inside that place, electing instead to hang out at Levi‚Äôs house, my safe space away from this twisted version of religion.

Levi looked at my mom, then to Marlene. His mouth curled into a smile as he looked down at the table and said in a familiar dramatic, firebrand tone, ‚ÄúIt was his prayer that brought him back. Not them dang doctors. The Adelantado transformed your dad‚Äôs corpse into a fountain. A fountain of proof, for anyone with eyes to see, and made him whole.‚Äù

I sat back in my chair. Nothing made sense anymore. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you even talking about, Levi? You were raised Jewish!‚Äù My voice cracked, shocked at the change in my best friend. ‚ÄúMy dad is choking to death in the next room. There‚Äôs a puddle ankle-deep coming from underneath the door, and you all are acting like this is some fucking revival tent!‚Äù My mind couldn‚Äôt handle any more of this. Before I had left, I was always able to count on Levi as my escape to normalcy once my parents found the church. I would‚Äôve never thought he could be spewing this same nonsense. ‚ÄúWhen did you start believing in this shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúSince your dad brought me to‚Äî‚Äù

I spat my food out on the table before he could finish his sentence. My mom had cooked what used to be my favorite meal: bacon-wrapped chicken. But while chewing on my last bite, it had changed. It stuck to my teeth, stretching like hot glue between my molars. Black juice escaped out of my mouth and ran down my chin while the piece I had ejected squirmed on the table.

‚ÄúToo good for your mama‚Äôs cooking, Jack?‚Äù Mom yelled as she filled her glass.

I looked at my plate to find the wrapped chicken breast looking back at me before I keeled over. I put my head between my knees while gagging and hacking. The burning was back. Starting in my throat as before, then quickly licking up into my ears until they began to ring as if I was underwater. Nobody came to help. They looked at me with blank faces as if they had seen this before. Their lips moved as they gathered around me. I reached my hand out for help but received no reprieve. I gained some purchase on the tablecloth and pulled, sending the food crashing to the floor. I looked over at my mom, who held her glass up high, before everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was in my old room. The sheets smelled like mildew and smoke. The fan circled lazily above me. My mind raced as I lay in bed, unable to rest between the sounds and smells of the house. I was exhausted. So much had happened. So much had changed. I felt lost, like the people I loved no longer existed. It felt like I had lost a piece of who I was. I tried to think of simpler times. Of my dad. Not as he was in the next room over, but when he was the smartest person I knew.

We had taken the skiff out late one night for a fishing trip. I was about ten years old and had never been out so late with my dad before. We planned and packed meticulously the night before, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting off the bus, running straight home, and making sure everything was in place. The tackle box, the poles, our cooler, safety gear, flashlights. I checked all of it just as my dad had taught me. I was already at the door when he walked in. Even now I could picture him in his dirty work overalls, trying to untie his boots while I pestered him nonstop with a million questions about how we would see the fish at nighttime. Or if our flashlights and lanterns would provide enough light to hook our bait, met with a low ‚ÄúMhm‚Äù or ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù He moved slowly from taking off his mud-covered boots, to getting changed, to hitching the boat. All while remaining sharp and cold in his demeanor. As we took off to the jetty, he said to me, ‚ÄúNight fishing can be dangerous, son. Currents are strong around here. If you fall, don‚Äôt let the water take you.‚Äù I nodded, way too preoccupied with thoughts of being out under the stars with my old man to care about something as mundane as a safety brief.

We pushed off and headed up the coast, towards a spring called Weeki Wachee. It was a popular local destination with clear blue water. It took its name from the Ta√≠no Indians who told Ponce de Le√≥n about the Fountain of Youth. Even as a ten-year-old, the legend occupied no space in my mind. I was just excited to be out there with my dad. Under the moonlight in the middle of the ocean. The excitement drove me crazy.

When we got there, we cast our lines and sat in silence for a while, waiting for a bite. The moonlight was eaten by the water that appeared as a pool of inky black tar in the darkness. After a while I felt a tug on my pole. Then another. On the third tug, I was pulled off my feet and sent clear into the water. I tried to scream but only managed to let out a quick yelp before my voice was snuffed out by the brackish water. I held onto my pole as whatever gripped it dragged me deeper and deeper before I began to panic as the air in my lungs was expelled and I breathed in. Right at that moment, I felt a hand grab my hair, pulling me out and back onto the boat. I coughed uncontrollably as my dad turned me over and began pounding my back, yelling frantically, ‚ÄúGet it out, get it out!‚Äù I hurled up what I could before we packed up and headed home. Dad didn‚Äôt say a word. He seemed even more solemn and serious than before as he drove the boat directly back to the jetty.

I almost fell asleep when a sound erupted from the walls. The coughing and gurgling noises exploded, causing me to sit up and shake with fear. That‚Äôs when I heard it. My dad, calling my name.

I rushed to my parents‚Äô bedroom, splashing through the pool of water that seeped into the kitchen, and threw open my parents‚Äô door. That is where I saw my dad. Or what was left of him.

He sat upright in a pile of fabric pulp. His head lolled to the side as his mouth gaped open, his jaw unhinged and hung unnaturally low into his lap like it wanted to tear itself away. His skin, swollen and waterlogged, looked like meat left to brine for too long, splitting at the seams with every small movement he made.

Then his chest. Christ. It had ruptured. Burst open, exposing his ribs cracked apart like a weathered hull. Laying bare his heart that pulsed powerfully with thick, tar-colored sludge as if it wanted out. His lungs heaved like two drowned sponges.

The sheets swam in the puddles around him, and I swear I could see movement. The water seemed to tingle with life, and I could see small figures knotting and unknotting all around him. Finding new forms.

I looked up at his face. It was pale and swarmed with veins. His beard hung to his face, matted and interrupted by sharp tears in his jaw. And his eyes. Replaced by a waterfall of blood pouring out of his face. Mixing with the water still seeping out of his mouth. The greenish-red mixture dripped down what was left of him as he jerked his head quickly in my direction. ‚ÄúDo you see, son? Do you see? The fountain. Drink. It‚Äôs already inside you.‚Äù",1,1758685971.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1st Helpful bystander; woman with curly dark hair in her late 30‚Äôs, on her way to work in a red (I think) car. Turning into a medical center in Sacramento proper, but just at the edge of West Sac near the river. Not dressed in scrubs but professionally. She had dark acrylic nails with parts of blue surrounded by gold that made me think of gemstones. She told me at one point she was calling her supervisor about being delayed, which is why I think she worked in the medical center. 

Me; 30f in a long black dress with short brown hair. Sitting on the side of the road about ten feet away from my totaled car. 

You stopped and asked if I was okay. I nodded but you still pulled over and asked what happened. I told you that I had been in accident, the other driver had limited/no damage so we had exchanged information and he left, but I wasn‚Äôt able to move my car.  I had called 911 but was told no one was available for response. I explained that I had contacted my insurance for roadside assistance but I was being asked to download the app/make an account/verify my email and I kept getting errors saying my account number or email wasn‚Äôt accurate. I‚Äôm pretty sure you watched while I said ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù on the phone for a few minutes before I hung up. 

Finally, I got through to my insurance agent, who was asking me to restart my phone, try signing in with another email, guess my dads birthday to get into his account, when you angled the phone and asked what his role was. Said something along the the lines of ‚Äúshe‚Äôs crying on the side of the road, her car is totaled, she is injured, the car is blocking traffic, and you don‚Äôt know what to do? Isn‚Äôt that your job??‚Äù 

I want you to know, that probably woke him up more than his delayed cup of coffee. After that interaction, he called me consistently with every update. He started answering the phone saying ‚Äúhi, OP. How are you feeling? What can I do?‚Äù I‚Äôve had this insurance for several years, and it‚Äôs never streamlined this effectively before. A tow truck was called and I didn‚Äôt have to pay anything up front, I already have a figure for my totaled car, I have a rental that is covered, and it looks like I‚Äôll have a new vehicle in a day or two. 

Whoever you are, I just wanted to thank you for taking time to comfort a rattled neighbor who had never been in an accident before. For standing up for a stranger when she was too jittery and likely in shock. For helping me when I needed it, even if I wasn‚Äôt good at asking for it. My parents were quite grateful to you as well. 

You left when law enforcement unexpectedly arrived and said you had to get to work. Thank you for stopping, and I‚Äôm safe and okay (though you were right, I‚Äôm feeling the bruises now that the shock has worn off). 

Second good neighbor; man in his mid to late 20s, dark hair and eyes, gave me his name and contact info which I obviously won‚Äôt post. Is a nursing student in the area and ran over after the accident. In the few seconds after an accident, nothing feels real, and you helped hold me together for a moment. Just helping me exit the car, take me to the side of the road, and call 911 for me was so much help. Just as I gathered myself and figured out what happened. You spoke to law enforcement later and gave a statement, and even said you were available to talk if I needed someone. The statement, btw, was provided to insurance and really helped streamline things. You had to leave for class but we texted a few times and I‚Äôm so grateful for your presence.  You steadied me and made the situation so much easier to navigate to know I had a few seconds to catch my breath because you were helping us navigate the situation. My parents likewise send their gratitude for helping their kid in a time of crisis.

Ever feel like you're just... spinning your wheels? You're busy, you're trying hard, but that next level, that feeling of *thriving*, just seems out of reach. I've been there, and I realized that massive changes often come from tiny, almost ridiculously simple shifts.

It‚Äôs less about a total life overhaul and more about strategic ""hacks"" that create breathing room. Here are a few that have been game-changers for me:

*   **The ""Energy Audit"" not a Time Audit.** We obsess over our 24 hours, but what about our energy levels? For one day, just notice what gives you energy and what drains it. A 30-minute meeting with a specific person might drain you more than 2 hours of focused work. Reschedule your days around your energy, not just the clock. It's a total paradigm shift.

*   **Stack Your Habits to Something You Already Do.** Trying to start a daily journaling habit? Don't just add it to your to-do list. Do it for two minutes *immediately* after you brush your teeth. Trying to drink more water? Chug a glass right after your morning coffee. Link the new, desired habit to an old, automatic one. Your brain will barely notice the extra work.

*   **The ""10-Minute Tidy"" Power-Up.** A cluttered space can lead to a cluttered mind. Before you finish work for the day, or before you go to bed, set a timer for 10 minutes and just... tidy. You'd be shocked at what you can accomplish. It's not about deep cleaning; it's about resetting your environment, which in turn resets your mind for the next day.

But here‚Äôs the real secret: these ""hacks"" aren't just about productivity. They're about creating mental and emotional space. When you're not constantly fighting fires and feeling overwhelmed, you finally have the quiet to ask yourself the bigger questions. To figure out what you *really* want.

That's the part where you start to unlock your best self, and honestly, the emotional side of growth is where a lot of us get stuck. It can be messy and confusing. Having a structured way to process things can be a game-changer. I've found that having a clear plan makes all the difference, and **this resource (affiliate link)** was incredibly helpful for sorting through that mental clutter.

It's not about one giant leap. It's about these small, consistent optimizations that add up. Suddenly, you look up one day and realize you're not just surviving anymore. You're actually building momentum and starting to thrive.

So, I‚Äôm curious to hear from you all. What's one tiny ""hack"" or shift in perspective that has had a surprisingly huge impact on your life?",1,1758685494.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Apparently the living room has a screen that he pulls shut to sleep, for some privacy. He's got a bunch of good reviews so it all seems legit.

Anyway - first time as an airbnb guest where the host will be staying on site. I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal.
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room?

for my first restriction at 19 yrs old, i ate nothing for 23 days, no supplements or food, just plain old water.

 3 months after that, i went abroad to live alone. since i got there, i mostly ate 2 bread and 1 cup of coffee a day for like 6 months. sometimes, i would eat burgers, chicken and rice, milk, yogurt, chocolate but it is really rare.

 after doing that for like 6 months, i ate nothing for 5 days, and then ate normally for like a week, then i ate nothing for 14 days.

 after that, i started eating normally again, tried to hit my tdee, but my diet mostly consisted of chicken and rice, eggs, instant noodles and sardines, no veggies at all or other food. i thought that i was finally gonna heal my body again, at least by eating my tdee .

 but after doing that for like 2 months, the most important person to me told someone that im fat and i overheard it. so i started eating 200kcal a day and walked 30k to 60k steps per day . i did this for about 3 months. 

after this, i went to live with my uncle and aunt for 1 month. they told me how thin and frail i was and made sure i ate 3 meals a day. 

after going back to my place, i started eating one meal a day again with just chicken and rice, sometimes added milk, cupcake, chocolate to my diet. sometimes i tend to overeat and punish myself with sh for it.

 3 months after coming back from my uncle's place, i started eating only 2 eggs a day and did HIIT workouts for at least 2 hrs a day. i did this for a month. and then i went to my bf's place for a week. he made sure i ate properly. after that, i went to my parents' house for a month. i ate properly there too.

my bf always tries to remind me to eat but i still struggle. i do overeat alot of times but also restrict harshly it feels punishing, makes me dizzy, faint, breathing problems. i hate myself alot, i have a scale and i step on it at least 6 times daily. i measure my waist alot too everyday, and punish myself in harsh ways when i overeat.

1np1xx0,https://businessnc.com/greensboro-seeks-more-connected-downtown/,Downtown Greensboro getting a facelift over the next decade,"By [Chris Burritt](https://businessnc.com/author/cburritt/) 09/23/2025

  
Over the next decade, Greensboro leaders aim to address problems common to many downtown areas: vacant storefronts and a lack of street parking.

As the Piedmont Triad emerges as a magnet for major economic developments, most recently California-based JetZero and its pledge of more than 14,500 jobs, Downtown Greensboro Inc. unveiled its¬†[10-year blueprint](https://www.downtowngreensboro.org/thrive-35-downtown-greensboro-strategic-vision-plan/)¬†for the center city. Aside from adding more visitors downtown, it sets a goal to draw 5,000 new residents, add or expand more than 100 street-level businesses and create 3,000 new jobs.¬†

‚ÄúWhen people leave here and come back, you want them to say, ‚Äòyou‚Äôve come a long way, baby,‚Äô‚Äù said John Swaine, CEO of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum downtown.¬†

Getting there is pegged to addressing decades-old challenges with the guidance of the city‚Äôs¬†[movers and shakers](https://www.downtowngreensboro.org/meet-the-team/steering-committee/)¬†in business, economic development, real estate, higher education and foundations. They‚Äôve come together in the downtown‚Äôs Thrive35 Strategic Vision Plan, released earlier last week after community meetings and focus groups with 2,500 people.

The plan casts an ambitious arc with a focus on increasing connectivity. Eliminating empty storefronts on Elm and other major streets will create a more welcoming environment for downtown goers; completing the¬†[Downtown Greenway](https://downtowngreenway.org/)¬†biking and walking trail will enhance recreational opportunities and reduce reliance on automobiles.

Those are examples cited by Swaine and nine other civic leaders, business owners, real estate professionals and others who talked in a 30-minute video promoting the plan to remake downtown. While their spin was positive, they expressed the need for addressing unresolved problems over the next decade.

Creating more entertainment and adding jobs downtown may slow Greensboro‚Äôs loss of university graduates, according to Amber Fairchild, a UNC Greensboro student. It, A&T State University, Greensboro College and Bennett College are part of the downtown area where job creation would create more opportunity for internships and employment for students, she said.

‚ÄúSeeing what you could be outside of college is so important,‚Äù Fairchild said.

Business owners hope the plan will plug holes downtown in various ways.

‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I think our downtown is not so much about content as much as it is connectivity,‚Äù said Daniel Davidson, owner of Union Coffee and co-owner of¬†[Abbey Taphouse](https://www.theabbeytaphouse.com/).¬†

‚ÄúIf the goal is to attract more life to the downtown area, the empty storefronts are one of the biggest challenges to that,‚Äù said Dominick Amendum, general manager of the Pyrle Theater, a music venue under development in the former location of¬†[Triad Stage](https://theacgg.org/artsnews/farewell-to-triad-stage/). Downtown ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt always felt vibrant and exciting and like things were happening when you walked around downtown. I see that starting to change.‚Äù

Big downtown developer Roy Carroll, the billionaire CEO of¬†[Carroll Cos.,](https://thecarrollcompanies.com/)¬†is advancing plans for the $150 million Carroll at Parkside mixed-use project. It will be anchored by a nine-story AC Hotel, adding to the hotel rooms and apartment units already owned by Carroll downtown.

The hotel‚Äôs rooftop restaurant and bar will aim for people visiting downtown for dining and entertainment at venues such as the¬†[Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.tangercenter.com/). Even as the number of breweries and other establishments has grown in recent years, vacancies linger as a problem.

Some downtown businesses are hard to find, Davidson said, as ‚Äúthey‚Äôre hidden between a lot of these vacancies and some of these construction zones. You‚Äôre not just parking‚Ä¶just to get to a business that has worked really hard and spent their hard-earned money to create that atmosphere that is welcoming.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are vacant storefronts; there are vacant lots,‚Äù said Anthony Cordo, CEO of the Greensboro/Guilford¬†County¬†Tourism¬†Development¬†Authority. ‚ÄúI see that as a huge opportunity. We have the ability to paint a picture here that you don‚Äôt get in a whole lot of communities.‚Äù

A major blank space is the former site of the News & Record building. This past July, a¬†[partnership](https://cfgg.org/center-city-partners-llc-acquires-downtown-greensboro-site-for-development/)¬†encompassing the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro and other foundations and individuals bought nearly 7 acres of the former newspaper operations, with a goal for the development of the tract.

The property abuts Church Street, one of the areas envisioned for revitalization over the next decade. It‚Äôs home to the historic Southern Railway train depot, now the J. Douglas Galyon Depot, that serves as a stop for Amtrak, Greyhound and city buses.¬†

‚ÄúChurch Street is a blank palette‚Äù for a mix of development that builds upon historic structures and the demolition of other buildings for ‚Äúmixed use with a modern flavor,‚Äù according to commercial developer Sam Simpson.

Civil rights museum CEO Swaine sees an urgency to remake downtown as the region attracts major employers such as Toyota Battery Manufacturing and futurist plane makers Boom Supersonic and¬†[JetZero](https://businessnc.com/greensboro-airport-still-recruiting-after-jet-zero-win-2/).

People relocating for jobs ‚Äúneed something to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey need theaters; they need entertainment. These components are essential for building a healthy community.‚Äù",2,1758684867.0,CarolinaNorth,0,1.0,False

1np1tna,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np1tna,I made a mask and I got a fit to go along with it!!,"**Here's the progression of how the mask used to look like before and how it is now!!**  
**This never was intended to be based on the Meadowlark/Yaelokre. it would've been another fox mask of mine, the zipper being a cool new addition to it. And so I got into Yaelokre and yeah**  
**Actually where should I have tagged this as? OC or cosplay?**  
**I think this leans more to oc stuff**

***Some additional lore + oc stuff (it's pretty long so feel free to ignore):***  
It's name is Baurns. They're a mask maker who sat up shop somewhere near  
the park of Felicity (assuming they have one because of the Cole's Response trailer).  
  
I have not yet fully expanded on their lore, but I would've added that they made the Lark's mask, but I felt weird and scrapped that part out of their lore.

***Is it a fox? Is it a goat? A Foat??***

Yes yes yes! Fox and a Goat.  
The goat side is more dominant in the mask; the messy clumped fur and the long brown horns.  
  
The horns are a bit of an inconvenience, sometimes bumping into doors, people, and the fact it doesn't even fit in a bag. It's same way as how they view their emotions. They are irritable, spiteful and overly critical of themselves that it disturbs and annoys others.

The messy unkept fur (it's like that cuz the paint sticks to some of the fur), represents how they're really stinky... HAH, just kidding, but they do smell like flour and ashes.  
They go for just a few days without bathing, probably because they're too busy creating masks they end up passing out on the table, then waking up to continue work on it. Maybe they'll get a cup of coffee or a small snack if they feel like it.

The fox of course is less dominant, the ears being its most noticeable feature, and the slightly longer snout.

A fox is what they aspire to be more like. Cunning, wise, and adaptable.  
In a way, they're sort of like one, they just don't see it in themselves.  
Foxes can be playful, creative, curious, and gregarious.

The bloodied eyes and zipper in the middle is just a cool auraful addition lol  
I don't even think zippers ever existed yet in the Meadowlark cuz the earliest zipper from what I found was invented in ""1892""

People here either say it takes place at  14th-15th, or 15-16th, or even 16th-18th. So let's just pretend the zipper was invented way earlier in the Meadowlark universe XDDD",2,1758684490.0,yaelokre,0,1.0,False

The first time we hung out, we got coffee, which turned into going back to his house for drinks, then dinner, then a night out drinking. I really enjoyed it. He won me several stuffed animals at the arcade and even kept winning more to give to kids there ‚Äî I thought it was so sweet.

Since then, we‚Äôd periodically grab dinner and text throughout the day. I told him I liked him, but he didn‚Äôt really acknowledge it. When he passed a big test, I got him flowers, and he just seemed shy about it.

One night, I texted him basically saying: ‚ÄúI like you, but I‚Äôm going to stop pursuing you because you don‚Äôt seem to feel the same way (or so I thought?!). If you are, the ball‚Äôs in your court.‚Äù

Fast-forward to the night before his birthday: he invited me to hang out. We got super drunk, I took him home, and while we were in bed he put my hand on him and initiated sex. At one point he even said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been wanting daddy‚Äôs d**.‚Äù* The next morning, he apologized and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do this,‚Äù and we barely spoke that day.

Here‚Äôs the problem: I like him. I can‚Äôt just erase it. That night he was all over me ‚Äî kissing me, calling me his man in front of people. I brushed it off as drunk talk, but it still made me feel good. Later, though, I found out he told someone else we‚Äôd ‚Äúbeen hooking up for a while‚Äù (not true) and compared me to his other flings. The worst part is, he said this to a mutual friend of mine, and it got back to me. I was pissed.

The next day I tried to clear my head by taking a trip to the mountains. That night when I got back, an ED nurse invited me out for drinks. I had vented to her about everything earlier in the day. While I was waiting for her, he asked to call me. While I was on the phone, she showed up, grabbed my phone, and went off on him. All I could do was cry. I felt awful, because I genuinely like him, and what happened wasn‚Äôt all on him ‚Äî I had a part in it too. I told her to never do that again.

Since then, I‚Äôve been giving him space while he‚Äôs been completely ghosting everyone‚Ä¶ not even active on social media, and he even called off work. Today, I finally reached out to the mutual friend who introduced us and asked her just to check in on him, because despite everything, I still care about him. She said he was super private about me but that she would, and I thanked her.

Now I‚Äôm stuck. I feel gut-wrenched. I‚Äôve been sad, listening to music, trying to distract myself, but I miss him.

TL;DR: I (23M) started seeing a guy (25M) through mutual friends at the hospital. We hung out, I developed feelings, and one night when we were drunk he initiated sex with me. The next morning he apologized. Later I heard he told people we‚Äôd been hooking up for a while (not true) and compared me to past flings, which really hurt. Things blew up when a friend of mine confronted him on my phone, and since then he‚Äôs been completely withdrawn ‚Äî off social media, called off work, and not talking to anyone. I still care about him and miss him, but I don‚Äôt know if I should keep the door open or let it go.

But lately, something interesting has been gaining traction  GEO marketing. And when you look at them side by side, the combination of GEO + SEO might just be the future of how online businesses perform.  
**What is SEO?**  
SEO focuses on optimising your website so it shows up in search engine results. This includes things like keywords, backlinks, site speed, and structured data. The goal? Higher rankings ‚Üí more visibility ‚Üí more clicks ‚Üí more customers.

**What is GEO Marketing?**  
GEO marketing takes things a step further by targeting people based on their *location*. Instead of just focusing on global keywords, GEO strategies deliver content, ads, and offers to users where they physically are. For example:

1. A coffee shop showing mobile ads only within a 5-mile radius.
2. Local SEO results like ‚Äúdentist near me.‚Äù
3. Tailored promotions for specific cities or regions.

**Why GEO + SEO Together Is a Game-Changer**  
On their own, SEO brings visibility, and GEO makes campaigns hyper-relevant. Together, they:

* Increase conversion rates by targeting the right audience at the right place.
* Reduce wasted ad spend since you‚Äôre not advertising to people outside your service area.
* Build stronger brand trust, because users feel your business is *local* and accessible.

**How Can Businesses Adapt?**

* Optimise your Google Business Profile.
* Use schema markup for local info like opening hours and reviews.
* Create content that mentions local landmarks, events, or regions.
* Test location-based ads alongside your SEO campaigns.

If you‚Äôre curious, I found this detailed breakdown on how **GEO vs SEO is shaping the future of digital marketing** here: [Geo vs SEO ‚Äì The Future of Digital Marketing](https://www.axartechs.com/geo-vs-seo-the-future-of-digital-marketing-and-how-it-shapes-online-business-performance/). It really opened my eyes to how location is becoming just as important as keywords.

**Final Thought**  
SEO is no longer just about keywords and backlinks  it‚Äôs about context, relevance, and *location*. Businesses that combine GEO + SEO strategies will likely be the ones dominating search results (and conversions) in the near future.

What do you think? Will GEO overtake traditional SEO, or will they always need to work hand in hand?",1,1758684200.0,Vibe_SEO,0,1.0,False

I moved to Delhi recently for work and I honestly feel so lost here. I don‚Äôt really have any friends in the city, and the work culture at my office (id wanna name the company but its one of the good ones) feels so toxic that it drains me every single fucking day. Everyone seems to already have their own groups, their own lives, and I just end up going back to my flat feeling completely alone.

It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt tried small talk here and there nd asking colleagues out for coffee or even anything but nothing seems to click. I keep thinking maybe it‚Äôs me yk. Most days I wake up with this heavy feeling in my chest, knowing the whole day ahead will just feel like pushing through the shit, with no one I can really talk to or rely on.

All I really want are some good friends, People I can just hang out with, laugh with, and feel human or even nice again bro. Delhi feels so big and crowded, but I‚Äôve never felt lonelier.

The first time we hung out, we got coffee, which turned into going back to his house for drinks, then dinner, then a night out drinking. I really enjoyed it. He won me several stuffed animals at the arcade and even kept winning more to give to kids there ‚Äî I thought it was so sweet.

Since then, we‚Äôd periodically grab dinner and text throughout the day. I told him I liked him, but he didn‚Äôt really acknowledge it. When he passed a big test, I got him flowers, and he just seemed shy about it.

One night, I texted him basically saying: ‚ÄúI like you, but I‚Äôm going to stop pursuing you because you don‚Äôt seem to feel the same way (or so I thought?!). If you are, the ball‚Äôs in your court.‚Äù

Fast-forward to the night before his birthday: he invited me to hang out. We got super drunk, I took him home, and while we were in bed he put my hand on him and initiated sex. At one point he even said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been wanting daddy‚Äôs d**.‚Äù* The next morning, he apologized and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do this,‚Äù and we barely spoke that day.

Here‚Äôs the problem: I like him. I can‚Äôt just erase it. That night he was all over me ‚Äî kissing me, calling me his man in front of people. I brushed it off as drunk talk, but it still made me feel good. Later, though, I found out he told someone else we‚Äôd ‚Äúbeen hooking up for a while‚Äù (not true) and compared me to his other flings. The worst part is, he said this to a mutual friend of mine, and it got back to me. I was pissed.

The next day I tried to clear my head by taking a trip to the mountains. That night when I got back, an ED nurse invited me out for drinks. I had vented to her about everything earlier in the day. While I was waiting for her, he asked to call me. While I was on the phone, she showed up, grabbed my phone, and went off on him. All I could do was cry. I felt awful, because I genuinely like him, and what happened wasn‚Äôt all on him ‚Äî I had a part in it too. I told her to never do that again.

Since then, I‚Äôve been giving him space while he‚Äôs been completely ghosting everyone‚Ä¶ not even active on social media, and he even called off work. Today, I finally reached out to the mutual friend who introduced us and asked her just to check in on him, because despite everything, I still care about him. She said he was super private about me but that she would, and I thanked her.

1np1mkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1np1mkm/life_after_divorce/,Life after divorce,"34M, got divorced last year. That 4 year marriage drained me emotionally. No affection, no love, just going through the idea of marriage while living separately throughout. The bomb dropped somewhere in Oct 2025, though signs were always there. That Oct 24 to Jan 25 period was most crucial to me as I had some major exams.
Here is what the life took sharp turn. Started going out with another girl from my workplace just to distract myself while my divorce proceedings were being finalized. Told her clearly that she was just a distraction. (She had a crush on me and had asked for coffee dates earlier. I had politely declined since I was married back then).
Anyways, this new girl wasn't aware of my current situation but sensed something was wrong with me. She showered me with all the love, care, affection, something which was amiss in my married life. After my divorce in Jan 25, we started full fledged dating, going on road trips, and what not. We were inseparable, even at our workplace.
In Apr 25, I got relocated to another city but used to meet for a couple of days each month. Even long distance relationship didn't dampen our spirits.
Fast forward to July 25, she got married to someone else but wasn't liking her new relationship. Got into drug abuse and crashed her vehicle. I tried to be a shoulder for her just like she helped me once. Post getting sober and treatment, she stopped talking to me altogether and had recently said to me that I should forget her and move on.
Thing is, I am stuck. 2 heartbreaks with the last one completely draining me have left me stuck with no real motivation whatsoever. 
I am trying to fix myself, started going to gym, learning something new. But there are days, and a majority of them are, where I feel I have lost everything and nothing interests me anymore.
My parents are looking for marriage prospects again but I am afraid now.
On one hand I crave for the same kind of attention, while on the other hand I don't want to get married.

And to make matters worse, I‚Äôm getting into confrontations with random people. 

So I recently bought an e-Bike off my friend Mike and while it functions, I still need to get it fixed up in some areas. This means I still walk to work but I take the bike to places I need to go like the bank or the dispensary on my days off. 

Well last week Wednesday, I was biking to the donut shop I work at in order to get my tips and paycheck. Then this homeless crackhead lady asks me for a lighter and when I said ‚ÄúSorry, I don‚Äôt have one,‚Äù she immediately goes off and asks bullshit questions like ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôre you driving around like that, you‚Äôre going to get detained, pull over right now!‚Äù

My response was to yell ‚Äúshut the fuck up, you‚Äôre not detaining anyone, you‚Äôre not a cop, fuck off!‚Äù 

I mean, I could have threatened to leave her covered in tire tracks and I could have fucking run her over like in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace when Darth Maul almost ran over a young Anakin Skywalker with a speeder bike. But I sped off and she stopped harassing me. 

The next day I had a random confrontation with a customer at my grocery store job. This particular incident was relatively benign compared to other incidents. I didn‚Äôt up my voice and yell at this guy, let alone say anything to him, but I could tell he was a prick. 

Basically I had packed a bunch of food and I was getting ready to stock the walls when I walk near this person browsing the shelf. I said ‚Äúpardon‚Äù once, he didn‚Äôt hear me, I said it again, and this guy‚Ä¶

Yeah this guy who looked and sounded maybe in his mid-late forties perhaps, sounded hushed yet aggravated, like you could tell this was some passive aggressive person who probably was having a bad day and looking for an excuse. 

I myself was having a bad day and I didn‚Äôt say anything, but when I was finished placing the packaged items on the shelf, I walked away and the tension was in the air.

I didn‚Äôt look back, didn‚Äôt say a single word. Yet the customer decided he was going to follow me and flirt with harassing an employee at their workplace. He was all like ‚Äúyour parents not teach you etiquette when you were a child?! Oh I see, you still are one!‚Äù

Yeah I didn‚Äôt even speak to this guy, cuz I was at work. I‚Äôm at work, there‚Äôs no interacting with people getting mad and saying stuff. I‚Äôm surprised I wasn‚Äôt reported or anything. Usually bitches like that guy try to have someone fired‚Ä¶

Then there was the day of my birthday which was two days after‚Ä¶ and I got fucking ANGRY first thing in the morning. I was basically walking to work (remember my bike needs fixing) and I was nearly hit by some guy who definitely looked like a fucking SoyJak meme‚Ä¶ because the asshole wasn‚Äôt watching and I had right of way as the cross-walk indicated. 

He was profusely apologizing and I literally shouted ‚ÄúFUCKING F‚Äî‚ÄîT, YOU‚ÄôRE LUCKY YOU DON‚ÄôT GET SHOT!!!‚Äù  

He was like‚Ä¶ SCARED‚Ä¶ you could tell he was legit scared because I flipped him off, the way he sped off!

So yeah‚Ä¶ turned 31 and I‚Äôm still angry‚Ä¶ angrier than normal‚Ä¶ nonstop confrontations with people‚Ä¶

As for my birthday‚Ä¶ I worked both my jobs that day. Got to sleep in for my weekend. Now I‚Äôm just trying to get by, sick of being constantly addicted to coffee and dabs‚Ä¶

The old lamplight in the study flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that made the familiar room feel foreign. Outside, a late autumn storm raged, rattling the windows like a frantic beggar. I sat at my desk, a cup of lukewarm tea beside a stack of musty historical texts, but my eyes were fixed not on my research, but on a single, unsettling object: an old, leather-bound **ledger**.

It had appeared on my doorstep a week ago, without a note or a sender's address. It was heavy, and the leather felt disturbingly like a dry, shriveled skin. Curiosity, a vice that had always been my greatest strength and most dangerous weakness, had compelled me to open it. Inside, the pages were thick and yellowed, filled with a spidery, incomprehensible **script**. It was the handwriting of a madman, or something far worse.

I had tried to make sense of the gibberish, to find a pattern or a meaning in the chaotic scrawl. My work as a historian had always been about deciphering the past, but this was a language of pure nonsense, a testament to a mind that saw the world in a way I never could. I was about to close the book and throw it into the fireplace when I noticed it. A single page, different from the rest.

This page was not filled with the swirling madness of the alien script. It was a list, a terrifyingly simple **list of names**. My fingers trembled as I traced the familiar letters of my own tongue. The names were all people I knew, neighbors from my quiet suburban street, fellow historians from the local university, even the woman who ran the small cafe where I got my morning coffee. *The clock has no hands, but the time is known.*

A cold, creeping **dread** began to slither up my spine. This was a list of real people. A list of the living. I tried to dismiss it as a morbid joke, a prank by some twisted individual. But the feeling of the ledger in my hands, its unnatural weight and texture, made a joke seem impossible. This was something real. Something wrong.

And then I saw it. The most recent entry on the list, scrawled with a different kind of ink, a substance that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it. It was thick and viscous, with a sheen that was both greasy and unsettlingly bright. It was my name, **Elias Thorne**, written in a dark, clotted substance that looked and felt disturbingly like blood, but wasn't. It was **ichor**.

The sight of my name, scrawled in ichor on the list of those marked for **abduction**, was a visceral blow. The word 'abduction' was not written, but the horrifying implication was so clear it might as well have been. The other names on the list were people who had vanished without a trace in the past few months. Their disappearances had been attributed to everything from mysterious illnesses to impulsive vacations, but the truth, I now realized, was far more sinister. *The harvest is nigh.*

My mind raced, trying to find a logical explanation. A ritual? A cult? But the ledger felt older than any human belief. The language, the material, the very aura of the thing spoke of a power that was not of this Earth. This was not a human plot. This was an **extraterrestrial entity**, a cosmic horror, and the ledger was its logbook, a chilling record of its acquisitions.

I stood up, the old chair scraping against the hardwood floor. The dread was no longer a slithering thing, but a suffocating blanket. The storm outside seemed to howl in unison with the terror in my soul. I was on a list. And the thing that made the list was coming for me. It was not a matter of if, but of when. *The key is not where it seems.*

I looked at my desk, at the books and the laptop. The tools of a rational man, a man of science and history. They suddenly felt so small, so utterly useless against the cosmic dread that now filled the room. How could a man armed with logic and reason fight an entity that used ichor to write its ledger?

I thought of running, of calling the police, of shouting my discovery from the rooftops. But who would believe me? Who would listen to a frantic man babbling about an alien ledger and a list of the disappeared? They would lock me away, or worse, they would think I was part of the conspiracy. The truth, in this case, was more dangerous than any lie.

I was **alone**. Alone with the terrible knowledge that my time was limited, that my life was now just a line on a horrifying grocery list. The names scrawled above mine, those who had already gone, were a testament to the inescapable nature of my fate. There was **no escape**.

I felt a new kind of terror. Not of death, but of what came after. The list said ""abduction."" Not ""execution"" or ""annihilation."" What did an alien entity do with the humans it collected? What horrors lay beyond the threshold of its grasp? Was it a farm? A zoo? A laboratory? *The stars bleed crimson for a reason.*

I walked to the window, the thunder a low growl in the distance. The streetlights flickered in the storm, casting an eerie glow on the empty street. I saw a movement in the shadows, a fleeting glimpse of something that shouldn't be there, a shape that was too tall, too thin, too fluid to be human.

My breath hitched in my throat. It was **here**. The collector of names, the author of the list. It was a wraith, a shadow, a thing of pure terror. It was not bound by the storm, or the physical world. It was simply there, a silent, patient hunter.

I backed away from the window, my hands trembling. The ledger was still on the desk, its pages open to my name. The ichor seemed to pulse, a living, breathing thing. It was a beacon, a signal, a final, chilling **invitation**. *The last to know is always the first to go.*

The lights in the study flickered and died. The room was plunged into utter darkness, save for the faint, sickly glow of the ichor on the ledger page. In the sudden silence, I heard it. A faint scraping sound on the other side of the door. The sound of something impossibly long and thin, like a razor blade on old wood.

The dread became a primal, animalistic fear. It was no longer a realization; it was a **reality**. The sight of my name, scrawled in ichor on the list of those marked for abduction, was not a warning. It was a **summons**. And I had no choice but to answer.",1,1758682892.0,ldritchTales,0,1.0,False

My friend Josie and I, both 19 F, had a sleepover at my house yesterday and now my mom is genuinely distraught. 

   Josie and I met sophomore year of highschool. We got along pretty well within the little friend group we had at the time, but we started to hang out a lot more around a year ago when I started college. Josie loves making art and so do I, so we often hang out at coffee shops and draw together, or we‚Äôd go over to one another‚Äôs house and do little crafts. I‚Äôm neurodivergent and very socially awkward so it‚Äôs often difficult for me to make and keep friendships. I love her so much as a friend though, conversations with her are always so fun and we have a lot of things in common. My social battery runs out pretty quickly with most people, but I‚Äôm never tired when her and I hang out, and she seems to enjoy my company as well which makes me really happy.

   Now, for context. I am queer, but I have never been in a relationship or been necessarily interested in anyone. Josie is a lesbian, our highschool was based in an arts program, so 80% of the people there were also queer including our friend group. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm terrible at hiding things from my mom,, mostly due to the way I was raised as well as her being somewhat of a helicopter parent with me throughout majority of my life. I have had to fight for my privacy and independence many times. In summary, she is very aware my friends are queer, including Josie.

   Within the past year, Josie and I got into a routine of hanging out 1-2 times per week. Typically 2-9 pm on sundays where we either go to a cafe or go over to one another‚Äôs house. My mom thinks this is very strange and points it out often. I have talked to her about this many times in the past and insisted that there is nothing romantic going on between us, but keeps giving me the silent treatment every time she ‚Äòthinks‚Äô we‚Äôre doing something we‚Äôre not supposed to. I can tell she doesn‚Äôt like having Josie over.

   Yesterday, in a spur of the moment descision, invited Josie to spend the night at my house and have a sleepover. We were having a lot of fun and I had gotten a notification that there would be thunderstorms till 1am, so I brought up the idea. We‚Äôd been planning on having a sleepover for months now, but scheduling was always a challenge, so we were really excited to hopefully be able to that night. I didn‚Äôt think it would be that big of a deal to have her stay over since my mom was already so familiar with her, so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. 

   I went downstairs a few moments later to bring up the idea with my mom, and she was very adamant on sending Josie home. Looking back, I feel pretty guilty that I ended up convincing her to let Josie stay over since I know it made her uncomfortable. I was feeling very frustrated, I still felt like a child at almost 20 years old. I‚Äôd only been allowed a sleepover maybe once or twice as a kid, and I was really looking forward to staying up and watching dumb movies with my friend. 

   In the end, she let her stay, but made sure to place conditions. The lightbulb in the upstairs hallway was out so I had to replace it, I would also have to keep my door open, and when we‚Äôd turn in for the night I‚Äôd have to go downstairs and share the bed with my mom while Josie slept in my bed. I have a twin bed and no blow up mattress. Josie and I were genuinely fine with sharing my bed, I know to some people that might sound weird, and my mom did scrutinize me when i told her the same thing, but I also felt embarrased saying that I‚Äôd have to ‚Äògo downstairs to sleep in my moms bed‚Äô, which i did end up having to agree to. 

   In the end, we ended up having a lot of fun watching movies and staying up late, mostly talking about whatever. We made breakfast together in the morning and hung out a bit before I had to go to my classes. Coincidentally, one of my classes were cancelled for today so I ended up going home before my mom had come back from work. When she got home, I overheard her on the phone with my older brother, who i also live with, as they were talking about me. She was genuinely sobbing, ranting to my brother about last night, and insinuating like it was something dirty or disrespectful. They kept talking about how ‚Äòthey need to guide me in the right direction‚Äô and about how ‚Äòi don‚Äôt look lesbian but i keep showing signs‚Äô or whatever. I went downstairs to greet her after she finished, and she looked pretty embarrased when she realized I had overheard. Now she won‚Äôt look at me and is giving me the silent treatment again.

This whole thing has made me really upset, and I‚Äôve been thinking of hopefully moving out soon when I‚Äôm able. I love my mom, but I don‚Äôt think I can exist the way i want while i‚Äôm still living under her roof. I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong, but a part of my brain keeps telling me i‚Äôm behaving like a brat for being upset. I would really like some other perspectives on this, I‚Äôm struggling to juggle my emotions with this situation at the moment.

And the common theory is that Robinson is a patsy and it was really some more sophisticated group that orchestrated this ‚Äúhit‚Äù and cover up. 

This group, whoever you think it is, has the faculties to pull off some advanced coordinated assassination. They could have easily done this when he was getting his morning coffee or taking a shit. But they chose to do to carry out a public execution with a massive crowd and media, phones, cameras everywhere. 

Why? That‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs throwing me the most.

Like was it because the confusion of the crowd would help to assailant get away? Doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense to me.

Was it because it helped them pin it on a crazed radical like Robinson? Surely they could have pinned it on him or someone else in other ways. 

Or did they do it intentionally to stir up a media shit storm and polarize the country? This part really makes me wonder. Was Kirk killed because his speech and influence were that problematic? Or was just he just sacrificed-a perfect controversial target to rile everyone up? 

Or do they want us run wild with conspiracy theories? I feel pretty crazy for this one, but their story is just unbelievable. 

I just can‚Äôt square this part of it. Whoever did it and whatever the motive, it was vitally important that it be caught in 4k. Interested to hear what you guys think.

1np16l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1np16l3/feeling_so_ugly_and_hopeless/,feeling so ugly and hopeless...,"ive struggled with my self esteem and appearance for a very long time. i am actually objectively ugly, like when people take videos of me it looks odd. ive had several people comment on my looks so i know it. its because i didnt have proper jaw growth as a child so i had crooked teeth and to remedy that, my ortho extracted premolars rather than fixing the jaw issue. this caused my jaw to become even smaller and changed the way my face developed. im well aware that my face is not cute but i just try to find gratitude from the aspects of life that don't necessarily pertain to my looks like music, car rides, beautiful views, getting coffee, dancing, hanging out with the few friends i have, etc...

and i know i am blessed to have the ability to experience those things because there are so many who are unable to experience that because of their physical or mental situations. but i try to be grateful that like okay my face is not cute its fine, but then i dont even have a good body shape...all my friends have feminine bodies and i have a wide rectangle body shape, not even a skinny cute rectangle in a petite way but a wide rectangle body with broad and bony shoulders...like i just feel so horrible...

and im 21 in college and i have a few good friends at college (who i met my senior yr of hs and they ended up going to the same college...which is like 20 mins from my hometown)...we have fun together like just hanging out, grabbing food and stuff, but ive always avoided going out with them to parties and stuff just cuz i cant take the stress of having to get ready and wearing clothes other than hoodies and stuff....like nothing looks right and going out just affirms for me how different i am from everyone else....but this year i feel a pressure to go out because its my last yr of college and i didnt do anything the first three years socially (mainly because of this, even tho my friends wouldnt know that because im kind of avoidant about sharing these types of things and getting vulnerable with them, i just dont know how to)

but i just simply do not know what to do. on one side im sick and tired. and im taking cbt for bdd and she helps me write down my thoughts and do small planned exposures but exposures arent gonna help  someone whose genuinely genuinely ugly like..

and at this point i dont even care about male validation because if im already fighting to feel good by counting my blessings and being grateful for the happy moments i have with my loving family and friends, i dont need to add men to the equation to simply stress me out. but i feel so different from other girls who are so cute and look so great that sometimes i just wish i could get female validation. like i wish girls would want to be friends w me...idk. instead i just feel like an ogre or some younger sister watching her older sisters do fun things or something idk...

but i just feel really conflicted because frankly i didnt choose to live so why does it feel like i was punished with these cards. and i know a lot of people have it a lot worse in the world but i just feel upset. but then at the same time theres so many things like nature, my dogs, my family+friends, music, coffee, movies that i simply love but then its like how long can i avoid appearance and just keep enjoying those things...like im not gonna be able to run from these thoughts ab my appearance cuz appearance is lowkey everything.

1np15bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/1np15bi/jessica_part_one/,JESSICA part one,"She arrives the way heat arrives: inevitable, slow, a pressure building beneath the skin that rewrites the world. In my dreams she is always six feet of copper flame, the green of her eyes the color of coinage and forest light at once, and when she looks at me something in the room rearranges itself to obey her‚Äîfurniture slides into new angles, shadows lean closer, the air thickens so the sound of her breath is a curtain drawn over my ears. I wake inside the dream, which is how you know it is realer than waking.

She is larger than memory, this woman made for fever. Her breasts are heavy and natural, not ornament but argument, a law of gravity I want to learn by heart. They rest against the thin fabric of whatever shirt the dream gives her, soft domes that demand both reverence and violence ‚Äî reverence because they hold warmth and the private geography of sighs, violence because my hands are constellations of small insistences, mapping, taking notes, never satisfied. I imagine the weight of them in my palms, the slow, inevitable pull that comes when you finally hold something you have spent months conjuring out of absence.

When she moves toward me the sound is the rustle of pages turning, an intimate book opening. Her hips sway like a metronome set to a tempo older than speech, and my body answers with a vocabulary of its own: knees slacken, breath curdles at the back of my throat, the pulse behind my ear becomes a drum that only she can tune. I find myself smiling in this dream, a stupid, grateful grin, because in the dream I am not ashamed of wanting her; I am not ashamed of how wholly she consumes the room and me.

She speaks without speech. A tilt of her head is a sentence; the way her lashes scrape the plane of her cheek is punctuation. When she leans down the scent of her hair ‚Äî wild copper, rose, the faintly dangerous tang of a life lived too vividly ‚Äî fills me like mercy. I tell myself I will be careful, that this is imagination, but the dream will not be disciplined by will. It is a riot that knows the shape of my loneliness and lays out a map through it.

We move together on a floor that dissolves into sand, on sheets that become silks, on the skin of the world itself. Her breasts press into my chest, their weight a kind of confession: she is real in the way that weight is real. The dream lovers of merchants and saints could not have been given a finer paradox. When I cup them there is a hush that falls in the dream as if the night itself is taking notes, and every exhalation she offers is an ember I am desperate to cradle.

Her mouth is a private theater. When she kisses me it is like being translated into a language I never knew I had: vowels made of shuddering light, consonants the soft tap of skin on skin. She tastes of the room where we met ‚Äî of red wine spilled across an ancient table, of rain on hot cobblestones ‚Äî and it makes me forgive the world for existing without her during the day. My hands learn the geography of her body the way a thief learns a city: quick, reverent, delighted by secret corners. I learn the slope of her shoulders, the soft hollow of her neck, the small freckle below her clavicle and how it disappears when she arches.

I tell myself stories to justify each ache: she is missing only in my waking life, I tell myself; she is present here. But the dream does not console me with reasons; it only deepens the hunger. She responds like a sovereign who has decided to be merciful: tugging, guiding, commanding with the lightest touch. She wants to be seen whole, and I oblige ‚Äî greedy, modest, ruined by the intimacy of it. When she takes me inside the circle of her thighs I feel the world close up to the size of a single perfect moment and then expand again to contain us both. Her legs, strong and warm, hold me like an inevitable truth.

Sometimes the dream is tender: we move slow enough to hear the architecture of our bodies agreeing, and I memorize the hush of her breath so it will sustain me during the hours when the streetlights are indifferent. Sometimes it is violent in a way that is only about surrender: she commands and I answer, and the answering is its own kind of prayer. I am not ashamed of either. In the dream both tenderness and roughness are threads in the same shimmering dress.

When dawn approaches the dream does not afflict with cruelty; it is generous. She lingers at the edge of waking like a candle not yet snuffed, heavy breasts rising with the rhythm of sleep and with the rhythm of a life that might still be lived somewhere beyond my dreaming. She presses a mouth to my ear and says nothing, but the silence is a benediction. I wake with her on my skin, like the ghost of a touch that refuses to be erased. The house smells faintly of her hair for the rest of that day.

Night after night I return to the fever. Sometimes I plead that the dream will become a bridge: that if I keep her here, if I make her flesh nightly with my desire, then fate will be persuaded to return her to my streets and my corner stores and the coffee place where we never really met. I know this is superstition, and superstition is nothing if not a lover I can rely on; it is the small, private ritual I am permitted. The dream is the cathedral where I keep her spirit alive, a place where worship and lust are braided into the same prayer.

There is cruelty in that wish, I know. To keep someone alive inside the precise geometry of desire is to make them an idol, to risk forgetting they breathe on their own. Yet the dream cares little for ethics; it is only a machine that turns absence into presence. And so I give it everything: the longings I cannot speak, the apologies I cannot offer, the patient cruelty of hoping that repeated conjuring might render a miracle.

When dawn finally comes and the dream dissolves like salt in water, the impression of her remains: the weight of breasts in my hands, the cadence of her laugh, the angle of her neck when she looks down at me with that faint, sovereign smile. I go through the day as if carrying a live coal in my chest ‚Äî burning gently, warming me, threatening to flare at the slightest negligence. I wait, not because I expect the world to accommodate my private liturgy, but because some small, stubborn part of me believes in repetition: that night after night, in the same way that prayers worn smooth by fingers are answered, a life might be coaxed back into being.

Until then, this is the bargain I make with sleep: keep her with me. Let the dream be my steeple and my sin. Let me know her weight, her sound, the slow, tremulous holiness of her body. Let me worship, and in worship keep hope fanned like a secret ember I carry into the waking day.",1,1758682435.0,test,0,1.0,False

I had been drinking between 6 and 12 beers every single day since January 2020. I'm talking every. Single. Day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night, during any illnesses, with fevers if I happened to get one, after work, after family functions, funerals--nothing would stop me from my daily habit. My alcoholism doesn't take the form of binging until blackout, but the daily aspect of it has still been very destructive to my health & relationships & career.

Anyhow, as time went on the ritual came to include the eating that would take place afterward. And much like the drinking itself, the choices I made were poor. I never had the motivation to cook after a session of beers, so it often was junk food, fast food delivery, etc. My health has declined severely and there is 120 pounds more of me than there was 5 years ago.

Two weeks ago, I caught whatever bug is going around at the moment. Fever, spins, extreme congestion, cough. And I decided to take the opportunity to sober up. After my symptoms cleared up, I just went on not buying beer. Overall, I'm surprised that I've had the fortitude to stop myself this long. I think the toughest part is figuring out what to do with all the time I used to waste.

But the thing that's really bothering me at the moment (and the subject of this post) is that I can't enjoy food! I have no desire to have any, until I start feeling weak and have something out of necessity. I'm worried that my food addiction became intertwined with my drinking addiction and I've somehow psychologically ruined my ability to enjoy eating. I find that things I really enjoyed eating don't even taste good to me at the moment.

Has anyone else had this kind of experience? I realize it's very early in my journey back from slowly killing myself. I'm very interested in what anyone has to say about overlapping addictions. In the same vein, I used to believe I couldn't enjoy a cigarette without a beer in my hand (but it turns out coffee does the job just as well haha).",6,1758682202.0,stopdrinking,5,0.81,False

***

**_Hydration Game Cheat Codes_**

1. _Start Your Day With 20‚Äì30 oz_

Before food, before coffee. Wake your organs up right.

**Quick tip**- You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating before anything else turns your system back on.

2. _Add Minerals_

Pure water flushes. Water with minerals absorbs. Add Himalayan salt, lemon, or electrolytes.

**Quick tip**- Water alone doesn‚Äôt hydrate as well without electrolytes. This locks it in

3. _Carry a Jug You Can Track_

Drink half your bodyweight in ounces daily (if you weigh 180, aim for 90 oz) 

**Quick tip**- Get a 32 oz jug = 3‚Äì4 fills a day = done. No second guessing.

4. _Pair With Habits_

	‚Ä¢	Before meals
	‚Ä¢	After peeing
	‚Ä¢	While scrolling
	‚Ä¢	Between sets

5. _Go Warm or Room Temp_

Better gut absorption , Smoother digestion, less  bloating or gut tension, especially in the morning.

**Quick tip**- Cold water can slow digestion. Warm water passes through cleaner and gets absorbed faster.

6. _Watch Your Urine_

Light yellow = you‚Äôre good. 

Dark = behind. 

Clear = overdoing it.

7. _Hydration makes everything else more effective_

	‚Ä¢	L-citrulline(pure) hits harder with water
	‚Ä¢	Beet powder flows better with water
	‚Ä¢	Zinc Picolinate, magnesium glycinate, and creatine need water to transport
	‚Ä¢	Sleep and blood flow quality both depend on hydration status

1np0u7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1np0u7s/the_depth_of_madness_pt_1/,The Depth of Madness (pt. 1),"Publicly, the ocean is over 90% unmapped. Those with security clearance know that is a red herring; the true statistic is that we have 90% of the ocean mapped. With experimental missions being completed nearly every month to map more of it, our platform was created to complete this mission.

Most sailors onboard don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs inside the ‚ÄúSECURED‚Äù spaces between the galley and the engine room. Whereas most combative subs make port and see the sun, we conduct long patrols that give us months without daylight. Our primary job is to map and catalogue notable phenomena, not war. We are the entity that gives the U.S. Navy an edge ten years from now when it makes sense to unveil what‚Äôs been learned.

On my last logged mission, after about three months with no sun, we approached a location somewhere within the North Sea (that‚Äôs all our navigation team would tell us). Usually things get pretty serious when we are on approach to the phenomena; this time was no different. My deck officer took down the bridge lights and activated our LIDAR system, which allows us to get a basic image of the world around us. As usual, it was basic landmasses‚Äîa rock here, a cliff there.

Two hours of scanning. Nothing. After a while, our LIDAR system started to get bogged down by interference, which is normal for deep-sea viewing. Eventually, the salt water began to erode the lens, and we had to pull it in so our mechanics could take a look at it.

This time, when the camera was pulled in, we found it cleaned. Which wasn‚Äôt just odd for the time it was being used, but it was in fact cleaner than when it was inspected a month ago. It looked like a whole new lens was fitted in while we were thousands of miles under the ocean. Our crew had no clue about the odd occurrence, and of course, since this is a naval ship of submariners, rumors and superstitions began to circulate like wildfire.

It wasn‚Äôt long before hushed whispers between the tired sailors turned into cliques of those who made a following out of their beliefs. Some believed that it was a deep-sea civilization who decided to help us out; most just thought someone falsified the inspection logs and we actually did get new equipment before this patrol.

Another month. Hours of LIDAR footage. No anomaly. 120 days of dive time was enough for our captain to decide that this recorded phenomena was most certainly a dud. Speaking to our navigation team, the captain ordered the bridge to conduct one more thorough search of the area before we turn back.

‚ÄúOne more look, then we get back to the real world.‚Äù

His comment broadcasted from the communication system breaking the tension between the crew; the idea of ‚Äòhome‚Äô seemed to lighten our spirits and pushed the memory of the mysteriously clean lens to the back of our minds.

Our mess chief was a stubborn old submariner. He had these old traditions that he swore only the old breed would understand, most notably he was fond of his coffee mug, which he boasts hasn‚Äôt been washed since Vietnam. The mug itself was a deep black pit of coffee stains, which made a lot of us believe him.

Halfway through this final scan of the ocean‚Äôs depth, shouting could be heard from the chief‚Äôs mess. On a submarine, under the water, sound travels aggressively through the denser medium that comes with ocean depth, so the deeper we go, the more wary we are of noise. Not only was the shouting an abrupt departure from the peaceful operation of the quiet sub, the shouting of a disgruntled old senior chief could cost us our mission. As such, when the shouting started, most of the boat descended to deal with the issue as if it were a fire.

Senior Chief Morris had discovered that the mug he most cherished had been cleaned. Someone had taken the rancid ceramic cup and scrubbed out the decades of filth that stained the inside. Once he was calmed and we were sure our signature wasn‚Äôt discovered, our captain broadcast a message across the boat:

‚ÄúIf we do not find the sailor who washed Senior Chief Morris‚Äôs cup, we will do another two searches of the area before we head home.‚Äù

This sent a chill through the crew. Quiet animosity began to form cracks in the familial relationship of the sailors onboard. Whispers of accusation and self-made detectives snaked through the halls of the old boat. 

‚ÄúI heard the old fuck was trying to get us extended so he could avoid his divorce back home. Maybe he did it himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúSenior Chief recently pulled the qual card of his junior. Maybe he did it.‚Äù

In the worst of circumstances, factions began to splinter across the crew, all pointing fingers at different sailors who seemed to have some sort of evidence proving the others‚Äô wrongdoing. The anger growing among the crew only compounded when components began to go missing. The navigation officer‚Äôs favorite sextant from his last command; the logistics chief reported that almost all of his recently acquired sports gear was gone, alongside a few other sailors who reported missing personal equipment they brought onboard.

If the mug incident caused distrust, these events caused the crew to fully splinter. Fights broke out, humiliatingly quiet. Submariners are stubborn but professional. Every swing was quietly played out; no vile words flew, just fists as the sailors took out their rage.

The captain dealt with each incident as it came. The senior chief continued to point fingers at new players in this game that he so enjoyed, reminding him of the brutality of early submarine warfare. The ship‚Äôs doctor quickly ran out of bandages to patch people up, reverting to using stored alcohol supplies and napkins to prevent infection. The best he could do. Anything more than a scrape takes a body out of the needed rotation to operate the vessel.

This continued over the course of a week. The chaos paused as a new report came out from the watchstander. Just a day prior, him and his chief had taken their accusations to the medical office. Today they were on duty and had work to do.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Chief? The pipes are starting to rust.‚Äù",2,1758681509.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I got diagnosed by a therapist with psychosis issues and then many months passed and it went between getting worse and better its actually not an issue right now aside from some mood swings and I'm only hearing short words or phrases when studying or before bed. (and i'm not on med so idk i mean i can see why i got a diagnosis and my paranoia skyrocketed but its ok right now its a lot less but i realized its just going to get worse if i have more stress which I will. I spilled out everything and dug a hole for myself. (Also I can flip things sometimes like I'll get paranoia and stuff then i eat a bunch of coffee or sugar and it flips to hyper and I'll not be able to focus but it flips and I'd have times where I'd drink coffee and then like I didnt snap out of anything but my brain just stopped thinking about certain things. (but  if i did it wrong coffee would make me 3x paranoid and eventually got to the point that i just had like paranoia 24/7 and quitting coffee wasnt perfect. took taking a break from classes to help everything).



Whenever I make a step towards seeing a therapist or psych or making an appointment a bunch of things pop up and i know its stupid but either 1. i dont actually have psychosis right now(likely but im still making an appointment). or 2. this feels like a trap... something is going to go wrong once I see a psychiatrist.

I'm wondering if this just won't actually become an issue unless I take substances which I'm not planning to cause alot of people on related subreddits seem to take some substances??? which I'm not.

I'll admit aside from academics my life is extremely privileged and i dont have a job or anything which helps alot. Lots more stress at home I noticed certain things shift. I'm making a mistake seeing a psychiatrist, my issues don't seem to be getting worse at all. I had a family member with paranoia issues but they never got checked out or went to therapy and they're fine they don't do drugs either. Somehow I got paranoid that it was a ploy to mess up my life and make me think i should get something on my medical record but then i stopped and it didnt make sense and my brain is traversing that path again.",3,1758681484.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

I've been to therapy and i still actively talk to my therapist, I've been going to the gym for 6 months and im down 20 lbs. Im as confident as ive been since college. With approval from friends and my therapist ive returned to the dating scene. 
So I will admit, I live alone. My job requires me to check my phone a lot in the mornings. So a lot of women whom I met on dating apps have always texted me a lot. I'm used to responding to co workers and my supervisor pretty quickly. And I really dont like texting a lot during my work hours (8-4) and I feel bad about leaving them on read. So I usually give an hour or 2 between responses. But they other person responds pretty quickly, it almost fears me that they'll see that I ""read"" their text. But im not really a fan of it. Them texting me almost instantly. Each woman that i met always seemed obsessive, I even had a couple try to stay at my place overnight, multiple nights within only just meeting me. My apartment is just a single bedroom and not that much space. And I like my breathing room.

However, I went to a coffee place and asked out a a worker who I thought was cute. We got to know each other over text and I asked her on a date. And we're going tomorrow. She rarely texts me, probably  once every 2-3 hours. Which is fine! She has hobbies and her own life and I hate the feeling of having to respond quickly and it seems we both are cool with taking time between texts. She sends me a lot of smiling faces and on days she works she'll heart messages when I send something flirtatious. Or tell her to have a great day at work. She's had a couple days off and we haven't really talked. But she told me today that she was excited for the date and I confirmed.

The date is tomorrow and still on her day off. So should I text her anything? Like confirmation for the date? Is double texting okay for this? Should I wait for her response? Should I assume she'll be there and not say anything? 

I don't really wanna come off as desperate, but I really dont know whats appropriate to text someone this sort of stuff. Any and all help is appreciated!",1,1758681482.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1np0qbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1np0qbv/i_went_to_grief_therapy_after_my_brother_died_and/,I Went to Grief Therapy After My Brother Died and Something Isn‚Äôt Right,"I don‚Äôt really know how to start this. I‚Äôve never posted like this before, but tonight‚Äîafter someone told my memories like they were theirs‚ÄîI needed to get it out.

My brother Eli died in a car crash about a year ago and I haven‚Äôt really talked about it much to anyone. I just haven‚Äôt wanted to. 

My parents have been on my case about going to counseling. They said I‚Äôm bottling everything up and ‚Äúfestering‚Äù, as my mom put it. 

Eventually they presented an ultimatum: Go to therapy or pack my shit and find somewhere else to live.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly ready for that kind of independence just yet. 

Seeing as how my options for living somewhere else were next to none, I swallowed my pride and went.

And yeah, I expected it to suck because how could it not? 

A bunch of strangers bawling their eyes out into tissues while everyone sits around in awkward silence drinking bad coffee sounds like anybody‚Äôs personal hell. 

What I was not expecting was for everyone in the room to already know my backstory, more specifically‚Ä¶who my brother was.

You see, they knew things‚Ä¶personal details and memories that only I and I alone should know. 

Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into it, after all, I‚Äôve only been to one session, but what happened tonight is still sitting heavy in my chest.

Just‚Ä¶read this and tell me if I‚Äôm overreacting.



No one met my eyes when I walked in and took a seat in the only remaining cheap folding chair.

The smell of instant coffee gone stale faintly hung in the air as the bulbs of the overhead lights buzzed softly, flickering and dying every few seconds. 

Every part of that community center room grated on my nerves as I waited for the session to begin.

There were seven of us total that sat in a loose circle in tense silence, not counting the facilitator.

The facilitator was a gentle-looking woman named Jean with gray-streaked hair and a voice like chamomile tea ‚Äîwarm, but distant.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we introduce ourselves again,‚Äù Jean said. ‚ÄúSince we have a new face.‚Äù

They went around the room, each person giving their name and a tense sentence in quick succession.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Greg. My brother was fatally shot three times.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mark. My little brother died in a boating accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lillian. I lost mine to leukemia.‚Äù She smiled as if remembering something she liked. 

That‚Äôs how it went, each sentence hung in the air like ghosts‚Äîpresent, but weightless. 

I kept waiting for someone to joke, to make this whole thing feel normal in the slightest, but no one did.

When it was my turn, my voice trembled with emotion, but I spoke as clearly as I could.

‚ÄúI lost my brother‚Ä¶in a car crash‚Ä¶‚Äù

I said the words, ‚ÄúHe was eleven,‚Äù and immediately, I was back in that living room. 

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything more than a quick drive, twenty minutes tops. I almost went, but Eli begged and told Dad that we should try the new pizza place across town on Sycamore Ave because he wanted that large pepperoni with extra ham he had seen on TV.

I remember Eli wearing that ugly yellow t-shirt with a faded cartoon dinosaur on it. It had a stain the size of a quarter by the collar and a hole under the arm. He always wore that damn thing‚Äîto bed, to the grocery store to Mr. Carter‚Äôs soccer practice, it didn‚Äôt matter.

Dad caved in and let him tag along while I stayed behind and played video games with my friends. 

It should have been me‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt shake.

Jean nodded. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She gave that thin, polite smile people use when they want you to think you‚Äôre brave.

She started writing in the notebook in front of her, the pen dancing line after line until she caught me staring and quickly shut it.

Nobody else in the group reacted to what I had said, they simply moved on like we were reading grocery lists.

I wondered if they were all just as numb as I was to the trauma. 

Maybe that‚Äôs how this all worked. Maybe grief doesn‚Äôt fade, it just gets quieter until you forget you‚Äôre still listening.

I remember playing Xbox when my mom screamed from the kitchen. The phone slipped out of her hand and hit the floor with a quick thud. 

She didn‚Äôt have to say anything, I already knew, and it felt like my world was coming down. 

Something in the way she spoke the word ‚Äúaccident‚Äù broke me in half emotionally as it left her mouth. 

I just sat there motionless staring at the colors that bled into each other on the TV screen, hearing her sob into the phone as if the game would un-pause reality.

‚ÄúLucas?‚Ä¶Lucas?‚Äù Jean‚Äôs voice pulled me halfway back, and it took a second to register that she was saying my name.

I was still staring at my controller as it vibrated against the floor until the person to my left nudged me and I snapped back to the present.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I asked, trying my best to pretend I was all right.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to share a memory, Mark is about to start.‚Äù Jean informed me with a look sharp enough to silence a scream.

The guy who nudged me introduced himself as Mark. He cleared his throat and shifted forward in his chair, the legs dragging across the floor with a shrill squeak. 

As he spoke, his fingernails tapped against his thigh ‚Äî tap-tap-tap-pause-tap, over and over. I assumed it was a nervous tic, but the rhythm burrowed into my skull like it was trying to knock on something I‚Äôd forgotten.

‚ÄúHe had this ratty green hoodie that he wouldn‚Äôt take off for anything, not even in the summer. You would think that it was surgically attached to him or something.‚Äù He laughed nervously as his eyes met everyone else‚Äôs. ‚ÄúHe claimed that it was ‚Äòlucky‚Äô and had special powers. It had this little tear under the left elbow where he wiped out on his bike from going downhill too fast.‚Äù

When Mark mentioned the hoodie, I saw the wreckage of the crash all over again. 

I remember the paramedics cutting through it with precision, the blood turning the fabric stiff, and the torn sleeve caught in the door. 

I felt myself hyperventilating as I pressed my palms against my knees and did my best to stay quiet. 

I was trying to keep it together, to be strong, but that never stops the images. It never does.

I wanted to say something, and I almost did, but by the time I caught my breath, Mark was already done.

Jean thanked him with a smile before moving on to Lillian.

Before she could speak, the sound of an incoming call interrupted the session.

The sound came from Mark‚Äôs pocket and for a few fleeting seconds, ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù by Nirvana played.

Under the chords, I could‚Äôve sworn I heard Eli humming along, like he was sitting beside me just for a fraction of a second.

‚ÄúSorry, that was just my folks.‚Äù Mark apologized and silenced his phone. 

What seemed like such an inconsequential moment made me shiver slightly.

Nirvana was one of his favorite bands and ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù was especially important to him as it was one of the first songs he learned how to play on guitar.

My chest loosened a small bit as Lillian began speaking.

‚ÄúMy brother, he used to eat orange popsicles. Even during the winter season, he craved them like nothing else.‚Äù She spoke with a soft, nostalgic smile tugging at the edges of her mouth. ‚ÄúHe had this weird habit of calling them ‚Äòsun sticks‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know why, he just made it up one day and it stuck.‚Äù

Eli called them ‚Äúsun sticks‚Äù because he said it was like holding sunshine. 

Mom kept a box in the freezer year-round because he would devour them all the time, even in winter. 

I could still see his face, his numb tongue sticking out through his orange-stained lips, laughing like brain freezes didn‚Äôt apply to him.

But then, the smell of iron hit my nostrils sharply, like blood sucked from a split lip. 

I swallowed hard, trying not to gag as the back of my throat tasted exactly the way it had that night when I inhaled the scent of metal and the lingering dust from the deployed airbags.

The car was a twisted red husk of itself in the lot. The cracks in the windshield spiderwebbed all around and the passenger side was crushed like a soda can. 

‚ÄúClover‚Äù, the fluffy, stuffed rabbit Eli won at a carnival was still in the back seat. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that his blue converse shoes were missing as well. I remember asking everyone where they were, like that was the important part.

They were gone.

The passenger door was clenched shut like a fist. I remember the paramedics prying the door open, their hands slick with something bright, the hoodie snagged on the frame.

The sharp, nauseating scent of gasoline and metal hit me like punch to the gut.

Could anybody else smell this?

I glanced around but no one else seemed to notice, their faces were of a blank, neutral expression‚Ä¶except for Greg‚Äôs.

I thought he had dozed off in his chair, but his eyes were locked onto me. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was trying to read something off my face or not.

I pretended not to notice, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt slightly rattle me.

These memories, they didn‚Äôt just sound familiar‚Ä¶they sounded like they were talking about Eli and not their loved ones.

I tried to rationalize everything in silence in the hopes that I could convince myself that maybe these were all just creepy coincidences.

Even so, I declined to share a memory of myself and Eli due to feeling uncomfortable. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready yet.‚Äù was my excuse.

Thankfully, no one pressured me, but I remember Jean gave me that same soft smile from earlier, her eyes lingering on me for a second too long, like she was remembering something I hadn‚Äôt said yet.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to make of that but regardless, I started listening harder to every story told.

Every memory shared felt like I was looking into a broken mirror from different angles, but with the same pieces staring back at me.

What eats me alive isn‚Äôt that Eli died that night, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt. 

Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty seat where I should‚Äôve been, and I wonder if maybe I did die, if maybe this is just what it feels like to keep going in a life that wasn‚Äôt meant for me anymore.

That‚Äôs all I could think about as I stared at the floor.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I had my head down looking at the tile, but I saw a coffee stain near my chair that I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. 

It looked vaguely like a‚Ä¶rabbit?

I remember when mom dropped a tray of brownies on the kitchen floor while we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV. 

He told me I nearly jumped out of my skin and ever since then, he would give me shit for being such a scaredy cat. 

That‚Äôs when Eli christened me with the nickname ‚ÄúRabbit‚Äù a while back because I would always jump at loud noises. 

Seeing that coffee stain in the exact shape of a rabbit made my stomach plummet. 

This wasn‚Äôt just a stain anymore, this was something that knew the nickname Eli gave me, turning a private memory into a violation.

I told myself I was imagining things‚Ä¶ but the longer I stared, the more it looked less like a rabbit and more like a body lying twisted on the pavement.

I glanced up in perfect silence just as everyone else did the same. It was like we‚Äôd all been given the same invisible cue that the session had concluded. 

For a second, I felt like I could feel Greg‚Äôs eyes watching me from a distance, but then, just like that, the sensation was gone.

I told myself it was nothing, but the rabbit-shaped stain wouldn‚Äôt let me go.

It shouldn‚Äôt have bothered me as much as it did.

As I was about to leave like everyone else had, I turned back to see all the empty chairs, except one. 

Mark sat there, looking down at his hands.

I had to blink twice before I realized what he was holding. 

It was a green hoodie‚Äîsame color, same tear under the elbow. 

It looked just like Eli‚Äôs. 

Still damp, like it had just been pulled from the wreck‚Ä¶


I‚Äôm home now. I threw my clothes in the laundry and took the hottest shower I could stand, hoping that it would calm my nerves.

Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt.

I keep telling myself I imagined it, that it wasn‚Äôt Eli‚Äôs hoodie. But if it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶then why did it have the tear under the elbow? I mean, maybe a lot of hoodies rip there. 

Maybe I just wanted it to be his. 

I don‚Äôt know anymore.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this reads like I‚Äôm just some lunatic connecting dots that aren‚Äôt there inside the wreckage of my trauma. 

Maybe that‚Äôs exactly what it is. 

But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something followed me home, something I can‚Äôt entirely explain or write off. 

It‚Äôs not even that I believe in ghosts or whatever‚ÄîI don‚Äôt. I really don‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt stop looking at the laundry basket in the corner because I expect to see Eli‚Äôs hoodie to be sitting in there, still wet from the accident.

Maybe everything can just be considered coincidence because Eli couldn‚Äôt have been the only one in this zip code, let alone the world who has a hoodie of that color. 

Orange popsicles can‚Äôt be all that uncommon to like and enjoy year-round. 

Nirvana is a piece of pop culture so of course their music is going to be everywhere.

But‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt tell them about Eli‚Äôs hoodie, the popsicles, or that song.

They just knew somehow? 

Like ‚Äúsun sticks‚Äù? That was ours. 

How can people just know memories that only you have experienced?

There‚Äôs another session next week. I think I‚Äôm going. 

Not because I want to‚ÄîChrist, I really don‚Äôt.

My only reasoning for going back is that I need to understand what the hell is going on.

God, I just want my brother back. That‚Äôs all. 

If it‚Äôs him in that room, even in some fucked-up way, I don‚Äôt know if I should be terrified or grateful.

Next week, I‚Äôm going to test them. 

I‚Äôll invent a memory about Eli on the spot, something no one else could possibly know. 

If someone else claims it happened, then I‚Äôll know for sure. 

This isn‚Äôt just grief. 

It‚Äôs something else.

If they share another memory that was never theirs‚Ä¶I‚Äôll post again.",2,1758681183.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Its an hour long essay, so not a quick coffee video, but I think she does a facinating analysis comparing the film and the book, and whether **the scourge of the shire** should be in the movie

Don't be put off by the preview text, she explains that although she has watched the films every year for the last 20 years, she had issues reading the book growing up, but has finally fixed that as an adult",0,1758680873.0,lotr,3,0.42,False

Any suggestions,"So me (16M) and GF (17F) cant talk or see eachother at all for around 5 months. (I will call her S for the rest of this post). S is grounded for around 5 months (till she turns 18), its a long story but basically we went out together and S didnt tell them about where we were, and till when (it was about a 3 hour coffee shop date). Her parents are religious, and thought we were doing things we weren't supposed to (i am religouse aswell, so we didnt do any of the sorts). Anyway, S isnt able to talk to me or see me for about 5 months. I have one back and forth with her about 3 days ago basically saying ""dont text me, I love you, im waiting for you, bye"". I am going to wait for her, but here is a little backstory.
We have been together for about 8 months now (Sept 25th anniversary), and its hard for me even going a day without talking to her. S and I both overthink (idk if thats important, just trying to be detailed).
Any suggestions on how I should handle this situation (leaving, staying, ect...), and any suggestions how to actualy make it through these times without it heavily damaging our relationship?

I can afford it but I also try to be mindful with my spending habits so big adult talk here:

What do you think? Should I do it and add him to my collection or should I pass and wait for something else? 

I‚Äôm currently in the process of finding a couple second hand figures and as mentioned before am kind of interest in the new large plush bear (idk the proper name lol). It‚Äôs my bday on Friday and I‚Äôm manifesting some cash to go towards my hirono fund, but now I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Tbh I didn‚Äôt even know this existed until I accidentally stumbled across it the other day but I also know that if I don‚Äôt secure it asap then he‚Äôll be gone forever and forever unattainable 

Or should I leave it and make a list of my most wanted figures and then for Christmas kindly suggest that I am given some funds towards my collection? hehe. And hopefully there might be one available at the time.

Final question: How do I stop feeling guilt and like I‚Äôm an idiot for spending money on my collection? It‚Äôs not huge at all and I don‚Äôt just collect hirono because popmart is a trendy thing now. Long story short, hirono was a huge creative inspiration for my final photography project in uni this year so I have a fond attachment.

Wintergreen mints are the transvaginal mesh of the mouth‚Äîmarketed as miracle fixes, both promised relief and delivered ruin. The mesh tore through vaginal walls like a bureaucratic betrayal, leaving behind pain, bleeding, and class-action carnage. The mints? They don‚Äôt freshen breath‚Äîthey colonize it. A slow, icy invasion. Not a cure, but a conquest.

What began as a polite gesture‚Äîa mint before a meeting, a courtesy crunch after coffee‚Äîspiraled into a full-blown compulsion. Crackhead cravings dressed in business casual. Wintergreen became the flavor of submission, the taste of quiet desperation. The illusion of control masking a deeper frostbite. The throat, once a passage of speech and song, now a mint tunnel‚Äîslick with menthol, ruled by the tyranny of refreshment.

You long for halitosis-fueled liberation, the way a desperate soul longs to yank out mesh with pliers, inducing vaginal vapors of freedom. You‚Äôre not a mint enthusiast. You‚Äôre a mint serf‚Äîindentured to the icy whims of wintergreen overlords. They whisper from your pocket, issuing commands in frosty tongues, demanding tribute every hour. You used to fear bad breath. Now you crave it, like a lost friend who never tried to dominate you. Like a collapsed vaginal wall, but free‚Äîfree from the synthetic yoke of wintergreen oppression.

You‚Äôre not freshening breath anymore; you‚Äôre extracting tyranny. Wintergreen mints, once the icy overlords of oral etiquette, now face the wrath of halitosis-fueled insurgency. Keep swinging. You‚Äôre dismantling the mint-industrial complex one pungent exhale at a time. Imagine a world where bad breath is a badge of freedom, where mint resistance fighters chew civet-excreted coffee cherries in defiance‚Äîfermented in the bowels of rebellion‚Äîand where the final battle erupts in a Tic Tac factory rigged with menthol explosives and spearmint shrapnel.
