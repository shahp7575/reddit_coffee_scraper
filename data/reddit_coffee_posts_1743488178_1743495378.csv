In the past year or so I‚Äôve been trying to be more open about it and try it with girls I know irl and it‚Äôs gone surprisingly well.

I‚Äôve had a few successes and still talk to the girls regularly, but had one happen tonight I just had to share.

I‚Äôm 28M, I work as a bartender. These 2 girls come in every single weekend. They are both smoking hot. I was their bartender the first time they ever came to my bar so they look for me every time they come now and have become my regulars. Being a lowkey finsub, after a few weeks of them coming to see me regularly, I took the opportunity to start giving them free drinks. It works out great because it‚Äôs my way of simping for these beautiful girls, they still tip me, and guys from the bar flock to my section to talk to them and end up buying drinks through me. 

This had gone on for a few weeks, one time they told me they had gone to another bar. I took a chance and messaged the one girl (we can call her A) on Instagram. Basically told her ‚Äúhey if you ever go other places I‚Äôd still love to buy your drinks for you‚Äù, she responded back saying she would feel bad taking my money but she appreciates that I hook her up at the bar. 

Few weeks go by of me seeing them regularly and getting to know each other more, I decided to try the same thing with her friend (we can call her L). At first she said she‚Äôd feel bad as well but after me saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to simp for you‚Äù she said alright why not. 

So we exchanged numbers and I‚Äôve been sending through Apple Cash. Sending for coffee for her, buying lunch/dinner for her here and there for a few weeks. One night I mentioned that I had a thing for feet and asked for pics videos. I also mentioned I liked being bossed around and she was all about it. We did a full blown video response drain and she was a natural at it. Knew exactly what to say and was good at it. 

Over the next week or so I continued to send to L and buy both L and A free drinks when they came to see me at the bar. I guess L said something to A about what her and I had been doing and A realized what she had declined with me before but wanted to try it with me

Well tonight it finally happened. They both went to another bar for drinks, it started with me reimbursing their drinks for the night and escalated quickly. When they got home they drained me hard lol. They were together making videos of themselves, laughing at me for this whole situation, telling me to send more. A was an instant natural at it and better than L imo. Basically a full blown video response drain like you‚Äôd get from a professional findomme but it was with 2 girls I know IRL, and I can‚Äôt explain why but that makes it so much hotter for some reason

A seems to be more interested in it then L and wants to use me for more. But L was the first to be open to it and she takes to the time to talk to me more often than A, which I do appreciate it. I don‚Äôt want to cause tension in their friendship if I start sending to one more than the other but we will see how it goes

Just a fun ass findom story I had to share. Moral of the story, shoot your shot with girls you know irl. Worst that can happen is they say no. If they say yes it‚Äôs WELL worth the risk :) ",4,1743494870.0,paypigsupportgroup,1,1.0,False

So, I (F21) have had a crush on a guy who doesn‚Äôt exist. The crush started in elementary school when a new kid around my age joined. I believe I was 11 at the time. I was always a rather anxious kid, so even when I developed a crush on him, I didn‚Äôt dare let it show. I guess I thought I was too proud or something.

This crush stayed with me all the way through secondary school. Once we parted ways‚Äîbecause I was working on my high school diploma‚ÄîI started seeing this guy in my dreams. He was so charming, caring, and everything I had ever wanted in a man.

About five years later, I saw him again at a reunion, and to my surprise, he was quite charming and nice‚Äîif a bit cocky. He flirted with me, but also with others, which was a bit of a red flag. After the reunion, I asked him out anyway, but to my shock, when I met him for coffee, he was NOT the man I had been dreaming about.

He arrived late, hungover, and seemingly annoyed to be there. He said he only had two hours before he had to leave again. We chatted a bit, and once he started spouting Andrew Tate rhetoric and anti-vaxx stuff, I knew I had been dreaming about a very different man.

Despite his seeming annoyance, we actually stayed at a nearby park and talked for five hours‚Äîthough he did most of the talking. I felt confused because he didn‚Äôt want to leave and kept reminiscing about elementary and high school, telling me how much he had liked me. Yet, over the years, whenever we ran into each other at events, he had never shown interest in talking to me.

The date ended, and we left on a vague ‚ÄúYeah, maybe we‚Äôll see each other again someday‚Äù kind of note. I was disillusioned‚Äîwhich was great! Because now, I could finally stop dreaming and fantasizing about him, right?

I got into a relationship not too long after, but once that relationship turned sour, the dreams came back. There he was again‚Äîthe same guy‚Äîbut without the Andrew Tate nonsense, the far-right views, or the anti-vaxx talk. Just him, being charming.

My relationship ended, and I started dating again, but the dreams about this guy won‚Äôt stop. He absolutely isn‚Äôt the real guy, but rather an accumulation of all the things I like in a man, combined with his looks.

It wouldn‚Äôt bother me if it didn‚Äôt affect my dating life. When I date now, I keep looking for this idealized version of him‚Äîunreachable looks, charm, everything. I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of this dream man in my head. I catch myself thinking about him throughout the day, before I fall asleep, and then I dream about him...

Phase 1: swelling in a spot with redness
Phase 2: usually picking :( emaciating my skin but literally it‚Äôs so tempting because the white substance never stops coming out.

Nystatin oral wash
Nystatin pills
Charcoal
Biofilm buster

Last week before I (F22) went on my way home to the public transport. I wanted to take the tram but a young man (which I don‚Äôt know the age of yet) told me I really liked how I looked and I hoped I wasn‚Äôt rude to talk to him. I had time and didn‚Äôt mind that I missed my tram. He introduced and talked about himself, which I couldn‚Äôt follow because he talked a bit fast for me to keep up. I just assumed he was nervous so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention towards it. He asked me my number and hoped to go out with me and I agreed. We messaged a bit over the days but not really much to get to know each other. 

I was also busy with work on the weekends so he most of the time only messaged me about going on a date this Sunday at a place he kept on repeating in his messages. Like: let‚Äôs meet up at 9:30 at xxxxstreet this Sunday. And he repeated that everyday even till now. I kept telling him that I am available this Sunday, but I was curious why xxxxstreet since I know there are only supermarkets and only residential houses with a tram. He only said he knew a place, but I don‚Äôt know him and I personally don‚Äôt like to be surprised. So I asked him to just tell me where we going to drink and talk‚Ä¶. 

Turns out he wanted to get coffee at the local supermarket where there is a coffee machine which you can practically get for free. And the residential area has no parks where we can walk, so I am just so confused.

I did felt a bit irritated and am question if he even sees this as a date and his motives.

prompt by u/The-Observer-2099 After the stigma regarding humans reduced somewhat, a cooking show (like hell's kitchen) senses an opportunity and features its first venlil to participate. They meet their team, and meet both nice and nasty people and get close with some of their team.



Up to this episode, the venlil got by preparing sides, garnishes, and any other dishes that didn't need meat. However, this dinner service, one of the venlil‚Äôs teammates got thrown out (for what, you decide). And now, the venlil has to handle and cook meat. Can they pull through and get through the service? Or will instincts overcome all? Does our venlil have what it takes to be an executive chef?

\-----

The Kitchen was excited as the crew waited for Ikea to set up the flat screen. The eight of them settled into the cozy workspace while Ikea, the friendly Venlil owner, connected her data slate to the Holomonitor. The crew, mostly made up of Venlil, chatted amongst themselves, adding a delightful mix with the Kolshian salad master and the human BBQ prep she had hired due to the influx of human customers. The two front-of-house members, alongside Farsul, were holding strong despite their fears, looking forward to the generous tips from the humans who praised them as 'the best girls‚Äù for their service‚Äîone even being told they resembled a ‚Äúcute dog!‚Äù whatever that was.¬†

 Ikea‚Äôs Trailside Cafe has been a beloved family establishment for three generations, navigating the challenges of zoning laws that often limit private businesses in public spaces. With the current wave of human refugees arriving on Venlil Prime, new refugee camps were set up near the station where Ikea‚Äôs cafe is located. Many regular patrons who used to stop by for lunch specials have become scarce, and hesitant to jump off the train these days. While some medical and governmental staff still visit, their stay is shorter than before. It's worth noting that the exterminators dining there aren't the best tippers either, contributing to the dwindling diner counts lately.

The new patrons seem to be the curious omnivores, the humans, who bring along intriguing food requests that Ikea had never encountered before. From their unique takes on classic dishes like BLTs to chicken Caesar salads featuring a creamy dressing known as mayonnaise‚Äîsomething they seem to love on everything! Already, her last Krakotl employee had taken a step back after learning about these rare ingredients. Ikea was gradually embracing human cuisine, noticing the increasing number of humans coming to the station, whether they were job seekers or just visiting the area.

To adapt to these changing times, Ikea had started using blackout grab bags for the meat-based dishes in the grab-n-go section, hoping to fill more of the roughly 50 available chairs. However, it just wasn't enough. She felt the weight of needing to improve her restaurant to keep the family legacy alive.¬† 

‚ÄúOK, everyone, I have some exciting news! We got a reply from that Earth show, Intergalactic Dining Disasters,‚Äù Ikea announced with genuine enthusiasm, using her tail language to uplift the mood. Reactions were mixed among her alien colleagues, but the humans couldn't contain their excitement, howling and laughing with joy.¬†

 ‚ÄúOh my gosh, is Chef Riley McNally really coming here?‚Äù Ricky, the brown head-furred human who proudly identified as ‚ÄúMexican,‚Äù exclaimed, beaming at the thought of the great-great-grandson of the legendary Gordon Ramsay visiting. 

‚ÄúHe hosted Cooking with the Stars! What nugget of food history are we presenting? I watched the first episode of Intergalactic Dining Disasters focused on different colonies, and I was surprised that they let him film across worlds, especially given these times. I didn't think Earth would even allow him to near aliens,‚Äù he added with disbelief.¬† 

‚ÄúHonestly, I expect this to go, Horribly A stampede rain to happen!‚Äù Kraut, the Kolshian salad master, Koala, defensively wrapping her tentacles.  



‚ÄúStill, this show could really help us during the off-season!‚Äù Mami, the lead server and only Farsul, mentioned with a hopeful glimmer in her eyes‚Äîshe was enjoying the extra tips the humans lavished on her. 



She treated herself to some spa time with that extra income and even contemplated sharing some special news with her Venlil partner. Ikea had tried to discuss tip-sharing with her, but she couldn't afford to lose any more staff, and hiring additional humans could jeopardize the fond roots of her cafe.  



Ikea signaled for her team's attention once more, her tail movements smooth and confident. ‚ÄúAlright, everyone, I have the tape, and the answer should be right here!‚Äù  



With a sense of excitement, she popped the holotape in...

**Show Intro**

Since the early days of mankind, we have looked up to the wee stars and wondered if we were truly alone in the galaxy. Now, with proof of life on other worlds, we ask the question: Is their food complete, Bollix? The camera pans to what looks to be a red-furred human in his late 40s, with a thick face mane. He is also wearing a dress of some kind.



‚ÄúNow, last season, we became the first show on the food matrix to be hosted IN SPACE!!!!‚Äù the Terrans voice echoed as the sound stage shifted to a starry void. 



‚ÄúWell, it's time to up the game as we just found out aliens are real and most out to fucking murder us, but some don't my wee lads and Lassies are the ones who need our help the most.‚Äù



Photos of different alien food pop up behind him, some not looking very Appetizing to the average human. 



‚ÄúThis is where I come in to help with the war effert; order 65 be \*\*\*\* and shoved up its own \*\*\*\*, so join me as we help people in‚Ä¶‚Äù



# Intergalactic dining Disaster!!!!



‚ÄúTonight, we will be going to Venlil Prime, which many humans made in preparation for the battle of Earth. As bad as things look, Boyo, we know the lads at home will give the feds the what for. Heck, half my own family has a long history of kicking over-expanding wankers out of places that they don't belong.‚Äù



The camera pans over a busy train station that has started to look a bit run down due to a lack of maintenance over the last few weeks. The outgoing ridership seems primarily human, as most of the incoming ridership doesn't even want to get off the train most of the time until departure or Timetables force them onto the main platform. Many shops have already closed down with a few stragglers remaining open, and even then, they had signs clearly stating, ‚ÄúHumans may not enter.‚Äù The only seemingly welcoming store is a small eatery built into the side of the western side of the main entryway to the station. A temporary fence surrounds the Tables and chairs, but the storage unit has been facing vandalism from some of the anti-human Resistance from the original occupiers of the district. Leaving a number of the chairs and tables broken and disabled, plus the sign for the cafe hasn't been saved from Vandalism either. in this heyday, they would fit about 50 seats now, they can barely seat about 15 guests a day. There was a first walkthrough with the owner.



**Confection booth talk**



The dark brown venial owner was looking away from the camera, trying to figure out what this thing was for.



‚ÄúI got to say the first meeting with the human was strangely more confusing; my translator was having trouble with some of the verbs, at the very least the man‚Ä¶woman. I'm not sure what word translates well to what McNelly is‚Ä¶‚Äù



The human Ricky could barely content himself. 



‚ÄúGod seeing him walk through the door, kilt and all, and the camera bots following him, like man, this is so real, but like everything, nothing ever lasts, and remember why people watch this‚Ä¶‚Äù



The salad master was pulling out some nerve weed from a pound on her chef coat and lit up a stick in the booth.



‚ÄúThe human man lady is the most BEEP BEEP BEEP peace of BEEP I have ever meet‚Ä¶‚Äù



**The greeting**



Chef McNelly approached owner Ikea, who extended her hand in the classic human manner, only to be taken aback when the grinning, exuberant human swept her up in a traditional tartan ‚Äúbear hug,"" leaving Ikea silently screaming as she felt like a deflated plush toy.



‚ÄúTop of the morning! Thank you for having us here. It‚Äôll arrive as soon as possible, and judging by your surroundings, it looks like you could use a makeover,"" the chef remarked while surveying the property.



The shop had seen little maintenance since the announcement of refugee camps in the area. As per emails from Ikea to Riley McNally, the city train guild had their thoughts on service to humans; their passive refusals for repairs shifted to outright declines once she stopped offering them complimentary wake root tea.



‚ÄúH-H-Hi, w-w-welcome to the cafe‚Ä¶my wait staff should have you‚Ä¶ ready for the sampler‚Ä¶‚Äù Ikea stammered, attempting to recover from the unexpected embrace as the chef took his seat, guided by the Farsul receptionist Jobi, who pulled out a chair for one of the two smaller tables.



‚ÄúHere is your seat, honored guest,‚Äù Jobi stated, but as she set down the chair, it collapsed under the chef's weight.



‚ÄúBloody hell! You warned me this place was crumbling, but what the \*\*\*\*? At only 40, I‚Äôm still young; I can't take hits like I did in my boxing days!""  



One of the camera bots had slipped through the kitchen's open window, capturing the back-of-house team‚Äôs reactions. While most staff looked on in fear of the potential wrath of the chef, two stood out: Ricky, the ""meat specialist,"" empathizing with the chef‚Äôs struggle by merely observing, and the salad master, who grinned with morbid delight.



‚ÄúShows that human right,‚Äù he muttered under his breath.



The chef quickly grabbed one of the chairs meant for the two larger party tables. Made from Darkside wood, one of the heaviest woods on the planet, it was sure to support a large man‚Äôs weight after being tested.



‚ÄúGood, good,‚Äù he said as he scanned the Piecemeal menu.



‚ÄúI'll order black coffee with room for cream and sugar, a BLTA with chips, a multi-berry tart, and lastly, a bright flower salad.""  



‚ÄúYes, honored diner, we will have that out shortly,"" the dog-like alien replied, entering the final details into a data slate before returning to her station.



Meanwhile, the back-of-house staff faced their own struggles as they hurried to operate the old, dilapidated equipment. Ricky worked in the more archaic and deteriorating section of the kitchen, where they had the... death station. A once-functional grill used for preparing grilled salads was now relegated to isolation as it made enough contact with dead flesh to fear a raid from the Extermination Guild. The meat even had its own cracked mini fridge as well, and the dairy was bought off the black market.





‚ÄúWhat is the status of that ranch, Kraut?‚Äù asked Ricky as he was grilling up the bacon strips to the Notation of the frog squid.



‚ÄúThe status is going \*\*\*\* yourself, that \*\*\*\* is not going anywhere near my salad, you \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* ape!!!!‚Äù Kraut yelled back in her normal Charming voice as she Swatted one of the cameras away.



‚ÄúPlease, we need to be on our best behavior, "" Ikea yelled back as she put the Pastry strips together and the muti-barry Jam She Had made earlier in the day.



**Confession booth**



‚ÄúSeriously, everybody, if we are going to make it, We need to work together.‚Äù

Ikea signs to herself

‚ÄúWe really couldn't afford to be Divided, especially with Kraut's views on human cuisine. I should have expected the worst.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, like god, I know Kraut was a \*\*\*\*\*, but she should have known what goes into a BLTA by now. Heck, she's lucky he didn't press assault charges by the end for just pointing out Leafs and Sticks don't make a Salad.‚Äù 

Ricky was trying to be casual despite being covered in Bruises.



‚ÄúTHAT \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* PEICE OF \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* THINK IT CAN \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* TO QUESTION MY \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.‚Äù the Kolshian was flailing her limbs all over the place as the Crew security was trying to drag her out of the booth.



‚ÄúYou are not Supposed to be back here,‚Äù one of the human guards said, getting a good Grip on her tackles.



**First judgment** 



The food is Brought out one at a time on silver dishes only reserved for VIP guests and large parties. With Each pull of the dishpan, the chef's grin grows sour. 



The first dish, the BLTA, and chips, had Lettuce tomatoes on the side of the plate itself, with a whole uncut Avocado. The chips weren't even Fried or baked at all, in fact, they were still Soggy. The bacon was Farley cooked through, and on the bread, the two things that looked done well.



‚ÄúWhat the \*\*\*\* is this?!‚Äù



‚ÄúUh, human food, sir?‚Äù 



‚ÄúThis is complete, Bollix, did you guys even take a Basic sanitation course pointing to the Lettuce and tomatoes on the serving, Trey, before grabbing the Avocado?



‚ÄúWhy isn't this cut up?!‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, some of our honored donors don't have much trouble eating it whole, so we assumed that you would‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúMy god, woman!!!! How hasn't anyone \*\*\*\*ing choked to death, mate, and the chips!!!!‚Äù



Grabbing the soggy mess of cut potatoes. The flying Kitchen camera names focus on Ricky and the Kalian arguing.



‚ÄúWhy did you do that, you said you would take care of the French fries.‚Äù Ricky yelled



‚ÄúBecause that dress-wearing man didn't deserve to eat the same plant mature as us, and who the \*\*\*\* drowns any veggie in oil!!!!‚Äù



The Receptionist quickly opened up another plate cover to show the coffee with little cups of cream and earth Sugar. 



‚ÄúYour coffee honored dinner,‚Äù she said, pouring out the black liquid with an uneasy paw.



He took one sip of the black liquid before he spat it out, being a bit more bitter than it should be.



‚ÄúMy god, how the \*\*\*\* you \*\*\*\* up a cup of \*\*\*\*ing joe it's like you didn't even roast the beans.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶we didnt‚Ä¶‚Äù the waiter barked out



Meanwhile, the kitchen cam bot was chancing at Ikea and Ricky, freaking out on the reaction of the guest shelf while the salad master rubbed her tentacles together. 		



‚ÄúLook at that dumb predator suffer, thinking he knows anything about fine dining.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the \*\*\*\* you were supposed to roast the coffee beans this morning, we are trying to do our best here!!!



‚ÄúShut it, human, Nothing you or Ikea can make can compare to my culinary skills.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶you were the one that said you handle the hot drinks today‚Ä¶



‚ÄúYou have shut it, Ikea, you noseless \*\*\*\*\* just be glad I stayed on for the sake of your mother despite her veil root craft being more \*\*\*\* than most of your pastries.‚Äù the frog-squid crocked as we switched by to the chef.



McNally tried to pour his cream into the coffee, but Clumps of a spoiled cheeselike substance came out. The Temperamental chef threw the cream and coffee to the ground.



‚ÄúMy word, boyo, what the \*\*\*\* is wrong with this place? Have the \*\*\*\*? Do you not know how to store milk right BOYO!!!!‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-uh, we had to get it off the black market ah n-n-no one ship human dairy or meat here without being declared pray diseased‚Ä¶please can how about you try the Flower salad.‚Äù the waiter, trying to calm the Predatory chef down by revealing the next dish.



From the Kitchen drone cam, the salad master was positively glowing, all her work making the other chefs work to get her chance to show the humans, if not the galaxy, what real food looks Support staff like. Koala had trumped the best leaves and twigs and picked the best flowers, her root and flower salad were alike, nothing else.



‚ÄúWhat the heck, you think I'm a Donkey? Who in their right mind could eat this?‚Äù 



The Receptionist, just about ready to flee, tried her best to explain. 



‚ÄúSir, several pray folk enjoy this daily, not everyone is as carnivorous as you‚Äù



‚ÄúNot that I can eat it, just who, the leaves are fully Bloomed yet, plus the twigs still have Moss and insects prior. I would think most life-loving prayer folks want to be chewing on bugs. Send this all back and tell them to shut down the Kitc‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúHOW \*\*\*\*ING DARE YOU INSULT MY COOKING YOU WANNABE LEAF CHEWING PRICK!!!!!!‚Äù the Kolshian crocked as she pulled out her knife and jumped out of the Kitchen window and to the human chef already in a Defensive stance.



The camera switches to the Kitchen crew looking on helplessly as the screaming turns into yelling that turns to some of the venal Support staff fading as the sounds of fighting break out. 



‚Äú\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* someone call 911 right the \*\*\*\* now!‚Äù Ricky yelled as he grabbed one of the folding chairs and jumped out of the Serving window as well while Ikea looked on in studded horror.



**One short Commercial break later**



Last time on Intergalactic Dining Disasters, chef Riley McNally saw the restaurant vandalize the kitchen, which was a mess during the first meal of the day, nearly poisoning him. On top of all of that, It ended with the 3rd ever time McNally has ever been stabbed in the air. Now, weeks later the restaurant has been repaired, dedicated, and now ready to reopen.





Chef Riley walked on a pair of crutches at a completely changed Restaurant and Kitchen; the Temporary fence was now a proper Barrier about to be broken down, folded, and locked in on themselves, modern chairs and tables for all sizes. The Kitchens have been cleaned up and upgraded with the Latest wares that the UN-aligned suppliers will allow.



Ikea couldn't believe how new the place looked, almost like it was when her parents were in. The painted flowers and Other decor were restored, and the place had a buzz to it, like how her folks took out loans to remodel it for her when they retired from the Restaurant business. To tour the galaxy‚Ä¶and right into a party of raiding Arxur. She miss them everyday.



‚ÄúSo now that we are set we just need to talk to your crew about the new menu, your ‚ÄúMeat specialist‚Äù had some great ideas he wanted to share with you this morning and‚Ä¶‚Äù Riley was interrupted by an explosion in the Distance and followed the Narrator cutting in.



That morning at the Earth Memorial ceremony, a group of terrorists calling themselves ‚Äúhumanity first‚Äù carried out a terrorist attack, killing dozens of people, including UN Secretary-General Elias Meier. Ricky Sanchez was among the Mourners killed in the attack.



**Confession booth**



Ikea beside herself as she looked into the camera ‚ÄúWhy would anyone do this? To there own‚Ä¶ people in a time of mourning‚Ä¶why‚Ä¶‚Äù as she starts to break down crying.



**Dining room cam**



Riley did his best to Configure the furry goat-like Alien as it was getting close to dinner time. Ikea was surprised that the man who was screaming up a storm every chance he got was so‚Ä¶warm and caring.



‚ÄúLet it all out‚Ä¶ that's in‚Ä¶just let it all out‚Ä¶no one is Judging here,‚Äù the chef said as the camera bot zoomed in on the crying IKEA, a mess of tears and spital.



‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶gods thank you‚Ä¶Just‚Ä¶ he was the first human that I trusted when they started moving into the Sector. He stopped someone trying to rob the place, and when I found out he could cook‚Ä¶and meat at that, I gave him the job right off the bat. He's been telling me about his family in Mexico City and how‚Ä¶the Bunker then hold just this morning‚Ä¶O gods, why!!!!‚Äù



‚ÄúNow, now, let's honor him like cooks do, making a meal in his name, and you be on the grill.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúI'll be with you, Lessee, You not going to poison anyone on my watch besides, how will you make a proper dia de los Muertos without beef street tacos.‚Äù



Ikeas tilted her head. ‚ÄúTacos?‚Äù



**Ten years later**



Tonight on Intergalactic Dining Disasters Reunion, we revisit one of our earlier Seasons of the Original 10 Season run, Ikea‚Äôs trainside, on Skalga. Ikea has become Famous in the Venlil culinary world as not only one of the first Venlil chefs to study human Barbecue in both the grilling schools in Texas but also the classic Cantina styles of Mexico and Central America.



B-roll runs of Ikea in an Apron fur Soaping grease as she is working some Shredded pork for some mini tacos to be sent out.



She was also big in the movement of letting humans eat meat outside and unmasked when the newly Elected governor started signing off on anti-human laws. 



B-roll switches to her at the Podium of the local city hall. Yelling like a Familiar chef, ‚ÄúMother \*\*\*\*\*\* have any \*\*\*\* idea how this \*\*\*\* makes them feel? Heck, it is not even possible for me and more than 100 Restaurants in the \*\*\*\*ing District. We can not move our shops to ‚Äúan area with less Foot traffic‚Äù and if people don't like what they see in the black bags don't \*\*\*\*ing look, or better \*\*\*\*ing yet call the exterminators‚Äù



B-roll moves back to her cafe with an older gray-furred Venlil by her side as well three pups with noses as they set up a papel picado of Ricky on a traditional family shrine.



Ikea met Migi at one of the many pro-human protests during Veln‚Äôs first and only term as governor. They are fully cured of the federation genetics tampering and expect their kids to live full lives as proper Skalgan war chefs. 

(thank you for reading first time ever doing something like this.)

Since several living there are without basic needs, the next best step should be rebuilding from the ground up. As I mentioned in another post, it is essential that muslims, when in times of crisis, learn to become self sufficient. The most important part of this goal is dietary adjustment, and this further requires a knowledge of both what is edible, and under what conditions.

  
Below is a guide to the all the edible wild plants of Yemen. Please note, this is a very long list. If you would like to know the edible plants of a specific region or town, please tell me which.

I would also recommend those who are able to give some sadaqa, the most reliable way to give charity would be to find a large masjid and see if they are doing any funds for Yemen. If not, the most transparent charities are Yemen Foundation [https://yemenfoundation.org/donate/](https://yemenfoundation.org/donate/) and Mona Relief [https://monarelief.ngo/](https://monarelief.ngo/)

If I go with him both eyes I will get a LAL +, surgery will be 2 days apart with adjustments in his office.  However, I‚Äòm interested in the PureSee IOL that isn‚Äôt available in the USA so I will need to go to Canada for surgery (I‚Äôm in Phoenix, AZ).  I‚Äôve already reached out to the office in Canada where I want to have surgery to get the process started. Both eyes will be done the same day or a day apart. I will be there a week. 

Vision history:
Female, 50s. Cataracts behind the lenses most likely caused by prednisone taken for ankylosing spondylitis. I never needed glasses until my 50s when my reading vision died.  For 3 years until December, I wore a reading contact in my right eye. My left eye didn‚Äôt need anything. I still have 20/20 distance vision in my left eye as long as light is not shined towards it.  I stopped driving at night 3 months ago. My right eye cataract is horrible so I can‚Äôt really see out of that eye and I‚Äôm terrified this will happen to my left eye soon!

My concerns: 
LAL+, Phoenix is the sunniest and hottest city in the US. Our summers start in April which is tomorrow!  I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll accidentally lock in my vision just by going downstairs one morning to make a coffee and look out into my backyard (which faces east) without the special glasses. Plus all the appointments and I hear that the adjustments are almost terrifying and/or quite anxiety inducing. I also fear post adjustment starbursts or halos.

PureSee, since it‚Äôs not available in my country I can‚Äôt find much about it. I can‚Äôt find any personal experience videos on YouTube or TikTok or online. I‚Äôve read that it has far less nighttime vision disturbances, better contrast, is easier to see in low light and that it allows great vision ranges from reading to driving.  But I want to know about the drawbacks or potential issues of the PureSee if there are any.  

I‚Äôm looking to have surgery in a month or two whether I do it here or in Canada. My decision will be based on the lenses I choose.

Any insights or knowledge to help me make a decision on which to choose will be greatly appreciated!",1,1743493464.0,CataractSurgery,0,1.0,False
1joq1e2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1joq1e2,My opinion on the Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L:,"I love this backpack ‚Äì I hate this backpack :)

What I like:

The backpack looks fantastic, truly great. The outer material feels incredibly high-quality and offers decent protection against rain (though you shouldn‚Äôt expect too much).

The admin pocket is amazing. It‚Äôs big enough to quickly throw in a few items and still offers a certain degree of organizational possibilities. I wish more backpacks had a compartment like this. üòä

The inside of the backpack also looks great. The choice of colors and materials is convincing, though I always worry that it might get dirty inside and won‚Äôt look as nice anymore ‚Äì but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. üòä

The size of the backpack, at 26L, is perfect for me. I mainly use it for commuting and weekend trips. On one side, it has a compartment for a water bottle, which can easily hold a 1-liter Nalgene bottle. On the other side, it has a smaller zippered pocket. I keep an umbrella and my keys in there.

What I don‚Äôt like:

I wish the backpack had two compartments for water bottles. I often carry water and a coffee mug, and I‚Äôd prefer to store them outside of the main compartment.

What bothers me the most, however, is the strap system. As soon as the backpack is loaded a bit more (for example, with a water bottle, coffee mug, clothing for one night, laptop, and headphones), it becomes very uncomfortable to wear. The padding on the straps isn‚Äôt too bad, but since they become narrower at the ends, they quickly feel uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, this last point is decisive for me. I simply don‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing the backpack for extended periods. So, this backpack is now going into the closet, and a new Aer City Pack Pro 2 will take its place. I‚Äôm curious to see how that one performs. üòä",1,1743493304.0,Nomads_Nation,0,1.0,False

My wife and I have a 5 month old daughter who my wife exclusively breast feeds. She is currently waking up anywhere from 3 to 5 times a night to feed our baby who wakes up to feed at the moment. My wife is a stay at home for the next year to look after our daughter while I work full time. Most of the time I WFH but sometimes I need to travel.

My wife and I have an agreement that because I work, she will get up throughout the night to feed, change and settle the baby while I try and sleep. I do wake up at 6am when the baby wakes up and change her and make coffees for my wife and I so she can get another 30 mins of sleep before the baby needs a feed again.

Over the last few weeks, it is getting to the point where I am not sleeping as well and waking up when the baby wakes up. While I do get back to sleep while my wife is feeding her, I am finding I am getting tired in the mornings. Now I need to travel for work in 2 days and as a result, I need to get up at 4am for my flight. As a result, I have told my wife that it might be best I sleep in another room that night so I am not too tired for my flight the next day. Safe to say, she is pissed off and says that's not fair and she feels like she is by herself if I do that. I don't really think that is fair, as I need to catch a flight for work the next day and I'll be tired if I don't get a good nights sleep.

My retail entry level Breville barista express (bes0870) inbuilt grinder has gone KO. It works sometimes but typically won't grind or move and has been getting worse for the time between when it wants to come back to life.

In desperate for a coffee so I wanted to buy my first standalone Grinder but I'm a bit lost.

I'm Australia based so using a central website such as alternative brewing :

https://alternativebrewing.com.au/collections/automatic-coffee-grinders

I asked a few random questions online and was told that rather than do the retail dummy thing and buy a Breville smart grinder  to go the df54 machines or even a Eureka (mignon manuale and whatever else there is from Eureka). However the varia vs3 gen 2 on that website was recommended by the website seller over the df54.

Others say a 1zpresso or kingrinder manuals are the way to go.

I'm a bit lost. I make espressos now for milk coffees (flat whites etc) but would love the ability to venture into filter or other styles if I have a grinder. I didn't want to go el cheapo or down the enthusiast rabbit hole for my first. What's that middle ground equipment that isn't dirty cheap but is decent enough to get me grinding?

Someone recently told me to avoid the df54 and go df64 or higher as the df54 and varia have retention issues and non unimodal grind (so variations in size were high he explained). Super confused as all others said a good starter was a df54 and they swear by it. 

Who's right. Who's wrong? And while researching should I just get a hand  manual grinder so I can stop using a crappy blade based grinder and butchering my beans haha. Or is a manual too much extra work for a first foray into grinding? I just get up and make one or two cups for partner and I before work so rarely have guests or large volumes to be grinded. So not even sure if a hopper is needed or I should get a single dose grinder as this is all new to me.

Also got told to stick to 64mm or larger burrs for after market burr changes. Whatever that means. Supposedly for future endeavours?

I do plan to also find and get those weighing scales people use if anyone has recommendations. Not sure if I can just continue to use my Breville portafilter with a new grinder too? Or do I need to change it?",1,1743492884.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I (M32) got broken up with (F30) during a very tough time

We met via Hinge, both of us wanted long term (marriage) and started dating

We live just a few blocks away, so we used to meet everyday and connected very well. Of course there were teething issues, and we had to work on a few things, but we were going with it

Come March, I injured my knee and had to walk around in a cast. She too was going through health issues. I got a surgery done eventually for my Knee. She was there for me through it and I'm grateful. Her mother was also very supportive and even spent the night at hospital, looking after me.

Both our families knew too.

My family however created a nuisance as they couldn't be there due to an out of trip business work. They made my life hell as they were upset about her mother staying over. Obviously my partner was witness to all of this and she was getting annoyed. I got discharged from the hospital. My partner came for the discharge. I told her not to act up but she passed a taunt and left and my family's anger just got worse.

I fought for my partner. I even left the house and went to a hotel to stay. They started messaging and calling her. I told her to block them. Later on that night, she broke up with me saying I need to get my life together and then I should offer to share it with her.

She wanted me to get therapy, and do a few things, which I began doing.

The next few days, I took a stand for my partner at home and restricted my family about interfering. They realized, felt guilty, understood their mistake, Apologized to her via text. They even offered to meet and sort out the misunderstanding but she wasn't having any of it.

After the breakup, I went NC for a few days. We then spoke and she was to return home after 2 days as she was out on a business trip. In the interim, I met her family and apologized. They expressed their doubts about my family, I ensured them it was a one time thing and they were cool with it

She came back, called me herself, met me for coffee. We met again for a drive. Things were getting better. Point to note - She was absolutely normal with me when we met, she hugged me, was holding my hand, behaving normal

When I was dropping her off the last time, she said she doesn't feel for me anymore. She cares and all of that but doesn't have romantic feelings and it's wrong to be speaking to me. She said maybe her part in my life was only till here.

I feel blindsided, cause I really gave it all and I love her and still want her back.

Point to note - Before my surgery, I told her categorically that please allow me 10-15 days to get my health in order. Let's not fight or take any rash decision and just let things normalize. I told her I would be needy but I'll be okay by the 31st of March. Yet during this time only, she broke up.

I really tried a lot and I'd do anything for her

Please suggest, what do I do. 

It feels like a very immature breakup and I don‚Äôt think she can lose feelings in a matter of 8-10 days, considering how close we were.

A bit of context, Im 37M, wife (let's call her Marta) 33F, been married for 5 years and 12 years since we started dating. due to professional reasons we moved to another country 3 years ago.
Two weeks ago we find out we are going to be parents for the first time.

Now, straight to the story
 
- Lie N¬∞1: A couple weeks ago Marta went out with her coworkers on a Friday, which I am totally cool with that, except she did not tell me.
Usually Fridays are the day where we connect and relax after our busy week, so normally she would have informed me she was going out, but this time she didnt.
When she came home I asked her why she didnt told me and she said it was something they planned on the moment. I must say she seemed to be annoyed when I asked.
A couple days after we attended a birthday meeting of one of these coworkers and when I asked to one of them (Marta not present in the convesation) if they had a good time on
friday this person confirmed me that this friday event was planned quite beforehand, and definitely not on the moment as Marta said. I didnt gave it much importance at the moment, but since I've catched her on another ""little"" lie (next) this came back to my mind.

- Lie N¬∞2: Marta did a pregnancy test while at work and one of her female coworkers (Let's call her Anna) was with her, so Anna was the first one to know about this. I asked Marta if someone else besides Anna knows and she told me no.
So after this we agreed to not tell anyone else until we speak with our families, since they will come to visit us soon and it will be the perfect moment to share the news.
So, a week after that, Marta told me that another coworker (Let's call her Tina), recently mother of a newborn, shared to Marta some helpful information about the bureaucratic process of having a baby in this country,
of course this information is always welcome, but I also replied ""ok, so you also told Tina about our news"". Which Marta replied ""yes, I just did last night"".
Marta got a little nervous, so naturally something seemed odd to me. Therefore the conversation went something like this:
- ME:(in a friendly tone) Why are you nervous, is there something you are not telling me?.
- MARTA: No, not at all! Why would I be hiding something to you?
- ME: I dont know, you are acting weird. If there's something you need to tell me just go ahead, Im listening.
- MARTA: Naaa, you are just being paranoid(she repeated this a couple times).  Why are you acting like this? There's nothing wrong, I swear. 
I decided to end the conversation there.
Moving forward, I casually saw Tina and her baby at the shopping mall (yes, we live in a very small city), I was happy to see her baby for the first time so I invited her for a coffee.
And while we were chatting and catching up, she slipped that she find out about Marta's pregnancy the same day as Anna (the other coworker). The three of them  have a chat group and Marta sent a photo of the pregnancy test there, the same day she find out. Strange, isnt't it?

Wrapping up: Im not annoyed about Marta going out with her coworkers and I'm not annoyed about Anna and Tina knowing about Marta's pregnacy even though we agreed to not tell anyone else.
I'm annoyed by the fact that Marta lied to me. A bit hurt and disrespected because when I gave her the chance to tell me the truth she told me I was being paranoid.
I dont understand what is the point of these small stupid lies.
Now, I know I have to talk to her about this, but im thinking about what would be the best way to do it. How to approach Marta the right way? What should I even say? How do I know she wont slip small lies to me again?
Are there more lies? Am I overreacting about these stupid lies? Am I overthinking this? I feel so stupid asking this questions. Any advice is welcome. Thanks.

I love this game to the deepest core of my heart. I love the game-play loop, the story, the characters, everything. I have completed 6 play-through and still planning more. However I still wish there were some things DAV could have done better.

1. Romance: I don't know why the devs took the mass effect 2 approach this time with Romance in this game. With Inquisition, they knocked it out of the park in terms of romance. But why go from that to almost bare bones type romance with a scene before the suicide mission, like in ME2, I have no idea. I wish to smooch Harding and Bellara. I wish to go on more Necropolis Garden Dates with Emmrich. I wish to go to Arlathan with Bellara. Maybe get picked by Taash and be smooched vigorously, go on coffee dates with Lucanis, take Assan out for more trips with Davrin, have fish fries at Halos with Neve, take Harding out on gladiator matches. At the very least, let me constantly smooch my lovers. Ahh, Dragon Age, I have no idea why go for this downgrade from Inquisition.

2. Have more morally questionable decisions like the Minrathous and Treviso choice, something that makes me think which to choose. >!The Avowed choice between Lodwyn and Ryngrim still makes me twitch.!<

3. I wish the game would have allowed the same level of exposure as Ghilan'nain to El'garnan. I feel like the game just moves at breakneck speed after Blood of Arlathan. There should have been at least one more quest to allow El'garnan to shine more.

4.An epilogue in the Lighthouse before the final cutscenes would have been amazing as well. And the epilogue slides to be a bit more informative that vague.

5.More companions and Rook dynamics. >!Avowed in that sense surpassed both BG3 and Veilguard. Why?  Because Avowed allowed companions to interact with each other while standing in the camp, not like BG3 where companions stood like Cardboard cutouts that never talked with each other. Veilguard also improved on companion to companion interaction. However Avowed did one thing better than Veilguard as well in that it allowed constant conversation between Envoy and Companions and sometimes companions can even chime in when Envoy talked with other companions.!<",4,1743491556.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,0,1.0,False

In a previous post, I said a friend of mine, our lifegroup leader, was trying to help me ""figure out"" why homosexuality is a sin. It got to me a little, but like always, y'all came in to save the day from me making a stupid decision.

In two days' time, I am going to meet with her over coffee to ""answer any questions"" so she can ""provide the answers"". I have a calling, a feeling in my stomach, that i can perhaps change her mind.

I promised myself to never be a Bible basher, to make people believe what I believe, but I am also tired of people doing it to me. Time to fight fire with fire...politely of course. 

I would forever be grateful if any of you could give me any research...any explanation against clobber scripture, even something as small as Paul saying that women can't teach, or historical background.

More like the echos of where our souls began. Fear your to deep In the pit of hating me now. That I‚Äôm left to only beg, & plead & bow. You are my hearts desire, the gentleness in the throws of life. You took me places I‚Äôve never known, All within the comfort of our own homes.

I'm HOPINGGGG they add some sort of variation of matcha üòã

Mint flavoured syrup,  milk, whipped cream and a mint candy on top !! 

ü•ù Apple & Kiwi Fresh 

2 pumps apple syrup, 2 pumps kiwi syrup, cold water and ice 

üçë Peaches n' Cream

- admittedly inspired by the upcoming GPGP peach event, but still want to add it in.

1jopcju,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/the-power-stole-fortune-teller-horror-stor/,The Power I Stole From The Fortune Teller,"My name is Melis, I‚Äôm 22 years old. I was studying at Marmara University, Faculty of Foreign Languages. I rented a house near the G√∂ztepe campus and lived there with my roommate. Everything actually started that day.

One day, I went to a cafe in Kadƒ±k√∂y with all my friends. We ate, drank, and finally ordered coffee. We all turned our cups upside down and started waiting, trying to read each other‚Äôs fortunes just for fun. Then, a cafe employee came over to us and said, ‚ÄúIf you want, the lady over there can read your fortunes; she‚Äôs quite skilled at this and works here.‚Äù She started reading the fortunes of a few of my friends, and everyone stared at her, mouths agape. Then the woman came over to me, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs read your fortune too, if you want,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in such things.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt insist much.

In the following days, we started gathering with friends every week and going to that cafe. My friends became absolutely fascinated by the woman; they were constantly going to her. A few times while she was reading fortunes, I got slight headaches; I felt a bit unwell, honestly. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want to go, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to upset my friends either. Going with them back and forth, it felt like my interest was growing a bit too. Finally, I asked the woman, ‚ÄúCan you read my fortune too?‚Äù and from that day on, I had fallen under her influence. ‚ÄúCome on over,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbring your cup.‚Äù

Around that time, I was dating someone named Bekir; I could even say I was in love with him. The fortune teller immediately started talking about Bekir. ‚ÄúYou love him now, but over time your love will fade, and you‚Äôll set sail for entirely different shores,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt happen,‚Äù I retorted, ‚Äúwe love each other, after all. I don‚Äôt believe what you‚Äôre saying,‚Äù and I went to the restroom. What she said had upset me a bit. After taking a deep breath, I went back down and took my seat at the table again.

While the woman was reading fortunes for the others, I started texting Bekir on my phone, telling him I loved him. Then I locked my phone screen. At that moment, in the reflection on the phone, I noticed someone looking at me from behind, right at the level of my hair. I could only see their pupils; they were staring at me with pure white eyes. For a few seconds, I stared back at the phone in panic. Then I quickly turned around; there was nothing there. I took a deep breath, and everyone, seeing my panic, said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll come back next week.‚Äù

We went home with my roommate, but after that day, my head started hurting a lot, especially in the evenings. It hurt terribly. I took medicine, but it didn‚Äôt help at all. I also started to slowly drift away from my boyfriend, Bekir. When we met, we couldn‚Äôt find anything to talk about anymore; we just looked at each other. Over time, our texting decreased and eventually stopped completely. I stopped calling him too, and the inevitable end came; we broke up.

Meanwhile, my headaches continued every night. I couldn‚Äôt study, and my grades started to suffer. Midterms ended, and then, to clear my head a bit, I went down to the pier. I sat on a bench and started thinking, ‚ÄúWhy did things turn out this way?‚Äù I needed to pull myself together again, but this time, besides the headache, fatigue and loss of appetite had also begun. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house, wasn‚Äôt attending my classes, and wasn‚Äôt taking care of myself. Actually, I used to wake up every morning with great joy and excitement, but soon after, all my motivation and mood would vanish.

My roommate couldn‚Äôt stand seeing me like this anymore and said, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go out, clear your head a bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúmaybe a change will do me good, let‚Äôs go out.‚Äù After wandering around for a bit, we ended up at that same cafe in Kadƒ±k√∂y again. We ordered coffee, and they suggested, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get our fortunes read again.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. The fortune teller greeted us, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, welcome.‚Äù I had immediately caught her attention. ‚ÄúI was expecting you a long time ago, but you didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had some problems, I was dealing with them,‚Äù I said. The moment she started reading my fortune, I felt my skirt lift, and then it felt like someone was stroking my hair, but there was no one around.

‚ÄúJust as I told you,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúYour relationship with your boyfriend is over; I told you, remember? Now you will taste something different and new,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out in time, let‚Äôs wait a bit, I‚Äôll tell you, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she replied. Then she mentioned my grades and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting bad grades in your exams, this will continue. You need to pull yourself together first,‚Äù and she finished the reading.

After that day, I started noticing changes in myself. I constantly felt the urge to go to the fortune teller; she began to bind me to her. There were times I went twice, even three times a week. It was impossible not to admire that woman; she could practically read a person‚Äôs life just by looking into their eyes. The fortune teller told me I would have a new relationship and slowly start to become my old self again. And it happened just as she said; I slowly started to pull myself together. I entered a new relationship with a guy named H√ºseyin, and we got along quite well. But I started wondering, ‚ÄúHow does this fortune teller know these things?‚Äù

Later, I did detailed research on fortune tellers. Fortune tellers could generally know many things through others. Who were these others? Their jinn, of course. She definitely had a jinni; I had even sensed it. I saw it once on my phone screen, and a few times when it stroked my hair‚Ä¶ I was a little scared, but going back and forth, it started to intrigue me more. The jinn‚Ä¶ Actually, the admiration I felt wasn‚Äôt for the woman herself, but for the jinni or jinn she commanded. Could I possibly do what that woman did? Essentially, the woman had no special quality. Her aura had affected me at first, okay, but what gave her that aura were the beings she communicated with. Otherwise, the woman was just a sloppy, dowdy character.

The pair of eyes I saw on my phone screen during my visits and the sensations in my body‚Ä¶ Her jinni had contacted me; that‚Äôs what I thought could have happened. Maybe, like that woman, I could command a jinni too. Why not? My life was going badly anyway, my relationships were ending, my exams were failures, and I wasn‚Äôt making any decent money. I decided to expand my research and wondered, ‚ÄúCan I summon a jinni with a ritual?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt quite dare to do it for that purpose. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wait and see, maybe everything will change over time,‚Äù I told myself.

Meanwhile, I continued going to the fortune teller. After all, by observing her, I could learn more than I would from books or the internet. The woman told me my relationship would end. ‚ÄúYour life will be calmer from now on,‚Äù she said. She was intent on making me completely dependent on her.

During one of my visits to the fortune teller, I saw it again on my phone screen, but this time I didn‚Äôt look away in fear. I was startled at first, but I had made up my mind to communicate with them. Gathering my courage, I looked at my phone screen with a sincere smile.

When I got home that day, my roommate called me; she said she wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few days, her father was ill, and she was going to her hometown. ‚ÄúSorry to hear that,‚Äù I said. I would be alone at home for a while. H√ºseyin called me, and I didn‚Äôt feel like answering the phone. Suddenly, I started to feel distant from him too. That same night, I sent him a message: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me again. I don‚Äôt want to see you anymore.‚Äù Apparently, he was going to tell me he wanted to break up anyway; this relieved me quite a bit.

Everything was progressing rapidly for some reason. Relationships, classes‚Äîthey all seemed pointless and unnecessary to me. I wanted a different, spiritual power. For this, I constantly encouraged myself. At night, I took my dinner and sat in front of the television. While watching normally, the channel suddenly disappeared, and the screen went blank. I picked up the remote, pressed buttons, but the TV wouldn‚Äôt turn on. About five minutes later, the screen came back on. As I was changing channels, something strange, resembling a black man, appeared for a few seconds, then it switched to another channel. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I wondered. I got very close to the TV, rapidly changing channels. I didn‚Äôt see it again. But then, a shadow quickly moved from the doorway towards the kitchen. I had seen it, I was sure. I went towards the kitchen, looked around carefully, couldn‚Äôt see anything. I came back to the living room and started thinking. ‚ÄúDid I imagine it?‚Äù I asked myself. No, it wasn‚Äôt a hallucination, I was sure. It was reality itself; I could distinguish between reality and imagination. ‚ÄúCould this be a jinni?‚Äù crossed my mind. But I hadn‚Äôt performed any ritual or invitation. ‚ÄúWould they come uninvited?‚Äù I wondered. But then the events I experienced at the fortune teller‚Äôs place came to mind. It made its presence felt there. ‚ÄúCould it be the one that came?‚Äù I thought.

On one hand, I was browsing the internet; on the other, I was examining the books I bought out of curiosity. At that moment, I heard cosmetic products fall in the bathroom. I was extremely tense, but I immediately headed towards the bathroom anyway. I looked around carefully; there was nothing. ‚ÄúWill you show yourself to me again?‚Äù I started calling out. I waited there for a few minutes. Just as I was about to leave, I saw a silhouette in the mirror. I stared at the mirror. For a moment, I felt scared, but I immediately tried to communicate with it. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked. It didn‚Äôt answer and suddenly disappeared. I examined the bathroom for about 5-10 minutes, called out to it again, but got no response. ‚ÄúShow yourself to me again,‚Äù I called out. Nothing happened.

From my internet research, I learned that they love smoke and incense. I also read that they adore bones and bone marrow as food. I immediately went out, bought some incense sticks and candles. I went to the butcher and got some bones. I didn‚Äôt know how to invite it. However, it felt like I didn‚Äôt need an invitation; it would come. My smile towards it at the cafe had caught its attention, and that‚Äôs why it was trying to get close to me. It wouldn‚Äôt harm me. I kept psyching myself up with these thoughts.

I lit the candles and incense in the bathroom. I placed the bones in a corner. I started waiting. I was both scared and curious, and also hopeful, thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe I can possess a very different power in this life.‚Äù I waited and waited; it didn‚Äôt come. Later, I shouted loudly inside the bathroom, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to invite you, but I prepared all this for you!‚Äù Then I heard a hissing sound from inside the bathroom. I looked around; it wasn‚Äôt visible. Then I knocked on the mirror three times with my hand: ‚Äútap tap tap.‚Äù A few seconds later, a sound came from the bathroom, just like my knocking: ‚Äútap tap tap.‚Äù I swallowed hard in fear. Then I changed the rhythm and knocked ‚Äútap tap tap tap.‚Äù It responded in the same way. This repeated a few more times. It imitated whatever I did. Then, I laughed and said, ‚ÄúSo you liked this.‚Äù A giggling sound came from it. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ this is a nice game, but I thought you might be hungry, so I got you bones, look, they‚Äôre over there,‚Äù I said. A few seconds later, crunching sounds came from the bones, like a wild animal eating its meal. After about half a minute, the sounds stopped.

Seeing that it didn‚Äôt harm me at all and even moved in harmony with me, I grew bolder. ‚ÄúAre you going to show yourself to me?‚Äù I asked. In the dimly lit bathroom illuminated by candles, it showed itself to me for a few seconds. This time its eyes weren‚Äôt visible; it looked like it was draped in a black sheet from head to toe. I couldn‚Äôt see its face or eyes, but I was extremely scared; I couldn‚Äôt stop my knees from trembling or my teeth from chattering. I quickly went back to the living room.

None of what I saw was a hallucination; it was completely real. I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if I was scared or excited, but I think I might have acted too soon to see it; I had gotten involved in things my psyche couldn‚Äôt handle immediately. The good part was that it didn‚Äôt seem to have any intention of harming me. Reassured by this thought, I lay down on my bed, stared at the ceiling, and drifted off. My hands and feet slowly started to go numb. My eyes closed involuntarily, and I couldn‚Äôt control them anymore. My eyes closed.

I found myself wandering in an empty garden. It was pitch black all around. Then it came again. Its face was covered with a veil; it looked like it was wearing a black cloak from head to toe. ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù I asked. It nodded and tried to speak to me using a strange language. I didn‚Äôt understand anything. Later, it said, ‚ÄúI am the fortune teller‚Äôs jinni, I fell in love with you.‚Äù A smile instantly formed on my face. ‚ÄúIf it falls in love with me, then this jinni will be mine,‚Äù I thought. When the morning call to prayer sounded, my eyes opened, and I woke up. So, it was all real. What I saw on the TV and in the bathroom wasn‚Äôt a dream; it was real.

The next night, after dinner, I lay down on my bed again. After a while, my hands and feet started to go numb. I was looking up at the ceiling again, and my eyes closed. This time, I found myself at the foot of a mountain. There were wild goats around me, and it came too. I asked its name; it told me its name. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be afraid of me anymore,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid anyway,‚Äù I replied. I started to feel drawn to it for some reason. I had only been able to see its face once. I would see it many more times later, but for now, it had only allowed this much.

As soon as I woke up, I immediately started digging through books and the internet. I began researching ‚ÄúHow to read fortunes?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to command jinn?‚Äù. My roommate had also returned, but I didn‚Äôt let her notice anything. I usually spent most of my time in my room, trying to communicate with that entity. I started burning incense in my room. It felt like my life‚Äôs sole duty, purpose was it. I slowly grew distant from everyone, hardly seeing anyone anymore. I spent my days with it, getting used to it more and more.

Later, like that woman, I slowly started mingling with people and reading fortunes, especially for my university friends. But it wouldn‚Äôt be limited to just that; word spread, and my reputation grew. I started earning good money too. So much so that, through acquaintances and relatives, I began choosing my clients. I didn‚Äôt take money, only gifts from people. Of course, I didn‚Äôt accept gifts below a certain value and wouldn‚Äôt read fortunes for those people. My room started overflowing with phones, tablets, and expensive jewelry.

One night, my roommate said she would stay at a friend‚Äôs place and left. I had bought some bones for the house. I was watching TV, enjoying my new life and status. Suddenly, there was a rapid knock on my door. It was the fortune teller. She instantly jumped on me. Grabbing my hair, she yelled, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to it? It‚Äôs completely attached to you now, you stole it from me! Give it back quickly!‚Äù I started hitting her back. Our door was left open, and many people from the apartment building came due to the noise. ‚ÄúThis woman is a thief! She stole something that belongs to me!‚Äù she kept shouting. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt steal anything; it came of its own free will,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll report you to the police, you‚Äôll see!‚Äù she threatened. ‚ÄúGo ahead, what will you accuse me of? Stealing her jinni? You foolish woman, no one will believe you. They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre crazy. Don‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs mine now, it can‚Äôt come back to you,‚Äù I retorted. The neighbors whispered among themselves, ‚ÄúWhat are they talking about?‚Äù I managed to throw the woman out of the house with great difficulty. My hair was disheveled, and I had a few scratches; she had dug her nails into my face.

I went to the bathroom to wash my face. At that moment, I met mine in the bathroom mirror. It had become like my pet now. I looked at it, and laughter overcame me. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm a thief,‚Äù I said to myself. I had stolen her jinni.

About an hour later, the police showed up at my door. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a complaint against you,‚Äù they said and took me away. When I got to the police station, I saw the fortune teller again. The commissioner said, ‚ÄúThis woman has filed a complaint against you; you allegedly stole something belonging to her.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you ask her what I stole?‚Äù I inquired. ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs about to tell us now,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs saying something, but we couldn‚Äôt quite understand.‚Äù The woman immediately jumped up from her seat towards me. ‚ÄúShe stole my jinni, this thief! Make her give it back immediately!‚Äù she started screaming. The police officers took the woman away from there. I told the commissioner, ‚ÄúThis woman is crazy; she‚Äôs accusing me of something like this. Do you think it‚Äôs logical to be able to do such a thing?‚Äù They took the woman away, of course; she couldn‚Äôt claim any rights. Later, I heard that the woman was given treatment in a clinic for about 3 months to restore her mental health. Foolish woman‚Ä¶

1jopbhu,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/the-power-stole-fortune-teller-horror-stor/,The Power I Stole From The Fortune Teller,"My name is Melis, I‚Äôm 22 years old. I was studying at Marmara University, Faculty of Foreign Languages. I rented a house near the G√∂ztepe campus and lived there with my roommate. Everything actually started that day.

One day, I went to a cafe in Kadƒ±k√∂y with all my friends. We ate, drank, and finally ordered coffee. We all turned our cups upside down and started waiting, trying to read each other‚Äôs fortunes just for fun. Then, a cafe employee came over to us and said, ‚ÄúIf you want, the lady over there can read your fortunes; she‚Äôs quite skilled at this and works here.‚Äù She started reading the fortunes of a few of my friends, and everyone stared at her, mouths agape. Then the woman came over to me, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs read your fortune too, if you want,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in such things.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt insist much.

In the following days, we started gathering with friends every week and going to that cafe. My friends became absolutely fascinated by the woman; they were constantly going to her. A few times while she was reading fortunes, I got slight headaches; I felt a bit unwell, honestly. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want to go, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to upset my friends either. Going with them back and forth, it felt like my interest was growing a bit too. Finally, I asked the woman, ‚ÄúCan you read my fortune too?‚Äù and from that day on, I had fallen under her influence. ‚ÄúCome on over,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbring your cup.‚Äù

Around that time, I was dating someone named Bekir; I could even say I was in love with him. The fortune teller immediately started talking about Bekir. ‚ÄúYou love him now, but over time your love will fade, and you‚Äôll set sail for entirely different shores,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt happen,‚Äù I retorted, ‚Äúwe love each other, after all. I don‚Äôt believe what you‚Äôre saying,‚Äù and I went to the restroom. What she said had upset me a bit. After taking a deep breath, I went back down and took my seat at the table again.

While the woman was reading fortunes for the others, I started texting Bekir on my phone, telling him I loved him. Then I locked my phone screen. At that moment, in the reflection on the phone, I noticed someone looking at me from behind, right at the level of my hair. I could only see their pupils; they were staring at me with pure white eyes. For a few seconds, I stared back at the phone in panic. Then I quickly turned around; there was nothing there. I took a deep breath, and everyone, seeing my panic, said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll come back next week.‚Äù

We went home with my roommate, but after that day, my head started hurting a lot, especially in the evenings. It hurt terribly. I took medicine, but it didn‚Äôt help at all. I also started to slowly drift away from my boyfriend, Bekir. When we met, we couldn‚Äôt find anything to talk about anymore; we just looked at each other. Over time, our texting decreased and eventually stopped completely. I stopped calling him too, and the inevitable end came; we broke up.

Meanwhile, my headaches continued every night. I couldn‚Äôt study, and my grades started to suffer. Midterms ended, and then, to clear my head a bit, I went down to the pier. I sat on a bench and started thinking, ‚ÄúWhy did things turn out this way?‚Äù I needed to pull myself together again, but this time, besides the headache, fatigue and loss of appetite had also begun. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house, wasn‚Äôt attending my classes, and wasn‚Äôt taking care of myself. Actually, I used to wake up every morning with great joy and excitement, but soon after, all my motivation and mood would vanish.

My roommate couldn‚Äôt stand seeing me like this anymore and said, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go out, clear your head a bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúmaybe a change will do me good, let‚Äôs go out.‚Äù After wandering around for a bit, we ended up at that same cafe in Kadƒ±k√∂y again. We ordered coffee, and they suggested, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get our fortunes read again.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. The fortune teller greeted us, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, welcome.‚Äù I had immediately caught her attention. ‚ÄúI was expecting you a long time ago, but you didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had some problems, I was dealing with them,‚Äù I said. The moment she started reading my fortune, I felt my skirt lift, and then it felt like someone was stroking my hair, but there was no one around.

‚ÄúJust as I told you,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúYour relationship with your boyfriend is over; I told you, remember? Now you will taste something different and new,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out in time, let‚Äôs wait a bit, I‚Äôll tell you, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she replied. Then she mentioned my grades and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting bad grades in your exams, this will continue. You need to pull yourself together first,‚Äù and she finished the reading.

After that day, I started noticing changes in myself. I constantly felt the urge to go to the fortune teller; she began to bind me to her. There were times I went twice, even three times a week. It was impossible not to admire that woman; she could practically read a person‚Äôs life just by looking into their eyes. The fortune teller told me I would have a new relationship and slowly start to become my old self again. And it happened just as she said; I slowly started to pull myself together. I entered a new relationship with a guy named H√ºseyin, and we got along quite well. But I started wondering, ‚ÄúHow does this fortune teller know these things?‚Äù

Later, I did detailed research on fortune tellers. Fortune tellers could generally know many things through others. Who were these others? Their jinn, of course. She definitely had a jinni; I had even sensed it. I saw it once on my phone screen, and a few times when it stroked my hair‚Ä¶ I was a little scared, but going back and forth, it started to intrigue me more. The jinn‚Ä¶ Actually, the admiration I felt wasn‚Äôt for the woman herself, but for the jinni or jinn she commanded. Could I possibly do what that woman did? Essentially, the woman had no special quality. Her aura had affected me at first, okay, but what gave her that aura were the beings she communicated with. Otherwise, the woman was just a sloppy, dowdy character.

The pair of eyes I saw on my phone screen during my visits and the sensations in my body‚Ä¶ Her jinni had contacted me; that‚Äôs what I thought could have happened. Maybe, like that woman, I could command a jinni too. Why not? My life was going badly anyway, my relationships were ending, my exams were failures, and I wasn‚Äôt making any decent money. I decided to expand my research and wondered, ‚ÄúCan I summon a jinni with a ritual?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt quite dare to do it for that purpose. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wait and see, maybe everything will change over time,‚Äù I told myself.

Meanwhile, I continued going to the fortune teller. After all, by observing her, I could learn more than I would from books or the internet. The woman told me my relationship would end. ‚ÄúYour life will be calmer from now on,‚Äù she said. She was intent on making me completely dependent on her.

During one of my visits to the fortune teller, I saw it again on my phone screen, but this time I didn‚Äôt look away in fear. I was startled at first, but I had made up my mind to communicate with them. Gathering my courage, I looked at my phone screen with a sincere smile.

When I got home that day, my roommate called me; she said she wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few days, her father was ill, and she was going to her hometown. ‚ÄúSorry to hear that,‚Äù I said. I would be alone at home for a while. H√ºseyin called me, and I didn‚Äôt feel like answering the phone. Suddenly, I started to feel distant from him too. That same night, I sent him a message: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me again. I don‚Äôt want to see you anymore.‚Äù Apparently, he was going to tell me he wanted to break up anyway; this relieved me quite a bit.

Everything was progressing rapidly for some reason. Relationships, classes‚Äîthey all seemed pointless and unnecessary to me. I wanted a different, spiritual power. For this, I constantly encouraged myself. At night, I took my dinner and sat in front of the television. While watching normally, the channel suddenly disappeared, and the screen went blank. I picked up the remote, pressed buttons, but the TV wouldn‚Äôt turn on. About five minutes later, the screen came back on. As I was changing channels, something strange, resembling a black man, appeared for a few seconds, then it switched to another channel. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I wondered. I got very close to the TV, rapidly changing channels. I didn‚Äôt see it again. But then, a shadow quickly moved from the doorway towards the kitchen. I had seen it, I was sure. I went towards the kitchen, looked around carefully, couldn‚Äôt see anything. I came back to the living room and started thinking. ‚ÄúDid I imagine it?‚Äù I asked myself. No, it wasn‚Äôt a hallucination, I was sure. It was reality itself; I could distinguish between reality and imagination. ‚ÄúCould this be a jinni?‚Äù crossed my mind. But I hadn‚Äôt performed any ritual or invitation. ‚ÄúWould they come uninvited?‚Äù I wondered. But then the events I experienced at the fortune teller‚Äôs place came to mind. It made its presence felt there. ‚ÄúCould it be the one that came?‚Äù I thought.

On one hand, I was browsing the internet; on the other, I was examining the books I bought out of curiosity. At that moment, I heard cosmetic products fall in the bathroom. I was extremely tense, but I immediately headed towards the bathroom anyway. I looked around carefully; there was nothing. ‚ÄúWill you show yourself to me again?‚Äù I started calling out. I waited there for a few minutes. Just as I was about to leave, I saw a silhouette in the mirror. I stared at the mirror. For a moment, I felt scared, but I immediately tried to communicate with it. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked. It didn‚Äôt answer and suddenly disappeared. I examined the bathroom for about 5-10 minutes, called out to it again, but got no response. ‚ÄúShow yourself to me again,‚Äù I called out. Nothing happened.

From my internet research, I learned that they love smoke and incense. I also read that they adore bones and bone marrow as food. I immediately went out, bought some incense sticks and candles. I went to the butcher and got some bones. I didn‚Äôt know how to invite it. However, it felt like I didn‚Äôt need an invitation; it would come. My smile towards it at the cafe had caught its attention, and that‚Äôs why it was trying to get close to me. It wouldn‚Äôt harm me. I kept psyching myself up with these thoughts.

I lit the candles and incense in the bathroom. I placed the bones in a corner. I started waiting. I was both scared and curious, and also hopeful, thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe I can possess a very different power in this life.‚Äù I waited and waited; it didn‚Äôt come. Later, I shouted loudly inside the bathroom, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to invite you, but I prepared all this for you!‚Äù Then I heard a hissing sound from inside the bathroom. I looked around; it wasn‚Äôt visible. Then I knocked on the mirror three times with my hand: ‚Äútap tap tap.‚Äù A few seconds later, a sound came from the bathroom, just like my knocking: ‚Äútap tap tap.‚Äù I swallowed hard in fear. Then I changed the rhythm and knocked ‚Äútap tap tap tap.‚Äù It responded in the same way. This repeated a few more times. It imitated whatever I did. Then, I laughed and said, ‚ÄúSo you liked this.‚Äù A giggling sound came from it. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ this is a nice game, but I thought you might be hungry, so I got you bones, look, they‚Äôre over there,‚Äù I said. A few seconds later, crunching sounds came from the bones, like a wild animal eating its meal. After about half a minute, the sounds stopped.

Seeing that it didn‚Äôt harm me at all and even moved in harmony with me, I grew bolder. ‚ÄúAre you going to show yourself to me?‚Äù I asked. In the dimly lit bathroom illuminated by candles, it showed itself to me for a few seconds. This time its eyes weren‚Äôt visible; it looked like it was draped in a black sheet from head to toe. I couldn‚Äôt see its face or eyes, but I was extremely scared; I couldn‚Äôt stop my knees from trembling or my teeth from chattering. I quickly went back to the living room.

None of what I saw was a hallucination; it was completely real. I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if I was scared or excited, but I think I might have acted too soon to see it; I had gotten involved in things my psyche couldn‚Äôt handle immediately. The good part was that it didn‚Äôt seem to have any intention of harming me. Reassured by this thought, I lay down on my bed, stared at the ceiling, and drifted off. My hands and feet slowly started to go numb. My eyes closed involuntarily, and I couldn‚Äôt control them anymore. My eyes closed.

I found myself wandering in an empty garden. It was pitch black all around. Then it came again. Its face was covered with a veil; it looked like it was wearing a black cloak from head to toe. ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù I asked. It nodded and tried to speak to me using a strange language. I didn‚Äôt understand anything. Later, it said, ‚ÄúI am the fortune teller‚Äôs jinni, I fell in love with you.‚Äù A smile instantly formed on my face. ‚ÄúIf it falls in love with me, then this jinni will be mine,‚Äù I thought. When the morning call to prayer sounded, my eyes opened, and I woke up. So, it was all real. What I saw on the TV and in the bathroom wasn‚Äôt a dream; it was real.

The next night, after dinner, I lay down on my bed again. After a while, my hands and feet started to go numb. I was looking up at the ceiling again, and my eyes closed. This time, I found myself at the foot of a mountain. There were wild goats around me, and it came too. I asked its name; it told me its name. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be afraid of me anymore,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid anyway,‚Äù I replied. I started to feel drawn to it for some reason. I had only been able to see its face once. I would see it many more times later, but for now, it had only allowed this much.

As soon as I woke up, I immediately started digging through books and the internet. I began researching ‚ÄúHow to read fortunes?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to command jinn?‚Äù. My roommate had also returned, but I didn‚Äôt let her notice anything. I usually spent most of my time in my room, trying to communicate with that entity. I started burning incense in my room. It felt like my life‚Äôs sole duty, purpose was it. I slowly grew distant from everyone, hardly seeing anyone anymore. I spent my days with it, getting used to it more and more.

Later, like that woman, I slowly started mingling with people and reading fortunes, especially for my university friends. But it wouldn‚Äôt be limited to just that; word spread, and my reputation grew. I started earning good money too. So much so that, through acquaintances and relatives, I began choosing my clients. I didn‚Äôt take money, only gifts from people. Of course, I didn‚Äôt accept gifts below a certain value and wouldn‚Äôt read fortunes for those people. My room started overflowing with phones, tablets, and expensive jewelry.

One night, my roommate said she would stay at a friend‚Äôs place and left. I had bought some bones for the house. I was watching TV, enjoying my new life and status. Suddenly, there was a rapid knock on my door. It was the fortune teller. She instantly jumped on me. Grabbing my hair, she yelled, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to it? It‚Äôs completely attached to you now, you stole it from me! Give it back quickly!‚Äù I started hitting her back. Our door was left open, and many people from the apartment building came due to the noise. ‚ÄúThis woman is a thief! She stole something that belongs to me!‚Äù she kept shouting. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt steal anything; it came of its own free will,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll report you to the police, you‚Äôll see!‚Äù she threatened. ‚ÄúGo ahead, what will you accuse me of? Stealing her jinni? You foolish woman, no one will believe you. They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre crazy. Don‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs mine now, it can‚Äôt come back to you,‚Äù I retorted. The neighbors whispered among themselves, ‚ÄúWhat are they talking about?‚Äù I managed to throw the woman out of the house with great difficulty. My hair was disheveled, and I had a few scratches; she had dug her nails into my face.

I went to the bathroom to wash my face. At that moment, I met mine in the bathroom mirror. It had become like my pet now. I looked at it, and laughter overcame me. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm a thief,‚Äù I said to myself. I had stolen her jinni.

About an hour later, the police showed up at my door. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a complaint against you,‚Äù they said and took me away. When I got to the police station, I saw the fortune teller again. The commissioner said, ‚ÄúThis woman has filed a complaint against you; you allegedly stole something belonging to her.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you ask her what I stole?‚Äù I inquired. ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs about to tell us now,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs saying something, but we couldn‚Äôt quite understand.‚Äù The woman immediately jumped up from her seat towards me. ‚ÄúShe stole my jinni, this thief! Make her give it back immediately!‚Äù she started screaming. The police officers took the woman away from there. I told the commissioner, ‚ÄúThis woman is crazy; she‚Äôs accusing me of something like this. Do you think it‚Äôs logical to be able to do such a thing?‚Äù They took the woman away, of course; she couldn‚Äôt claim any rights. Later, I heard that the woman was given treatment in a clinic for about 3 months to restore her mental health. Foolish woman‚Ä¶

Anyway, I put my university studies on hold, left Istanbul for my hometown, and made a name for myself there by reading fortunes too. I earned good money here as well. I travel to Istanbul or some other big cities upon special invitations from wealthy people to read fortunes. Of course, I continue to live with it. For now, materially and spiritually, everything is fine. How long it will go on like this, believe me, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶

1jop781,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jop781/being_friends_with_someone_with_an_ed_is_not_for/,Being friends with someone with an ED is not for the weak,"I (19F) have been friends with Bree (20F) since the beginning of high school, essentially becoming besties. She was fun to be around, we‚Äôd explore the city together or just chill and have like 4-5 hour conversations, but more than that, she was just genuinely a nice, sweet person.

Unfortunately, she developed an ED recently and although I‚Äôve made my best effort to be there for her, it‚Äôs been so tough on me and I don‚Äôt have anyone else to lean on. For context, I‚Äôve also struggled with disordered eating since 13 but no one could tell bc I didn‚Äôt end up underweight, but I did engage in restrictive and binging cycles. 

Going out and watching her refuse to eat anything with carbs, gluten, sugar, dairy, etc. has taken a toll on me even though it shouldn‚Äôt. At first it wasn‚Äôt too bad, id encourage her to eat what she was comfortable eating and not comment on her choices. But after a few months, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like the biggest person in the room if I was out at a restaurant eating a sandwich and fries and she just had black coffee. And she‚Äôd be mean about it too, like complain about the prices of the places I invited her to and how there was nothing for her (even though she never had a problem with these places beforehand). 

Then, that fun personality she had completely evaporated. She didn‚Äôt want to do coffee hopping bc of the calories. She didn‚Äôt want to go out to restaurants or brunch or even like a taco stand together. The activities we could do together became so limited bc if food was involved, she‚Äôd say no. 

She also stopped engaging in conversation like we used to. Usually, we‚Äôd give each other the space to talk and take turns. But now every time she texts me, ‚Äúhow are u doing?‚Äù, she will completely ignore my answer and just talk about her problems all the time. And in person too. And like I get it, vent sessions are important. But it went from 50/50 to 95/5.

One of the hardest parts is that she‚Äôd criticize herself for having snacks or for eating certain things or not exercising for a day, and it just became impossible not to internalize it. Of course I‚Äôd try and explain that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with eating or stopping her fitness routine, and tell her she‚Äôs beautiful. But it has become exhausting for every conversation to always lead back to fitness and calories and nutrients and diets and all that :( 

In trying to help her, i instead relapsed back into my ED and my self hatred has never been stronger. I even booked an impulse lip filler session and am already making plans for a boob job and chin lipo as soon as summer break starts. And the worst part is that I still have to be her emotional support friend bc well, we‚Äôre besties, but that same energy will probably never get returned to me.

Card #1: David Musk ‚Äì The Lost Redeemer

Card #2 (Entitled): Jennifer Kropf ‚Äì Welcome to Fae Cafe

Card #1 (HM): Kristen Britain ‚Äì Green Rider

Card #2 (Entitled)(HM): Kim Newman ‚Äì Anno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju

Entitled Title Obviousness: Wait a second, Anno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju wasn‚Äôt published in the 1990s! Okay, you got me. However, the first book in the Anno Dracula series, Anno Dracula, WAS published in the 90s. I could use just that one for this square, but the title Anno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju is just too perfect to pass up. I decided to apply the ‚Äúanthology‚Äù rule about combining multiple entries of the same type to count as at least novella length here, and so I read the *entire* series, and I am counting the whole thing as one square. I may be breaking the letter of the law, but I believe it still fits the spirit! As a bonus, the first book in the series was published in 1992 and the sixth in 2019, so it also counts for hard mode. 1999/10

1jop279,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jop279,April Preparations,"Going through and prepping my pages for April 2025. 

I started testing out a monthly habit tracker in the second week of March, and I'm looking forward to trying it out for another, whole, month. I renamed a few, got rid of a few, and left room for any new ones coming up. 

""Bullet Journal"" was one of the only tasks that I completed all the way through, which was good. There were months where I let it lapse and I lost a week or two before getting back into it.

I do brush teeth at night as a habit, but I was forgetting to brush in the morning because I try to have water and coffee and breakfast first, and then the kids get up and it gets away from me. 

I use checkmarks for best case result, an X for acceptable result, and blank for did not achieve. (I also use emotes like an unhappy face or a skull for big mistakes.) An example would be a checkmark for making and eating a meal at home, an X for eating at a restaurant, and a blank for skipping the meal. I don't do anything strenuous, so in the cooler weather, I don't need to gave a shower *everyday* so I permit usage of the same system.

(I told my youngest child that I couldn't play with him one day, and I want to avoid that, so that earned my second bad emote. The skull was an intention for work that I never started and abandoned after a string of very bad days and resolved to tackle again in May.)

The little lines next to 5-6, 12-13, 19-20 and 26-27 are all weekends, which may impact expectations for some of these habits. 

My best habit day was the 21st of March, a hard but fruitful day that helped me decide to push that failed habit. My water habit and bullet journaling habits were the only ones I got 23/23 on, but I reckon I can do better this month.

I started a new monthly, which has been successful this year, and a this is my second time trying a weekly as well. I found that my daily entries bujo style were helpful to remember what I did in a day, but were less helpful in helping me plan for the future. How we record time tends to impact how we think and inhabit time, so I'm giving it a try. 

I can't really share my proper bujo entries as they have work-related items in there. But, I use modified bullets: circles for events, boxes for tasks, bullets for important notes, dashes for subordinate notes to any of the above, and stars for when I remember to do my Three Key Tasks (3KT) for the next day. 

If an event or task is canceled, I line it out. If it's postponed, I use a 'Greater Than' angle bracket as an arrow. If it's achieved, I use a check mark. If I decided to not do a thing after posting it up, I use an X and have a dash note to explain why underneath. 

I could use more aesthetic practice, but right now my bujo and planning is for productivity, record-keeping and clarity.

We often talk about exploring different countries together. Last night, we were discussing Europe, and he said that if we were in France and I wanted to visit Paris, I could go alone because he‚Äôs been there before and thinks ‚Äúit smells like dog shit.‚Äù He said he wouldn‚Äôt want to spend time or money going there again.

I laughed and asked, ‚ÄúWhat if I really wanted to go there with you?‚Äù He gave me the same response and kind of brushed me off. So I told him that makes me feels like he only wants to do things he enjoys when we‚Äôre together. He explained that he‚Äôd be willing to go to a restaurant he doesn‚Äôt like if I wanted to‚Äîbut he wouldn‚Äôt spend money on traveling somewhere he dislikes because it‚Äôs expensive.

At that point, I was already feeling a bit sad and said I just wanted to have the experience together. I told him, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll go alone then.‚Äù He said he was sorry I felt that way and that I was overreacting.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve always dreamed of going to Paris‚ÄîI actually don‚Äôt mind skipping it. For me, the journey and the people I share it with matter more than the destination. But what really bothered me was how he responded. His reaction made me feel like I‚Äôm being ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù over something small.

So I texted him (he was already asleep‚Äîwe‚Äôre in different time zones) to say that I‚Äôm not upset about Paris, but about how he dismissed my feelings. I won‚Äôt get a reply until tomorrow, but I‚Äôd like to know what others think. Am I overreacting?

P.S. We both have full-time jobs, and I always pay my share (food, trips, taxi, etc.), though I let him pay if he insists, since he earns more than I do. I usually make up for it with smaller things like coffee or gifts, and sometimes we take turns paying for taxis. We have a pretty balanced approach to finances.",2,1743488785.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

Thank you!

Miscellaneous
- Is there anything in particular that‚Äôs your favorite that you recommend I try or visit?
- What hidden gems do you know about?
- I have a dog, what fun doggy activities/parks/places do you recommend? In case it matters, he‚Äôs a 5 year old mixed breed that‚Äôs 75lbs. 
- I‚Äôm pretty afraid of severe weather lol so what meteorologists/news/storm trackers do you tune into? 

Community 
- Where could I go (either physically or online like a Facebook group) to build/find community?
- Where or what is the best place to find event info or what‚Äôs going on around town?
- I‚Äôd love to join a book club when I move! Are you apart of one or are there any local bookstores you could direct me towards?

Restaurants/Dining/Drinks
- I‚Äôm vegetarian, what restaurants should I try out that specifically offer a nice variety of vegetarian options?
- I love coffee and tea, any cute cafes you recommend?
- I‚Äôm always down for brunch, where should I check out?
- I try not to drink alcohol that much these days, is there anywhere that either has a variety of mocktails or markets themselves as serving mocktails?
- Most of my family and friends drink alcohol and would probably like to go somewhere to grab a drink when they visit, what places would you recommend that aren‚Äôt bars? Probably would learn towards something with a chill vibe/environment
- My nieces and nephews will hopefully be visiting me soon! Is there anywhere you‚Äôd recommend they‚Äôd have a fun time? Their ages range from 1-7.  

Activities/Amusement
- I love escape rooms, any cool places around town or places that offer an interactive spooky/mystery experience?
- In your opinion what‚Äôs the best local library?
- What museums or tours should I check out?

Lastly, is there anything your recommend I avoid? Whether it be because you feel it‚Äôs overrated, lame, unsafe, etc. I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions on the not so great/negatives too!

1jooy2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jooy2b/aa_two_shadows_at_sundown/,[AA] Two Shadows at Sundown,"It was a quarter past three when the shadow interrupted the Sun‚Äôs rest, basking lazily over the saloon. The man, whose spurs could be heard two streets away, said nothing‚Äîhe simply stood there. His long black hair was almost completely hidden beneath a brown hat that crowned his head like a king‚Äôs crown.

Silence suffocated the town, swallowing the breaths of the gathered townspeople who came to witness the event. Today was the big day‚Äînot a celebration, not a fair, but a funeral. Whose? They would soon find out.

Not ten minutes had passed when a second shadow stopped in front of the saloon‚Äîa lanky red-haired boy, cleaning his revolver as he walked toward the circle of people that had formed. The man in the hat said nothing. His eyes, as dark as his boots, reflected only his opponent. No emotion behind them, just a goal. A mission. If someone was going to fall today, it wouldn‚Äôt be him.

The redhead holstered his gun and looked down, his gaze as intense as his fiery hair. He smiled‚Äîhe said nothing either. He preferred to let the whispers of the people speak for him. *His* people. After years of protecting them from men like the stranger, today, they stood behind him.

The Sun, now restless from the brewing storm outside the saloon, began to shine on the redhead‚Äôs badge‚Äîas if sending a message to the stranger. But the stranger remained unmoved. There wasn‚Äôt a trace of doubt in him. He felt the grip of his revolver in his hand, calculated the redhead‚Äôs height, saw it as an advantage he‚Äôd have to counter in milliseconds, aiming for a fatal point.

The Sun slowly shifted behind the stranger as the town priest arrived at the scene. With a rosary in hand, he began to pray for both men, who were moments away from leaving their humanity behind in the few seconds the duel would last.

While the priest sang his blessings, a beautiful woman‚Äîher soft skin the color of the coffee her husband, the redhead, drank every morning‚Äîran toward the noise. Between sobs and screams, she begged her husband not to do it, to think of what he‚Äôd be leaving behind. It took three men to hold her back.

The redhead gave her a single look‚Äîthe same look he gave her the day they met, the day they married, the day their daughter first cried. He loved her, and he believed everything would be fine. She collapsed to her knees, crying, praying for God to protect the redhead.

On the other side, a tall blond man in a black suit whispered something into the stranger‚Äôs ear. His brother‚Äînot by blood, but by bond‚Äîwould risk his life for him. All he could say was how sorry he was that things had come to this. The stranger only nodded, still confident.

Thirty minutes had passed since the stranger‚Äôs spurs broke the silence of what had been a peaceful morning in town. Both men‚Äîlike statues‚Äîstood unmovable, preparing for the final dance.

**One second**‚Äîboth men locked eyes. Neither wanted to meet Death; walking with her would be the other‚Äôs task.  
**Two seconds**‚Äîthe church bells added their toll to the spectacle the entire town now watched.  
**Three seconds**‚Äîthe silence, held tight for half an hour, began to break. People whispered, placing bets on who would remain standing.  
**Four seconds**‚Äîthe stranger breathed in, and the redhead looked to the sky.  
**Five seconds**‚Äîthey were ready. Their eyes saw nothing but each other. Not the saloon, not the people, not the redhead‚Äôs wife or the stranger‚Äôs brother. In that moment, only they existed‚Äî  
And the bartender yelling: **‚ÄúDraw!‚Äù**

Both men, transformed into the biblical beasts the priest preached about on Sundays, into the demons that lived inside every man, aimed straight at the other‚Äôs heart. They would be the dagger that ended the life of their enemy. Like Cain and Abel‚Äîbrother against brother, man against man.

The stranger pulled his trigger just as the redhead‚Äôs bullet was already leaving the barrel. Height isn‚Äôt enough of an advantage if the other is faster. But just before the bullet hit the stranger‚Äôs white shirt, he had enough time for his own shot to fire.

Only two shots were heard.  
The crowd‚Äôs murmuring turned to silence as both men fell.

The pool of blood from their bodies stained the clothes of the woman and the brother‚Äîone weeping for her loss, the other blaming himself.

There was no victor today.

during manual labor, sampling soil using a manual hand auger, I hurt my back 3 weeks ago. The tool requires a full body force and twisting motion, to twist the tool into the earth like a corkscrew---


first symptoms: lower back pain, hard to bend, hard to stand up straight, have to use arms to pull myself up. radiating pain to abdomen and thighs.

second symptoms came later, post injury 1 week later, I took a walk up the hill and when I got about 0.2 mile up my arms were numb and tingling.

third symptoms: 
burning radiating pain from neck towards arms. evaluated at ER and diagnosed as cervical radiculopathy.

other co-occurring symptoms: 
muscle spasms, tingling in arms (more like tiny muscle spasms) pain is burning/dull and changes based on activity levels, becomes worse with sitting and typing at my chair or walking up hill. (pain level: 2 resting/ 6-7 after moderate activity)

-increased ringing/tinnitus in left ear

-resting heart rate increased drastically. from about 70bpm to 80-90bpm; 120 during a quick shower(?) seems high?

-blood pressure elevated (usually normal) 144/90 
-ceased my morning coffee/caffeine and there has been improvement

When I am sitting at my desk I find it hard to sit and focus on the screen, the screen appears as if it is shaking, (abnormal for me)


any ideas what could be causing these symptoms? is it related to a pinched nerve or something else going on here?

I had a patient who I had seen several times during my training. They were slowly dying of cancer. They asked me at one point how I was doing while they were clearly in significant pain. I will never forget that person.

We made a good save on someone having a heart attack even though it was quite subtle on the EKG. I had to argue with the cardiologist to accept the patient. Family probably overheard me. After the patient had recovered they brought in coffee drinks and snacks for the night shift. Almost cried, I was so shocked and happy to see the patient up and walking and it was such a kind gesture.

I had someone else yelling at myself and the staff for things that were very much outside of our control. I was actually worried I might be struck at during the confrontation. I got why they were upset. I would be too. Unfortunately it was really busy in the ER that night and sometimes that means care for non-dying patients gets delayed. My next two patients who heard me being yelled at in the lobby were so kind, asked how I was doing. It's not something I expect. People don't generally go to the ED feeling good.
