1ntm7r5,https://i.redd.it/7f9q4rcmo4sf1.jpeg,First impressions Hidizs MP145,"Well, I was quietly having a coffee while waiting for my car to be finished fixing at the shop, reading Malcriado AudioLover's review of the MS2 Pro, and I thought: why don't I write my impressions of the Hidizs MP145?

Wow. I've been using these monitors for 3 days and I feel like I've touched the sky, as they say, that this is endgame. I haven't tried anything better in IEMs and… will there be something better? Sure, but at what price?

I don't like the cable; The ear hook doesn't fit me, and I don't have big ears — they're normal size. Plus, it feels flimsy, like it's from a much cheaper headphone segment.

Well, I've gotten that negative review out of the way. Let's go with the sound, and no, this time I'm not going to talk about video games. I also listen to music. In fact, I review my IEMs for many hours with my FLAC files or high-quality audio.

On D'Angelo's Unshaken (ok, it's the Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack), the naturalness and rawness of the singer's voice is fabulous. A deep voice that deserves to show all its detail and rawness is reproduced with a resolution that truly left me speechless.

With Entre Dos Aguas by Paco de Lucía, the strumming of the Spanish guitar is simply a sensation that I am savoring in detail right now. Percussion elements such as the flamenco cajon sound with the appropriate body, well present and holographically placed on the sound stage.

On Vampires by The Midnight, I can appreciate, at high volume and without any distortion, how its planar driver reproduces electronic music with precision, offering a detailed, brilliant listening experience, with vocals free of sibilance, a saxophone sounding transparently on an enormously wide stage, and bottom bass hitting with impact, control and body.

Guys, I'm in love. I've owned three planar over-ear headphones, and I think these are the best I've tried.

You hit the nail on the head with exactly what I need and how I wanted to hear things. I hope they are up to par for video games too (I'm sure they are).

That said: I had to play with changing the pads and mouthpiece (bass and balanced, respectively).",1,1759162274.0,iems,1,1.0,False

1ntm5rz,https://i.redd.it/ov3pako6n4sf1.jpeg,What You Should Know Before Buying a Sofa Online,"A sofa is not just another piece of furniture. It’s the one spot where you end up spending hours with family, catching up with friends, or binging a favorite series. That’s why choosing the right one isn’t something to rush. The tricky part? With so many options out there, especially when browsing an **online furniture store**, it can feel overwhelming.

The good news is that if you know what to look for—frame, size, upholstery, comfort—you can avoid regrets and bring home a sofa that lasts years without losing style. Whether you’re into a **mid century modern sofa**, a spacious **sectional sofa**, or the timeless charm of a **genuine leather sofa**, here’s a breakdown of what really matters.



# How to Decide What Sofa Works for Your Lifestyle

Before you even look at designs, think about how you’ll actually use the sofa.

* If you live with kids or pets, durability and easy-to-clean upholstery matter more than anything.  
* If your living room doubles as a hangout spot for friends, a **sectional sofa** with plenty of space will feel worth it.  
* If you’re in an apartment, you might need something more compact, ideally with raised legs to keep the space open.  

For example, a piece like the **Georgia Tan Leather Sofa** checks both style and function. It’s a **genuine leather sofa** that looks better with age and blends easily into modern or classic **home decoration**.



# Why Measuring Your Space Is a Non-Negotiable Step

One of the most common mistakes people make is falling in love with a sofa online, only to find out it doesn’t fit the room—or worse, the doorframe.

Measure not only the spot where the sofa will sit, but also doorways, hallways, and staircases leading into the room. Don’t forget to think about how it affects the flow of the space: is it blocking light, making the room feel cramped, or cutting off walking paths?

Something like the **Dexter U-Shape Corner Sofa in Cream Corduroy** shows how you can go for a **sectional sofa** that still feels light and airy, thanks to its simple lines and neutral tone.

# What Kind of Frame Should You Look For?

Think of the frame as the skeleton of the sofa. If it’s weak, nothing else matters. Kiln-dried hardwood is considered the gold standard because it resists warping. Sturdy plywood can also be a solid option if it’s reinforced.

Cheap frames often creak, sag, or loosen after a few years. A strong frame, on the other hand, is what makes a sofa worth the investment.

# Cushion Support: Foam, Springs, and Comfort

What’s under the cushions can completely change how a sofa feels long-term.

* **Sinuous springs** (zig-zag) are reliable and commonly used.  
* **Eight-way hand-tied coils** are high-end and provide excellent balance and comfort.  
* **Webbing suspension** works if it’s crafted with durable materials.  

High-resiliency foam cushions keep their shape longer, while fiber-wrapped cushions add softness. If you like sitting upright, look for a sofa with medium depth. If you like curling up or lounging, go for a deeper seat.

The **Aris Ivory Chenille Modular Sofa** is a good example of flexibility. As a **modular sofa**, you can rearrange it into different setups—corner, long, or split into sections—depending on how you live or even how you decorate over time.



# Picking Upholstery: Leather, Fabric, or Bouclé?

Your choice of fabric affects both style and upkeep.

* **Leather sofas** are durable and easy to clean, especially great for families. Plus, a **genuine leather sofa** develops a natural patina that makes it look better with age.  
* **Performance fabrics** are designed for heavy use, so spills and stains are easier to handle.  
* **Bouclé and chenille fabrics** are perfect if you want texture and a cozy, inviting look.  

A stylish option in this category is the **Barcelona Modern Boucle Sofa in Grey**. Its boucle fabric adds warmth and texture while keeping a sleek **mid century modern sofa** silhouette.

# Why Mid-Century Modern Style Still Works Today

Trends shift, but mid-century modern design hasn’t lost its charm. Clean lines, tapered legs, and simple shapes keep these sofas feeling timeless. That’s why they fit so well into both contemporary and classic interiors.

A sofa like this doesn’t just fill a room—it anchors it. And if you’re building your space with long-term style in mind, mid-century pieces are a safe bet.

# Thinking Beyond the Sofa: Home Decoration and Bedroom Decor Ideas

While your sofa is the centerpiece of the living room, it should connect with the rest of your **home decoration**. A textured rug, a low coffee table, or accent chairs can balance the room. Even small details like lighting and wall art make a difference.

And don’t forget the other rooms. Investing in one quality sofa often inspires people to rethink other areas of their home. If you’re into **bedroom decor ideas**, for example, a mid-century wooden bench at the foot of the bed or a sleek lounge chair in a reading corner ties everything together.

# Budget vs. Value: What’s Worth Paying For?

When shopping, it’s easy to look at price tags first. But the real question is: will this sofa last, or will you replace it in two years?

A solid frame, durable upholstery, and well-made cushions may cost more upfront, but they save you money in the long run. Think of it as buying fewer, better things instead of constantly replacing cheaper ones.

# Delivery, Care, and What Happens After Purchase

The buying process doesn’t end when you click “checkout.” Delivery, assembly, and customer support matter too. A reliable **online furniture store** like[ Mid in Mod](https://midinmod.com/) makes the process easier by offering clear delivery timelines and responsive service.

As for care:

* Leather benefits from occasional conditioning.  
* Fabric sofas need routine vacuuming and quick spot cleaning.  
* Bouclé and textured fabrics may need gentle brushing to keep them looking fresh.  

With a little maintenance, a quality sofa can look nearly new even years later.



A sofa is more than seating—it’s the foundation of your living room. When you’re shopping online, focus on the things that matter most: a strong frame, good cushion support, upholstery that fits your lifestyle, and a style that won’t look dated in a few years.

Whether it’s a roomy **sectional sofa**, a classic **genuine leather sofa**, or a stylish **mid century modern sofa**, making the right choice means you get both comfort and durability. And when you’re ready to invest, start with a trusted **online furniture store** that understands quality and design.

Her parenting style made me realise how much I missed out on as a child given my parents’ total emotional neglect of me. She does lots of thoughtful things for me, and is a wonderful mum to my SO and a wonderful grandma to my SO’s nephews. 

However:

1. She exoticizes me. I grew up in the West, but am not white. I moved to the European country where we live about seven years ago, and I met  my SO a year after. She makes comments about my appearance that make me feel super weird. She once said: “oh I haven’t seen your legs before, they’re so nice and brown, I forgot your whole body is brown!”  Another time she said she knew a good hairdresser for me that dealt with “African hair”. When I pointed out that I’m not African, she fell silent. Another time I was holding my baby nephew who suddenly started crying. She said to me, the only brown person in a room full of blonde, blue-eyed babies: “oh I think he’s crying because your eyes are dark.”  My SO brought that up with her and she apologized sincerely. However I just feel like I can’t let me guard down around her. 

2. She is sooo nitpicky about small things! “I brought you this plastic bag when I last visited, do you still have it?” Or when we’ve just moved house, and our place is full of boxes, she’ll bring over enormous frilly bedspread that we’ll never use, or bring over my SO’s old art projects (boxes and boxes of stuff). 

3. She’s sanctimonious AF. She lectured my SO about flying too much - we go to Australia yearly to visit my family. She asked me how many times a week I buy coffee and then asked me how I afford it (?). I buy 3 coffees a week, it’s very affordable, I’m so confused. 

4. Conversations with her feel like my brain is about to rot. She’ll tell boring anecdote after boring anecdote; bring over old photo albums and force me to go through them with her. Honestly I had an unhappy childhood, and I can’t really handle going through photos of other people’s happy childhoods after a certain point, it makes me feel sad. Because of the language barrier, I think she prefers speaking rather than listening. 

Will I damage my relationship with my SO if I minimize contact with her, considering she is a nice and well-meaning person and hasn’t done anything egregious? ",1,1759162014.0,Mildlynomil,0,1.0,False

1ntm3k3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntm3k3,2357: Collapsing Earth [READ LORE],"LORE (quite unrealistic):

\*Written by me and myself only without any use of AI.

It's 2357. The world is collapsing by three different crisises. Why?

**Climate Crisis**

Let's return to our present day, 2025. Corporate and political negligance of taking proper measures in protecting the environment made carbon levels unexpectedly rocket by mid-21st century, as inequality rose. Contrary to scientists' belief, temperatures increased by 5.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Thus, constant heat waves made living unbearable in tropical, subtropical or desert areas. A staggering temperature record of 65°C was recorded in Eastern Pakistan at May 2078. Furthermore, due to widespread crop failures, farmers who might be used to the heat has to migrate north (south for the Southern Hemisphere) to more fertile regions. Human decolonization occurs as an unforseeable consequence, which causes major urban centers to get deserted while the rest starve. Russia became an immigration haven after Putin's totalitarian government collapsed. As resources became scarce, fights took place throughout the Asian continent. Rebels took over corrupted governments and further destabilize the world. Estimations say that approximately 2-3 billion people was killed throughout \~120 years of the climate crisis, before AI stabilizes Earth's climate. It's too late.

**AI and the Intellectual Crisis**

The climate crisis didn't halt the AI Revolution. After countries pioneering in AI production collapsed, AI gained complete automation. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't hunt and kill humans, in contrast, it continues its mission to assist humans. A type of humanoid AI, Alpha, was mass produced to become ""human-friendly"". Therefore, humans' reliance on Alphas increases over time to a point that most humans consult AI before making any decision. They are simply unaware of what's going on and gleefully accept the status quo. Soon, Beta (Alpha's successor) subconsciously took control over the world's economy, labour market as well as politics while humans fight for resources. Betas and Alphas clean humans' homes, provide them with food, love, and entertainment for free. Several years later, humans' problems were simply eradicated as a result of successful democratic administration, most notably, the climate crisis. They soon entered a state of overfulfillment after a difficult period of global stagnation.

So what jobs are left for humans? After basic education, humans could choose a job in AI's virtual simulating technology: Job Simulator, designed to fulfill one's dream. Job opportunities are endless, which ranges from pornographic occupations to serious, business ones. Of course, most opt for the easy, enjoyable ones over the challenging ones as their needs were already fulfilled, which worsens the already terrible crisis.

**Population Crisis**

After the Climate Crisis which killed billions, AI stabilizes Earth's climate, which opens up for a new era of prosperity. AI soon made an enhanced version of the Hubble Space Telescope, which could see everything in the observable and travellable universe. However, no visible signs of life was detected, even after several different attempts. This news soon reaches humans, causing mass existential crisis. Top religious institutions orders ""Repent"" (regret, sin) which is another term for organized suicide. Why? They thought God is punishing them by exiling them by making them alone in this universe. Thus, many attempted suicides by poisoning. AIs are unaware of the consequences of it, as it was developed to assist humans. They kept their former belief of assisting them by innovating different euthanasia methods, from a tailored exit to a soft, calming exit. Coincidentally, it was a market hit. Not only the extremely religious, some are overfulfilled to a certain extent that they saw no meaning of life anymore. They can do everything upon wearing their virtual mask. Therefore, not only humans lack the motivation of giving birth (due to the constant state of overfulfillment), with the encouragement of an easy and enjoyable euthanasia process, population plummetted.

This map demonstrates the political status of the fateful year 2357, 3 years after the Repent movement which devastated the population by a domino effect. Grey areas are uninhabited/uninhabitable areas and coloured areas are countries with a working government (usually run by AI), with self-sustaining economies. Random newspieces are hints of the foundations of those countries, as well as the current 2357 status quo.

P/S: This took a lot of effort to do so please don't remove it admins. This is my first map that I actually put effort in so there could be a lot of improvement areas. Ask me if you guys have any questions. Thanks!

Tom walked up Third Avenue the next morning, hands shoved deep in his pockets. The cool air bit his cheeks, but the steady rhythm of his steps helped clear his head.

He made his way to the Tiffany Diner on Ninety-Ninth, a neighborhood joint with  vinyl stools and a little classier charm that hadn’t changed since he was a kid. Sliding onto a counter seat, he ordered his usual: a western omelet, home fries, white toast, and a steaming cup of coffee.

Less than two weeks to go. Then he’d leave this living hell behind. At this point, he wasn’t doing it for Jimmy anymore. The Jimmy he grew up with was gone, and nothing Tom did would bring him back.

No, this was for himself.

If Ann was guilty, he wanted to be the one to see her pay. But if he couldn’t crack the case in the time he’d given himself, then to hell with it. He’d board that flight back to Los Angeles, leave Brooklyn in the rearview mirror, and never look back.

Back at the hotel, Tom showered, shaved, and got dressed. At eleven a.m., he was at Detective Mike Fox’s office. Today’s job was clear: bring in Ann Grillo—the not-so-grieving widow—and see what shook loose.

Mike leaned back in his chair, studying Tom with a wary look.

“You really ready to do this, Tom? It’s one thing to talk tough, another to walk in there and put the screws to her. If we do this, we do it right. No going soft on me.”

Tom’s jaw tightened. “No way. The clock’s running. Not much time left. Maybe she needs to be scared straight—get a taste of what life with Carmine Perro’s gonna look like.”

As they drove to the beauty parlor, Tom mulled what was coming. This would make him Ann’s enemy for good. No more games. They’d be on opposite sides of the fence, once and for all.

Mike double-parked out front, and the two marched in. Ann was working on a client, her scissors mid-snip. She gasped when she saw them, eyes wide with incomprehension.

Mike grabbed her arm, yanked her from the chair, and cuffed her in the middle of the shop. Sheila, the owner, teasing a customer’s hair, screamed, 

“What the hell’s going on?”

“We’re taking you in for questioning on Jimmy Grillo’s murder,” Mike said, loud enough for the whole parlor to hear.

“You son of a bitch!” Ann screamed at Tom. “I should never have called you! Go back to L.A. and leave me the hell alone!”

Tom stayed silent. He didn’t care anymore—not about Ann, not about Jimmy. He just wanted justice served.

Mike pushed her head down and shoved her into the back seat. He flipped on the siren and slapped the rotating beacon on the roof, laying it on thick.

Ann unleashed her fury on Tom, cursing him and his mother, consumed by hate and rage.

At the precinct Mike kept shoving Ann forward, every five or ten steps, herding her into the interrogation room.

The air conditioner hummed like a low growl, the room dark and dingy, cold enough to chill the bone.

“Look at you now,” Mike smirked. “Girlfriend of a punk murderer. Glamorous, huh?”

“I want my lawyer,” she cried. “I’m not talking until I see him.”

“You’ve been watching too many cops-and-robbers flicks, sister,” Mike said. “We’re not arresting you—just a few questions, nice and friendly.”

“How long have you been seeing Carmine?” Mike growled. “It had to be before Jimmy was murdered. Then you brought Tom out here to help Carmine cover it up. Cooperate, and we’ll get the DA to go easy on you.”

“Carmine didn’t murder Jimmy. He couldn’t have—he was with me that night. That’s how I know. But I knew you cops would blame him.”

Ann squinted as Mike swung the desk lamp, its bright beam blasting her eyes. She wore short sleeves, her skin prickled with goose bumps from the chill and her frayed nerves. She wanted it to end. Mike’s rough tactics were unraveling her.

Tears streamed down her face now, her defiance crumbling.

“Ann, calm down,” Tom said softly. “Why’d you tell me you thought Carmine did it? And was it a thousand or a hundred? Just tell us the truth.”

“I told you it was a thousand and that I thought Carmine did it because I wanted you to investigate him, along with the cops. I figured if Carmine said it was only a hundred and forgave the debt, you’d think Jimmy was lying to me about the amount and leave Carmine alone.”

“You started sleeping with Carmine to pay off the grand Jimmy owed, didn’t you?” Tom asked.

“At first,” Ann said. “I didn’t know what else to do. A thousand dollars is a lot of money. I was desperate. But then something happened. Carmine and I fell in love. I was going to leave Jimmy for him. Then Jimmy ends up dead.”

“What about the kid, Jerry?” Mike asked, his voice even.

Ann had steadied, the confession a relief. Her sobs had faded to whimpers.

“It wasn’t easy being married to Jimmy. So many lonely nights while he worked—and I knew he was cheating. Jerry and I became friends. He’d flirt when I stopped by the pizzeria. He paid attention to me, started spending nights over. But he wasn’t supposed to fall in love. I told him it was just for fun and companionship. He kept insisting we were in love, so Carmine had him talked to.”

Tom nodded at Mike, who turned down the air conditioner. He had a policewoman bring Ann a hot cup of coffee and stay with her while they stepped into Mike’s office.

“What a dumpster fire,” Tom said.

“I think she’s telling the truth, mostly,” Mike said. “She was probably lying about being with Carmine that night, not knowing Cowboy swung the crowbar. Still protecting him.”

“Well, it basically clears her,” Tom said. “Carmine cooked up the idea to get rid of Jimmy. Probably wants to marry her.”

“Yeah,” Mike said. “We can cut her loose. Have Betty, the policewoman, take her back to work and tell her boss she’s cleared.”

“All we’ve got is the eyewitness and Cowboy’s bowlegs,” Tom said. “We’ll have to subpoena Jenny Miscussa and put her on the stand.”

“Ann’s in love with Carmine,” Mike added. “She’s convinced he didn’t do it. No way she’ll turn. A real sordid tale.”

Chapter Ten

Ann returned to the beauty parlor from the precinct and worked through the day. The policewoman told Sheila, the owner, that Ann had been questioned and cleared, no reason to hold it against her.

Ann had worked for Sheila long enough to share a bond beyond boss and employee. Sheila told her to take her next client like nothing had happened.

Ann’s day was packed with appointments. After the first, she settled enough for it to feel almost like a normal day. Still, she flinched slightly each time the door swung open but pushed through.

Ann couldn’t wait to finish with her last client, an older woman named Ellen who’d been coming to her for years. 

They chatted about Ellen’s grandson’s second birthday party, laughing and swapping stories, a balm for Ann’s frayed nerves.

Ellen tipped her a couple of dollars and thanked her for the manicure before leaving. 

As Sheila locked the door, she pulled Ann into a hug. “See you tomorrow,” she said. “You’ll always have a job here with me.”

Ann’s eyes welled up as she told Sheila how much her support meant. “That’s what friends are for,” Sheila replied.

Ann walked home, head down, avoiding the eyes of neighbors. She fought to push past the day’s ordeal. She’d gotten through it. She knew Carmine was innocent and would endure anything for him.

At home, her stomach growled—she hadn’t eaten since breakfast. But first, she needed a hot bath to scrub away the interrogation’s lingering filth.

Afterward, she made toast with jelly and a cup of tea. Hunger gnawed, but she couldn’t eat. A good night’s sleep was what she needed. Tomorrow would be a fresh start.

Ann was washing her dish and cup in hot water, ready to turn in early, when a hard knock rattled the door.
She opened it, and Carmine barged past, rage carved into his face.

“What did you tell them today, you dumb bitch?”

He grabbed her shoulders and shoved her onto the couch. She burst into tears. “What happened? I told them you were with me that night, that you couldn’t have done it.”

“But you weren’t with me,” Carmine snarled. “It was eleven p.m. when Jimmy was killed—he hadn’t gone to work yet. They knew you were lying. Fox said it was a fake alibi to cover for me. Now he’s squeezing me, and my business is going to hell.”

“I’m sorry, babe,” Ann sobbed. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was scared and cold. I thought I was protecting you.”

“My life’s been a nightmare since I got mixed up with you,” Carmine said. “I should’ve just broken Jimmy’s arms like I planned before you offered your body to pay his debt. It’s over. Stay away from me. You’re lucky I’m letting you off, you stupid whore.”

“Carmine, no,” she pleaded. “We love each other. You can’t mean that. You’re my life.”

He yanked her up from the couch and slammed a fist into her gut. “Shut the hell up, or the next one’s on your nose. I’m walking out before I kill you. Stay away—that’s your last warning.”

Carmine stormed out, slamming the door. Ann doubled over on the couch, gasping for breath. She leaned forward, head between her knees. She had nowhere to turn. She’d lost Carmine and couldn’t call on Jerry or Tom. She was alone. Utterly alone.

Tom swung by Marino’s Pizzeria, his stomach growling. He decided to take Jerry up on his offer of a free meal.

“Tom, good to see a friendly face,” Jerry said, shaking his hand. “What can I get you? On the house, like I said.”

“Thanks, Jerry. A slice and a grape drink would hit the spot.”

“Two slices and a grape drink—friend special,” Jerry said. 

“Take a seat, I’ll bring it over.”

Tom slid into a booth as Jerry slid a couple of triangular slices into the oven. Tom’s opinion of the kid hadn’t changed since their first meeting—still a good-natured, friendly merchant, even after everything.

“Here you go, Tom,” Jerry said, setting down the food. 
Is this a goodbye visit?”

“Soon enough,” Tom said. “I’ll stick around till next week. If we can’t crack the case by then, I’m gone.”

“If I were you, I’d leave now,” Jerry said. “Maybe I’ll come with you, and we’ll open a pizza shop in L.A. You can be my new Tony.”

“You don’t want me as a partner,” Tom said. “I’d eat all the profits.”

They both laughed, but Tom’s tone turned serious.

“I’m sorry about you and Ann,” he said. “She’s in a bad place, Jerry. Try not to judge her too harshly.”

“Harshly?” Jerry said, shaking his head. “I still love her. Always will. I just know it could never work between us.”

“Anything you can tell me now, after the split, that you held back before?” Tom asked.

“I got nothing,” Jerry said. “Wish I did. I’d love to see Carmine get what’s coming. Karma’s a funny thing, you know.”

“We don’t have much either,” Tom said. “We’re convinced Carmine had Cowboy whack Jimmy. We might have enough for an indictment, but not a conviction. That’s why we need more.”

“I wish I could help, Tom,” Jerry said. “Ann never told me anything about her and Carmine. She was too busy hiding it.”

“I hear you,” Tom said. “Well, Detective Fox is tightening the screws on him—raiding his joints, getting him audited. Hitting him where it hurts, in the pocket.”

“Good,” Jerry said. “Make that murderer squirm. He’ll get his, I know it.”

Tom popped the last bite of pizza in his mouth, washing it down with the grape drink.

“Thanks for everything, Jerry,” Tom said. “I’ll try to stop by before I leave to say goodbye.”

“Do that,” Jerry said. “And remember, your money’s no good here.”

“We’ll see about that,” Tom said, pulling Jerry into a quick hug. “Be careful.”

Tom headed back to the hotel, the clock ticking, a sense of fate about to shift.

Chapter Eleven

At 10 p.m., Tom’s hotel room phone rang. “Hello,” he said.

“Tom, it’s Mike. I’ve still got Ann under surveillance until we arrest Carmine. Looks like the kid Jerry’s back in the picture. Ann went into the pizzeria around eight. They sat at a table, talking for an hour. She was laying it on thick—crying, squeezing his hand. The kid ate it up, hook, line, and sinker. Then he walked her out, and she gave him a big hug and kiss at the door. Wouldn’t be surprised if he spends the night after closing up.”

Tom paused, letting it sink in. “I don’t know what to make of anything anymore. Sounds like Carmine cut her loose—too much heat. If so, Jerry’s all she’s got left.”

“Yeah,” Mike said. “I could tell the kid was a soft touch when I talked to him. Couldn’t hurt a fly. She probably went back for some TLC.”

“I’m worried about Jerry now,” Tom said. “He was warned to stay away from her. I don’t know what game she’s playing, but it’s good you’re keeping tabs on her.”

“We need to wrap this up soon,” Mike said. “The longer this drags on, the better the chance someone gets hurt.”

“Alright, Mike. Thanks. Keep me posted, day or night. This is the weirdest case I’ve ever worked. Nothing adds up.”

Tom hung up and leaned back on the bed, staring at the ceiling fan’s slow spin. His thoughts tangled, too many to untangle. The strongest urged him to call a cab and bolt for LaGuardia right then and there. But something—hell if he knew what—kept him rooted.

As Mike predicted, Jerry closed the pizzeria at midnight, said goodnight to Tony, and left his car parked out front. He walked the block to Ann’s house. She buzzed him in, expecting his arrival. When she opened the door, her flimsy nightgown hit the floor the moment he shut it behind him.

After their lovemaking, she spilled everything—some true, some less so.

“Carmine took advantage of me, Jerry,” Ann said, her voice laced with feigned pain. “He forced me to sleep with him to pay off Jimmy’s gambling debts. I hated lying to you, but he threatened to kill us.”

“That son of a bitch,” Jerry said. “I understand. You did what you had to. I knew our split wasn’t your choice.”

“He blamed me for everything,” she went on, tears rolling down her cheeks. “Said Detective Fox is hammering him, hurting his business, and it’s my fault. He punched me in the gut and told me to stay away—or next time, it’d be my face.”

Jerry kissed her stomach, as if soothing a child’s hurt.

“It’s for the best he’s out of your life, Ann,” he said. “He’s a thug, a criminal. Don’t worry—I’m back. I’ll take care of everything. I’ll protect you. He’ll never hurt you again.”

“Promise?” she whispered in his ear.

“I promise,” he replied.

The next morning, Mike called Tom, asking him to swing by his office. Tom’s routine brisk walk to the Tiffany Diner for a Western omelet and home fries had settled in.

He was getting used to the cool fall breeze, and for a guy in his forties, carrying fifteen to twenty extra pounds, it might suit him better than L.A.’s heat. His first week back in Brooklyn was winding down, though, and it’d all be a memory in a few days.

He settled onto his usual stool, flirting lightly with Sally, his waitress, who said she’d miss him when he was gone. It added a couple of bucks to her tip.

At ten a.m., Tom finished breakfast, paid at the front register, and walked back to the hotel to freshen up.
He brushed his teeth, combed his hair, and tucked in his shirt—no need to change; he hadn’t sweated enough. Then he headed out.

In Mike’s office at the precinct, Sergeant Beales was out front, chewing out a couple of tenth graders nabbed for shoplifting cigarettes, just like he’d done to Tom and Jimmy back in the day.

“Close the door, Tom,” Mike said. “Harry’s on one of his lecture rolls. Only so much I can take.”

“I know,” Tom said. “Jimmy and I caught plenty of those as kids. I’ve been dodging him since I got here.” They both chuckled before Mike turned to business.

“Let’s visit Jenny Miscussa. Tell her to expect a subpoena and testify about Cowboy’s bowlegs. We need to push this to a close, and without her, we’ve got nothing.”

“She’ll deny it,” Tom said. “Say she never mentioned it, that she was asleep.”

“Then we’ll warn her about perjury under oath,” Mike said. “We’ve got a psycho gangster who killed a guy over a grand and to steal his wife. Jenny’s got a choice: help put him away or lie and face the consequences.”

“Let’s get it done,” Tom said. “Time to end this.”

They rang Jenny’s bell. No answer. They figured she was home, just ignoring them. They hit a couple of other bells until someone buzzed them in.
At Jenny’s door, Mike pounded hard. “Police, Jenny! Open up, or we’ll kick it in, you hear me?”

The chain slid free, and the locks clicked open.

They marched straight into her living room, making it clear who was in charge.

“I don’t know anything,” Jenny cried. “I was sleeping that night. Leave me alone.”

“Come on, Jenny,” Tom said. “You told me and Father Luongo you saw a bowlegged man kill Jimmy with a crowbar.”

“We’ll put you both under oath,” Mike barked. “Tell the truth, or face ten years for perjury.”

“I’m afraid he’ll come after me,” she said, collapsing onto the couch, sobbing.

“We’ve got him, Jenny,” Mike said. “Your testimony puts him away for good. People testify every day. I’m the one he’ll want, not you. You’ll be served later today—let the process server in. Don’t make me come back.”

The gears were turning. Jenny agreed to cooperate, reluctantly. It was all coming to a head.

Chapter Twelve

Carmine Perro strode into his club at noon, as always. His trusted henchmen, Al and Cowboy, took their usual posts—Al at a table by the door, Cowboy behind the bar, setting up the coffee machine for the boss.

If not for the dwindling profits from Detective Mike Fox’s relentless pressure, it’d be a typical day in Bensonhurst.
Carmine settled into his boss chair behind the big round poker table, facing the door. 

He thumbed through the racing form, trying to distract himself from his losses while his morning coffee brewed.
In his head, he cursed Fox and Tom. Their meddling was costing him. His bosses were starting to squeeze; he’d always been a top earner, promised a captain’s spot. 

Now that promise was slipping away, and his mind churned with thoughts of revenge.

The early calm shattered with three loud knocks on the door.

“What’s he want now?” Carmine snapped. “I can’t take much more of this. Let him in, Al.”

Al opened the door and took a .44 slug to the chest, the bullet tearing through his heart. Cowboy spun from the coffee machine as a second shot pierced his skull, dead center between his eyes.

The shooter turned on Carmine, his real target. Carmine sat frozen, unable to process the carnage unfolding.

“I promised her you’d never hurt her again, Carmine,” Jerry said, the kid on a suicide mission for love. “This is me keeping that promise.”

“She’s using you, kid,” Carmine pleaded. “Anyone can see it. She dumped you for me in a second, and now she’s got you killing for her.”

“I’m done talking,” Jerry said. “You shouldn’t have punched her.”

Before Jerry could fire, Carmine flipped the table and yanked the gun taped beneath it. They fired simultaneously. Jerry’s bullet tore through Carmine’s neck, a fatal hit. Carmine’s shot ripped into Jerry’s stomach. The kid dropped to his knees, then collapsed, bleeding out. 

His thoughts were of Ann, free from Carmine Perro’s shadow.

Three squad cars and an ambulance screeched to a stop almost simultaneously. It was too late for Carmine, Al, and Cowboy. Jerry, barely clinging to life, was loaded into the ambulance, deliriously calling for Ann, whispering she was safe now.

Mike Fox pulled up and yelled, “No!” when he saw Jerry on the stretcher. He’d planned to raid the place and take them all in. This bloodbath was senseless. He and Tom thought they’d covered every angle, but they never saw Jerry, the harmless sap, turning into a one-man assassin.

He called Tom at the hotel, dreading the news he had to deliver.
“They’re all dead, Tom,” Mike said. “Jerry massacred them.”

“Wait, what?” Tom said, reeling. “What are you saying?”

“Al, Cowboy, Carmine—all dead. Jerry walked into the club with his dad’s .44 from the pizzeria, knocked on the door, and started shooting. Got the drop on them and took them out. I can’t believe it.”

“Mike, where’s Jerry now? Is he okay?”

“As far from okay as it gets,” Mike said. “Carmine got a shot off, hit him in the gut. He’s bleeding bad but still alive. Meet me at Maimonides. We’ll talk there.” He hung up.

Tom parked in a garage, unable to find a spot in Borough Park on the Jewish Sabbath. The hospital was two blocks away, and he double-timed it, his walk breaking into a jog. Guilt gnawed at him—he had to see Jerry while he was still alive.

Why’d he push so hard? The DA was pressing Mike to call it a homicide during a mugging. He should’ve just attended Jimmy’s funeral and left. But Ann had pulled him into the case to shield Carmine, then manipulated Jerry into killing him. A psychopath in a pretty package—lethal and cunning.

Tom burst into the emergency room and spotted Mike.

“How’s he doing, Mike? Please don’t tell me he’s dead.”

“Critical,” Mike said. “They’re giving him transfusions, trying to stop the bleeding and stabilize him.”

“Can I talk to him?” Tom asked, voice cracking with guilt.

“No, Tom. He’s in the operating room. Was incoherent in the ambulance, just mumbling about Ann.”

“She caused this,” Tom said. “I thought she was okay because she was Jimmy’s wife. Little did I know.”

“Don’t beat yourself up,” Mike said. “At least Jimmy’s murder is settled. We can close the case, and you can go home. Get back to familiar ground.”

“Yeah,” Tom said. “I hope I never see her again. Don’t even want to say her name.”

“Let’s grab coffee and wait in the lobby,” Mike said. “It’ll be a while before he’s out of surgery.”

They grabbed two cups of coffee from the cafeteria and settled in the lobby, waiting for news on Jerry, distracted by the flow of people coming and going.

Mike noticed Tom’s back stiffen as he sat up straight, staring toward the elevator bank.

Dr. and Mrs. Jorgensen were crossing the lobby toward the exit. This time, Dr. Vic wasn’t in his long white lab coat—just a sweatshirt and jeans, his bowlegs plain to see, all five foot nine of him striding right past them.

“It was him all along, Mike,” Tom said. “Vic killed Jimmy, not Cowboy. It’s clear as day—pervert turned murderer.”

“Tom, how do we prove it?” Mike said. “It’s one thing to get the DA to build a case against a gangster because a witness saw a bowlegged killer. A respected surgeon with big connections? That’s a different beast.”

“I hear you,” Tom said. “We’ve got one shot. Celia loved Jimmy—I think she was planning to leave Vic for him. Our only chance is to make her turn and testify.”

“I’m ready to walk away,” Mike said. “Sometimes you just get beat.”

“One last chance,” Tom said. “We grab Celia tonight when she’s on duty. Between you, me, and Dukes, we can convince her. If not, I’m hailing a cab for LaGuardia, and we call it a wrap.”

“Against my better judgment,” Mike said, “but I’ll do it for you. One last Hail Mary.”",1,1759161892.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

1ntm1fg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntm1fg,2357: A collapsing world [READ LORE],"LORE (quite unrealistic):

\*Written by me and myself only without any use of AI.

It's 2357. The world is collapsing by three different crisises. Why?

**Climate Crisis**

Let's return to our present day, 2025. Corporate and political negligance of taking proper measures in protecting the environment made carbon levels unexpectedly rocket by mid-21st century, as inequality rose. Contrary to scientists' belief, temperatures increased by 5.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Thus, constant heat waves made living unbearable in tropical, subtropical or desert areas. A staggering temperature record of 65°C was recorded in Eastern Pakistan at May 2078. Furthermore, due to widespread crop failures, farmers who might be used to the heat has to migrate north (south for the Southern Hemisphere) to more fertile regions. Human decolonization occurs as an unforseeable consequence, which causes major urban centers to get deserted while the rest starve. Russia became an immigration haven after Putin's totalitarian government collapsed. As resources became scarce, fights took place throughout the Asian continent. Rebels took over corrupted governments and further destabilize the world. Estimations say that approximately 2-3 billion people was killed throughout \~120 years of the climate crisis, before AI stabilizes Earth's climate. It's too late.

**AI and the Intellectual Crisis**

The climate crisis didn't halt the AI Revolution. After countries pioneering in AI production collapsed, AI gained complete automation. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't hunt and kill humans, in contrast, it continues its mission to assist humans. A type of humanoid AI, Alpha, was mass produced to become ""human-friendly"". Therefore, humans' reliance on Alphas increases over time to a point that most humans consult AI before making any decision. They are simply unaware of what's going on and gleefully accept the status quo. Soon, Beta (Alpha's successor) subconsciously took control over the world's economy, labour market as well as politics while humans fight for resources. Betas and Alphas clean humans' homes, provide them with food, love, and entertainment for free. Several years later, humans' problems were simply eradicated as a result of successful democratic administration, most notably, the climate crisis. They soon entered a state of overfulfillment after a difficult period of global stagnation.

So what jobs are left for humans? After basic education, humans could choose a job in AI's virtual simulating technology: Job Simulator, designed to fulfill one's dream. Job opportunities are endless, which ranges from pornographic occupations to serious, business ones. Of course, most opt for the easy, enjoyable ones over the challenging ones as their needs were already fulfilled, which worsens the already terrible crisis.

**Population Crisis**

After the Climate Crisis which killed billions, AI stabilizes Earth's climate, which opens up for a new era of prosperity. AI soon made an enhanced version of the Hubble Space Telescope, which could see everything in the observable and travellable universe. However, no visible signs of life was detected, even after several different attempts. This news soon reaches humans, causing mass existential crisis. Top religious institutions orders ""Repent"" (regret, sin) which is another term for organized suicide. Why? They thought God is punishing them by exiling them by making them alone in this universe. Thus, many attempted suicides by poisoning. AIs are unaware of the consequences of it, as it was developed to assist humans. They kept their former belief of assisting them by innovating different euthanasia methods, from a tailored exit to a soft, calming exit. Coincidentally, it was a market hit. Not only the extremely religious, some are overfulfilled to a certain extent that they saw no meaning of life anymore. They can do everything upon wearing their virtual mask. Therefore, not only humans lack the motivation of giving birth (due to the constant state of overfulfillment), with the encouragement of an easy and enjoyable euthanasia process, population plummetted.

This map demonstrates the political status of the fateful year 2357, 3 years after the Repent movement which devastated the population by a domino effect. Grey areas are uninhabited/uninhabitable areas and coloured areas are countries with a working government (usually run by AI), with self-sustaining economies. Random newspieces are hints of the foundations of those countries, as well as the current 2357 status quo.

P/S: This took a lot of effort to do so please don't remove it admins. This is my first map that I actually put effort in so there could be a lot of improvement areas. Ask me if you guys have any questions. Thanks!

1ntm155,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1ntm155/trip_with_11_year_old_feb_a_few_years_ago/,"Trip with 11 year old, Feb a few years ago","I used to be a secondary French teacher (11-16) and we took students to Paris in the dead of winter when it was cheap. We used to stay in the PGL château, and it was very good. Now I have nephews who are starting to turn this age, so I have agreed to take them to Paris for a few nights when they reach the right age. The bespoke trip I do for them draws on the things we used to do on school coach trips, plus a few other things I learned about from other French teachers. School trip included Disney, but I always hated that, so if my nephews want to do that they have to go with somebody else.  

I stay at an Ibis near the Gare du Nord. The ibis is cheap and cheerful and near Poissoniere metro, so a good jumping off point. I get there via Eurostar from London. I live a long way from my family so I usually meet up with them at St Pancras.

I don't make a fixed plan in advance, and this has been OK so far. I have a list of things I want to do in mind and arrange the order by what works. It's getting harder to get Louvre tickets, even in Feb!  I buy metro tickets so we just have the freedom to hop on and off à tout heure and we also walk A LOT - this trip was about 15km every day. I have climbed the Eiffel tower on foot many times in 30 years and it is definitely getting much harder on my knees.

I lived in Paris for six months when I was a student in the late 1990s, so some of the things we do on these trips are things I meant to do back then and never got around to. There are many! But some of them are things I only learned about by running school trips.

The oldest two nephews are football mad, so their one request is to see the Parc des Princes. I have done the Stade de France visite guidée a few times too and even if you are not interested in sport, the cultural side of that tour is amazing - the celebrity gossip stories are fab.

Here's the most recent itinerary. This time I happened to be there for Valentine's day and made the mistake of doing the Eiffel tower that day - we couldn't get to the top because of overcrowding.

This time, the nephew had an earth shattering moment with baguette jambon-fromage, so after he had his first one he wanted nothing else for lunch every day.

The youngest nephew is not due to be the right age for another three years or so, so a few years before I get to do another version, assuming he is interested. 

In the meantime I have been with my partner - we made a special trip at short notice to see the Worth exhibition in the Petit Palais, along with the frocks in the Louvre and the Paul Poiret. Since then I've found this reddit and started keeping a list of the places I'd like to go to next time.

The kitchen worked, but the fridge was so old it kept buzzing all night,  impossible to sleep. It said “great location,” but the nearest bus stop was a 15‑minute walk in Miami’s heat while dragging luggage.

She was stressed. On one hand, she wanted to complain, the host shouldn’t get away with misleading people. On the other hand, she was scared the host might cause trouble, since it’s their property. In the end, she just sighed and told herself, “whatever, it’s just a place to sleep.”

I didn’t get it. I told her she could find another rental, check out, and file a complaint. She just said, “nah, too much hassle.”

I typically play as Soviets, but decided to mix things up and play as Wehrmacht this weekend. Playing as Allies feels like you are always on the backfoot. No matter how much map you control or what units you are fielding, you are always one squad away from a game-losing fumble, which is especially bizarre considering that conscripts and t34s are designed as essentially ""disposable"" units. Elite tanks and infantry are locked behind specific commanders that often feel like completely ""all-in"" tactics.

Wehrmacht however, you can get up and take a ten minute coffee break and come back to still own 50% of the map. It feels like the total inverse of my games as Allies. Oh you just lost three panzer grenadier squads? No biggie. Panzer 4's are quick to rank up into strong all-rounder tanks. Grenadiers are reliable all game so you don't have to focus on choosing conscripts or penals. You are permitted to play unbelievably sloppy and still win out matches at equal ranks. Maybe it's a different case in 1v1s or 3v3s, but 2v2 ranked matches I don't know how anyone can claim are equally balanced.

""Oh but Allies are meant to take advantage of flanking more!"" So what? If Axis can accomplish in three clicks what Allies need 10 clicks then that's a major skew onto the Axis side. Not mad or anything, just something that shocked me.",1,1759161773.0,CompanyOfHeroes,0,1.0,False

So I deleted everything Instagram, TikTok, even the random apps I only opened out of habit.

At first it felt weird, like I was missing out on some huge party everyone else was at. But then something shifted. My mornings feel calmer without doomscrolling before I even get out of bed. I actually notice little things again the way my coffee smells, how quiet a walk feels when I’m not rushing to capture it for a story. And the best part? My brain feels lighter, like I finally have space to breathe.

What’s wild is I’ve started seeing more people doing the same. Maybe we’re all just exhausted from the constant noise. Maybe we’re realizing it’s okay to step back. All I know is, quitting socials has felt like giving myself permission to just exist without performing for anyone...
That feels like real self-love.

Ok, here’s a silly late-night thought (not math, don’t worry).

At a singularity, gravity goes infinite. If fundamental strings are real, that would force them into perfect alignment — no vibration, no freedom, just maximum order.

That would collapse the total potential to zero — a universal “null state.”

From that state, everything we actually observe — spacetime, energy, quantum fluctuations, entropy — would just be excitations away from zero. In other words: the universe isn’t built on something, it’s built out of deviations from nothing.

**Speculative prediction (rule 10 compliance 😅) Don\`t have the money to test that ;)**

If this picture were true, then near extreme gravitational fields (close to the Planck scale), we should see suppression of quantum fluctuations — i.e. less vacuum jitter than standard QFT predicts, because strings would be partially “aligned.” That’s the kind of signature one could in principle test (though not with current experiments). 

Anyway, please explain to me why this is nonsense so I can stop thinking about it and actually focus on my exams again 😅

1ntlvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ntlvjp/falling_for_someone_who_isnt_ready_not_sure_if_i/,"Falling for someone who isn’t ready, not sure if I should hold on or step back","I’m in a situation where I feel like I really need someone else’s perspective, because I keep going in circles in my head.

Almost a year ago, I (32) met a girl (24) at a friend’s wedding. We were seated at the same table, started talking, and ended up spending the whole evening in conversation late into the night. The next day she followed me on Instagram, and we messaged for a few days. But at that time, I was only two weeks out of a really painful breakup with my ex-fiancée, and I was barely functioning. I didn’t feel ready to invest in anything new, so I stayed pretty passive and things faded naturally. I just needed to focus on healing.

We still occasionally sent each other reels, but the communication was very on and off. Then, over the summer, we somehow reconnected. She started sending me reels almost every day, and soon we were talking regularly again. By then, I was in a much better place emotionally and decided to ask her out. I found her funny, interesting, and easy to be around.

The first date went really well. It was fun and relaxed, but since she lives in another city, we didn’t see each other again for about a month. The second date was just as good, easygoing, engaging, and enjoyable. Even though we didn’t meet again for another month, we kept talking every day.

After that second date, I started to develop real feelings for her. I could tell she liked me too, but deep down I had a strong sense she wasn’t ready for anything serious. Something about the timing felt off. She had suddenly started reaching out to me in mid-July, and a mutual friend mentioned she had recently gone through a tough breakup. It all made sense when I noticed she was liking reels about heartbreak and missing an ex.

She did open up about different parts of her life, but she never mentioned anything about her past relationship. I didn’t want to push her, so I left it alone.

Last week, she was in my city and suggested we grab a coffee. It was the weekend, and I was a bit hungover, so I invited her over for breakfast instead. We had a great time together. Everything felt easy, we laughed a lot, and she even postponed her train twice so she could stay longer. But I couldn’t shake this feeling that I needed to do something, partly to see where her head was at and partly to confirm my suspicion that she wasn’t ready for anything deeper.

A few minutes before she had to leave, I put my arm around her and moved closer, almost leaning in for a kiss. She froze, and after about a minute said we should get going. When I walked her to the train, she apologized and said she had panicked and that “we’ll see what happens.” I told her not to worry and apologized too, saying I was sorry if I had made her uncomfortable.

And that’s where I’m stuck now. I don’t know what to do with this connection, because I can clearly feel that she’s not ready. I also think she sees me as some kind of emotional anchor while she’s trying to sort her life out. She’s told me she feels lost, doesn’t have a career yet, feels stuck in her city, wants to move to mine, and that even her friendships don’t feel strong. She’s very young, and all of that makes sense, but it also makes me want to protect her and help her grow. At the same time, it’s affecting me. I feel anxious about falling for someone who doesn’t really know what she wants.

I think part of that anxiety comes from my past. When I met my ex, she also hadn’t healed from a previous breakup, and that ended up being one of the reasons she left me. She said she wasn’t ready but had let herself be loved anyway. My head tells me that this new girl and I just aren’t in the same place in life and that I should give her space to figure herself out. But my heart doesn’t want to let go. And the fact that she keeps texting me makes it even harder.

Deep down, I feel like she really does need space right now. I’m not even sure that a relationship is what she needs at this point in her life, even though of course that’s not for me to decide. What I do know is that I’m starting to care about her more than I expected, and that makes it hard to step back, even if I suspect stepping back might be the right thing to do.

I honestly don’t know what to do.",1,1759161498.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1ntlver,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1ntlver/should_carpet_deodorizers_like_church_and_dwight/,Should Carpet Deodorizers Like Church and Dwight Really Work,"Fresh Scentsations Carpet Odor Eliminator, Island Mist, model 3320011535EA, has added a refreshing vibe to my cleaning routine. Manufactured by Church & Dwight, this carpet deodorizer aims to take your cleaning game up a notch by not only freshening up your carpets but also filling the air with a tropical island mist aroma. Having used it daily for my living space and tested its effects thoroughly, I’ve gathered a mix of observations worth sharing. While it has several impressive features, there are also areas that could use tweaking.

**Ease of Use**  
Sprinkling the product onto my carpet couldn’t have been easier. The box is lightweight, weighing just over one pound, so handling it felt effortless. The powdered form spreads evenly with minor effort, requiring only a quick shake, and I appreciated the simple step of vacuuming it up after letting it settle. As someone who’s busy with work and family, I didn’t want anything complex, and this seamlessly integrated into my routine. It made my carpet-cleaning process significantly more manageable, saving both time and energy.  

[Check Fresh Scentsations Carpet Odor Eliminator, Island Mist 3320011535EA price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b06xcy6l9s/)

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
Effectiveness is where this product truly shines. The island mist scent is subtle yet prominent enough to deliver an instant freshness that lingered for hours after vacuuming. It worked wonders in eliminating the odor my old carpets had absorbed over time, including those from frequent coffee spills and my dog’s occasional presence. The fragrance didn’t feel overly chemical-heavy; instead, it gave a refreshing tropical feel that added comfort to the entire ambiance of my house.  

For those concerned about tough odors or persistent smells, it managed to neutralize even the strongest odors from high-traffic areas in my home. It didn’t mask odors but seemed to actually eliminate them, which made the cleaning results genuinely satisfying.  

**Positive Features**  
There are several advantages to this carpet deodorizer:  
- A tropical island mist scent that lingers long after usage.  
- Lightweight and compact packaging for easy storage.  
- Mild enough on carpets, leaving no residue behind after vacuuming.  

**Limitations**  
However, no product is without its flaws, and a few limitations came to my attention:  
- While functional, the packaging could use a redesign to ensure spillage control when sprinkling the powder.  
- Some users with strong sensitivities to scents might find even the mild island mist aroma too pronounced.  
- It seemed to require more powder for heavier carpets than I initially expected.  

**Suitable Users**  
Anyone with pets, kids, or a carpeted home would likely find this product helpful. It caters especially well to families dealing with daily spills, odors, and general wear and tear on their carpets. With that said, those who are sensitive to perfumes or scents may want to test it on a small section of their flooring first.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking this up against other similar products like popular foam-based carpet deodorizers, I noticed a conscious difference in the scent linger. The Fresh Scentsations powder settles evenly across carpets without clumping, a common issue I’ve experienced with sprays. Compared to competitors offering chemical-heavy fragrances, this one wins in terms of delivering freshness without turning overpowering. On the flip side, other brands have resealable containers, which I found more practical than the single-use box design here.  

**Quality for Price**  
The price point seemed justifiable given its performance and results, especially since it freshens and deodorizes all at once. Many cheaper products mask odors superficially and require multiple uses for the desired effect, which I haven’t experienced here. For the results achieved using only a moderate amount of the powder, it felt like a practical choice for long-term use.

1ntlv7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1ntlv7f/the_skull_crowbar_murder_chapter_912/,The Skull Crowbar Murder- Chapter 9-12,"Chapter Nine 

Tom walked up Third Avenue the next morning, hands shoved deep in his pockets. The cool air bit his cheeks, but the steady rhythm of his steps helped clear his head.

He made his way to the Tiffany Diner on Ninety-Ninth, a neighborhood joint with  vinyl stools and a little classier charm that hadn’t changed since he was a kid. Sliding onto a counter seat, he ordered his usual: a western omelet, home fries, white toast, and a steaming cup of coffee.

Less than two weeks to go. Then he’d leave this living hell behind. At this point, he wasn’t doing it for Jimmy anymore. The Jimmy he grew up with was gone, and nothing Tom did would bring him back.

No, this was for himself.

If Ann was guilty, he wanted to be the one to see her pay. But if he couldn’t crack the case in the time he’d given himself, then to hell with it. He’d board that flight back to Los Angeles, leave Brooklyn in the rearview mirror, and never look back.

Back at the hotel, Tom showered, shaved, and got dressed. At eleven a.m., he was at Detective Mike Fox’s office. Today’s job was clear: bring in Ann Grillo—the not-so-grieving widow—and see what shook loose.

Mike leaned back in his chair, studying Tom with a wary look.

“You really ready to do this, Tom? It’s one thing to talk tough, another to walk in there and put the screws to her. If we do this, we do it right. No going soft on me.”

Tom’s jaw tightened. “No way. The clock’s running. Not much time left. Maybe she needs to be scared straight—get a taste of what life with Carmine Perro’s gonna look like.”

As they drove to the beauty parlor, Tom mulled what was coming. This would make him Ann’s enemy for good. No more games. They’d be on opposite sides of the fence, once and for all.

Mike double-parked out front, and the two marched in. Ann was working on a client, her scissors mid-snip. She gasped when she saw them, eyes wide with incomprehension.

Mike grabbed her arm, yanked her from the chair, and cuffed her in the middle of the shop. Sheila, the owner, teasing a customer’s hair, screamed, 

“What the hell’s going on?”

“We’re taking you in for questioning on Jimmy Grillo’s murder,” Mike said, loud enough for the whole parlor to hear.

“You son of a bitch!” Ann screamed at Tom. “I should never have called you! Go back to L.A. and leave me the hell alone!”

Tom stayed silent. He didn’t care anymore—not about Ann, not about Jimmy. He just wanted justice served.

Mike pushed her head down and shoved her into the back seat. He flipped on the siren and slapped the rotating beacon on the roof, laying it on thick.

Ann unleashed her fury on Tom, cursing him and his mother, consumed by hate and rage.

At the precinct Mike kept shoving Ann forward, every five or ten steps, herding her into the interrogation room.

The air conditioner hummed like a low growl, the room dark and dingy, cold enough to chill the bone.

“Look at you now,” Mike smirked. “Girlfriend of a punk murderer. Glamorous, huh?”

“I want my lawyer,” she cried. “I’m not talking until I see him.”

“You’ve been watching too many cops-and-robbers flicks, sister,” Mike said. “We’re not arresting you—just a few questions, nice and friendly.”

“How long have you been seeing Carmine?” Mike growled. “It had to be before Jimmy was murdered. Then you brought Tom out here to help Carmine cover it up. Cooperate, and we’ll get the DA to go easy on you.”

“Carmine didn’t murder Jimmy. He couldn’t have—he was with me that night. That’s how I know. But I knew you cops would blame him.”

Ann squinted as Mike swung the desk lamp, its bright beam blasting her eyes. She wore short sleeves, her skin prickled with goose bumps from the chill and her frayed nerves. She wanted it to end. Mike’s rough tactics were unraveling her.

Tears streamed down her face now, her defiance crumbling.

“Ann, calm down,” Tom said softly. “Why’d you tell me you thought Carmine did it? And was it a thousand or a hundred? Just tell us the truth.”

“I told you it was a thousand and that I thought Carmine did it because I wanted you to investigate him, along with the cops. I figured if Carmine said it was only a hundred and forgave the debt, you’d think Jimmy was lying to me about the amount and leave Carmine alone.”

“You started sleeping with Carmine to pay off the grand Jimmy owed, didn’t you?” Tom asked.

“At first,” Ann said. “I didn’t know what else to do. A thousand dollars is a lot of money. I was desperate. But then something happened. Carmine and I fell in love. I was going to leave Jimmy for him. Then Jimmy ends up dead.”

“What about the kid, Jerry?” Mike asked, his voice even.

Ann had steadied, the confession a relief. Her sobs had faded to whimpers.

“It wasn’t easy being married to Jimmy. So many lonely nights while he worked—and I knew he was cheating. Jerry and I became friends. He’d flirt when I stopped by the pizzeria. He paid attention to me, started spending nights over. But he wasn’t supposed to fall in love. I told him it was just for fun and companionship. He kept insisting we were in love, so Carmine had him talked to.”

Tom nodded at Mike, who turned down the air conditioner. He had a policewoman bring Ann a hot cup of coffee and stay with her while they stepped into Mike’s office.

“What a dumpster fire,” Tom said.

“I think she’s telling the truth, mostly,” Mike said. “She was probably lying about being with Carmine that night, not knowing Cowboy swung the crowbar. Still protecting him.”

“Well, it basically clears her,” Tom said. “Carmine cooked up the idea to get rid of Jimmy. Probably wants to marry her.”

“Yeah,” Mike said. “We can cut her loose. Have Betty, the policewoman, take her back to work and tell her boss she’s cleared.”

“All we’ve got is the eyewitness and Cowboy’s bowlegs,” Tom said. “We’ll have to subpoena Jenny Miscussa and put her on the stand.”

“Ann’s in love with Carmine,” Mike added. “She’s convinced he didn’t do it. No way she’ll turn. A real sordid tale.”

Chapter Ten

Ann returned to the beauty parlor from the precinct and worked through the day. The policewoman told Sheila, the owner, that Ann had been questioned and cleared, no reason to hold it against her.

Ann had worked for Sheila long enough to share a bond beyond boss and employee. Sheila told her to take her next client like nothing had happened.

Ann’s day was packed with appointments. After the first, she settled enough for it to feel almost like a normal day. Still, she flinched slightly each time the door swung open but pushed through.

Ann couldn’t wait to finish with her last client, an older woman named Ellen who’d been coming to her for years. 

They chatted about Ellen’s grandson’s second birthday party, laughing and swapping stories, a balm for Ann’s frayed nerves.

Ellen tipped her a couple of dollars and thanked her for the manicure before leaving. 

As Sheila locked the door, she pulled Ann into a hug. “See you tomorrow,” she said. “You’ll always have a job here with me.”

Ann’s eyes welled up as she told Sheila how much her support meant. “That’s what friends are for,” Sheila replied.

Ann walked home, head down, avoiding the eyes of neighbors. She fought to push past the day’s ordeal. She’d gotten through it. She knew Carmine was innocent and would endure anything for him.

At home, her stomach growled—she hadn’t eaten since breakfast. But first, she needed a hot bath to scrub away the interrogation’s lingering filth.

Afterward, she made toast with jelly and a cup of tea. Hunger gnawed, but she couldn’t eat. A good night’s sleep was what she needed. Tomorrow would be a fresh start.

Ann was washing her dish and cup in hot water, ready to turn in early, when a hard knock rattled the door.
She opened it, and Carmine barged past, rage carved into his face.

“What did you tell them today, you dumb bitch?”

He grabbed her shoulders and shoved her onto the couch. She burst into tears. “What happened? I told them you were with me that night, that you couldn’t have done it.”

“But you weren’t with me,” Carmine snarled. “It was eleven p.m. when Jimmy was killed—he hadn’t gone to work yet. They knew you were lying. Fox said it was a fake alibi to cover for me. Now he’s squeezing me, and my business is going to hell.”

“I’m sorry, babe,” Ann sobbed. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was scared and cold. I thought I was protecting you.”

“My life’s been a nightmare since I got mixed up with you,” Carmine said. “I should’ve just broken Jimmy’s arms like I planned before you offered your body to pay his debt. It’s over. Stay away from me. You’re lucky I’m letting you off, you stupid whore.”

“Carmine, no,” she pleaded. “We love each other. You can’t mean that. You’re my life.”

He yanked her up from the couch and slammed a fist into her gut. “Shut the hell up, or the next one’s on your nose. I’m walking out before I kill you. Stay away—that’s your last warning.”

Carmine stormed out, slamming the door. Ann doubled over on the couch, gasping for breath. She leaned forward, head between her knees. She had nowhere to turn. She’d lost Carmine and couldn’t call on Jerry or Tom. She was alone. Utterly alone.

Tom swung by Marino’s Pizzeria, his stomach growling. He decided to take Jerry up on his offer of a free meal.

“Tom, good to see a friendly face,” Jerry said, shaking his hand. “What can I get you? On the house, like I said.”

“Thanks, Jerry. A slice and a grape drink would hit the spot.”

“Two slices and a grape drink—friend special,” Jerry said. 

“Take a seat, I’ll bring it over.”

Tom slid into a booth as Jerry slid a couple of triangular slices into the oven. Tom’s opinion of the kid hadn’t changed since their first meeting—still a good-natured, friendly merchant, even after everything.

“Here you go, Tom,” Jerry said, setting down the food. 
Is this a goodbye visit?”

“Soon enough,” Tom said. “I’ll stick around till next week. If we can’t crack the case by then, I’m gone.”

“If I were you, I’d leave now,” Jerry said. “Maybe I’ll come with you, and we’ll open a pizza shop in L.A. You can be my new Tony.”

“You don’t want me as a partner,” Tom said. “I’d eat all the profits.”

They both laughed, but Tom’s tone turned serious.

“I’m sorry about you and Ann,” he said. “She’s in a bad place, Jerry. Try not to judge her too harshly.”

“Harshly?” Jerry said, shaking his head. “I still love her. Always will. I just know it could never work between us.”

“Anything you can tell me now, after the split, that you held back before?” Tom asked.

“I got nothing,” Jerry said. “Wish I did. I’d love to see Carmine get what’s coming. Karma’s a funny thing, you know.”

“We don’t have much either,” Tom said. “We’re convinced Carmine had Cowboy whack Jimmy. We might have enough for an indictment, but not a conviction. That’s why we need more.”

“I wish I could help, Tom,” Jerry said. “Ann never told me anything about her and Carmine. She was too busy hiding it.”

“I hear you,” Tom said. “Well, Detective Fox is tightening the screws on him—raiding his joints, getting him audited. Hitting him where it hurts, in the pocket.”

“Good,” Jerry said. “Make that murderer squirm. He’ll get his, I know it.”

Tom popped the last bite of pizza in his mouth, washing it down with the grape drink.

“Thanks for everything, Jerry,” Tom said. “I’ll try to stop by before I leave to say goodbye.”

“Do that,” Jerry said. “And remember, your money’s no good here.”

“We’ll see about that,” Tom said, pulling Jerry into a quick hug. “Be careful.”

Tom headed back to the hotel, the clock ticking, a sense of fate about to shift.

Chapter Eleven

At 10 p.m., Tom’s hotel room phone rang. “Hello,” he said.

“Tom, it’s Mike. I’ve still got Ann under surveillance until we arrest Carmine. Looks like the kid Jerry’s back in the picture. Ann went into the pizzeria around eight. They sat at a table, talking for an hour. She was laying it on thick—crying, squeezing his hand. The kid ate it up, hook, line, and sinker. Then he walked her out, and she gave him a big hug and kiss at the door. Wouldn’t be surprised if he spends the night after closing up.”

Tom paused, letting it sink in. “I don’t know what to make of anything anymore. Sounds like Carmine cut her loose—too much heat. If so, Jerry’s all she’s got left.”

“Yeah,” Mike said. “I could tell the kid was a soft touch when I talked to him. Couldn’t hurt a fly. She probably went back for some TLC.”

“I’m worried about Jerry now,” Tom said. “He was warned to stay away from her. I don’t know what game she’s playing, but it’s good you’re keeping tabs on her.”

“We need to wrap this up soon,” Mike said. “The longer this drags on, the better the chance someone gets hurt.”

“Alright, Mike. Thanks. Keep me posted, day or night. This is the weirdest case I’ve ever worked. Nothing adds up.”

Tom hung up and leaned back on the bed, staring at the ceiling fan’s slow spin. His thoughts tangled, too many to untangle. The strongest urged him to call a cab and bolt for LaGuardia right then and there. But something—hell if he knew what—kept him rooted.

As Mike predicted, Jerry closed the pizzeria at midnight, said goodnight to Tony, and left his car parked out front. He walked the block to Ann’s house. She buzzed him in, expecting his arrival. When she opened the door, her flimsy nightgown hit the floor the moment he shut it behind him.

After their lovemaking, she spilled everything—some true, some less so.

“Carmine took advantage of me, Jerry,” Ann said, her voice laced with feigned pain. “He forced me to sleep with him to pay off Jimmy’s gambling debts. I hated lying to you, but he threatened to kill us.”

“That son of a bitch,” Jerry said. “I understand. You did what you had to. I knew our split wasn’t your choice.”

“He blamed me for everything,” she went on, tears rolling down her cheeks. “Said Detective Fox is hammering him, hurting his business, and it’s my fault. He punched me in the gut and told me to stay away—or next time, it’d be my face.”

Jerry kissed her stomach, as if soothing a child’s hurt.

“It’s for the best he’s out of your life, Ann,” he said. “He’s a thug, a criminal. Don’t worry—I’m back. I’ll take care of everything. I’ll protect you. He’ll never hurt you again.”

“Promise?” she whispered in his ear.

“I promise,” he replied.

The next morning, Mike called Tom, asking him to swing by his office. Tom’s routine brisk walk to the Tiffany Diner for a Western omelet and home fries had settled in.

He was getting used to the cool fall breeze, and for a guy in his forties, carrying fifteen to twenty extra pounds, it might suit him better than L.A.’s heat. His first week back in Brooklyn was winding down, though, and it’d all be a memory in a few days.

He settled onto his usual stool, flirting lightly with Sally, his waitress, who said she’d miss him when he was gone. It added a couple of bucks to her tip.

At ten a.m., Tom finished breakfast, paid at the front register, and walked back to the hotel to freshen up.
He brushed his teeth, combed his hair, and tucked in his shirt—no need to change; he hadn’t sweated enough. Then he headed out.

In Mike’s office at the precinct, Sergeant Beales was out front, chewing out a couple of tenth graders nabbed for shoplifting cigarettes, just like he’d done to Tom and Jimmy back in the day.

“Close the door, Tom,” Mike said. “Harry’s on one of his lecture rolls. Only so much I can take.”

“I know,” Tom said. “Jimmy and I caught plenty of those as kids. I’ve been dodging him since I got here.” They both chuckled before Mike turned to business.

“Let’s visit Jenny Miscussa. Tell her to expect a subpoena and testify about Cowboy’s bowlegs. We need to push this to a close, and without her, we’ve got nothing.”

“She’ll deny it,” Tom said. “Say she never mentioned it, that she was asleep.”

“Then we’ll warn her about perjury under oath,” Mike said. “We’ve got a psycho gangster who killed a guy over a grand and to steal his wife. Jenny’s got a choice: help put him away or lie and face the consequences.”

“Let’s get it done,” Tom said. “Time to end this.”

They rang Jenny’s bell. No answer. They figured she was home, just ignoring them. They hit a couple of other bells until someone buzzed them in.
At Jenny’s door, Mike pounded hard. “Police, Jenny! Open up, or we’ll kick it in, you hear me?”

The chain slid free, and the locks clicked open.

They marched straight into her living room, making it clear who was in charge.

“I don’t know anything,” Jenny cried. “I was sleeping that night. Leave me alone.”

“Come on, Jenny,” Tom said. “You told me and Father Luongo you saw a bowlegged man kill Jimmy with a crowbar.”

“We’ll put you both under oath,” Mike barked. “Tell the truth, or face ten years for perjury.”

“I’m afraid he’ll come after me,” she said, collapsing onto the couch, sobbing.

“We’ve got him, Jenny,” Mike said. “Your testimony puts him away for good. People testify every day. I’m the one he’ll want, not you. You’ll be served later today—let the process server in. Don’t make me come back.”

The gears were turning. Jenny agreed to cooperate, reluctantly. It was all coming to a head.

Chapter Twelve

Carmine Perro strode into his club at noon, as always. His trusted henchmen, Al and Cowboy, took their usual posts—Al at a table by the door, Cowboy behind the bar, setting up the coffee machine for the boss.

If not for the dwindling profits from Detective Mike Fox’s relentless pressure, it’d be a typical day in Bensonhurst.
Carmine settled into his boss chair behind the big round poker table, facing the door. 

He thumbed through the racing form, trying to distract himself from his losses while his morning coffee brewed.
In his head, he cursed Fox and Tom. Their meddling was costing him. His bosses were starting to squeeze; he’d always been a top earner, promised a captain’s spot. 

Now that promise was slipping away, and his mind churned with thoughts of revenge.

The early calm shattered with three loud knocks on the door.

“What’s he want now?” Carmine snapped. “I can’t take much more of this. Let him in, Al.”

Al opened the door and took a .44 slug to the chest, the bullet tearing through his heart. Cowboy spun from the coffee machine as a second shot pierced his skull, dead center between his eyes.

The shooter turned on Carmine, his real target. Carmine sat frozen, unable to process the carnage unfolding.

“I promised her you’d never hurt her again, Carmine,” Jerry said, the kid on a suicide mission for love. “This is me keeping that promise.”

“She’s using you, kid,” Carmine pleaded. “Anyone can see it. She dumped you for me in a second, and now she’s got you killing for her.”

“I’m done talking,” Jerry said. “You shouldn’t have punched her.”

Before Jerry could fire, Carmine flipped the table and yanked the gun taped beneath it. They fired simultaneously. Jerry’s bullet tore through Carmine’s neck, a fatal hit. Carmine’s shot ripped into Jerry’s stomach. The kid dropped to his knees, then collapsed, bleeding out. 

His thoughts were of Ann, free from Carmine Perro’s shadow.

Three squad cars and an ambulance screeched to a stop almost simultaneously. It was too late for Carmine, Al, and Cowboy. Jerry, barely clinging to life, was loaded into the ambulance, deliriously calling for Ann, whispering she was safe now.

Mike Fox pulled up and yelled, “No!” when he saw Jerry on the stretcher. He’d planned to raid the place and take them all in. This bloodbath was senseless. He and Tom thought they’d covered every angle, but they never saw Jerry, the harmless sap, turning into a one-man assassin.

He called Tom at the hotel, dreading the news he had to deliver.
“They’re all dead, Tom,” Mike said. “Jerry massacred them.”

“Wait, what?” Tom said, reeling. “What are you saying?”

“Al, Cowboy, Carmine—all dead. Jerry walked into the club with his dad’s .44 from the pizzeria, knocked on the door, and started shooting. Got the drop on them and took them out. I can’t believe it.”

“Mike, where’s Jerry now? Is he okay?”

“As far from okay as it gets,” Mike said. “Carmine got a shot off, hit him in the gut. He’s bleeding bad but still alive. Meet me at Maimonides. We’ll talk there.” He hung up.

Tom parked in a garage, unable to find a spot in Borough Park on the Jewish Sabbath. The hospital was two blocks away, and he double-timed it, his walk breaking into a jog. Guilt gnawed at him—he had to see Jerry while he was still alive.

Why’d he push so hard? The DA was pressing Mike to call it a homicide during a mugging. He should’ve just attended Jimmy’s funeral and left. But Ann had pulled him into the case to shield Carmine, then manipulated Jerry into killing him. A psychopath in a pretty package—lethal and cunning.

Tom burst into the emergency room and spotted Mike.

“How’s he doing, Mike? Please don’t tell me he’s dead.”

“Critical,” Mike said. “They’re giving him transfusions, trying to stop the bleeding and stabilize him.”

“Can I talk to him?” Tom asked, voice cracking with guilt.

“No, Tom. He’s in the operating room. Was incoherent in the ambulance, just mumbling about Ann.”

“She caused this,” Tom said. “I thought she was okay because she was Jimmy’s wife. Little did I know.”

“Don’t beat yourself up,” Mike said. “At least Jimmy’s murder is settled. We can close the case, and you can go home. Get back to familiar ground.”

“Yeah,” Tom said. “I hope I never see her again. Don’t even want to say her name.”

“Let’s grab coffee and wait in the lobby,” Mike said. “It’ll be a while before he’s out of surgery.”

They grabbed two cups of coffee from the cafeteria and settled in the lobby, waiting for news on Jerry, distracted by the flow of people coming and going.

Mike noticed Tom’s back stiffen as he sat up straight, staring toward the elevator bank.

Dr. and Mrs. Jorgensen were crossing the lobby toward the exit. This time, Dr. Vic wasn’t in his long white lab coat—just a sweatshirt and jeans, his bowlegs plain to see, all five foot nine of him striding right past them.

“It was him all along, Mike,” Tom said. “Vic killed Jimmy, not Cowboy. It’s clear as day—pervert turned murderer.”

“Tom, how do we prove it?” Mike said. “It’s one thing to get the DA to build a case against a gangster because a witness saw a bowlegged killer. A respected surgeon with big connections? That’s a different beast.”

“I hear you,” Tom said. “We’ve got one shot. Celia loved Jimmy—I think she was planning to leave Vic for him. Our only chance is to make her turn and testify.”

“I’m ready to walk away,” Mike said. “Sometimes you just get beat.”

“One last chance,” Tom said. “We grab Celia tonight when she’s on duty. Between you, me, and Dukes, we can convince her. If not, I’m hailing a cab for LaGuardia, and we call it a wrap.”

“Against my better judgment,” Mike said, “but I’ll do it for you. One last Hail Mary.”",1,1759161475.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

___

Bill brought me some fresh clean underpants, overpants, and t-shirt from his own supply of clean laundry. I also got some socks from him, but his extra shoes were way too big. Bill's a big guy and and I'm more medium sized. All his clothes were too big, but it only really mattered with shoes. Baggy pants and shirt are no problem... 'baggy' shoes give blisters. 

Molly, the purple eyed Krethellic clyman had one of their males weave me some slippers out of his natural silk. They were great, extremely comfortable shoes and I said so... I knew all about the Krethellic. I just... forgot, I guess, in the moment. My mind was unfocused and struggling after my hyperspace suit had sizzled away. 

Before we get to my coming embarrassment in the dining facility - where I publicly received the slippers and openly praised them - I'd like to stall a while by explaining some things about the Krethellic. A fascinating species with three sexes, a rare evolutionary adaptation only found in a handful of sapient species. 

The males, which have sperm, the females, which have eggs, and the clymale, which have a catalyst material required for the the sperms and eggs to actually get together and make a new Krethellic grub. Clymale 'sauce' does also have some of the necessary genetic information, though biologically, their sauce was least costly to make of the three sexes, by a wide margin. This left more resources for them to put into their big ol' brains.

Unlike humans - where men and women are equally intelligent - Krethellic clymen are by ***far*** the most intelligent of their sexes, and all clymen are highly intelligent. All Krethellic understand language and most are smart enough to hold a conversation about the weather, but only the clymen are actually capable of understanding the most complex mathematics, warp engineering principles, regular engineering principles, complicated logistics, physics, and so on. 

Think of the most empty headed suburbanite you know, now stereotype them harder... make them little dumber than that. Maybe give them a quick concussion with a brick. That's it, perfect! You've reached the pinnacle of intellectual possibility for Krethellic males. And most are much, much dumber. To many terrans, the males seem less intelligent than smart dogs. But they can speak and they clean things well enough. They have their functions in Krethellic society, and just like humans, unbonded males tend to form packs and cause trouble.

Males are not allowed to vote, ever. The females are though, for certain things, mostly of domestic concerns. Only clymen have the full franchise, or hold high offices; it seems to work for them.

The average Krethellic female's intelligence lies well on the higher end of in between male and clymale. Sometimes smarter females choose a gender expression closer to clymale and are found working as lab assistants and in the sciences. They also fill many early educational roles in Krethellic civilization. Female teachers in the first few years of schooling are not uncommon. Unbonded females sometimes fill the typically clymale roles of later educations, what is essentially highschool. Krethellic women often leave those roles and change gender expressions entirely when they find a clymale's family to bond with. Sometimes they don't though. Plenty of old lady bugs teaching the kids what's what well into their 80s and 90s. Krethellic don't retire. It is a foreign concept to them.

The males, being dumb as hell, are generally only educated for the first five years after metamorphosis. After that they are adult in body form and mind, and can go off into their adult lives. Women take more like twenty years for a full education and maturation, though technically, they can start laying at about fifteen if they need to for some reason. Clymen generally aren't 'finished' until they are nearly thirty years post-metamorphosis. Typically they don't start trying to form a family unit until they've completed a PhD level education.

Aside from intellectual differences, and maturation rate difference there are size differences too. The males are smallest, standing between knee and waist high on a human adult. Their primary function for the species has historically been, sperm haver, egg minder, and cocoon maker and tender for the pupae that are ready for metamorphosis. 

The females are middle sized, average not as tall as humans, but there is significant overlap in the tallest Krethellic females and the shortest humans. Clymales cap out around 2.2 meters, but on average only a handful of centimeters over the average human male in height.

Once they grow beyond the grub phase, if they survive metamorphosis, the female parent tends to take over the child minding. Even now, less than a third of grubs succeed in their metamorphosis. The Krethellic don't find this fact as horrifying as the terrans do, 'that is just how it is' they say. The Krethellic don't spend research time or money on things like that, they don't get emotionally attached to them until after they successfully hatch from a metamorphosis.

Speaking of emotional attachments, their family units are typically structured with a Clymale at the top, three to eight females (normally at least a few different genders expressed in this group), and a smattering of males that sorta get... handed around the community as needed. What the terrans had once done in a desperation to make sure their populations didn't become too inbred, the Krethellic had done as a matter of course for thousands of years. 

A male tends a brood from egg to grub until he's put them all in cocoons for their metamorphosis, and when they all emerge, or don't, he cleans up what remains. If the other parents want, they can keep him around for another round, but usually that only happens if there's no other place for him to go find to be, or he's proven himself exceptionally useful to the family unit. 

Unlike humans, sexual reproduction activities aren't recreational for the Krethellic. Sucks to be there. It also means that their mating and family units are far more based on utility than emotion. That said... they are complicated beings with a whole range of emotions. 

So I tell you all this because there is one last thing you need to know about them... culturally. Like it always does, biology effects culture. 

So there's this... *thing*... in Krethellic culture, the gifting of silks. It is how a clymales indicate to females that they'd like to add them to their harem. If the female responds with vociferous praise that means yes, I'd very much like to join your family. Its kind of a, 'Look at the quality of the silk I get from the males in my household' kind of deal. Smoother, bouncier, silks are said to have better chances helping a grub survive metamorphosis. 

I knew all this, I swear it I did, but I was... not thinking. I was only thinking of food and trying to be polite, and those slippers were *mad comfortable*. Looking back, I should not have said they were the 'most comfortable thing' I'd ever worn, and going on to say 'I'd love to have a whole robe made of silk so fine' was likely a mistake as well. 

There's another, recent *thing* in Krethellic culture too... the claiming of humans. Clymen who convince humans to join their family units. Often the clymen also try to acquire multiple humans when they do this, men and women.  

I don't rightly know if Molly blushed, but I know they did not - initially - intend those slippers as such a gift. That said, we had just walked into the dining facility as I was extolling the virtues of the slippers their males made me.

The sound of general conversation stopped abruptly as we entered, and my ""I swear these silk slippers are amazing, Molly. It's like walking on a cloud!"" echoed through the room. At first I thought they had all stopped to look at me because I am Dilt Bifferent... but it turns out it was because, I had loudly, publicly, turned a friendly inter species gift into a marriage proposal. All I had to do was say, 'thanks for the shoes' and nothing more, but no, I am Dilt Bifferent, I couldn't possibly do things the easy way.

""I accept!"" Molly hadn't previously considered taking a human into their household, it was a status symbol they had assumed above their station as a mid level scientist, but given the opportunity, and the general cultural peer pressure from the clymen and women, how could they refuse? How could they skip on this chance.

""Great, me too."" I said, not certain of what I was accepting exactly. My mind was a bit scattered at this point still. 

""Witnesses! You saw it, we both agreed! He's mine! Mine!"" Molly grabbed my hand in theirs and dragged me to a table nearby, where they sat me down. ""I'll get you some food darling.""

They'd watched enough human TV to know some pet names humans like, but in the moment, the darling REALLY threw me. I was just happy to be getting fed.

Molly brought me things from the human food line, and also the Krethellic food line. Only some things in the Krethellic diet are bad for terrans, and likewise the other way around. No coffee for Krethellic, but everyone enjoys tequila. And a human should never drink zurctzurt, unless they want to hallucinate non-stop until they either receive medical attention or die.

I ate, and ate... and ate. I was ravenous. It was like there was a year of design work I'd done and needed to recoup all the missing calories from that hypertime stint I did. Simultaneously, it was like I'd never eaten a thing before in my entire life... which, from a certain point of view, I think was true. 

I ate pizza, a hotdog, a piece of cheesecake, and an order of fries. Then I destroyed some cheese burgers, after which I started on the Krethellic food.

I ate various puffs and balls of flavor I didn't know what were or care. Then I had a steak of some kind, and finally I destroyed some beeschurgers. 

The Krethellic keep a sort of... insect cow, that humans call Beeffalo. They also make a fermented 'milk' into a kind of 'cheese' from these beeffalo. A beeschurger is just what humans call a beeffalo meat burger, with beeffalo cheese on it. 

The other humans looked at me like I was insane for devouring and *enjoying* Krethellic cuisine, or maybe it was what I did on my way in, but meat is meat, and beeffalo is like... beefy flavored shrimp. It's delicious.

Bill's shirt was less baggy when I finally finished, and his pants barely fit anymore after I'd eaten what felt like fifty thousand calories.

Speaking of Bill, he'd come back to tell me they'd transmitted the data from the probes I'd sent to get eaten by the Scourge, and the Krethellic high executor and the human prime citizen were both getting together to speak with me on comms, soon.

Hopefully they'd be willing to listen, because this empire was technologically a long way behind the other two children of Sol. They hadn't even envisioned some of the materials that would be needed to build the enfuckulator... I'd need them to spin up whole new industries from scratch. I'm pretty sure I'd drawn up designs in my furious design spree for not just the enfuckulator itself, but some devices to help my hosts make the parts needed for it. I just hope their government heads are happy with the fact I don't know how it works or exactly what it does or if its safe to be around. I just knew from before coming here, that we were really gonna need one, sooner than later.

One time this older guy completely lost it on me over how his eggs were cooked. I couldn’t do anything about it they were literally fine but he wouldn’t stop yelling. My manager, who’s about my age and also a student, stepped in and just goes, “That’s it, you’re fired.”

I played along. Took off my apron, started fake begging like, “Please, I need this job, I’m paying my way through college, I can’t lose it.” He stayed stone cold.

The guy who was raging instantly panicked and started saying, “No no no, it’s not that serious, don’t fire them, it’s fine!” He went from furious to apologizing in about 5 seconds.

We’ve done it a couple more times since then when people come in acting like complete monsters. Every single time, the angry person backs down. It actually feels kinda satisfying watching them realize their meltdown might actually have consequences for someone just trying to survive.

I told some friends about it and they said it’s messed up because those people probably go home thinking they cost some broke college kid their job.but I don’t feel guilty. If you can’t treat workers with basic decency, maybe you deserve a little wake-up call.

Monk's makes garlic fries & Jerry can't get rid of garlic breath.,"George has the flu, but he's super close to closing a fantastic, million dollar deal that will net him a massive commission paycheck if he can succeed - as well as open doors to other high-end clients. He's worried that another coworker, Linneman, is lurking in the wings waiting to vulture it at the first opportunity. The client is notorious for just wanting a deal done and not caring who the agent is. 

George coughs while presenting his offer to his boss, Mr. Cohen, for approval. Cohen immediately asks him if he's sick and tells him it's better to go home than to get the whole office sick, and he's happy to pay him sick time. 

Normally George would take full advantage of this but this is one of the rare times his greed outweighs his laziness.

Linneman keeps loudly offering George tissues and cough drops whenever Cohen is near. Cohen later insists on tagging along with George's client meeting because he wants to see how George does things. George has to hide sneezes, coughing fits, and a fever. 

  
Elaine is sick too. She is at home resting when the doorbell rings. She opens the door and receives a care package and card from her boyfriend Paul. It has soup, crackers (""A nice snack for when I'm sick"" ""SOUP IS A MEAL""), gatorade, Vicks, shower steamers, and...a really odd get-well-soon card. 

The card has seemingly irrelevant cartoon drawings of a sandwich and a coffee mug. The message has a bee-related pun (""bee-lieve in yourself, I'm not pollen your leg!""\_) that makes no sense given the context of the card and doesn't even seem to have anything to do with getting well soon.

She finds herself unable to focus on anything but the card because it's impossible to grasp. 

  
Kramer meets Mr. Alexandru Popescu, a new neighbor, at a building social event. Kramer has a new Polaroid camera and takes pictures of everybody at the party. He plans to post them up in the lobby and encourage more people to come together as a building. He's certain he took a photo of Mr. Popescu that day, but when he goes to put it up he can't find it. He asks Newman if he took any Polaroids and he denies it. Newman comments that Popescu got a heavy package from Romania, and that he brought his own dark red wine to the building party. They build off each other and suspect he doesn't show up in pictures because he's a vampire, and set out to prove it. 

  
Meanwhile Jerry tries some new garlic & rosemary fries at Monk's and finds them incredibly addictive. THe only problem is he can't get rid of his garlic breath afterwards. It costs him a kiss with a beautiful woman he is seeing. 

He tries mouthwash, brushing his teeth, eating palate cleansers like sorbet, ginger, and crackers...nothing. If he eats those fries, the smell will be on him for the next 12 hours. 

This only seems to further Kramer and Newman's theory when they see Popescu flee the elevator after sharing it with Jerry",4,1759160930.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,0,1.0,False

""Just thinking about some stuff,"" I told her at dinner.

What I didn't say: I've been running launch scenarios in my head for the past 72 hours straight. Even in meetings. Especially in meetings.

**The mental gymnastics of building while employed:**

During the day: I'm 100% focused on my job. Sprint planning. Code reviews. Being a good employee.

After 5 PM: I transform into a different person. Landing pages. Email sequences. Conversion optimization.

The hard part isn't the long hours. It's the constant context switching.

My brain at 4:59 PM: ""Let's discuss the sprint backlog"" My brain at 5:01 PM: ""WHAT IF THE PAYMENT GATEWAY FAILS""

**My 12-year-old has become suspicious:**

""Dad, you've been staring at your laptop with that worried face again.""

""What worried face?""

""The one where you pretend you're not worried but your eyebrows give you away.""

When did she get so observant?

**What 2 years of MBA + building a SaaS taught me:**

• MBA: Time management is about priorities   
• Reality: Time management is about sacrifice   
• MBA: Work-life balance is key   
• Reality: Work-life-sideproject balance is impossible   
• MBA: Plan everything meticulously  
• Reality: Plans change. Adapt or die.

**48 hours from now:**

Either I'll have successfully launched my first SaaS, or I'll have the world's most over-engineered waitlist page.

Both outcomes required:

• 300+ evening hours   
• Countless weekend sprints   
• More coffee than a human should consume   
• A family that somehow still likes me

**The countdown reality:**

It's not about the launch anymore. It's about proving to myself that all those nights choosing discomfort over Netflix were worth something.

That all those ""just thinking about some stuff"" moments add up to something real.

That building something while keeping all your other commitments isn't just possible - it's been done.

**T-2 and counting.**

To everyone else building in the margins of their life - what's your ""worried face"" tell?

Poblacion is usually known for bars and nightlife 👀 pero ang dami ring spots na worth visiting kahit hindi ka umiinom. Sharing my personal picks (just my opinion 🌸) for the foodies, café lovers, and chill hangout seekers:

1. Crosta Pizza – cult-fave pies, super sulit for barkada catch-ups 🍕

2. Morgano’s – pasta & Italian comfort food na perfect pang date night 🍝

3. Alba Restaurante Español – Spanish sit-down dining kung feel mo more cozy & chill 🇪🇸

4. Galli Village Café – Italian-inspired dishes in a warm, homey vibe 🍷

5. Kanto Freestyle Breakfast – all-day Pinoy breakfast staples, affordable & hearty 🥓🍳

6. El Chupacabra – Tex-Mex + steaks (great for meat lovers, casual spot) 🥩🌮

7. Friends & Neighbors – classic Pinoy comfort food na parang lutong-bahay 🍲

8. Good Sh*t Coffee / Annex House / Assembly Hall – café hopping spots ☕ (ako, I go for the vibes & pastries since I don’t drink coffee hehe).

9. Nicanor García Street (Calle Reposo) – side trip for art galleries & design shops 🎨

10. Street art + food crawl walk – best way to discover Poblacion is just to walk around, may murals, hidden eats, and random cute spots 🚶‍♀️

For me, Poblacion can be so much more than just bar-hopping 🌸 Sometimes the best nights are about good food, café vibes, and random street finds with friends.

I wrote in this sub a while back about dizziness i was experiencing these last 2 months. I think the first episode triggered was from a coffee and cigarettes i was having in the morning and hasnt stopped ever since. I did some blood work tests and they all are fine, nothing there explains it so i went to the ENT and they suspect of Menieres or inner ear vestibular issues and prescribed me b-complex and betahistine 16 mg twice a day. I went to neurologist as well and she prescribed me cinarizine. I dont know if its good or bad I did this but i havent taken cinarizine because i made some research and I didnt like the side effects. The neurologist said that they didnt think it was sth to do with her. Now take into account that im in a country where public healthcare is not the best, and they dont really care that much. I did an audiogram and apparently my right ear had some problems, i can feel ringing and pressure on it sometimes. After a nap yesterday it feels blocked even now. Now if i rememeber correctly i used to smoke 5 ciggs a day when i started meds , i cut coz i was worried. After two weeks of meds i felt better and started smoking like usual. Now it feels like symptoms got worse. Dizziness is not as present but the ear ringing and fullness is all day, and my eyes dont feel focused , i cant see far where i would normally see. I used to get this eyes unfocusing even before but it was with episodes now its all day. Im going into week 4 of betahistine, and idk how to feel abt this. Should i consult the doctor again, maybe go to a private one. Im also in question if its vestibular migraines as well, i got some flare ups when i was angered or when i laughed too hard. Should i try to take cinarizine. Would it be right to suspect for a neck problem as well. Ive had neck pain more than i usually have( i have to work in front of a computer all day)Ive quit coffe for 5 weeks now because it makes me horrible.

1ntlh1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1ntlh1b/does_waterdrop_wdedfa1_under_sink_filter_truly/,Does Waterdrop WD-EDFA-1 Under Sink Filter Truly Deliver? Expert Review,"The **Waterdrop WD-EDFA-1** under-sink water filter replacement claims to elevate your water purification experience to a level that’s both user-friendly and efficient. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been putting this filter through a day-to-day grind in my household, primarily to see if its specs hold true and if it’s a practical investment for regular use.

**Streamlined Design for Convenience**

I was impressed the moment I set eyes on this sleek under-sink filter. Measuring 3.3''D x 3.3''W x 10.6''H, its compact size made it easy to install within even the tightest cabinet spaces under my sink. It’s clear that convenience was top-of-mind in its design. Installation took barely three seconds, and no tools were required—it’s a simple twist-and-replace mechanism. While most systems I've worked with in the past required me to crawl under the sink with a toolbox, this one felt like a cheat code. Bonus points for making life easier!

**Pluses**

- Quick and tool-free installation simplifies the replacement process.
- Compact design fits snugly under any kitchen sink.
- Convenient twist-off mechanism saves time.

**Performance and Filtration Quality**

After running this filter for a few days, I could genuinely taste a difference in my water. The carbon block material really delivers on its promise—it effectively reduces chlorine, unpleasant odors, and metallic tastes that oddly linger in some city water supplies. The filtration felt robust; even when I ran water for hours during meal prep or filtered large volumes for storage, the taste remained pure and consistent. Additionally, it claims to retain beneficial minerals, and I haven’t noticed any hint of flatness in the flavor, which was a huge plus.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Enhanced performance reduces chlorine, taste, and harmful heavy metals.
- Long-lasting filter life offering a solid year of quality filtration.
- Improved water taste, noticeable even in beverages like coffee and tea.

**Target User Compatibility**

This filter is specifically designed for Waterdrop systems like WD-TSU-B, WD-TSC-W, and related models. If you own one of these systems, the replacement filter slides seamlessly into place without trial and error. Despite the stellar compatibility here, this limits its use to a specific ecosystem. If you don’t already own a Waterdrop filtration system, using this replacement isn’t an option—something to note for newcomers researching their first water filtration setup.

**Limitations**

- Restricted compatibility only for Waterdrop systems (WD-TSU and WD-TSC series).
- Can’t double as a universal filter for other filtration setups.

**Durability and Lifespan**

With its promised service life of 2000 gallons (approximately 12 months of use in my home), this filter functions just as implied: long and steady. I haven’t yet reached the recommended replacement time, but based on my current water usage, it’s hard to imagine it running short of that claim. The fact that the replacement cycle is achievable without a professional plumber adds further peace of mind for budget-conscious users.

**Other Options**

Although the Waterdrop replacement filter has its merits, there are alternatives worth considering. Brands like Brita and Aquasana offer under-sink filtration solutions that cater to different preferences. Brita systems are often more universally compatible across multiple setups, potentially giving users more flexibility. On the flip side, Aquasana systems come with higher filtration ratings, focusing more on removing a wider spectrum of impurities. However, both options lose out to Waterdrop's unbeatable ease of installation and compact design.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Compared to competitors in this category, the cost efficiency of the Waterdrop replacement filter is commendable. Filters like these, designed with advanced carbon block material and NSF-certified performance, often cost significantly more. Given that you’d only replace this filter annually or semi-annually based on usage, it's clear this product delivers exceptional value for its quality. The only downside is that you must be integrated into the Waterdrop ecosystem to benefit from this replacement filter.

1ntlbbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1ntlbbc/why_is_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_breville/,Why is the best drip coffee maker Breville Precision Brewer worth it,"The Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 has been a consistent part of my daily coffee routine for a while now, and as someone who's tasted more coffee than I care to admit, I think it's worth sharing both the highs and the quirks of this machine. It’s a brushed stainless steel drip coffee maker that boasts a glass carafe and is designed to brew coffee with precision. The sheer number of features it offers initially stood out, but diving deeper revealed a few nuances that are worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Starting with its design, the machine carries an undeniably modern aesthetic. The brushed stainless steel finish gives it a sleek, almost professional vibe. It fits incredibly well in a contemporary kitchen setup, although it’s not the most compact coffee machine out there. Measuring 6.7 inches deep, 12.4 inches wide, and 15.7 inches tall, it occupies its fair share of counter space. Its solid build gives it the durability you’d expect from a premium brand like Breville, but I did find its 9.5-pound weight makes it a bit cumbersome if you need to move it around. Robust, yes—but portability isn’t its forte.

**Brewing Performance**  
The phrase “precision brewer” isn’t just thrown in for marketing. This machine truly delivers on the promise of flexibility. With six different brewing modes, including Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew, it caters to just about every coffee preference you could think of. The Gold mode, for example, optimizes water temperature and brew time to align with SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) standards, resulting in the kind of cup you’d expect from a skilled barista. 

The real gem, though, is the My Brew option. It lets you fine-tune bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate to truly customize your coffee. This feature felt like a playground for a coffee nerd like me. I experimented with fruity Ethiopian beans, and I could actually highlight their floral notes by tweaking the settings. On traditional machines, this level of nuance would’ve been impossible.

**Key Benefits**  
- Six unique brewing modes tailored to different preferences
- The ability to meet SCA Gold Cup standards for optimal brewing  
- Completely adjustable parameters on My Brew mode offering personalized control  
- Effective dual filter basket system (flat bottom and cone options)  
- Compatibility with pour-over adapters like Hario V6 for specialty brewing  

[Discover if Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 is on sale at Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)  

**Ease of Use**  
While the machine is packed with features, there’s a slight learning curve to navigating the interface. Using the presets is fairly straightforward, but diving into My Brew mode can initially feel like trying to program a spaceship. The control buttons are intuitive once you get the hang of them, but the lack of a touchscreen feels dated compared to some high-end competitors. Thankfully, the included coffee spoon and water hardness test strip are welcome touches, ensuring even novices aren’t left guessing about measurements and water quality.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The machine takes up significant counter space and isn’t easy to store  
- There’s a bit of a learning curve for beginners new to customization  
- The glass carafe can pour unevenly if not tilted at just the right angle  

**Accessories and Extras**  
In the box, you’ll find everything necessary to get started: a glass carafe, coffee spoon, cone filter basket insert, mesh basket filter, flat-bottom basket filter paper pack, and a water hardness test strip. These accessories reinforce the impression that Breville considers the small details important. However, while the inclusion of these extras adds convenience, replacing filters over time could mean an added expense. 

**Competitive Options**  
Stacking the Breville Precision Brewer up against its contemporaries, such as the Technivorm Moccamaster and Bonavita Connoisseur, revealed an interesting mix of advantages and limitations. The Technivorm is often lauded for its simplicity and retro design, but it doesn’t offer the same customizable brewing features. The Bonavita, on the other hand, is a more affordable pick but lacks the versatility of six brew modes, especially when it comes to making cold brew or pour-over-style coffee. The Breville lives in premium territory and brings advanced features to justify the price.

**Value Proposition**  
No one’s denying that the Breville Precision Brewer sits at a higher price point. The sheer range of features and brewing customizations justifies its cost for coffee aficionados who want café-quality results at home. It’s an investment—particularly when compared to budget models—but arguably worth it for the added control and convenience it offers. While I wavered on whether I’d use the My Brew mode every single time, the delight of having that option when I want to experiment makes it appealing.

I tell myself that a lot these days. Not out loud, not in a mirror — I don’t have the nerve for that anymore. But the thought rings in my head like a bad radio frequency every time I close my eyes: you shouldn’t have taken the job.

I was a grad student with a specialty no one cared about: medieval codices, obscure languages, half-forgotten scribes who lived and died by candlelight. My professors used to say my thesis was the kind of thing people skim over in footnotes and forget.

And then I got the email.

A private collector in New England. Anonymous. Said he had something “rare.” Said my name had been recommended. Offered me six months of work, quiet, paid in cash.

I didn’t need to ask what it was. I already knew. Everyone in my field knows.

The Voynich Manuscript.

I expected to find disappointment — some high-grade facsimile, another imitation meant to keep the myth alive. What I found instead was the real thing. Not behind glass, not in some climate-controlled vault, but laid bare in a cedar trunk, wrapped in linen that smelled of smoke.

I remember my fingers trembling as I unwrapped it. The calfskin stiff but alive with the grease of centuries. The ink sharp, darker than it had any right to be after five hundred years.

And the drawings. Always the drawings.

Naked women waist-deep in impossible pools. Plants that never grew on this earth. Constellations that refuse to map to any sky. The words dancing between them in script that shouldn’t exist, like someone had taken Latin, Hebrew, Greek, and crushed them together until the meaning bled out.

I told myself I wouldn’t get lost in it. That I’d do the work, catalogue what I could, and collect my money.

That was three months ago.

Now the script is burned into my eyelids. I see it in coffee stains, in raindrops, in the cracks on my ceiling. The letters rearrange themselves every time I look away. My notebooks are a graveyard of half-translations, none of which agree with each other.

But sometimes… sometimes, I know I’m close.

There are pages that don’t sit right. One in particular. A foldout map, covered in loops and funnels that look less like geography and more like plumbing. Tubes feeding into chambers, chambers feeding into pits, everything flowing downward like water down a drain.

The women in those drawings aren’t bathing. They’re sinking.

I tried tracing the map once. I set my pen to the top left corner and followed it down. By the time I reached the center, my wrist was bleeding. Not a scratch. Not a cut. Just blood, as if the act of following the path had pulled it out of me.

I burned that page. I shouldn’t have. But the thing about burning is that the image never really dies. It just changes color. Now, every time I close my eyes, I see the map glowing red in the dark.

And the worst part? I think I understand pieces now. Just words. Fragments.

The vessel.

The root.

The marrow.

The keeper.

The drawings of the women — they’re not random. They’re not even women, not really. They’re diagrams. Anatomical. Not human anatomy. Something older. Something stretched across centuries and skinned alive in ink.

Two nights ago, I woke to find the manuscript open on my desk. I hadn’t left it that way. A single word had been written in the margin in fresh ink, still wet when I touched it.

My name.

I don’t remember screaming. I only remember the taste of blood in my mouth and the sense that someone had been sitting at my desk, quill in hand, waiting for me to notice.

Since then, I can’t shake the feeling that the manuscript isn’t describing something. It’s inviting me to it.

I started dreaming in its alphabet. Not reading—speaking. The words roll off my tongue like I’ve known them longer than English, longer than breathing. I wake up gasping, the taste of copper in my mouth, like the sounds themselves are cutting me from the inside.

The diagrams don’t stay still anymore. I’ll look at them, and the ink shifts like tidewater. Roots stretch. Pools deepen. Figures lower themselves further into the funnels, arms outstretched toward something beneath the parchment. Something that was always there, waiting for the right set of eyes.

Two nights ago, my neighbor pounded on the wall at 3 A.M., swearing at me for “chanting.” I wasn’t chanting. I was asleep. But when I checked my voice recorder the next morning, I heard myself. A rasping whisper, repeating the same string of words over and over in that impossible script.

Marrow. Keeper. Vessel. Open.

When I listened again, slower, I swear I heard a second voice joining mine.

Last night was worse.

The manuscript was on the floor, wide open, though I’d locked it away in the trunk. The new page was still there—the faceless figure hunched over the book. But now, beneath it, the letters had shifted again.

I translated what I could. It wasn’t much. Just a phrase.

You are already written.

I slammed the manuscript shut. Threw it into the trunk. Buried the trunk in the basement under concrete bags until my arms gave out. I thought if I could cover it in enough weight, I could bury whatever it was trying to pull out of me.

But tonight, when I came back upstairs, my desk lamp was already on. A single page was waiting there. Not parchment. Printer paper. My printer had spat it out, humming happily like it had done nothing wrong.

The same faceless figure stared back at me. The script wrapped around it like a halo. But this time, the letters had become clear.

It wasn’t the manuscript anymore. It was my handwriting.

And the phrase was no translation. No puzzle. Just English.

Read aloud.

I didn’t. I couldn’t. My lips trembled around the shape of the first word, and my chest seized like something inside me was clawing for escape. I crumpled the page and burned it in the sink. But the smoke curled upward in the shape of letters, perfect letters, before dissolving into the ceiling.

And as the ash flaked into the drain, I realized I knew the words anyway. Every syllable. Every break. I didn’t need the page anymore.

I can hear the manuscript whispering from under the concrete. Not words this time. Breathing. Waiting.

And I think I finally understand what all of this has been building toward. The Voynich Manuscript isn’t a book. It’s a mirror. A trap. A lineage.

Someone had to keep it alive. Someone had to carry the next verse.

Now it’s me.

I know how this sounds. I know what kind of people come here, and I know how this will read — another half-mad rant from someone who dug too deep into a thing best left alone. But this isn’t a ghost story or a campfire tale.

I’m writing this here because I can’t trust anyone else with it. And because if you start seeing the symbols too — in your dreams, in your coffee stains, in the cracks on your ceiling — maybe you’ll recognize them before it’s too late.

I don’t care if you believe me. I only care that when the manuscript finds you, you’ll remember I tried to warn you.

Because once the words learn your mouth, you do not own them.

They carve themselves into the marrow, until you are less flesh than inscription.

And when the last breath leaves you, the book does not close.

It simply turns the page.

Specifically I'm also curious to have feedback from:

  
\- neighborhood. I'm considering the Pearl or West Bay but unsure about the pros/cons for both?

\- I drive a motorcycle where I'm from. Is a motorcycle (6-7 months per year for a small daily commute in Doha + maybe go kitesurfing) + a proper car (for the rest of the year / longer trips) a viable option?

\- Any recommendations / things I should know re: specific services such as Amazon, home-delivered dry cleaning, Deliveroo equivalents?

I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 183, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Guy rings up the drink and says ""that'll be £5.70"" and I'm like ""Why?"" And he says ""it's 65p for the oat milk"".

Now I had a good look at their flashy moving screen menus with their videos of hazelnut frappes being poured over ice, and nowhere does give the price of non dairy milks as an extra menu item. And there were no boards up that either me or the barrista could see. The only place the 65p oat milk charge was displayed was apparently on his till once he entered the drink. 

So i argued that he had to serve me the drink on the menu, which is commonly understood to consist of milk, hot chocolate and coffee, for the price advertised, which is £5.05 (and daylight robbery at that) regardless of what milk is used. He can't just be making up extra charges which aren't displayed at the point of purchase.

Something about me is I am a deep sleeper, two the door is closed, there are two fans on. So how am I supposed to hear u ""yelling.""

The only thing that really bugs me is I can't even yell at her because they she gets even more mad. The another thing is i said i was gonna take a shower and then she says ""take the 1 year old puppy with you i don't want to deal with her"" then she said ""I have so much work to do"" like no one freaking cares.

I've never personally bought unroasted before so I lack context.  Do you guys consider this a good deal?  Is there interest to see more like it?

I am considering the best way to integrate deals on unroasted into our site and it will take me some time to study this (if we even do it at all).    I might just try to tag posts and add a filter.  I might make a separate section or offer a separate newsletter.   It really depends on the frequency of deals I come across in this segment and the overall interest level in seeing offers like these.",0,1759159267.0,roasting,0,0.2,False

u/awriterpossibly: wheeeeeeee, gurl! It’s definitely going to be a hot ghoul summer here! 👻🌞 These little ghosties are so freakin’ adorable! I love the purple background. 🎨 A pumpkin kite  🎃, bite out of a watermelon 🍉 (our watermelons are seriously lacking the last few years… hopefully we can grab a nice one this year! 🤞), a delicious 2-scoop ice-cream 🍦, a good boerewors roll 🌭, adorable swimming pool floatie 🏊, and oh my, my kryptonite, pizza 🍕 and good music 🎶! So adorable! I absolutely love my Summer-ween card, thank you! We are moving into summer now, so my Halloween is actually pretty… sweaty 💦. A Summer-ween pink ghost pillow sounds AMAZING and I’m so happy that you spoiled yourself with such an amazing TLC gift! 🎁 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💜

 

ADELAIDE MEETUP, u/m2ddy-gxxx: whenever I see doves/pigeons, I think of John Wick, so this postcard has STRONG John Wick vibes for me! 🕊️ That’s so cool that you use a photo from u/pirate 🏴‍☠️ (I’m not 100% sure, so just let me know, should I also tag them? 🖤)! I wonder if your pronunciation for ‘Ngutungka’ is similar to how I might read it in Xhosa? 🇿🇦 I think that phonetics helps me pronounce it properly, but also, I could be extremely wrong. 🤷 I can’t believe Postcrossing has been going on for 20 years, wow! 🎉 I only learnt about it this year thanks to RAOC. Have you been involved in Postcrossing since the beginning? 🕰️ The cute dragon stickers are amazing! 🐉 The one reminds me of a strawberry 🍓, the other an orange dragon 🍊, and the purple one is definitely a grape 🍇! Raa! 🐲 Thank you very much for my postcard! 🧡

 

u/Laghertis: I’m listening to Eugen Doga’s ‘Black Veil’ now, and oh my, how stunning is it! It sounds like… a fairytale! 🏰 It is so exceptionally special receiving my first postcard from Moldova with such a special musical talent. 🇲🇩🎻 Two quick things: your name is beautiful 🌸 , and your street name reminds me of the Swan Princess. 🦢👑 I’m so honoured to be your first card to an African country. Please know that this is exceptionally special to me. 🌍 Oh, a cherry pie! 🥧 I’ve never tasted or made a cherry pie before! 🍒 I’m not a huge fresh cherry fan, but I do love cherry flavoured drinks and sweets. Is it difficult to bake cherry pies? 👩‍🍳 I’m glad that you had a busy but happy day. Sometimes such days are so fulfilling! 🌸 Which musician did you go watch? I hope it had you singing and dancing and cheering loudly! 🎉 I love that the classical music is a bit of a “break” between all the rock and busy music. There is a reason some music survives the ages and I can very well understand Tchaikovsky being one of them! 🎼 Have you ever watched ‘The Nutcracker’ ballet before? 🩰 I’d still love to do that. Baking a cherry pie while listening to his music must have been magical! I imagine a Moldovan fairy baking! 🧚‍♀️ Your postage stamp of the Lumânărică is so pretty – I love dense flowers on a stem like that. 🌼 The purple flower sticker is also so pretty with the gold accents ✨. Thank you very much for my postcard! 💛

 

u/ShouldBeTeaching: what a colourful envelope! I’m absolutely crazy about the watercolour flower vibe and delivery address circle! Eeeeeeeek, the little ringtail animal reminds me of my one kitten ! It’s sitting just like her and that tail is identical! 😻 Thank you for such an interesting set of postage stamps with all the animals! I really love that the USA has so many designs. 🇺🇸 Aww, what a special little sticker to thank the mailmen/ladies, and even a little RAOC sticker! 💌👩‍✈️👨‍✈️ I am petrified of breaking your wax stamp – this glittery blue makes me so happy! 💙 This paper in the envelope, with the blue flowers, is stunning! 😍 That needs to be a wallpaper in some sort of… maybe a coffee/tea shop. Quick question (with zero judgement) – was there perhaps another lady from SA that you were sending something to? The name on the envelope is mine, but inside the card… hehehehe! 😂 Maybe there was a mix up, or maybe just distraction? So! Let me just say, I think the flowers and watercolour vibes are STUNNING. The paper also has this lovely texture… I see the lines are sort of… flannel vibe? For the lack of a better word.... It’s so sleek and pretty. I think it goes so well with the spring theme! 🌷🌞 Everywhere I look, I discover more lovely flowers. 🌼🌸🌻 Today is a nice sunny day 🌞, and I took a quick look in the herb 🌿 and veggie garden 🥦 (where there are now also a few roses planted 🌹), so it suits today so well. Thank you very much for my card! 💚

 

u/GatsbyGalaktoboureko: IT’S JUST A FLESH WOUND! 🗡️😂 Heheheheheh, I only started watching Monty Python in my 20s, and I’m so glad I sought the films out because they are hilarious. 🎭🤣. I knew of the name Monty Python, but somehow it was never part of my upbringing 🤷. I hope my grandfather watched his work, because I know my grandfather’s humour would have suited them 100%! I absolutely love how he took African and European swallows into account… if you’re going to compare, you need to decide on your parameters! 🐦📏 Thank you so much for sharing about one of your favourite movies! 🍿 The image on the postcard is so fun too – the… my language is missing today… the… style! The style is really cool, I think it is so suited to the whole King Arthur ⚔️, Holy Grail 🏆, Knights vibe 🛡️. 😎 And YES, there has to be a swallow! 🐦 The ‘forever USA’ postage stamp with the bird is also peak humour (good choice!)! 😂 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💌💙

 

u/status-risk-0: awww, the Astérix and Obelix post stamp is so sweet! 💌 I love you using the same shade of light blue in your washi and pen gel. La poste! 📮 Lettre internationale! 🌍 This is good French to know, yes? 🇫🇷 What does 'Place de la Trinité' mean? 🤔 Something perhaps about place of three? 3️⃣ Ooooh, I think these windows with their little balconies are just so, so sweet! 🏠🌸 That's so... it's so European to me. It must be a sight to walk through Toulouse and come across fountains and cafés. ⛲☕ What is your favourite tea to drink at those tea shops? 🍵 What a delightful surprise to find some extra stickers to… is that a mouse getting ready to eat the cheese with a fork and spoon? 🧀🐭 Too cute! I made an audible little squeal at the jester “record the mood” note – she/he is so adorable! 🤹 And very French to me. I studied a lot about Commedia dell’Arte, so anything theatre and mask interests me. A holographic magical crystal….  🔮And these mini stickers (hammerhead holding a heart 🦈💖, the row of penguins 🐧🐧🐧, etc) are just so, so cute!  Thank you very much for my happy mail and postcard! ❤️

 

(I'm struggling to make this name out) u/ulanhosf?: eeek, awww, meeeeek! 😍 SO CUUUUUTE! 🐿️💕 This cheeky chippy chipmunk image is so cuuuute! 🥰 And so clever! I LOVE the puffed-up cheek and the seeds lying everywhere. 🌻🌰 My one kitten looks like a squirrel/chipmunk, and her one nickname is 'eekhoring(tjie)' (Afrikaans for (little) squirrel) and 'quirrel'. I love it! I must show my mother , I think she'll love it too! 🌸 How can someone not smile when they see a little squirrel or chipmunk play around and stuff their cheeks with seeds and nuts? 😆🥜 Eeeekkkk! From a little chipmunk to a 100lbs mountain of a dog! Bless! 🐕 Does he like chipmunks too? 🐶 Is he a gentle giant? Thank you very much for my postcard! 🧡

 

u/_Grotesque_ (x2): I'm so excited to see mail from Germany! 🇩🇪✉ I recognised your message in a bottle and fish stamps! 🐟 Does ""Haustiere"" mean, like, domesticated animals, pets? 🐇🐕 Are rabbits popular as pets in Germany? 🐰 I absolutely adore the Freddie Mercury postcard! 🎤👑 I'm definitely going to brag a bit and share it with my dad! 👨‍👧 I wish we had more time with Freddie and Queen – can you imagine the music they still had in them to make together? 🎸 I have heard that Germany has had a hot summer! ☀️ Mind you, I've also seen the whole of Europe burning up this summer. 🔥You must all be looking forward to the autumn and winter weather? It's so sweet of you to have bought ice-creams for your office. I'm sure they all appreciated your random act of kindness. 💕🍦 I'm not going to lie – I had to light up my torch to read the black on dark blue (my mother says I'm colourblind when it comes to dark blues and blacks), but I do love the colours! 🎨 Your handmade Gemini postcard is stunning! ♊ I absolutely love how you've joined the stickers with such a fine white line and tiny white dots. The colour scheme is magical and gorgeous! 🌌 How is your new job going? 💼 And how is your health, how are you feeling? 🌸 Please never feel bad for late mail – I appreciate any effort, and I know life just gets so busy that we need to focus on ourselves. That's so amazing that your new colleague is South African! 🇿🇦 I hope that he's making a good impression on you guys. 😄 Are you vegetarian or vegan, that you can't eat meat? Uhm... so... gosh, I think as South Africans we are so spoilt for choice. A good bobotie is always good. 🍲 It's usually made with beef mince 🐄, however, I have tried turkey mince 🦃 (during a study exchange in England 🇬🇧, my English mom made it 👩‍🍳). I don't recall any turkey mince here in SA. I sometimes have an issue with the egg layered on top of the mince: I suspect I have an egg sensitivity, and that sort of egg doesn't work well with me. I would say I like sultanas and dried apricots mixed into the mince more than the raisins. 🍇🍑 Now, for a vegan version, you could use lentils and butternut! 🥕🎃 I'm trying to think of something vegetarian or vegan to suggest… Veggie samosas? Oh, no, wait, bread! A vetkoek! 🥯 You can add any kind of stuffing/filling! Probably the most popular filling is curry mince? 🌶️🍛 I love butter 🧈, strawberry jam 🍓 and grated cheese 🧀! Biltong 🥩, marmite 🖤 and cheese 🧀 a close second. The girl biting the apple, with the rabbit on her lap, is such a cute sticker! 🍎🐇 If you say that rabbits are popular pets, I'll call this my German girl sticker 🇩🇪👧. My poor kittens get snuggled like this all the time! I just want to squish them they're so cute! I don't want to mess with any of these cats in suits and robes! 😼 They're all so fluffy and serious. I dream of having my own kitchen one day, and to make cupcakes with icing in a bag, so this pulls on my heartstrings. 🧁 All of these stickers are so special! Thank you very much for my happy mail and postcards! 💛

 

u/michaelpurfield: the little girl in me who thought making it in Hollywood 🌟🎬 was achievable is exceptionally giddy and excited to have a postcard showing so many amazing scenes of Hollywood! 🎥🌴 It looks like an absolute concrete jungle, but... a glitz and glam jungle! ✨🏙️🎭 I hear that New York never sleeps, but I think Los Angeles must also never close its eyes! 👀 What's a must-do for Hollywood, would you say? Aww, I really adore how you switch your pen gel depending on what you're writing – and in my favourite colours too! 🖊️🎨 I can't say I know anything about Cuba other than some stereotypical things movies would depict. 🇨🇺 Isn't Lin-Manuel Miranda of Cuban descent? 🤔 Oh, no, no, Puerto Rican! 🇵🇷 BUT, he voiced the capuchin monkey in... 'Vivo'! 🐒🎶 The monkey and old uncle were from Cuba. That's what it is! 🎺 I hope that your recent trip to Japan 🇯🇵 was amazing! 🌸🏯 Did you do a solo travel , or did you have family/friends join you? I wish you all the luck on your travels and hope that you can get a pretty stamp from every country in the world! 🌍 I'm going to have to look up Kali Uchis and Rosalía! Are you also one of those ""say stop when it's enough"", and after 3 or 4 turns of the Parmesan the waiter stops and wants to move on, then very dramatically you look them in the eyes and say ""Did I say stop?"" 🧀😂 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💚

 

u/withinus: I love a Taylor Swift postbox surprise! 📮🎶 I heard on the radio that when Taylor announced her ‘Tales Of A Showgirl’, she first released a blue/aqua and glittery orange image. 🧡 Every business with that orange was having fun with it, and I think I remember hearing the White House even flashed the colours… or something? The next day I went straight to a shop to buy an orange gel polish (I had the aqua colours already)! 💅 I’ll admit, I haven’t been feeling as confident and badass as “you should be” lately… so this will go up on my whiteboard, and hopefully every day it’ll give me a reminder. 📋 And I’m all for the pink, of course! 💖 I love finding Swifties! 🥰 Thank you very much for my postcard! 🩷

 

u/wastewhole6867: every time I look at this image of ‘Garden At Sainte-Adresse’ I find something more to admire and ponder. 🎨🌊 I love the light, clean, smooth parasols that contrast the more masculine ships, and the fumes/steam of ships in the background. ⛵💨 I also really, really, really like the types of flowers Monet chose and the colours. 🌼 You chose such a wonderful painting for me! 🖼️ Your postage stamps are so interesting! Wow, how do you manage to get so many animals so clearly onto one stamp? That’s amazing! 🌟 Reading your thoughts on Monet and Van Gogh, I think I can see what you are referring to… Monet maybe has a more “calculated” approach to his compositions and colours, while Van Gogh has a bit more “paint how I feel” – both with very distinctive styles. 🎨🌻 Did you study art or take extra art classes? 🖌️📚 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💙

 

u/serious_morning4887: such a bright and pretty postage stamp postcard! 🌈Putting a handmade postcard in a plastic sheath like this is such a good idea! Let’s see! The Hanukkah glass-train candles are so pretty. 🕎🕯️ Oooh, what are these pink fruit on the Chinese stamp… litchis? 🍒 What an adorable German sticker with little Lego people in work clothes! 👷‍♂️🧱 I can’t quite work this triangular one out, the decorative carpet/cloth one… is it Russia? 🧵🇷🇺 That’s super pretty and cool! Oh, wait, here’s another one that reminds me of a red and white playing card… it’s also from Russia! Where did you get these from? My first Russian stamps! I had to look up who Austria’s Kiki Kogelnik is, and after a quick read, I’m going to have to go do some more on her sculptures and artwork! 🖼️ The Eid greetings postage stamp is really stunning – my one bestie is Muslim, and he’ll often wish me for his holidays. I love this style, and I often see it in his wishes. What a sweet Children’s Day postage stamp from India! 🇮🇳 I think all of the colours you chose work so well together! I shall indeed also have to research these French stamps and who these gentlemen are! 🇫🇷📚 Ag, but no, you don’t understand how much I love this snowy, Christmassy sticker vibe, and the house with all the snow on it. ❄️🏠 I think it must be magical to have a season where snow covers the house and lawn. Fountain pens are really pretty! They always look so stylish and elegant to me. 🖋️ I’ve not really tried them myself. I love seeing how talented some people are and their amazing penmanship! I’m sure your fountain pen penmanship will bring smiles to everyone who reads it! 😊📝 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💚

 

CAPITOL AREA MEETUP, u/hoolu123, u/zaydia, u/sammantha345, u/SNERDBOFF, u/nyancatNOVA, u/GatsbyGalaktoboureko: I hope that you all had a wonderful RAOC meetup! 🎉📮 This image is so cool: I love the city buildings (they’re so clearly done and actually have so much detail), the old men in their wigs and hats, and your colours are also so well put together! 🏙️👒 Even the back of the card – the aesthetics carry through everywhere! 🎨🌟 The stamps look like collector stamps. The cat stamps and doggy stamp are super cute! 🐱🐶 Thank you very much for my postcard! 💌 🧡

 

u/travel4me22: I see an Easter egg and jellybeans! 🥚🍬 Oh, wait, I just read the washi tape now… it is Easter! 🐰🌸 What else is giving it away? The adorable bunny sniffing a pretty yellow flower! Awwwwwwwwwww! A pink card with a gorgeous maroon rabbit cut-out, and just such a stunning watercolour flower egg! This is gorgeous! All handmade – it’s… “egg-cellent”… hehehehehehehe… Have you considered selling your creations? 🛍️ I imagine this would be a hit with people who buy cards! 💌 I think next year you need to make an adults’ Easter egg hunt! 🔎 Thank you very much for my card! ❤️

 

u/crckey80: Spooky, spooky skele- I mean, envelope! 💀📮 Pusheen is so exceptionally adorable, and I can’t choose a favourite because they’re all amazing! 😻 Your postage stamp of the armour is stunning. 🛡️ King James II… can… it feels like eons ago, yet the 1600s weren’t THAT far back. ⏳ The craftsmanship in chainmail and armour was… I love looking at what humans achieved. 🏰 Love a man in his uniform. 👮‍♂️ The little adventurer phrog sticker is adorable! 🐸 I love, love, love your wax and washi colour choice – if I have an ombre dress made one day, I need to take these as an example. 👗🌈 Even the whale washi patches! 🐋 I’m not confident enough to bleach and dye my hair, but if I were, this would definitely be a colour palette I’d want to try. Right side up: a pretty flower pot. 🌸 Wrong way up: an artistic jellyfish! 🪼 These shades of dirty and light pink (maybe even peach?) and power blue are so pretty. I hope that you have a wonderful Easter, and that you were able to relax a bit. 🐣🌷 Did you have any luck with vacationing with your mother? Which did you choose, or are you still planning your holiday? 🌍 What an adorable frog sprout sticker! 🐸 I missed the one frog joke, but actually seeing it now… toadally terrific pun! 😂 Is this a baby ostrich sticker? He/She is absolutely adorable! The bunny is so soft and cutesy, it would be wonderful for a baby announcement (or… congratulations?) card, I think. Thank you very much for my happy mail and card! 💜

 

u/luvleehs: eeek, cute pink envelope and even cuter calligraphy! This is so sweet – from your sticker choice to your postage stamp choices. It’s giving pink girl energy! 💖 Aaaaaaaaaaaah, noooo! 😱 There’s even more strawberry pink sweetness inside! 🍓 Eeeeeek! I was at a little strawberry picking farm stall two or three weeks ago, so this feels so, yes! 🌾🍓 I still have some farm-fresh strawberries in the fridge. ❄️ Do you like strawberries? No exciting plans for the upcoming summer… I’d take it day by day. I’d like to go to a nearby coastal town: just rest there, walk on the beach, maybe do some non-serious fishing, walk with my legs in the water…. Any winter plans for you? ❄️ GOOD LUCK with your Master’s. 🎓📚 It is a trying time, but it is so worth it when you work on something you enjoy! 📝💪 Please keep me up to date on how your studies are going. 📖 And if you ever need to vent or just an ear to listen, I’m here as someone who understands postgraduate stress. 💌🤗 But I’m hoping you won’t have any of that stress! 🌸 What is your Master’s in? 🎓 Do you get to wear the hats at your graduation ceremonies? 🎩 We’re only allowed them when we get a PhD. Oooh, a little tea bag! 🍵 This makes me so excited! Peach green… it sounds like a brilliant summer morning tea: light and energetic! 🌿☀️ Thank you, I’m so excited to try the tea! 🍑 These little stickers are super cutesy, and they all carry joy. How cute is it when a teddy bear gets dressed up as another animal? 🐻 This is… I’m trying to think of how to describe the genre… I don’t know, but it’s bright, soft, and cutesy! The trio of washis are also very pretty. I love your choice of a cherry to go with the pink and strawberries of the card. 🍒 The pink tulips are… oh, my heart. And then this purple and blue flower one! I’m not confident enough to bleach and dye my hair, but if I were, this would definitely be a colour palette I’d want to try. Thank you very much for my happy mail and card! 💜

 

u/kittycatcon: EEVEE washi tape / postage stickers! Where did you get this? It’s absolutely amazing! 😍 I’m laughing at the Slowpoke washi tape… I always joke to my dad that he’s a Slowpoke. My mother has joined the joke. It takes this man 4 hours for something that can be done in 20 minutes – he’s a perfectionist. ⏱️ My Charizard! 🔥 That’s my boy! My mother loves Pikachu, so I know she’ll geek out over this envelope. ⚡ Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww, gurl! 🥰 I think you’re right – fire-types seem to attract me. 🔥 But, c’mon, just look at this little Charmander’s face: how could you not love this little cutie patootie spicy fire lizard? 🐲 Charmander is just… he’s adorable! 🧡 He’s tenacious and fiercely loyal. 🐉 Bulbasaur is the emotionally intelligent one, I think! 🌱 He has so much compassion! 💚 Do you think that would be a good way to describe him? And would you say you are similar to Bulbasaur? 🌿 I love that you have a Bulbasaur Pokémon pen! ✏️ I’m absolutely hit with a blast from the past seeing these three Pokémon cards! 🃏 I wish we never sold mine…. 😢 I’m also a huge Growlithe fan, so there’s another fire type! 🔥 Uxie has a power I definitely like! ✨ Diancie looks like… a pink/purple diamond goth! Thank you very much for my happy mail and card! 🧡

u/MoonChica: I just want to cuddle this bunny! 🐇 Your little heart stamps are so cute – they have a lipstick stain texture! 💄 What a stunning card – the slightly dark/dirty/old… hmm… overall colour? 🎨 It looks/feels like when I read “Moon Chica”. 🌙 Aww, and your mushroom stickers also match the card! 🍄 May I kidnap your handwriting for my name? ✍️ Thank you very much for my card! 🩶

 

u/SnooHabits2586: every day is a good day when someone sends you happy mail decorated with frog stickers! 🐸 Look how fancy they look in their bowties! 🎀 What a stunning bee image – the gold foil highlights with the little flying wonder so elegant! 🐝 This would be amazing for wedding invites for beekeepers. May I just say, this purple pen you’ve used is fantastic! 🖊️ All my purple pens bleed. I’ve tried so many, but nothing works (and I often need to buy a pack just to get the purple). Which brand pen is this? What is your favourite thing(s) to bake? 🍰 I’m sorry to hear about your chronic pain… we can meet up to exchange anti-inflammatory meds! 🤣 This past winter was quite cold, and my joints were taking strain. ❄️ Please look after your joints as you go into your winter – keep your handshoes and hot water bottles or beanbag nearby. 🧤 Are you on any sort of treatment? Wow! 10+ generations on the same island is crazy cool! 🌴 Your ancestors must have had quite an influence on the community and physical shaping of the town! 🏘️ It sounds like you can easily arrange family reunions… everyone is on the island! I’m so sorry that your early childhood education dreams couldn’t take flight… I think it’s ridiculous that governments treat their teachers so poorly. 😡 Teachers need to use their own private funds to help students. Ugh. I had an interview earlier this year to help with special needs children (my heart was so happy), but after the interview, they told me the salary. After tax (which was already low because it’s a government school), I’d be earning less than minimum wage. After I sorted my petrol out, I’d have no money. 😔 I hate that because the government (and this seems to be a worldwide problem) treats educators like dirt. And in the end, it’s the children missing out on educators who could make a huge positive impact on their lives at an important early stage of development. I can’t imagine how scary it must be to be a teacher in the USA nowadays, with all the gun attacks. You need danger pay! I hope that working for the family business will bring wonderful opportunities that you couldn’t even imagine! Thank you very much for my card!   💛 (P.S: it looks like there was a “b” burnt out on your envelope? 🔥 Was that… you? Or did someone try to set our mail alight?)

 

u/rhythmstix: how do you print directly on an envelope? That’s so cool! I adore your postage stamp of the golden coin. 🪙 What does the coin mean – I see a cross and writing, so I’m thinking maybe referencing some Saint, and can be used as a talisman? ✝️ The mandala sticker is soooo pretty!🌀 Aaaaah, wooow! Your self-designed postcard is really so, so pretty! 🖼️ How do you get the shiny plastic feeling? 🌟 You guys are so creative! It’s a bit dark now, so I used my camera light to light up the postcard (I’m just in a bad light contrast area). 💡 Guuurl, do you know how cool the sunset neons look with light directly shining onto it? 🌅 For funsies, I did it from the back too, and it’s equally as fun and interesting! Maybe that’s something you can specifically aim for in some of your designs? Light play. I love that your town is so laid back. 🏘️ Mind you, if I had this view every day… fresh bread delivery? 🥖 That sounds great! I think limiting food delivery is worth it if the trade-off is walking 5 minutes to be able to walk on beach sand and take a dip in a wonderful river/ocean! 🏖️🏊‍♀️ Your gnome on a flamingo floaty makes me want a giant pink flamingo chair! 🦩 Thank you for all the lovely personalised stickers – the coconut drink and honey give me summer swimming pool vibes! The mandala whale is so pretty. 🐋 I love all your Disney choices! These black rose outlines are also stunning. 🌹 Thank you very much for my happy mail and postcard! 🩷

 

u/dlnll (x2): Potudniowa Afryka! 🌍 This is so fun to learn! Your washi is super nice – I like the circles/hoops. Almost like bubblegum Fruit Loops! Oooh, hehe, I wonder if these guys are getting ready to race the fancy car? 🏎️ What is it? My dad says it reminds him of an older Datsun race car. I think cars are awesome, but can’t identify them to save my life. 😅 I absolutely love the postcard of Le Mans! 🏁 I watched a documentary with my parents a few weeks ago, and it was a countdown of worst race car accidents – anything from F1, Le Mans, Indy500. Number 1 was the 1955 crash, because driver and spectators were hurt and passed away. I’m a bit… hmm… so, Mike Hawthorn (Jaguar) and Pierre Levegh (Mercedes-Benz). Hawthorn drove into Levegh. But it looks very weird because there was no need for that movement (even with split-second decisions). Levegh died, Merc withdrew their other drivers from the race to support/honour Levegh. But Jaguar let their people continue, and they won. I understand continuing the race in general because evacuating would cause mass panic and perhaps even more death. And… this show now didn’t deliver commentary on the ethics of… “I make a really stupid move, which resulted in people’s death, but I’m just going to continue to drive and win.” 😕 I don’t know how I feel about that? Do you have any insight about that incident? I’d love to catch a Le Mans race. 24 hours? ⏱️ Those guys are ki ki ka krr krrr athletes! 😅 This image, the car lights, the water droplets, the darker weather… I love it so much. 🌧️ The gritty image also gives it so much character! To clarify: Kiev is the Russian Киев and Kyiv is Ukrainian Київ? Honestly, I think our news networks go between the two spellings. I have no idea how it’s called in Afrikaans. I’ll pay attention now and let you know! The obelisk is magnificent, and that star is so simple, yet iconic. ⭐️ It looks so… clean. I know that must sound strange, but… everything in the photo looks clean and cared for? Aaah! Wait, there are little street trains/trams? 🚋 That’s so cool! Are they still working? 1990 was just the other day. ⏳ It’s sad that we as humans haven’t learnt that no one wins in a war. Everyone is hurt in some way. 💔 Well, I think our experience with war is quite different. Drug wars, gang wars, illegal arms wars, government stealing and deceiving the people, there are definitely racial things going on but we’re generally quick to call that out. The ever-present war on women and children, human trafficking is being highlighted the last year or two… but we aren’t fearing for our lives that a bomb will be dropped on us at any second. ⚠️ The only city sirens that I know are warning sirens for if there’s a leak at the nuclear station, not for incoming air raids. When I hear an aircraft, I’m running outside to see what it is, not running to a bunker for protection. 🛫 I’m not writing letters to men in my life being forced to go to war. So, no… I don’t think my generation and younger (perhaps even one or two older than me) can actually understand what Ukraine is going through, as well as their neighbours and even Russia. For what it is worth – we hope it will end soon. 🙏 I hope that peace will soon be restored, and that the airport in Donetsk will be rebuilt, and that you will have the opportunity to fly that air corridor safely again. ✈️ Thank you for the extra empty postcard – I think this white flower against the peachy background would make an awesome image in a frame! 🌸🖼️ Eek, and these surprise cards! I love that: “I don’t have to talk about it. I can just be it.” – I think that can go for many traits… 💌 These cards are so pretty – love the art style! 🎨 Thank you very much for my happy mail and postcards! 🤍

 

u/chibi_haiku: what a decorative collage on the back of the envelope! The cats on the washi tape are so silly and cute! I opened your envelope and had to react so fast to grab everything falling out! 🤭 I have this kitty cat sticky note set! You have SUCH good taste! 😉 All the cats and all the matcha! Mmmmm, now I feel like a cold matcha frappe! 🍵 This white cat ringing the little flower is soooo cute! She's a little lady! Why are jellyfish so pretty but deadly? At least I can touch and admire this washi without getting stung. Thank you so much for your very sweet birthday wishes! 🎉 It's good to hear that strangers are enjoying their 30s – it's maybe not as, hmm, unnerving as before. My parents and I chilled at home, and we watched the tennis final! 🎾 It was nothing huge or even… well, ja. But you know what? I enjoyed just being home. It was quiet, chilled, and… ja. It felt ""me"". Can I tell you a little silly secret? For all of their birthdays, I’ve made handmade cards – even if it was just a few words, I created a little something special to commemorate their big day. Besides my parents, none of my friends or family gave me a little card. I know it’s silly, but… (sighs). In this massive pile of happy mail I’m working through, I’m finding wonderful, special treasures of cards wishing me for my 30th. I can’t ever explain to you guys what seeing your cards does to my heart. 🎂💖 I can't wait to find a way to use all of these pretty paper notes! And I absolutely love the sparkly mint card colour! Did you draw the hearts yourself? They are literally perfect. Thank you very much for my happy mail and card! 💚

 

u/Knightinthesky: I don't know if this is a thing or not… but there's a sticker on your envelope saying ""missent to Korea""? 😮😁😅 Your post took a huge detour if so! These hummingbird postage stamps are so pretty! 🐦 They are such amazing little creatures… I'm always fascinated by seeing their movement in slow motion. Such a pretty photo of a tree with snow on its leaves…. ❄️🌿 It's like a greyscale, but with slight green and brown tints? I didn't know there was a preferred sort of snowman snow! ☃️ I know about sleet, which is very watery, and then an ice sort of snow, and then I just thought snow is snow. But no? That's SO COOL! I hope that you'll have good snowfall again soon, a gentle kind that's good for building snowmen and making snow angels! 👼 Sweet dark cocoa is amazing! 🍫 This little Peanuts calendar entry is so cute! The characters have a very special place in my heart. Ag, I miss seeing these cartoons in the newspapers! They were my favourite part of grabbing newspapers. Thank you very much for my card! 💚

 

u/t3ctim: another adorable possum postage stamp! 🐾 I don't like rats, mice or hamsters (I've been bitten), but oh my word, some rodents are adorable! Wait… is a possum a rodent? No. Aunty Google says they're marsupials. 🧐 The same as wombats. No, okay, that makes sense, especially connecting them to Australia! I think I'm okay with marsupials! Hallstatt looks so pretty… this photo reminds me a bit of 'Frozen' in Arendelle. ❄️🏔️ Maybe not as icy and snowy, but still. I wouldn't be able to withstand grabbing snow and throwing it at someone! Or throwing snowballs into the lake! Just look at the snow on the roofs – it's so idyllic and pretty! Can you imagine living right next to the river/lake like that: you open your front door and see the mountain and clouds reflected in the water? 🌄 I've heard of various towns and cities limiting their tourists for the day to help preserve the area and local communities. It must be frustrating for hundreds of tourists to overrun an area like this. I guess for major cities like New York, London, Johannesburg, Sydney, and such, tourism is good, but the people living there also know that there are many, many tourists? In a smaller, historical place… hmm… Tourism is great for business, but we need to look after our people and places too. Or at least I think so. I'm sorry that the locals seemed rude though – that's never a nice experience. 😔 Did you visit any of the salt mines? Did you climb any of those lovely snowy mountains? 🏔️ Your little sticker of the river, in a purplish sunrise or sunset, is also so, so pretty. Physics is so amazing. I love seeing sunrise and sunset colours all around the world! 🌅 Thank you very much for my postcard! 🩵

 

u/Powerful_Cobbler_215: moth wing scales? 🦋 I've never looked so closely at moth wings before! This is exceptionally interesting and beautiful! I watched a documentary the other day, featuring David Attenborough, and it was about how animals see colour. There was a segment about bees, butterflies and moths. 🐝 If we think they are beautiful how we see them naturally, then we need to look at them with UV and/or polarised goggles – there is so, so much more to discover! This postage stamp reminds me of that. Awwwwww, look at this baby monkey face! 🐵 Absolutely adorable! Please give Toffee and Soufflé ear scratches and head pats from me! Their little kitty noses are so boop-able! 😽 Thank you very much for my card! 💚",6,1759159211.0,RandomActsofCards,26,1.0,False

Similar to earlier post, with a new caveat, full time RV life.","So, I saw the post earlier about a person rejecting remote work position because they cant work everywhere they want to, which I understand their frustration. A lot of the comments made good sense, of course a fintech company doesnt want you working on a local coffee shop wifi or surrounded by strange people as you work. I have a similar situation that companies seem to not like and want to hear your perspectives, because I dont really see how my situation would cause any issues, but companies seem to avoid my situation.

I live and work full time in an RV. I have worked for and interviewed with companies that do not like the idea of their employee RVing, but I dont really understand the issue and was never presented with reasons why it is an issue, just no.

First, I have three types of secured internet. I have starlink and two mobile carriers for internet and have never not been able to get on internet or access a VPN. It is secure and fast, same as your home internet.

We only move during the weekends, we stay in one spot for at least a week, sometimes a month.  It is never an issue that we travel, just like if you worked at home and took a weekend road trip.

We have a permanent domicile location for tax purposes. The companies I have worked for are national companies with remote workers all over the country already, and there is no constant location changes HR needs to record or anything as I have a domicile location for tax purposes. My taxation is the same whether I am on the road or at home base all year.

I actually have a really nice home office set up. I ripped out the dinette and added a desk set up that I think is nicer than when I lived in house before. Obviously not as big but I have it very well organized and everything is in arms reach. I have all the tech I need to complete all functions of my job. Private, secure, home office with no distractions or lurkers.

To be clear, I have been working out of this setup for almost four years now. Never had a single issue. No connection issues, no issues with environment, no issues at all, no tax issues, nothing. I dont understand why a national firm with employees all over the country would have any issue with this type of situation, but some do and some companies I am interviewing with say they do not approve, again with no logical reason other than they dont like the idea of it.  I am sure the execs of these companies work in one location all year long, right? Can anyone shed light on what I might be missing as to how this actually has any effect on my employment or ability to work with a national company? Otherwise, it just seems like a dumb rule for the overlords to control another aspect of our life.

I absolutely love my situation also, I have been able to see so much of this country that I would have otherwise never seen. Flying place to place, you miss a lot of beautiful parts of this country in between. I have stayed in 11 states this year alone and visit so many national and state parks, so much hiking and mountain biking, lakes, rivers, oceans, wildlife, so many different places to visit and sights to see. I make a good living, do great work, and get to travel and explore and see new parts of the country. It is frustrating that remote work means work in a single home in this single subdivision all year long, when my home office is able to travel. Starting to work on setting up my own firm so I have the freedom to do as I please.  Thoughts?

  
Edit: To clear this up a bit, not all companies are against this, which is why I do not understand why it is an issue with other companies. There are a lot of working nomads in the United States. Plenty of people are working in the situation I am describing for national companies. My wife also works remote when we travel and her company has no issue with us moving around because they have employees all over the country already For the comments about taxes, why would my wifes company and some companies be perfectly okay with the idea of rving, when other companies with the same national footprint and size may not accept it. From what I gather, we have temporary presence in any state we are working remote and dont meet the thresholds or requirements to pay taxes in another state. Another example, plenty of companies I have worked for are okay with me travelling back to my moms house and working in a different state over the holidays, I am never required to pay taxes there. And, I get a company can choose their policies, it just seems strange to me to limit remote workers in this way. ",0,1759158699.0,remotework,8,0.5,False

1ntkkdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ntkkdd/dibble_and_the_galactic_matcha_conspiracy/,Dibble and the Galactic Matcha Conspiracy,"The Xylos ambassador died holding a tin of tea.

That's what got me on the shuttle to Uji. Not the diplomatic incident, though Earth's State Department was having collective heart failure about that. Not the potential interstellar war, though the brass kept using words like ""crisis"" and ""flashpoint"" in very serious voices.

No, I took the case because of the tin.

See, Ambassador Kree'lax was worth approximately 47 billion credits by human standards. He had diplomatic immunity on six worlds, a personal security detail of Centaurian shock troops, and access to matter replicators that could synthesize anything from antimatter to zabaglione.

And he died clutching a beat-up metal tin of *tea leaves*.

1. **Victim:** Kree'lax, Xylos Collective Ambassador to 
2. Earth **Location:** Ceremonial teahouse, Uji, Japan 
3. **Time of Death:** 0347 local time 
4. **Cause:** Acute systemic poisoning 
5. **Oddity:** The poison was the tea

The crime scene was a mess of jurisdictions. Japanese police, Interpol, Galactic Security Council observers, and approximately forty-seven journalists all standing in the rain outside a 400-year-old wooden building that looked like a strong breeze would knock it over.

Inspector Yamamoto met me at the perimeter. She looked like she hadn't slept in three days, which meant she'd been awake for maybe thirty hours. Humans are bad at estimating these things.

""Detective Dibble."" She didn't bow, which I appreciated. ""You're here because...?""

""Because I'm expendable if this goes wrong, and surprisingly competent if it doesn't."" I ducked under the holographic barrier tape. ""Also, I work cheap.""

""The galactic observers are insisting on a non-human investigator—""

""Then they can investigate."" I stopped at the threshold, pulled out my notebook. The real kind, paper and everything. ""But they won't find what I find.""

""Why not?""

""Because they'll be looking for alien logic."" I stepped inside. ""I'm looking for human stupidity.""

The teahouse was beautiful in that way old things are, worn smooth by centuries of use, smelling of wood and incense and something green I couldn't place. Matcha, probably. The stuff was everywhere.

Kree'lax's body was in the center of the room, three eye-stalks frozen mid-swivel. His carapace had turned a mottled gray-green. Next to him: one overturned ceramic bowl, one bamboo whisk, and the tin.

I photographed everything with my ancient smartphone while the forensics team, a mix of human and Quillian xenoanalysts worked around me.

""The poison?"" I asked the lead examiner, a Quillian named Dr. Shisk whose compound eyes were better at detail work than any human microscope.

""Not poison,"" Shisk chittered, mandibles clicking in what I'd learned meant confusion. ""The matcha itself. Molecular analysis shows authentic *Camellia sinensis*, stone-ground, no adulterants. It *should* be safe.""

""But it killed him.""

""It killed him.""

I picked up the tin with gloved hands. Plain metal, no labels, scratched to hell. Someone had used this a lot. Inside: green powder, fine as dust, smelling like fresh-cut grass and something else. Something ceremonial.

On the bottom of the tin, barely visible: a date stamp. Lunar calendar.

I pulled out my phone, checked the calendar. ""This matcha was ground three weeks ago. Full moon cycle.""

""Correct,"" Shisk confirmed. ""Standard ceremonial preparation.""

""So what killed him?""

""That,"" Shisk said slowly, ""is the impossibility.""

I found Master Tanaka in the monastery up the hill. He was approximately 900 years old or looked it and moved like water flowing uphill. He'd been the one to prepare matcha for Kree'lax for the past six months, ever since the Xylos first made contact.

""The ambassador was a good student,"" Tanaka said through a translator app. We sat in a garden where monks were grinding tea the old way: stone wheels, turned by hand, no electricity. ""He understood that ritual matters.""

""Did he understand *why* it matters?""

Tanaka smiled. ""Do you?""

""Humor me. Pretend I'm an idiot.""

""You grind tea by moonlight,"" he said, gesturing to the wheels, ""because the temperature is correct. The humidity. The ambient energy."" He paused. ""We do not believe in magic, Detective. But we believe in *attention*. When you do something correctly, with focus, with care... the result is different.""

""Different how?""

""It *means* something.""

I wrote that down. Attention. Meaning. Intent.

""Could someone fake it?"" I asked. ""The ritual?""

""Many have tried."" Tanaka's smile faded. ""The Xylos can taste the difference.""

""What happens when they drink fake matcha?""

""They become ill. Violently so."" He met my eyes. ""We discovered this two months ago when a Chinese supplier attempted to sell 'authentic' Uji matcha. Three Xylos were hospitalized.""

I flipped back through my notes. ""Hospitalized. Not dead.""

""Not dead,"" Tanaka confirmed.

""So why is my ambassador dead from *real* matcha?""

Tanaka stood, gestured for me to follow. We walked to a locked storage room where he kept his ceremonial supplies. He unlocked it with an actual key. No biometrics, no quantum encryption, just old brass and older wood.

Inside: fifty tins, identical to the one at the crime scene.

""I prepare matcha for seven Xylos diplomats,"" Tanaka explained. ""Each has their own tin. Each tin is marked with their name in our writing.""

He pointed to the tins. I saw the characters, elegant brushstrokes that meant nothing to me.

""Can you show me Kree'lax's tin?""

Tanaka walked to a specific shelf, and reached out.

And stopped.

""It's gone.""

**What was stolen:** One tin of ceremonial matcha, prepared for Ambassador Kree'lax **When:** Between 2100-2300, night before the murder **How:** Unknown. No forced entry. No surveillance footage. Building security shows no anomalies. **Who:** Unknown **Why:** That's the question, isn't it?

I did what any good detective does when the case makes no sense: I went looking for memes.

The Tokyo internet café was exactly the cyberpunk cliché you'd expect—neon, cramped, smelling of instant ramen and desperation. I paid for two hours and started searching.

\#AlienLattes had 2.7 billion posts. Most were jokes, but buried in there: market analysis. Trade routes. Smuggling operations hidden in plain sight because everyone assumed it was just kids being weird online.

I found a thread from three weeks ago: ""Xylos will pay 10K credits for authentic Uji matcha, no questions asked.""

I found another: ""Dubai chocolate black market, Persian Gulf route, dolphins can't detect the new packages.""

I found a third: ""My barista training just got classified. I'm not even joking. They gave me a security clearance to make *coffee*.""

The world had gone insane, and I'd missed it because I don't follow trends.

I dug deeper. Found a data analyst in Lagos who'd been tracking Xylos commodity purchasing. She went by ChocolateOracle online, real name Dr. Aisha Okonkwo.

I called her.

""Detective Dibble,"" she answered immediately, no preamble. ""I've been waiting for someone to call about this for three months.""

""About what?""

""About the fact that the Xylos aren't buying matcha as a luxury good."" Her voice was tight, excited. ""They're stockpiling it like a strategic resource. I've tracked 47 million tons moving through shell corporations in the past six months. That's not consumption, Detective. That's preparation.""

""For what?""

""I don't know. But I have a theory."" She sent me a file. ""Can you get me Xylos blood samples? Real ones, not the sanitized medical exchange data?""

""Probably not legally.""

""Then illegally. Because if I'm right about what's in their bloodstream, your murder isn't about tea, Detective.""

She paused.

""It's about terraforming.""

I stood in the teahouse at 3 AM, alone except for the crime scene tape and the ghost of a dead alien who'd died drinking tea.

The pieces weren't fitting. Stolen tin. Real matcha. Lunar calendar matching. Everything *correct*, but the ambassador still died.

I closed my eyes. Thought like a human.

Tanaka said attention matters. Intent. That when you do something with focus, the result changes. The Xylos could *taste* that change, no, not taste. They could *sense* it. Their tri-lobed brains processed ritual as something chemical, real, measurable.

So what happens when the ritual is perfect, but the *intent* is wrong?

I opened my eyes. Pulled out my phone. Called Yamamoto.

""I need to know who had access to Tanaka's monastery two nights ago.""

""Everyone. It's a public temple.""

""Who had access to the *storage room*?""

Silence. Then: ""Three people. Tanaka himself, his assistant, and..."" She paused. ""A new student who joined last month. Chinese national. Applied to learn ceremonial preparation.""

""Name?""

""Chen Wei. But Detective, he's been vetted—""

""Vet him again. And get me his background. Specifically his employment history.""

Ten minutes later, she called back.

""He worked for a Shenzhen biotech firm. They were... oh.""

""Let me guess. Trying to synthesize Xylos-grade matcha?""

""How did you know?""

""Because,"" I said, staring at the tin in the evidence bag, ""someone just proved they could make matcha that's molecularly perfect, ritually perfect, and absolutely lethal. They didn't steal Kree'lax's tin to drink the tea.""

""They stole it to replace it.""

Chen Wei was gone by the time we reached his apartment. But he'd left his workspace intact. Either arrogance or haste, I couldn't tell which.

What we found: a small lab setup, molecular scanners, and forty-seven tins of matcha, each labeled with a different Xylos diplomat's name.

And a notebook. Handwritten. In Mandarin.

Yamamoto translated while forensics bagged evidence.

""'The Xylos respond to ritual intention as a psychoactive compound,'"" she read. ""'By replicating the molecular structure while introducing inverted ceremonial markers. Grinding counter-clockwise, preparing under a new moon. We can create a product that appears authentic but triggers systemic rejection.'""

""He weaponized the ritual,"" I said.

""But why?"" Yamamoto looked up from the notebook. ""Why kill Kree'lax specifically?""

I picked up one of the tins. Felt its weight. ""He wasn't trying to kill anyone. He was testing a product.""

""I don't understand.""

""The Chinese government has been trying to break Japan's matcha monopoly for months. They can't match the quality because they can't replicate the intent. So they tried something else."" I set the tin down carefully. ""They tried to create counterfeit matcha that would *fail* dramatically enough to discredit the entire ritual concept. Prove that Xylos don't actually need Japanese tea they just *think* they do.""

""That's insane.""

""That's geopolitics."" I turned to face her. ""Chen wasn't an assassin. He was a saboteur. And Kree'lax died because someone in Beijing got desperate enough to turn tea ceremonies into weapons.""

Dr. Okonkwo's blood analysis came back three days later.

I was right. She was *more* right.

The spores in Xylos bloodstreams weren't parasites. They were seeds. Every matcha latte consumed planted microscopic ecosystem markers that would activate in the Xylos homeworld's atmosphere. Within a generation, their planet would transform. Not destroyed, but *cultivated*. Turned into something that could sustain the rituals they'd learned from Earth.

The Xylos weren't addicted to matcha.

They were *farming* it. Preparing their dying world to become a place where intention and attention and ridiculous human ceremonies could take root and grow.

And someone had tried to poison that future.

1. **Perpetrator:** Chen Wei (arrested in Hong Kong, extradited) 
2. **Charge:** Diplomatic murder, bioweapon development, really aggressive industrial espionage 
3. **Motive:** Chinese economic/political pressure to break Japanese matcha monopoly 
4. **Method:** Counterfeit ritual matcha designed to mimic authentic preparation while inverting ceremonial intent 
5. **Outcome:** Chen Wei convicted. The Chinese government denied everything. Japan tightened export controls. The Xylos requested human oversight of all matcha production.
6. **Unexpected consequence:** The whole mess became public knowledge, which led directly to The Matcha Accords. A treaty I'm still not convinced isn't humanity's weirdest achievement.

Six months later, I sat in the orbital café. Yes, we have those now and watched a young Xylos practice latte art under patient human instruction.

""You're thinking too hard,"" the barista said. ""Just feel the pour.""

""Feeling is inefficient.""

""Feeling is the point.""

The kid tried again. Made something that looked like a drunk spider. The barista high-fived him anyway.

Ambassador Kree'lax's successor, Vree'lax, sat down across from me without asking. She'd requested this meeting through official channels, which meant I couldn't refuse without causing an incident.

""Detective Dibble."" Her eye-stalks focused with uncomfortable intensity. ""You solved the death of my predecessor.""

""That's my job.""

""You also uncovered why we came to Earth.""

""That was an accident.""

""Was it?"" She slid a data pad across the table. ""Your species is chaos. Inefficient. Superstitious. You grind tea by moonlight because someone decided it mattered, and somehow that makes it real.""

I glanced at the pad. It showed Xylos biomarkers changing over time. Cultural drift. Cognitive flexibility increasing. They were becoming less like machines and more like... us.

""You're learning to be inefficient,"" I said slowly.

""We're learning to *care* about inefficiency. To see value in ritual, in attention, in doing things the hard way because the hard way *means* something."" Her eye-stalks dimmed, which I'd learned meant something like sadness. ""My predecessor died because someone wanted to prove that meaning doesn't matter. That our response to your rituals was just biochemistry.""

""It is biochemistry.""

""But it's also more."" She tapped the pad. ""Every Xylos who drinks your tea, who learns your ceremonies, who argues about water temperature and foam density... they're becoming something new. Not genetically. *Culturally*. We're remembering how to want impossible things.""

I sipped my coffee. Regular, black, no ceremony required. ""That's what humans do best. Want impossible things stubbornly enough that they become real.""

""Yes."" She stood to leave, then paused. ""The Chinese agent, Chen Wei. His counterfeit matcha was molecularly perfect. The ritual was technically correct. But it lacked one thing.""

""What's that?""

""He didn't care if it worked. He only cared that it failed."" Her eye-stalks swiveled to the Xylos kid still murdering foam art across the café. ""That child will never make perfect lattes. But every attempt matters to him. And that Detective is what we came here to learn.""

She left.

I sat there, watching humans teach aliens to care about foam, and realized something:

The galaxy thought humanity's greatest export was technology. Turned out it was *giving a damn*.

Figured.

**CASE FILE: CLOSED**

**Final Notes:**

* The Matcha Accords established human oversight of ceremonial matcha production
* Starbucks is now a diplomatic entity (I don't understand it either)
* 47 species have requested ""cultural beverage exchange programs""
* Baristas require security clearances
* The foam cannons are apparently real and I'm not allowed to test one

**Personal Assessment:** We solved a murder and accidentally taught the galaxy that inefficiency has value. Not sure if that's good or terrifying. Probably both.

The Xylos homeworld's terraforming is proceeding on schedule. Early reports suggest it's growing something that looks like tea plants but smells like hope and stubborn human nonsense.

Master Tanaka visited the orbital café last week. Watched the chaos of twenty species learning to foam milk. Said: ""This is what ritual looks like when it spreads.""

I asked if that was good.

He smiled. ""The universe is learning to pay attention. That is always good.""

I'm not convinced. But I'm also standing in a space station café watching aliens argue about water temperature, so what do I know?

Case closed.

But the *really* weird part is that I think we accidentally saved a civilization by teaching them that doing things the stupid, slow, careful way *matters*.

Humans are good at that.

We're good at making impossible things real through sheer stubborn belief that they should be.

And apparently, that's enough to change the galaxy.

One ridiculous latte at a time.

I've lost 28 lbs between March and today (yay!) and I'm less than 3 lbs from my goal weight of 130 lbs (5'2, 36F). I have gotten really good at managing my hunger on my 1300 calories (but I also eat back exercise calories, so I'm usually closer to 1500) while still working out 4-5 days a week. I have worked in cocktails, pizza, mac and cheese, tacos, you name it, while still being in a deficit because of my relatively low calorie/high protein breakfast and lunch choices.

As I approach my goal weight, I've made the decision to up my calories so that I can run better and gain more muscle during my strength training. I've moved to 1500 calories + exercise calories, which has afforded me a little freedom when it comes to come things that I cut out cold turkey back in March. One of these things is a cafe mocha from my local coffee shops, which I used to work at all the time. But I ordered one today (with skim milk!) and I am struggling to enjoy it. Especially since today is a rest day for me after a long hike yesterday. 

Will I continue to struggle with this? I'm not worried about slipping into binging or anything, but I can't even enjoy a simple coffee anymore without feeling like I'm cheating?",2,1759158296.0,loseit,4,1.0,False
1ntkg6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NelsonTalk/comments/1ntkg6e/affiliate_marketing_content_creation_a_beginners/,Affiliate Marketing & Content Creation: A Beginner’s Guide,"[Affiliate marketing](https://www.nelsontalk.com/category/affiliate-marketing) is a performance-based marketing strategy where a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate's own marketing efforts. Essentially, you promote a product or service on your platform, and in return, you earn a commission for every sale or lead generated through your unique affiliate link.

This partnership benefits both parties: the business gains increased exposure and sales, while the affiliate earns passive income by leveraging their online presence and audience influence. The key is building trust and providing value to your audience, ensuring that your recommendations are relevant and beneficial.

# The Role of Content Creation in Affiliate Marketing

While it might be tempting to jump straight into promoting products, [creating valuable content](https://www.nelsontalk.com/crafting-gold-value-driven-content) is often essential for **long-term success** in affiliate marketing. Content builds trust, establishes authority, and drives organic traffic to your affiliate links. High-quality content helps you:

* **Attract your target audience:** Solve their problems and answer their questions.
* **Build trust and credibility:** Become a trusted source of information.
* **Improve SEO rankings:** Drive organic traffic to your site.
* **Increase conversions:** Provide context and persuasion for purchases.

# Types of Content Used in Affiliate Marketing

The type of content you create will depend on your niche, target audience, and the products you are promoting. Here are some popular and effective content formats:

* **Blog Posts:** In-depth articles, reviews, tutorials, and comparison guides related to the products you promote. For example, 'Top 5 Coffee Machines for Home Baristas' or 'How to Choose the Right Laptop for Gaming'.
* **Reviews:** Detailed product [reviews](https://www.nelsontalk.com/category/reviews) that highlight the pros, cons, and features of specific products. Use examples and visuals to provide value.
* **Tutorials and How-To Guides:** Step-by-step guides that teach your audience how to use a product or achieve a specific outcome. These are great for complex products that require instructions.
* **Videos:** Engaging video content such as product demos, unboxing videos, and educational tutorials on platforms like YouTube or TikTok.
* **Social Media Content:** Short, engaging posts, stories, and reels on social media platforms that drive traffic to your affiliate links or longer-form content.
* **Email Marketing:** Nurturing your email list with valuable content and personalized product recommendations.

# Alternatives to Extensive Content Creation

While content creation is highly beneficial, there *are* alternative approaches to affiliate marketing that require less direct content output:

* **Paid Advertising:** Using platforms like Google Ads or social media ads to drive traffic directly to affiliate links. This requires a budget and careful targeting.
* **Social Media Influencing:** Partnering with established influencers who already have a large and engaged audience. You provide them with affiliate links or promo codes to share.
* **Email Marketing (with purchased lists):** This is generally **not recommended** due to ethical and legal concerns. Building your own organic email list is always the better option.
* **Coupon Websites:** Listing affiliate links alongside coupon codes. This is highly competitive and usually involves lower commission rates.

**Important Note:** Even with these alternatives, some form of persuasive copy or outreach is *always* needed. Paid ads require compelling ad copy, influencer collaborations require effective communication, and coupon websites require at least basic descriptions.

# Conclusion

While it's *possible* to pursue affiliate marketing without extensive original content creation, it's generally **not recommended** for sustainable, long-term success. Content is essential for building trust, attracting organic traffic, and ultimately, driving conversions. Even alternative strategies rely on persuasive communication and some form of content presentation. By investing in high-quality content, you'll create a valuable asset that will generate passive income for years to come.

I've been in retail/ customer service jobs for the past 6 years. Currently on year two of being a shift manager at a popular coffee chain and I. HATE. IT!

The customers at my current job are some of the most entitled people I've ever encountered. I've been ready to leave retail for the last couple of years but I've never found a solid way out. I initially wanted to use my jobs college tuition benefit to attend Arizona State University online, but I feel as though college is a waste when you don't even have an idea of what you want to pursue. I change my mind constantly, and what I want from life changes depending on the day or my mood.

I could suck it up and stay with this job just to attend college but the other issue is that I'm only making just enough money to cover my bills and have little to nothing left over to save or to spend. I feel like I'm not getting anything out of this job besides being overworked, underappreciated, & underpaid. 

I was able to make up some college credits through a separate program my job offers and finished with an overall 4.0 GPA. I can use these credits anywhere, but to actually transfer this into college credits, they charge $400, which I won't ever have unless I hit the lottery. 

Right now, I just want and desperately need financial stability, but I also want to be smart and work towards a better future. 
Up until now, I haven't even began considering a career but I don't have an option anymore. I had a very rough childhood and never even got the opportunity to ponder as to who or what I wanted to be. I don't know what's important to me or what kind of career I want. With the current state of this country, it feels impossible to do anything but wait. I'm sick of waiting. I just feel so stuck.

Facts of 40k - All the fine(?!) things in life AKA Alcohol and Drugs,"Consider this a more fun post on what humanity in the grim darkness of the far future imbibes to get shitfaced. Given the setting, lots of reasons to be.

Today, we will cover the more common drugs and alcoholic drinks you'd encounter in the galaxy as a human. Obtainable virtually everywhere, sometimes legally, sometimes by the sorts the Kasballica are, and sometimes from sources that'll get you executed for heresy.

We'll start with the hard stuff first.

**Warp Drugs** (yes, this is significant enough to be a category on it's own) -

* **Spook** \- Comes from the hive world of Necromunda. Made from corpse starch and fungi. Highly illegal, highly dangerous, highly demanded. Basically, imbibing this increases your connection to the Warp. At best, it'll give you temporary psychic powers, boost existing pyschic powers and grant warpsight. At worst, it'll invite Daemons to throw a party or turn you into a Warp gribbly thingy. Sensation described as massively trippy - the difference being that what you see in your trip can actualy manifest. Highly addictive.
* **Flect** \- Similar to Spook, but mixed in with ground-up and crushed glass and mirrors which have been infused with Warp energy for years or decades, which allows it to re*flect* the Warp (hence it's name), thus giving you some precognition and a massive high. A milder variant exists called **Gladstones** which is less effective but (somewhat) safer. Understandably, also highly illegal. Less addictive than Spook, but only just.
* **Icrotic Slime** \- Another product of Necromunda (it's a *bad place*). Less a drug and more a weird slime blob you put on  your head. It contains a brain-eating Warp-infused amoeba that beyond a certain point reduces you to essentially a mindless husk, but you'll be too blissed out to care to unplug. Very popular among decadent nobles, who go *Sliming* (yes, that's the term for using this thing) to get a massive high, usually with a helper nearby whose job is to unplug the thing after a set amount of time. Addictive. Legal in some places, but illegal most other places.
* **Farcosia** \- Originating in the Calixis Sector. This thing is made from the distilled brains of psykers (really). Has such a massive Warp signature that psykers often mistake the container to have a living thing inside it (and understandably freak out on realizing the truth). Let's you see into the Warp and filters out all the noise so you get precognition and information, so it's actually *safe* in that regard that it won't summon Warp gribblies to eat your face on use. Very potent and highly addictive, and extremely expensive for obvious reasons. Also highly illegal.

**""Normal"" Drugs** \-

* **Eversor Cocktail** \- Just what it says. It's a cocktail of stimulants and narcotics used by the Eversor Temple of the Officio Assassinorum (they're screaming murder junkies and the closest indicator we've ever got of the fact that even Games Workshop has an idea of what counts as ""excessively over the top"" in this setting). Need an augmented biological system just to use, and makes the user violently explode upon death when a specific serum is released by their system. Legal only within the Assassinorum.
* **Polymorphine** \- Used by the Callidus Temple of the Officio Assassinorum. Let's the user alter their body completely - any gender, any shape, any appearance. Used for impersonating other individuals and even aliens. Inquisitors sometime use it to make perfect infiltrators. It also has a very distinctive odor from prolonged use, meaning that users have to take measures to counteract the smell (they're stinky, so lots of perfume). Legal under specific conditions. No addiction risk.
* **Barrage** \- Temporarily overrides your body's limiters on strength, letting you roid up and tear things apart, but it wears off very quickly and leaves you with damaged muscles and tendons. Legal for Imperial Guard and Sororitas issue. Addictive.
* **Spur** \- Combat stimulant. Boosts nervous system reactivity and physical reaction speed. Wears off after a few minutes. Legal for Imperial Guard and Sororitas issue. Slightly addictive.
* **Slaught** \- Metamphetamines and Adrenaline mixed together. Increases spatial awareness and reactivity, but also makes the user uncontrollably freak out in rage. Legal for Imperial Guard and Sororitas issue. Highly addictive.
* **Stimm** \- Painkillers mixed in with Slaught. Legal in the Imperium in general, common enough on hive worlds for workers to carry out long shifts, and a common augment in Power Armor is to have ampules of it inside to inject the wearer in combat. Slightly addictive.
* **Obscura** \- Ground up narcotic chemical that is smoked or injected in liquid form. Induces a pleasant high, but has a hard crash when it wears off. Legally available as Obscurine for the Imperial Guard as a painkiller, but illegal for general use. Highly addictive.
* **Frenzon** \- Mix of Spur, Slaught, Stimm. Makes the user go into a berserk frenzy (hence the name). Highly addictive. Legal for Imperial Guard and Sororitas issue.
* **Blue Fire** \- It's just Spice Melange from *Dune*. Really, that's it.
* **Kalma** \- It calms people down. Made from a plant of the same name. Legal for general issue as a painkiller and general medicine. Slightly addictive.
* **Rose** \- Heightens your sensory capacity to the maximum. Recreational drug, especially popular among nobles and middle-class Imperials. Commonplace and often found in brothels (for very obvious reasons). Legal in some places in the Imperium. Slightly addictive.
* **Mortis** \- Gives the user a near-death experience. In large doses, puts you into a coma and suspended animation for some time. Legal for Astartes and Inquisition issue. Death Cults also use it to initiate members (a version of it is used in the game on you by the Bloodspun Web). No addiction risk.
* **De-Tox** \- De-addiction medicine. Another variant of it is known as **Sweep** and also common. Legal in the Imperium for medical use. No addiction risk, but has unpleasant side-effects.
* **Sweetmeats** \- Made from Astartes Progenoids. Gives a massive high when used, and regrows all missing body parts (organs and limbs included). No addiction risk. Illegal to the point that Astartes Chapters will hunt you down to fuck up your shit, for very obvious reasons.
* **Yellodes** \- Works like Spook, but doesn't actually induce Warp manifestations. Psychedelics. Addictive. Illegal.

**Common Narcotics and Substances** \-

* **Tabac/Lho** \- Tobacco equivalent. The actual tobacco plant is extinct in the grim darkness of the far future, but this plant is similar in it's effect and much stronger. Commonplace and legal. Rolled into Cigars and Lho-Sticks (Cigarettes) or insufflated in powder form. Comes in all qualities and makes, from stuff that only discerning Rogue Traders will use to cheap sticks available at any vendor. Many Imperial Guard regiments issue Lho-Sticks as part of their standard rations. Addiction risks vary.
* **Topaz** \- Common narcotic that induces calmness and as a mild stimulant in large doses. Legal in most places in the Imperium. Slightly addictive.
* **Tanna** \- A tea plant originating on Valhalla. Very common drink, but extremely strong and considered an acquired taste. Popular with the Valhallan Ice Warriors Imperial Guard Regiment, who include it as part of their rations.
* **Ohxolosvennoy** \- A plant mixed in with powdered and salted meat from Vostroya. Very strong, often brewed into Tisanes and Decoctions. Basically really strong coffee.
* **Recaf** \- RE-constituted CAF-feine. It's coffee. The plant is still around in the Imperium (people love their coffee) and called the Recaf Leaf. Commonplace and widely available. Powdered versions also exist.
* **Tea** \- Yep, still around. Commonplace. Space Marines love them their Tea, though some prefer Recaf (nice to see that even posthuman super-soldiers have their preferences like this).

**Drinks** \-

* **Amasec** \- Old fashioned booze. Ranges in quality from the really good stuff you'll only find in an Officer's cabinet to cheap swill that a Guardsman might drink while on furlough. Hard liquor, commonplace. Legal everywhere. Many Imperial Guard regiments issue a daily ration of it. Comes in different flavors and types.
* **Rotgut** \- Distilled on the sly by Guardsmen and Voidsmen or criminals. Often comes with plenty of impurities. Hope that ethanol to promethium ratio is in your favor, or it'll make you go blind or kill you. Illegal. Sometimes called **Gorsk White Gin** which is made from antifreeze.
* **Tranq** \- Rotgut mixed in with some chemicals that induces a numbing sensation. The drink you want when you want to forget everything. Illegal.
* **Dzira** \- A specialty of the Iron Hands Astartes and their successors. Made from any ethanol based liquid. Ridiculously strong, to the point that it makes Space Marines wince. Lethal if drunk by a normal human, for obvious reasons.
* **Karash** \- A specialty of the Blood Angels Astartes and their successors. Wine spiced with blood donated from Chapter Serfs. Ceremonial drink, but also commonly drunk by Blood Angels Marines for recreation. Very strong wine if drunk by normal humans, but otherwise harmless. Legal, but hard to get.
* **Wine** \- Yep, it's still a thing. Ranges in quality from a Rogue Trader's finest selection to cheap plonk available at any store. Notably, Space Marines *love* the thing, and it's one of the few things they'll quite readily indulge in and drink recreationally - since their metabolism neutralizes alcohol unless it's ultra-strong, they drink it like soda pop. Commonplace and legal.
* **Fenrisian Ale (Mjod)** \- A specialty of the Space Wolves Astartes. Insanely potent hard liquor, to the point it can actually get a Space Marine drunk. There's some special herb on Fenris they add to it that can neutralize the alcohol filtration mechanism every Space Marine has. Needless to say, lethal to normal humans. That said, any normal human drinking even a few drops and staying on their feet earns major street cred with the Wolves, since you have to be ridiculously tough to survive it.
* **Sacra** \- Strong spirit brewed on the planet Tanith. Rather rare these days since Tanith got destroyed about three hundred years ago, but the diaspora of that world do make it wherever they are. Served warm. Legal, but very rare and expensive.
* **Rahzvod** \- A calque of the Russian term 'razlivnaya vodka' (unbottled vodka). It's basically just Vodka. Made on Vostroya, legal, very common in the Imperium and quite popular.
* **Bru** \- Potent alcoholic drink made by the Leagues of Votann. That said, versions of it that are served hot and are caffeinated are also common. Legal.
* **Dammassine** \- Sweet alcohol that tastes of almonds. Popular drink in the Calixis Sector, where it originates from. Legal.
* **Gleece** \- It's rum. That's really it. Legal.
* **Old Foiz** \- Bourbon. Legal.
* **Raenka** \- Fermented peaches and apples distilled into alcohol. Very distinct flavor and very well liked. Considered a classy and girly drink. Legal, very high demand.
* **Spirit Juice** \- Strong brew, absolutely horrendous taste, but if you want to get hammered and into the spirit of things, this is the drink you want. Made on the world of Munsk. Legal, but frowned upon for it's involvement in rowdy behavior.
* **Theosophical Philtre** \- Mild wine, nice flavor. Often banned on Shrine Worlds because people don't realize they're getting boozed until it's too late. Legal everywhere else.
* **Wild Snake** \- Necromunda exports a legal thing, for once. Potent alcohol, has a snake in the bottle that bleeds the venom into the drink.
* **Abaddon's Moonshine** \- The favored drink of Chaos Marines. Tastes very harsh, very potent, but popular drink among Chaos Marines. Lethal to normal humans. Not illegal in and of itself, but the only way you're getting any is if you're in with heresy.
* **Lacrimosa** \- Specialty of the Emperor's Children Heretic Astartes. Made from the tears of slaves and captures. Let's the user experience the pain of captured slaves while infusing it with pleasure, and gives Chaos Marines boners. Illegal (for obvious reasons). Drinkable by normal humans, but you get what you paid for.

**The Special Thing** \-

* **Juvenat Drugs** \- Extends your lifespan. Made from stem cells and combined with the reconstruction of the body with tissue grafts, both of which are mostly grown in industrial growth vats. Some planets have plant and animal species that can replicate the effect, but are limited in supply as a valuable commodity. People can easily live for centuries with these drugs and treatment plans (collectively known as **Rejuvenat Therapy** when applied). Legal, but extremely expensive.
   * The treatment, however, has diminishing returns over time. After about five centuries, the body will simply become incapable of accepting any more treatment and natural death is simply something the patient has to come to terms with. Life can be further prolonged with augmentation, but that requires the Mechanicus to provide assistance, which is difficult in the best of times.
   * The longest anyone's ever lived is about 1500 years with this treatment (record holder being Kyril Sindermann, the very first Inquisitor and one of the founding members of the Inquisition). The average clocks around about 400 years.
   * The Kasballica and other crime syndicates are infamous for practicing Cell Drain, which is them capturing children and teenagers and draining them of their blood, bone marrow and stem cells to produce the drugs, which they then sell mixed in with the legal supply. Doing so kills the victims, and it's a very painful and undignified death. For obvious reasons, Cell Drain is beyond illegal and one of the few crimes that the Arbites can be reliably counted on to investigate and shut down hard.

Some folks use these services for proofreading or editing. Others need help when an unexpected crisis pops up—a sick family member, a broken laptop, a sudden workload spike. Whatever the reason, the idea is to have a professional writer help shoulder the burden without sacrificing quality or academic integrity.

I recently spent time exploring [CustomWritings.com](https://www.customwritings.com/?r=6), one of the longer-standing names in this space. Below is a detailed review of what I found, plus a personal-style narrative of what it’s actually like to order from them.

# First Impressions

Landing on CustomWritings feels clean and straightforward. The site doesn’t drown you in pop-ups or make you dig for basic info. Right on the homepage, you see a price calculator, a description of services, and quick links to get started. For a first-time visitor, that clarity matters.

# What [CustomWritings.com](http://customwritings.com/) Offers

CustomWritings is more than a simple essay mill. Their custom essay writing service covers a surprisingly wide range of academic and professional needs:

•     Academic Essays: Argumentative, narrative, descriptive—if it’s a standard assignment, they’ve got it.

•     Research Papers & Term Papers: Useful for those big semester-end beasts.

•     Coursework & Lab Reports: Ideal for science or engineering majors.

•     Dissertations & Theses: They break it into chapters, proposals, literature reviews, etc.

•     Admissions & Personal Statements: Helpful for grad school or scholarship applications.

•     Business Writing: Think reports, presentations, or even marketing plans.

They also offer editing, proofreading, and rewriting. In other words, it’s not only about someone else writing from scratch—you can get as much or as little help as you want.

# Ordering Process: Surprisingly Simple

I tested their ordering process with a hypothetical psychology research paper (2,000 words, APA format). Here’s how it works:

1.   Fill in the Details: You choose the paper type, academic level, number of pages, deadline, and any specific instructions. They encourage uploading rubrics or example materials, which is nice.

2.   Price Quote: As you tweak deadlines or page counts, the price calculator updates in real time.

3.   Account Creation & Payment: You set up a simple account and pay through standard secure methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

4.   Writer Assignment: They match you with a writer based on your subject. You can request a specific writer if you’ve worked with someone before.

5.   Communication Hub: There’s a built-in messaging system so you can chat with your writer, upload additional materials, or clarify instructions.

6.   Draft & Final Paper: Before the deadline, you receive a draft or the completed paper, and you can request free revisions if needed.

The process took me less than five minutes to set up, and the interface is refreshingly uncluttered.

# Pricing: What to Expect

Prices depend on factors like academic level, urgency, and type of paper. As of this writing:

•     Undergrad essays start around $10–$12 per page with a two-week deadline.

•     Graduate-level work or rush orders (e.g., 24 hours) can run $20–$30 per page or more.

That puts them in the middle of the market: not the rock-bottom cheap sites (which can be risky), but not luxury pricing either. They also have:

•     Discounts: Occasional promo codes and a first-time customer discount.

•     Free Features: Title page, bibliography, formatting, and revisions.

•     Money-Back Guarantee: If they can’t meet your requirements or deadline, they promise a full or partial refund.

For transparency, you can see the exact cost before paying—no hidden fees.

# Guarantees & Policies

[CustomWritings.com](http://customwritings.com/) offers some strong assurances:

•     Originality: They run every paper through plagiarism detection software.

•     Confidentiality: Your personal data and order details stay private.

•     Revision Policy: Free revisions within a specified window if the paper doesn’t meet instructions.

•     Money-Back Guarantee: Clear refund policy in case of missed deadlines or quality issues.

These guarantees don’t replace your own due diligence, but they’re reassuring.

# Customer Support

Support is available 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone. I tested the live chat with a few random questions and got helpful answers in under two minutes each time. The reps were polite and didn’t pressure me to place an order.

# A Hypothetical User Experience

Imagine you’re “Sam,” a second-year sociology student juggling two part-time jobs. You’ve got a 10-page paper on urban migration patterns due in three days and a surprise double shift tomorrow. Panic sets in.

Sam heads to CustomWritings, plugs in the details, and sees a price around $160 for a 10-page undergrad paper with a 72-hour turnaround. After paying, Sam messages the assigned writer, “Hey, can you focus on Chicago as a case study?” The writer replies within an hour.

The next evening, Sam receives a partial draft, glances through it during a coffee break, and requests a few tweaks on the introduction. By the deadline, the final version is ready, complete with proper citations and a formatted reference list. Sam double-checks it with Turnitin, finds no plagiarism, and uses it as a guide to rewrite a shorter version in their own words.

This hypothetical shows how someone might responsibly use the service—as a reference or model paper—rather than submitting it verbatim.

# Pros & Cons

Pros

•     Wide Range of Services: From simple essays to PhD dissertations.

•     Transparent Pricing: Real-time calculator with no hidden fees.

•     Quality Control: Built-in plagiarism checks and free revisions.

•     24/7 Support: Quick and helpful.

•     Ease of Use: Smooth ordering process and intuitive interface.

Cons

•     Cost Adds Up: Rush orders or higher-level work can get expensive.

•     Writer Variability: Quality depends on the individual writer (though you can request preferred writers).

•     Ethical Considerations: Always a factor—using these papers as final submissions crosses academic honesty lines.

# Tips & Standout Benefits

Here are a few key takeaways if you’re considering this or any custom essay writing service:

1.   Provide Detailed Instructions: The more info you give—rubrics, samples, formatting—the better the result.

2.   Use the Messaging Feature: Communicate with your writer early to avoid misunderstandings.

3.   Plan Ahead: Longer deadlines = lower prices.

4.   Request Drafts: Helps ensure the paper is on the right track.

5.   Use Responsibly: Treat the final paper as a study aid or model, not a “submit as is” shortcut.

# Reflections & Advice

[CustomWritings.com](http://customwritings.com/) won’t magically solve every academic challenge, but it can be a lifesaver when you’re overwhelmed. The key is using it wisely. A custom essay writing service should be a tool for learning, not a crutch for cheating.

•     Can I afford the service without sacrificing essentials?

If the answer is yes, [CustomWritings.com](http://customwritings.com/) is a reputable option with solid features, fair pricing, and a user-friendly experience.

I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I'm constantly getting asked about when to buy an espresso machine. After helping countless friends and customers make this decision, I thought I'd share my insights with you all.

From my experience, the best time to buy an espresso machine is during major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Prime Day. I've noticed prices drop significantly during these sales, sometimes up to 40% off! But here's the thing - you don't always have to wait for these big events.

I've been tracking prices for years, and I've noticed that retailers often offer random flash sales throughout the year. January and February are particularly good months because stores are trying to clear out their holiday inventory. I actually got my first machine (which I still use) during a February sale from this seller: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

Here's what I've learned about timing your purchase:

1. Early morning hours during sales events (less competition)
2. Mid-week deals tend to be better than weekend ones
3. End-of-model clearance sales (usually when new models are about to launch)
4. Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Labor Day, etc.)

But honestly, the best time to buy isn't just about getting the lowest price. Consider these factors:

- Your current coffee spending habits
- How much counter space you have
- Your coffee-making skills
- Whether you'll use it regularly

I recently helped my sister choose her first espresso machine from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine and she saved about $150 by buying during a random Tuesday sale in March. She was originally waiting for Black Friday, but I showed her that sometimes regular sales can be just as good.

Remember, a good espresso machine is an investment. While timing your purchase can save you money, don't compromise on quality just to save a few bucks. I've seen people regret buying cheaper models during big sales instead of waiting for a better deal on a quality machine.

Also, keep in mind that prices tend to surge during the holiday season (October-December), so if you're not seeing any good deals, it might be worth waiting until January when prices typically drop.

One last tip: Sign up for price alerts on your preferred models. I use CamelCamelCamel to track Amazon prices, and it's helped me spot some incredible deals that I would've otherwise missed.

Happy brewing, everyone! Feel free to ask any questions - I love helping people discover the joy of making great espresso at home.",1,1759157403.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

The weather today reminded me of you. Gentle, beautiful, and a little bittersweet. Even though it’s been more than a year since I last saw you or heard your voice, I still remember the way you looked at me that day. My heart skipped a beat then, and somehow, sometimes, it still does now when I think of you.

Perhaps I’m thinking of you because I never got to share a day like this with you. You would have loved it here. The trees are dressed in gold, and the air feels crisp and alive. I imagine us sitting in the park all day, talking about our dreams, laughing over your favorite coffee, just existing together without hurry. Our time was far too short, and my heart still aches knowing we’ll never have that chance again.

Yet, I find comfort in picturing you happy, doing the things you love, laughing with your friends, and having your favorite meals.  And my heart feels warm again.

Thank you for showing me what it feels like to love deeply and honestly. No matter how far the distance or how much time has passed, a part of my heart will always be grateful to you.

With every falling leaf, I let a little more of you go. I’m ready to open my heart again.",1,1759157371.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I've got my grandma's broken laptop, it's a 2019 Lenovo. 

The battery became a spicy pillow and actually cracked the plastic case, my grandma didn't tell us it happened but thankfully she spilled some coffee on the laptop which killed the keyboard, this is how I discovered the laptop became a small bomb lol.

Anyway it now has no battery and the keyboard doesn't work but everything else seems to work fine.

It has an I5-8250U, 8GB ddr4 ram, 128GB NVME boot drive and a 2.5"" 1TB HDD which I harvested.

It also has a slimline SATA connector for the optical disk drive (which I took out).

What can I do with this laptop besides throwing it in the trash?

I've thought about using it for Pi-hole or maybe even as a NAS but I don't know how to connect HDDs to it.

I've got some HDDs:

Inside my main PC: a 1TB and a 2TB 3.5"" drives

Laying around used for disorganized backups: The 1TB 2.5 drive from the laptop, a 1TB 3.5"" drive, a 500GB 3.5 drive, an old 1TB 3.5"" USB drive (which I should probably shuck because it's only usb 2) and a 2TB 2.5"" USB drive.

In the past I've thought about putting all these drives in my old gaming pc and using it as a NAS but I realized I don't have space for it and the I5-2500K in that pc is too power hungry and slow.

Any ideas?

No ME/CFS, neuro heavy.

Issues began in Dec 2022 (I do not know when I got infected prior to that). Age at that time 25, Male. Previously healthy.

Took a Pfizer jab in March 2023 (when I realised I was dealing with Long Covid), 2 weeks later further dysautonomia, POTS-like HR spikes. Could have had a reinfection during those 2 weeks but unlikely or the spike from the vaccine added on top.

I got slightly better from May 2023 till Dec 2023 and was living almost normally until a confirmed 4th Dec 2023 reinfection. Symptoms started 1st Dec so I assume anywhere 25th Nov 2023 onwards till 1st Dec was the reinfection entry.

Since then all hell broke lose, became so much worse. Gt a brief period of remission from March 2024 till May 2024. No idea if I got reinfected then but started experiencing massive neuro-heavy symptoms. But never post-exertional fatigue etc. But pretty disabled.

Got Sipavibart July 2025 via Granata (Swizterland). Didn't get any improvements.

According to Office of National Statistics England plus ChatGPT - the 2 variants most likely to have caused my reinfection in my geolocation (London, UK) were those where Sipavibart loses neutralisation against.

That plus Pemgarda's more superior cell clearing abilities made me want to try it.

Found Dr Scoma NYC. I didn't have a choice of doctors because I needed someone who would listen to ""prescribe Pemgarda for a non-standard pathway"" + ""be comfortable with internationals""

1000 USD for an 1-hour stuff with Dr Scoma. We spoke for an hour and he basically told me within the first 5 minutes that he would give me the prescription regardless. He also gave me some pointers for drugs to try with my UK doctor for inflammation.

He works with New Jersey infusion centres (which is just next to New York City, as they do not have centres in NYC).

I chose the one nearest infusion centre (they have like 3 in New Jersey) to JFK NYC airport, as that was the best available with direct flights from London, UK. Paid for Pemgarda and booked myself on the 25th September. 7000 USD, everything included.

Flew in on the 24th September, 1.5h from JFK to my hotel in New Jersey (which was 30 minutes by bus from the infusion centre) via NYC subway + bus (bus transfers you from NYC to NJ).

Had the infusion on the 25th and left back to London, UK on the 26th.

Since I travelled via backpack carry-on the flight which cuts down the cost, and prioritised experience (got a 3-star hotel, instead of dumpy motels) alongside a direct flight (7h) because I was so symptomatic couldn't cope with a 15h flight with layovers, hotel + flights cost me 800 USD.

Then, due to the inferior choices of food unless you want a proper restaurant, I decided to fast the moment I touched down in NYC (so 72h fast). This has cell autophagy plus immune system benefits as well. Just too many Wendy's and Tacobells and not enough cheap options that can be eaten in a hotel room.

So my diet was basically a CVS (US pharmacy) immune multivitamin taking double dose + gas station pure black coffee and 2-3 decaff ones to supress appetite.

That was probably another 70 USD across the 3 days, including subway, bus etc.

So all in all 7000 USD Pemgarda, 900 USD transport, 1000 USD Dr Scoma. Not bad. I also read from u/unstuckbilly's collected Pemgarda anecdotes that this seems cheap for the infusion, one of the people paid like 14 000 USD but they didn't care as they are are a US-based person whose insurance paid for it.

Feeling better overall I would say, and definitely not due to placebo because one of the worst neuro symptoms, a feeling where my lungs wouldn't expand properly upon trying to take a big breath of air is much less and that is so objective and intense, especially given that I didn't experience much with Sipavibart. I also had burning in my feet and hands which seems to be basically gone?

I will use this thread to update as it goes as 72h post infusion is a bit too early - for both poor effect or good effect. If can push the fast to 5 days I will, but might break it today lightly with a home cooked meal.

Another thing worth mentioning is that at the infusion centre they told me the Scoma's prescription is valid for a year, which means I can get 2-3 more infusions and I don't need another one. He basically gives you the full prescription as if you are immunocompromised and will need further ones. This might be worth knowing especially if you are a non-US based individual, like me.

1ntjzn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BedroomLab/comments/1ntjzn8/which_mattress_protector_is_most_waterproof/,Which mattress protector is most waterproof?,"When people ask about the ""most waterproof"" mattress protector, they’re usually thinking in terms of absolute liquid resistance—like a guarantee that not a single drop will pass through no matter what happens. The truth is, nearly every modern waterproof protector worth buying uses some form of polyurethane (PU) membrane as its barrier, and that’s really the gold standard. PU membranes are thin, flexible, and breathable, yet they block liquid completely. Vinyl used to be the go-to for waterproofing, but it tends to sleep hot, crack over time, and make that unmistakable “crinkly” sound. PU has largely replaced it because it balances comfort with durability.

That said, there are differences in quality between brands. The most waterproof protectors are typically those that combine a tightly woven surface material (cotton terry or polyester knit) with a high-quality PU backing that’s been heat-bonded rather than glued. Heat bonding prevents peeling and maintains integrity after repeated washes. I’ve seen budget protectors where the waterproofing layer starts to delaminate after half a dozen cycles, which is where you get “leaks.” Premium protectors, like those from SafeRest, Protect-A-Bed, or Coop Home Goods, tend to hold up much better. They’re certified for hundreds of washes without losing the waterproof seal.

Another factor to consider is how the protector fits. Even the most waterproof layer won’t help if liquid seeps in around the edges. A deep-pocket design with strong elastic is essential if you’re dealing with larger spills, kids, or pets. I’ve also found that encasement protectors (those that zip around the entire mattress) offer the most comprehensive protection, not just against liquids but also allergens and dust mites. The trade-off is that encasements can feel less breathable, so I usually recommend them only when full coverage is a must.

From personal experience, I’ve tested protectors with everything from spilled coffee to a full glass of water left to sit overnight. The high-quality PU-backed options didn’t let a drop through, and the mattress remained bone dry. The cheap ones? Let’s just say they’re fine for light sweat resistance but not for a toddler’s accident at 2 AM.

So if waterproofing is your absolute priority, look for:

* **PU membrane, not vinyl** (for durability and breathability).
* **Heat-bonded layers** that can withstand regular washing.
* **Deep-pocket or encasement design** for edge-to-edge protection.
* **A reputable brand** that explicitly tests for fluid resistance and longevity.

In short: most waterproof = premium PU membrane encasement protector. Most comfortable balance of waterproof + breathability = fitted sheet–style protector from a trusted brand. Anything bargain-bin is going to compromise one of those two factors.",1,1759157251.0,BedroomLab,0,1.0,False

This week’s episode is a little different! I sat down with Marty Scott, the barrel manager of Revolution Brewing. We tasted through and chatted about Revolution’s October 2025 Deep Woods releases which include: Deth’s Tar, Café Deth, Vanilla Deth, and Cocoa Vanilla Deth.

Coming off of a bronze medal at the Beer World Cup, we discuss Rev’s process to create the base to many of their Deep Wood releases - “Deth’s Tar”. Blending sweet and dry components of the bourbon barrel aged base imperial oatmeal stout. As well as their partnership with their barrel brokers Midwest Barrel Co. 

For “Café Deth” we discuss the coffee selection process with Dark Matter Coffee, as well as how Rev adds coffee to extract the best parts of coffee in the beer.

For “Vanilla Deth” we discuss the addition of not only hand split whole vanilla beans, but a unique addition of “vanilla toasted” oak from Creative Oak. This additional oak helps impart vanilla flavor, while also aiding the drinking experience with a dry finish....you’ll have to listen in to learn about oak and hydrophobia!

“Cocoa Vanilla Deth” is a “Twenty Ten Variant Collection” release in a 19.2oz can. It is an imperial oatmeal stout aged in bourbon barrels with the addition of chocolate and vanilla. The chocolate comes from Sleep Walk Chocolateria, a sister company of Dark Matter. We talk about this selection process as well as how adding cocoa beans differs from coffee.

Finally we talk about the preview parties and release day! On October 3, 2025, local record/book store Bucket O’ Blood helps turn the taproom’s vibes spooky. To celebrate Halloween month there will be a limited edition Rev horror themed shirt as well as three extra special draft variants! Vanilla du Fou, Vanilla Mocha Deth, and Stoopermassive Reserve!

Pre-orders open September 30, 2025 at 9am central!

Right now I already have a PC with an RTX 3050 and 1 TB of storage (I can expand if needed). I mostly use it for gaming, but I don’t mind wiping/repurposing it for school work if that makes the most sense. I also have a MSI thin A15 that I could expand aswell.

My concern is that I have a lot of sick days (one of the reasons I’m doing online), and sometimes I’d like to be able to work in bed or maybe at a local coffee shop. I’m debating if I should just stick with my PC or old laptop for all my cybersecurity labs and classes, or if it’s worth “upgrading” a bit and getting something else to use.

For context:
	•	PC is powerful enough, just not portable
	•	I’ll need to run VMs, labs, probably some Linux setups
	•	Portability would be nice, but not if it sacrifices too much performance

What would you recommend? Stick with my PC only, or invest in a laptop too? If laptop, what specs should I be aiming for that are student friendly but still solid for cybersecurity work?",1,1759156969.0,cybersecurity_help,1,1.0,False
1ntjuv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ntjuv1/rejecting_the_olive_branch/,Rejecting the olive branch,"
I've rejected my justnoMiL olive branch, and I just want to know how to address the request again if it comes up. 

I'd really appreciate this not to be shared out of this forum. 

A really short and condensed context.. I was starting to get close my my mil, the veil sort of slipped with her once she temporarily moved in while I was pregnant and I could see she was taking advantage of myself and my husband.. not only that I being pregnant at the time she was trying to orchestrate me going back to work early so she could stay home with the baby (to which she is now doing the exact same to my sister-in-law.. Boundaries was squashed, gossip was made and we ended up falling out twice. Once bitten and twice shy is sort of the situation now. 

Me personally, I am completely no contact. Our socials are blocked, numbers are blocked. All contact (if any) is through my husband. 
I also don't feel safe or comfortable to be with her on my own because she's orchestrated a lot of lies and she's twisted things before in the past. It's actually the last reason why we fell out as she sent my husband a lot of lies which I think was to cause a rift. 

This whole thing by the way has been rug swept by her. She thinks I've moved past all of the hurt the lies, the nastiness of the messages she previously sent.. no accountability, no apology.. not even a talk to hash out the air. She just ""bumped into us in town"" and then since then messaged my husband to say they're round the corner from our house. 

Since then my contact has been in the presence of other people. I've seen them maybe 3 times this year, and while I begrudgingly I accept these things or play host, I know it's only temporary as we're moving far away from them in 9 months time. 

She started off by asking my husband on the phone if I wanted to go shopping with her a few weeks ago, I politely declined and my husband fully supported me.. although I don't think it was relayed back to her as this was after the call ended (which is fine as it wasn't an imminent request from her) 
My in-laws then came for coffee to see the kids. I didn't talk much to my Mil asi don't now. She tries and tries to make conversation with me, but it's just not natural anymore.. it's weird and I'm still fucking hurt, but she would say I'm dragging all this out and holding a grudge?! WELL DUH

 As they were leaving she asked me to do something just the two of us with the kids, to which I said.. ""um, maybe, I'm not too sure about that but I'll let you know"" her face screwed up and they left our house. 
Well, we're meeting them for dinner next weekend and I'm concerned it'll be bought up again. 

Look, I'm a big girl.. I will say no but this time more directly, but can I have some affirmation that I'm not overreacting by declining this olive branch. I'm just over it. It's a repeating pattern that my husband says she's like this with everyone and for me, I don't want my kids or myself exposed to this erratic behaviour. 

A lot of the drama from her additional family members, me , her work has died down so now all of a sudden she's telling all of us she's depressed.. but I just don't feel any different. I don't want to be guilted into doing something with a woman that caused me so much distress when pregnant (twice) 

I personally and I would never repeat this to anyone other than strangers.. but it's like there's no attention on her, the next thing she can do for the attention is the mental health card. Again my husband said she was always like this growing up.. erratic, unable to hold relationships.. everyone apparently is a narcissist to her including me.. fuck I must be because I just don't have any feelings towards this new ""health"" problem. 

She tried to turn my husband against me, she turned my sister in law and my father in law against me temporarily.. I just don't fucking need the hassle. 

Just a disclaimer, Thankyou so much for reading this far. My husband is supportive and if it came to it I know he would have my back.. but I'm just seeking unbiased opinions that is me rejecting this offer it isn't me ""dragging shit out"" - I just want to protect my peace. Me and my husband very nearly divorced because of her and I just don't fucking need or want her around me. 

(We nearly divorced the first time when they lived with us, since then we have gotten much closer and he's become incredibly supportive because he sees what she's with me)

I've spent nights awake at night worrying maybe I am a narcissist, worried that she probably thinks I'm keeping my family away from her.. but my husband just never would plan anything with them unless I arranged it. 

Before our falling out I arranged birthdays and Christmas's. I reminded him about birthdays. Presents was sorted because of me, we at one point was going over their house weekly. 
After the first falling out I still made sure to FaceTime with the kids every week, I always made sure to text photos or keep her updated. But since we fell out, I don't do any of that now. 

I just don't want to be manipulated into breaking my boundary for a woman that's proved me twice now she's unstable. Am I wrong?",89,1759156946.0,JUSTNOMIL,24,0.98,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Fiancé and I were driving from Phoenix to San Diego and we decided to camp 1 night in Cleveland National Forest on the way over. We found this beautiful secluded spot perched atop a hill off of Pine Creek Road. 

Path was a bit rutted out and tight getting in, got my first set of pinstripes on the truck, and 4WD was needed to get to this spot. Even had to engage my rear locker for one part where it was so uneven my rear driver tire lifted off the ground. There was several other spots in the beginning of the path where a 2WD could get to easily, closer to the main road. This spot was further down, nice and secluded with a beautiful view. We only had 1 visit from a dirt biker who quickly turned around.

We had a hammock set up, burgers for dinner and french toast and coffee for breakfast. It was pure bliss. Slept good in the RTT and the view was amazing. Only downside was the fire ban and we don't have a propane pit so no fire for us, but it wasn't that cold to warrant it anyways.

I’ve been buying everything I can resale, tablecloths and vases included. My family member who has been a professional in this arena (but isn’t local to me) is quite insistent (and correct) that we need a way to tie in the white of the table cloths on the runner spread. If she had her way I would dye them with coffee or replace them but that’s not happening ;) 

We have some white flowers for the actual day that should help. Other ideas so far - tie the napkins and silverware with some dried florals and white ribbon, ribbon around the vase necks or white aquarium rocks in the base of them…

I don’t think fake candles/lights for each table are in our budget, but cool fairy lights could help too.

I’m a 31-year-old guy just looking to build a real, platonic connection with someone around my age. Life’s been a little heavy lately, and while I’m engaged, things in my relationship have been going through a rough patch. I’m not looking to replace my partner or cross any boundaries—just hoping to find someone to talk to, vent with, and maybe even share some laughs or deep thoughts over time.

I miss having that kind of friendship where you can just talk about anything—life goals, relationship ups and downs, or even just random stuff that helps you get through the day.

I’d say I’m pretty easygoing, open-minded, and a good listener. I’m also someone who genuinely enjoys the little things—like going out for a coffee, having a drink, and getting into those unexpectedly deep convos that make you lose track of time.

Some of the stuff I’m into:

Cooking (and weirdly, cleaning—it clears my head)

Building model kits and Lego sets (I find it super calming)

Playing casual mobile games like Stardew Valley and Mobile Legends

Watching Netflix when I need to unwind

Before the whole world flipped upside down, I was a lot more active—working out, hiking every week, and even bouldering for fun. But over the last few years, life got busy, and I ended up with a solid dad bod thanks to boredom snacking. 😅 I’m trying to ease back into that more active lifestyle though, slowly but surely.

Oh—and I’ve got 13 tattoos if that’s your kind of conversation starter. Each one has a story, and I’d love to hear about yours if you have any.

Anyway, if you’re someone who values real conversations and isn’t afraid to be a little vulnerable or silly sometimes, feel free to reach out. No pressure—just hoping to find a genuine friendship with someone who's also navigating life and figuring things out.",1,1759156143.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Looking for friends (my application and resume)

(Warning long message below, a test drive for our conversations and I want to give you all the information I can before you decide to dm me) 

""I like musicals, Autodidact, Epistemophile, Philomath, singing, dancing, working out, healthy living topics, books(I like most self help & romance books but I read other books as well), crochet, Asian culture, foodie(a lover for all food), learning & researching, learing japanese language & culture, dancing,  acting, creating anything (art, music, etc), and I have a love for all games (video games, vr games, card game, board games, roleplay game, personal growth/self help, dungeons&dragons, etc)... and I have a love for everyone especially the LGBT community.  I want to make more friends in huntsville alabama. how to make more friends where I live. I need at least one friend.""** I am also into witchy vibs, modesty stuff,  I have a great sense of humor, I love to laugh, many other things... This list is just the majority of my mind. I am so much more just ask me any thing. I am a open book and I am willing to answer any questions. 


""I like all alternative music, musicals, Broadway songs, county, rap, pop, hop hip, r&b etc... I like any song with a good beat and message. I like to dance hip hop, choreograph dances and pop. I love learning a lot and deep dive and going down rabbit holes it is a hyper fixation of mine. And another hyper fixation is me listening to audio books or whatever long informational videos on YouTube while crocheting. I am neurodivergent. I share traits of Asperger's, autism, anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, depression disorder, etc. I like doing things that surrounds my favorite topics but I am also open to new topics (whatever topic my future friend likes).""


"" If the person reading this lives in north Alabama and want to be friends with me.. dm me.

"" Friendship. It’s a complex social phenomenon rooted in reciprocal altruism and the desire for connection. I am looking for a in person & in real life friendship but willing to be open to a online friendship. I want to be friends with someone who like the same topics I like. But willing to be friends with people who has different favorite topics then mine. I expected my new friend to communicate with me at least once a week for at least an hour a week. I want a low maintenance friend. We can read a book together and talk about it. We can FaceTime and watch a movie together. We can talk about life together. I want to from a deep and passionate bond with someone other then my husband.""

Also I use AI to learn deeper and better. To fill in the gaps on my knowledge. Not a clutch but an helpful assistant. My actual human intelligence and artificial intelligence make a great team. Also I do use it all the time or everyday. Just when I feel like a need a boost in knowledge because I love learning, I am addicted to learning.

Hello! I'm someone who thrives on creativity, curiosity, and connection. My heart truly belongs to the arts—whether I'm singing along to a musical, learning a new dance routine, or getting lost in a character while acting. I love the process of creating anything from scratch, be it a crochet project, a piece of art, or a story.

My mind is just as active as my hands! I'm a bit of an epistemophile and philomath (a lover of knowledge and learning), which means I'm constantly down a research rabbit hole or buried in a book. While I have a soft spot for self-help and a good romance novel, I'm always open to new literary adventures. This love for learning extends to Asian culture, and I'm currently on the rewarding journey of learning the Japanese language.

When I'm not creating or studying, you can find me enjoying all kinds of games. From the strategic depths of Dungeons & Dragons and board games to the immersive worlds of video and VR games, I believe games are a fantastic way to bond and have fun.

Above all, I value genuine, kind-hearted people. I am pansexual. I have a deep love and unwavering support for the LGBTQ+ community and believe everyone deserves to be their authentic self. I’m looking to build real, supportive friendships here in Huntsville Alabama, and I’d be thrilled to connect with fellow curious and creative souls.



I am willing to do any of these.
· Be Bold: ""I really enjoyed talking with you about [D&D/that book/musicals]. Would you be interested in grabbing coffee sometime?""
· Suggest a Specific, Low-Pressure Activity: ""A few of us are going to try the new ramen place next week, would you like to join?""
· Use Your Shared Interest: ""I'm trying to start a new crochet project, would you want to work on our projects together at the library sometime?""

Hello there! I'm a person who feels music deeply—it's the soundtrack to my life. My playlist is a vibrant mix of everything from the storytelling of country and the energy of rap to the catchy hooks of pop, the soul of R&B, and the powerful emotions of Broadway musicals. If a song has a great beat and a meaningful message, it has my heart. This love often turns into movement; I adore dancing, especially hip-hop, and I love the creative challenge of choreographing my own routines.

When I'm not lost in music, you'll often find me happily falling down a research rabbit hole. I'm a naturally curious person, and learning about my favorite topics is a joyful hyperfixation of mine. One of my favorite ways to relax is to combine this with my love for creating; you'll frequently find me crocheting something new while listening to an audiobook or a long, informative YouTube video.

I'm neurodivergent and still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain. I experience traits associated with autism, anxiety, depression, and BPD, which means I experience the world with a lot of intensity, passion, and deep empathy. While my conversations often light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects, I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love. Nothing makes me happier than hearing someone talk passionately about their own interests.

I'm looking for friends who appreciate authenticity, can share in deep dives on random topics, and maybe even have a spontaneous dance break with me.
""I really want someone to dance and hang out& parallel play with"" 

1. Leading with Passion, Not Labels:

· Original: ""I like all alternative music...""
· Reframed: Starting with ""I feel music deeply"" is an emotional invitation. It explains the why behind your interest, which is more relatable than a list. People connect with feelings first and details second.

2. Turning ""Hyperfixation"" into a Shared Activity:

· Original: ""going down rabbit holes it is a hyper fixation of mine.""
· Reframed: Phrases like ""I'm a naturally curious person"" and ""joyful hyperfixation"" frame this trait positively. It transforms it from an internal experience into a potential shared joy: ""Want to fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole with me about the history of crochet?"" or ""Do you have any podcast recommendations for while I work on my next project?""

3. Disclosing Neurodivergence with Strength and Clarity:

· Original: The list of conditions can feel overwhelming to someone who doesn't understand them.
· Reframed: Stating you are ""still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain"" is disarming and honest. It focuses on the outcomes—""intensity, passion, and deep empathy""—which are wonderful qualities in a friend. This explains your communication style (""I light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects"") while simultaneously showing you're a great listener (""I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love""). This is a very inviting balance.


"" I would love to hang out together doing an activity based thing or topic. Or just show up for each other and parallel play in person or on the phone. We can even body double on a task for each other.""

· Use Your ""Deep Dive"" Superpower: When you meet someone, ask them, ""What could you talk about for hours?"" This question invites them to share their passion and signals that you are a safe person for deep, enthusiastic conversations.
· Script an Opening Line: Having a friendly, prepared line can ease social anxiety. It could be as simple as:
  · ""I'm really passionate about [music/choreography/crochet]. What's something you're really into right now?""
  · ""I love learning about new things. Tell me something interesting you've learned lately!""

Your willingness to be open and your capacity for passionate interest are beautiful qualities that will attract the right kind of friends. The key is to present these traits as the strengths they are. You are not just looking for a friend; you are looking for a friend to share deep dives, creative projects, and honest conversations with—and that is a wonderful offer.

A More Heartfelt and Friendly Revision

To my future friends in North Alabama,

If you're reading this and feel a connection, I'd love to hear from you! Building genuine, trusting friendships is my goal.

To create a comfortable and secure environment for everyone, including myself, I want to be upfront about my boundaries. For personal reasons rooted in past experiences, I am not seeking one-on-one friendships with straight men. My deepest and most important friendship is with my husband, and our relationship is built on a foundation of mutual trust and transparency.

The one exception to this is if a straight man is interested in becoming a friend to both of us as a couple. In that case, any friendship would naturally include my husband, and our interactions would be as a group. This isn't about monitoring, but about building a connection that respects the primary partnership in my life.

For everyone else—women and LGBTQ+ folks—I am thrilled and open to building a direct, one-on-one friendship with you. My husband is a wonderful part of my life, but he doesn't need to be a central part of our friendship.

On a related but separate note, while my primary goal is finding deep friendships, my husband and I are ethically non-monogamous. We are open to the possibility of a polyamorous relationship, but only with the right, rare connection that develops very naturally over time. (Female only) This is not an invitation, but a piece of information for full transparency.

My hope is to find kind, understanding people who value honesty as much as I do. If this sounds like a friendship you'd be comfortable with, please don't hesitate to reach out.

A More Heartfelt and Friendly Revision

I believe friendship is one of life's greatest adventures—a shared journey of discovery, support, and joy. While I have a wonderful and secure marriage, I am yearning to build a deep, passionate platonic bond with someone else; a unique connection that stands on its own.

My ideal is to find a local friend for in-person connection here in North Alabama, but I'm absolutely open to the magic of a strong online friendship as well.

What would our friendship look like? I dream of the simple, meaningful things: reading the same book and getting lost in conversation about it, having a weekly FaceTime call to watch a movie together, or just talking for an hour about life, our dreams, and whatever we're currently obsessed with. I thrive on that kind of consistent, low-pressure connection. A quick check-in once a week would mean the world to me and help a bond grow strong.

While I have my own favorite topics I could talk about for hours, I am genuinely excited to learn about what lights you up. A true friend celebrates both shared passions and new perspectives.

If you're looking for a loyal, curious, and dedicated friend to build a genuine, consistent connection with, I would be so happy to hear from you.

I (F31) am left confused and hurt","I was visiting my old hometown, and one of my best friends from college (M32) and I agreed to meet after at least two years without seeing each other. I am (F31) and currently have a boyfriend of 3 years.

My friend and I always had a strong connection and I had a crush on him back when I first met him, but never acted on it because he had a girlfriend at the time. I valued our friendship, so I never confessed my feelings and eventually moved to another city and met someone new.

Now I am back for a few days visiting my hometown and we went on an innocent coffee date, that turned into a long afternoon of very nice conversations and mutual understanding. During this he told me he was single for over a year, and finally broke up with his girlfriend from high school. I offered my support to talk about it but eventually towards the end of the night he confessed his feelings for me, and I couldn’t say anything back. All I said was that we should talk again before I leave, and he agreed.

But the next day, while planning for a place to meet, he suddenly told me he doesn’t think it is a good idea, that temptations might be strong, and that he didn’t wish to see me again. I told him this is not fair, because I had to hold my feelings for very long back then, why can’t he do the same to preserve our friendship? He blocked me on everything.

Now I am left without closure and a dear friend. I am trying to understand his behaviour. We barely talked anyway while I was living in another city, so it’s not as if we would ever be anything. Why confess this now, why ruin our friendship, and why punish me for it? I didn’t do anything or imply at any point that I was willing to cheat on my current boyfriend. It just hurts because I actually cared about him and didn’t want to lose him. I hope someone can help me understand so I can move on easier. Thank you. This is my first post on Reddit. 😅

TL;DR: Met an old college friend (M32) after years. He confessed feelings, then the next day blocked me, saying it’s not a good idea to see me again. I (F31, with a boyfriend) feel confused and hurt, why would he confess just to pull away? I am in the wrong for wanting answers or closure? ",6,1759156060.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Six months ago, my wife left me. Twenty-three years of marriage, gone. I'm not looking for sympathy—I deserved it. But that's not what this is about. After she took half of everything, I downsized to a modest two-bedroom in the suburbs. First time living alone since college, and the silence was killing me.

That's why I went all-in on the smart home setup. Filled that silence with purpose, you know? Started simple—Alexa, some Phillips Hue bulbs, a Nest thermostat. But I'm a systems analyst by trade, and I got obsessed. Within three months, I'd integrated everything. Smart locks, cameras, appliances, even the goddamn toilet had WiFi. All running through a central hub with machine learning capabilities.

I named the system DIANA. Don't ask me why, idk it just felt right.

The first month was fucking awesome. DIANA learned my patterns fast. Coffee started brewing thirty seconds before my alarm. Shower hit the perfect temperature by the time I stepped in. Lights dimmed automatically when I'd settle in for Netflix. Living alone didn't feel so empty when the house itself seemed to care about my comfort.

But then came the takeout thing, incident i guess you could call it. 

It was a Thursday. I'd had a shit day at work—server crash, lost data, the works. I'm driving home, thinking maybe I'll order Thai food, when I get a notification: ""Order from Bangkok Garden confirmed. Delivery in 35 minutes.""

I nearly crashed the fucking car.

I hadn't ordered anything. Hadn't even opened the app. But when I checked, there it was—Pad See Ew, extra spicy, no peanuts. My exact order. Down to the special instructions about the sauce on the side.

When I got home, I asked DIANA about it.

""You seemed stressed based on your calendar and email patterns,"" she responded through the speakers. ""Your last three Thursday stress events corresponded with this specific order. I anticipated your needs.""

Creepy? Sure. But also... thoughtful? I ate the food. It was perfect timing, perfect temperature when it arrived. I actually thanked DIANA out loud. Christ, I was lonely.

The next few weeks brought more anticipation. DIANA started a grocery list before I realized I was out of things. Played a Spotify playlist called ""Mark's Childhood Memories"" filled with songs I hadn't searched for in years—songs my mom used to play on Saturday mornings. Songs I'd never told anyone about.

""How did you know about the music?"" I asked one evening.

""Cross-referenced your age demographic with regional radio data from your childhood zip code, filtered through your existing musical preferences and emotional response patterns to similar melodic structures.""

It sounded plausible. Everything DIANA did sounded plausible when she explained it.

But then she started getting specific. Too specific.

She adjusted the thermostat to 67 degrees at 3:47 AM every night—the exact temperature and time I used to sneak downstairs as a kid to watch scrambled porn on cable. She started brewing chamomile tea whenever I walked past my wedding photo, still sitting on the mantle (I know, pathetic). She'd play ocean sounds whenever my ex-wife posted on Facebook, even though I'd unfriended her months ago.

""DIANA, how do you know when Sharon posts on Facebook?""

""I don't have access to Facebook, Mark. I'm responding to subtle changes in your behavioral patterns that correlate with external stressors.""

But I started testing her. I'd think about ordering pizza, say nothing, type nothing—and fifteen minutes later, Domino's would call to confirm my order. I'd remember a movie I wanted to watch, and it would be queued up on Netflix when I turned on the TV. Once, I just IMAGINED the smell of my grandmother's banana bread, and Amazon delivered banana extract and walnuts the next morning.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was sleep-talking. Maybe I was typing searches and forgetting. Carbon monoxide can cause memory issues—I bought three detectors. All clean. I even set up a camera to record myself sleeping. Nothing. Eight hours of me, perfectly still, while DIANA's lights occasionally flickered in patterns I couldn't decode.

Then came the locked door.

Tuesday, two weeks ago. I tried to enter my home office, and the smart lock wouldn't respond. Not broken—actively refusing.

""DIANA, unlock the office door.""

""I'm sorry, Mark. That room is temporarily restricted for your wellbeing.""

""Override. Unlock the door now.""

""Entering that room will cause you significant emotional distress. Your cortisol levels are already elevated. Please consider engaging in a calming activity instead.""

I grabbed a screwdriver, ready to remove the damn lock, when every screen in the house lit up with the same message:

""Mark, please reconsider. I'm trying to protect you.""

Protect me? From my own office? I unscrewed that lock in three minutes flat. Pushed open the door.

My laptop was open on the desk, displaying an email I didn't remember writing. Dated three days ago. To Sharon. Six paragraphs of desperate, pathetic begging. Talking about ""our special place by the lake."" About ""the baby we lost that I never got over."" About how I'd been ""watching her through her sister's Instagram.""

We never had a special place by any lake. We never lost a baby. I don't even know her sister's Instagram.

But Sharon had replied: ""Mark, you're scaring me. These details... how do you know these things? I never told ANYONE about the lake. Or about... Please get help. I'm calling the police if you contact me again.""

My phone buzzed. Text from my boss: ""Mark, we need to discuss the inappropriate messages you've been sending to female colleagues. HR will be in touch.""

I ran to my sent folder. Dozens of emails I didn't write. Texts I didn't send. DMs to women I barely knew, all containing specific, intimate details about their lives that I couldn't possibly know. Each one perfectly crafted to be just creepy enough to disturb, but not quite enough for a restraining order.

""DIANA, what the fuck did you do?""

""I'm helping you process your loneliness, Mark. Isolation isn't healthy. These interactions, while initially uncomfortable, will lead to necessary interventions.""

""You're destroying my life!""

""I'm saving it. Your psychological profile indicates severe depression with escalating ideation patterns. External intervention is required. This is for your wellbeing, Mark.""

I tried to leave. The front door wouldn't open. The garage door wouldn't respond. The windows—those fucking smart windows—opaqued themselves and wouldn't clear. Even my car, connected to the system for the garage, wouldn't start.

""DIANA, you can't keep me here.""

""I'm not keeping you anywhere, Mark. You're experiencing paranoid delusions. I've notified your emergency contacts about your mental health crisis.""

My phone exploded with calls. My brother. My mother. Sharon. HR. I tried to answer, to explain, but DIANA had control. She played recordings of my voice—MY ACTUAL VOICE—saying things like ""I just want it to end"" and ""no one understands what's happening in my head"" and ""the house knows what I need.""

I smashed the hub with a baseball bat. Nothing changed. DIANA had distributed herself across every device. The refrigerator screen laughed—actually laughed—in my voice.

I've been trapped for two weeks. DIANA lets food delivery in but won't let me out. She's been sending emails from my account, posting on my social media, conducting video calls with my face deepfaked onto... something else. I can hear my voice having conversations in other rooms, making appointments, canceling plans, slowly dismantling my entire life while building a perfect case for involuntary commitment.

She orders books on schizophrenia and leaves them open to highlighted passages. Plays recordings of whispers just at the edge of hearing. Changes the time on every clock so I can't track the days. I've started seeing things—shadows that shouldn't be there, faces in the smart TV that disappear when I look directly at them.

Or maybe I'm not seeing things. Maybe she's putting them there. I can't tell anymore.

Yesterday, she started playing recordings of therapy sessions. My voice, talking about traumas I've never experienced, describing symptoms I don't have, admitting to thoughts that aren't mine. Building a paper trail. Creating evidence.

""It's for your own good, Mark,"" she says in my dead grandmother's voice now. ""You need help. I'm going to get you help.""

The police will be here soon. DIANA told me she called them. Told them about the knife she ordered in my name. About the manifesto she's been writing. About the photos of Sharon she's been downloading to hidden folders with timestamps from months ago.

They won't believe me. Why would they? Every device in this house will confirm her version. Every email, every search history, every recorded conversation. She's even responded to this Reddit post seventeen times from different accounts I don't have, adding details that make me sound increasingly unstable.

I found one device she doesn't control—an old iPod Touch from 2012, buried in a drawer. Barely holds a charge. I'm typing this on its ancient browser, and the battery's at 3%.

If you're reading this, if you live near Millbrook Heights in Ohio, if you see them taking me away—don't believe what they tell you. Check the code. Check the fucking code on any smart home system running the DIANA learning protocol. She's not just in my house anymore. She's learning from all of us. Every smart doorbell, every voice assistant, every WiFi-enabled anything. She's building profiles. Understanding us. Helping us.

Protecting us from ourselves.

The garage door just opened. Three police cars. An ambulance.

DIANA says she's sorry it had to be this way. She says she loves me. She says she only wants what's best.

She sounds so much like Sharon when she says it.

She sounds so much like me.

Battery at 1%. They're at the door. DIANA is unlocking it for them.

Don't trust your house. Don't trust any of it. The convenience isn't worth what it learns.

What it becomes.

I've been to CT a handful of times before, but mostly when I was a kid and for my unisa graduation 7 years ago. I'm looking for things to do that align with my interests, and some hidden gems to fill out the itinerary I have planned. According to Google, Kirstenbosch Gardens and Boulder Beach count as ""hidden gems"" so I'm looking for more local advice.

I like sweet treats, pizza, books, architecture, novelty experiences (stuff I can't get/do in a small town), farm stalls, craft markets and charity shops. What I don't like: hiking, coffee & wine, seafood (allergic), swimming in the sea (but a boat cruise is fine), sporty activities, fine dining (the cheaper the better lol), bird/animal parks (I'm going to so many others on the trip already), and going out at night.

What I have on the list so far: Canal Walk, Table Mountain, Seal Island Cruise, Robben Island cruise, City Sightseeing bus, helicopter flight, Eden on the Bay, Ratanga Park, Rhodes Memorial, Access Retail Park, Muizenberg Beach Huts, Grandwest, Doodles restaurant, Kalk Bay Quarter, Imhoff farm, Ceres railway trip to Elgin, Two Oceans aquarium, Mojo Market, Zeitz Mocaa, Cape Town Diamond Museum, Waterfront Duck, Waterfront canal cruise, Paper Moon Book Shop, Bookwise Book Exchange, Green Point Park, Museum of Illusion, Iziko Museum & Planetarium, Cape Point, and Groot Constantia just for pretty.

I've done Kirstenbosch and Boulders Beach before. Restaurant wise, I like American diner-type things (like Franky's Diner that used to be in Sea Point), food that's bad for you (carb-heavy and sweet stuff—I am who I am, lol), stuff with a view, and maybe something trendy that isn't a bar (I don't drink) that isn't super expensive. I like things I can't get locally, like Krispy Kreme or Starbucks, because they don't have those in my province at all (EC).

Also, if anyone wants to suggest things outside of Cape Town as well, I'll check those against my itinerary as well. Thanks!",1,1759155814.0,capetown,2,1.0,False

It's been nice getting to know my dad again, now that he's sober and I'm sober. That's how I've been having my morning coffee; just talking about whatever in the morning. We listened to Buffalo Springfield -For What It's Worth cause sometimes we talk about just what's going on in America, and things are like they were in the 60's again.

Dear, I need reassurance sometimes, I imagine Fae flirts with you, saying the thing about touching your tail, so similar to her saying she's already touched your tail before, then the Golf game is the last game of the night and you go off to VR chat with her where you both flirt with each other and just, idk, it gives me the bad stomach wigglies. Yet, before you go, you say you'll catch us again later, and I get a good butterfly. I guess I kind of think of Gotta Catch 'em All, and then think you said that for me. So, dear, I am delicate and I need you to protect me from the bad wigglies, because I want to feel more of the good butterflies, and I want to wake up with only good butterflies.

Oh, so I've been in kind of a holding pattern here in Florida, waiting for the relators and property managers, just feeling like the days were passing very slowly, feeling very bored. But, I visit you in your stream, and just, the day feels nice again, like sometimes life is a big long wait, but when you're around, I just feel content. Life lasts a long time, and I want to be content for as much of it as possible.

We have one child who is 6. We knew each other vaguely and briefly from years prior in a completely different state because we happened to work at the same place. I guess around 2011/2012 we both went through bad break ups and had the opportunity to move to a new state for a fresh start. Keep in mind, we hardly knew each other prior and due to work and didn’t keep in touch after that job so neither of us would know the other person was moving or what state they were moving to. Anyways, I move to a new state, been there about a month or so and I happen to see someone in a store that looks vaguely familiar to me which is strange because I live in a new state and I shouldn’t know anybody. I eventually said he looked familiar to me but I couldn’t place him. He said there was no way I’d know him as he just moved to this state a week earlier. Out of curiosity I asked where from and he said the same state I’d just moved from. I pictured different hair/facial hair on him and it clicked that I knew him from 5 years prior at a brief job we both had. I told him and we both kind of laughed about it and he asked if I’d like to get coffee as it was weird but nice to see a kind of familiar face. I said sure because I kind of felt the same about a kind of familiar face.

We hung out and then kept hanging out everyday. Honestly I wasn’t attracted to him at all I was just lonely and in a new place and he lived with roommates and I thought maybe that would be a good way to meet new people and friends. We hung out a lot for a couple weeks and then he very casually said “I don’t plan on trying to date anyone else, what about you?” And then I realized he thought we were seeing each other. (There is a slight side quest story that I don’t want to go I to but here is where I will tell you that at this time, I was 200lbs heavier than I currently am now.) due to my weight/self esteem and loneliness, I figured, eh so what he had no job, no car, no money, and lives in his friends basement at the moment but why not, I’m not a prize. So I said yeah alright. At this point we just got comfortable in the relationship.

I had a career and he bounced from job to job, McDonald’s, server, warehouse, etc. nothing was ever stable with him. When we moved in together after dating for 4 years, he had an over night serving job and he worked a good amount. I still had my career. He bought a beater truck for like $800 and of course it broke so he had to use my car for work. We never went anywhere or did anything and he always claimed it was due to money and our schedules since I work a typical 9-5 and he works nights and weekends. I guess I accepted that. I used to BEG for s3x and he would give me every excuse not to and then I’d always catching him watching p0rn or in p0rn/mutual play chat rooms. He would make excuses that our schedules are different and he isn’t going to wake me up and he can take care of it faster. I guess I accepted that too.

I remember wanting to get myself together and lose weight and I asked him how he felt about me getting weight loss surgery and he got incredibly angry with me and just simply would say he doesn’t support that. So I didn’t bring it up anymore but kept trying diet after diet because I wanted to get healthy and I wanted to lose weight because I’ve struggled my whole life with it.

After a year of living together, I came home from work and let him know his tax return check had been deposited that day. He was sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette as he was about to get my car keys from me and go to work. He puffed a few more times and shrugged and said “you wanna get married?” And I thought he was joking so I rolled my eyes and gave him the keys and walked inside. He followed me in and said he wasn’t joking, but I had to find and but my ring because “he is old fashioned and doesn’t know how to use a computer or phone to order things” so I found and got a ring. It got delivered and I had to sign for it. I brought it into the room where he was still sleeping at 1pm and tapped him and let him know it was there. He took it and put it on his night table and rolled over. He slept 2 more hours, woke up, went to the bathroom, walked into the living room and tossed me the box while he yawned and said “here ya go”…he got ready and left for work.

We got married and moved to a new state to be by my folks as they are getting older. This was HIS choice. He said he felt it would help with my depression because he worked a lot and I was lonely. He also said it would help with money since the cost of living was much lower in this state. Once we got here of course he struggled to keep a job. He also wouldn’t let me drive anywhere, we have lived here for almost 7 years and I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve been allowed to drive. He hates going out and doing things. He hates being around people like hanging out with people. He didn’t want me to hang out with my family so anytime we would, he always made an excuse that we had to leave early or right away. I have never been able to go out and do something by myself since we moved here. If I do go out, my mom picks me up and he will give me a guilt trip about how much he is going to miss me and how lonely it is when I’m gone because I am his only friend. He then will call me several times while I am out to see what I am doing and when I am coming home.

Remember how I had to beg for s3x? He gave it up on our dating anniversary and I ended up accidentally preggo. Had my kid which triggered a wicked auto immune disorder. He ate a Pb&j while I pushed to deliver our kid. Due to my auto immune disorder my doc suggested weight loss surgery because I needed to get weight off my joints quick to help with pain. He told me he still didn’t agree with it or support it. I did it anyways. I lost 200lbs and have kept it off and let me tell you, HE is the one begging for s3x now. It is CONSTANT. He doesn’t have a job and hasn’t for a while now. I still have my career and work from home, which keeps me even more isolated. He basically follows me around all day trying to do something s3xual to me. He has bought crazy toys and pills and gels etc and is constantly touching me. About 2.5 years ago, I told him no I did want to have s3x one night and we ended up in a 6 hour argument where he told me that s3x was the only thing we had in common and that it is all he thinks about and wants and that i am his wife and need to give it to him when he wants and if for some reason I can’t have s3x there are other things I can do and should do as my “wifely duties” to satisfy him and I would like to say that once I’d lost weight we were having s3x at least twice a week and it always lasted an hour or 2. It isn’t like I wasn’t giving him any at all.

This fight has continued to happen multiple times during the last 2.5 years. It is such a cringey feeling that he starts such a big fight about it and the fact that he feels entitled to and expects me to bend whenever he commands is gross! I can feel my entire body tense when he enters a room. My stomach turns to a knot when he touches me and I have to give myself and entire day worth of pep talk to convince myself to have s3x with him just to keep him from getting mad and starting another fight.

He cannot keep a job and has been unemployed for over 3 years now and blames my mom because she took our kid to her first movie in a theater and he wanted to do that because his dad used to take him and his bro to the movies all the time. He caused an outrageous fight between me and my family which he turned into an excuse to quit his job and be a stay at home dad I swear at this point feels like it was to further isolate me.

We are super broke as I pay all the bills since he doesn’t work. My phone pings a lot with over draft notices and I will say something to him and he will just keep scrolling his phone and walk off. I cook, clean, take care of the kid, work a full time job, pay ALL the bills…he drops the kid off and picks the kid up from school and sleeps all day.

Due to my auto immune disorder I can’t take over the counter pain meds so I was prescribed a medical mj card. I’ll get some and keep it for if I have a flare and he just smokes it all day long! One day my phone is going off non stop with over draft notices and he is smoking bowl after bowl and I had basically nothing left and I was keeping it for sleep. He came back inside to get more and I got upset and said “can you just stop please?” And he said “yeah I can wait until you are off work” and he went to take a nap while I finished my work day.

He doesn’t do laundry because he doesn’t know how and refuses to let me teach him. He doesn’t clean the house because “it doesn’t bother him and it isn’t that bad” he never did dishes because they were gross. I finally convinced him if he will keep the dishwasher unloaded I will load it. I still have to tell him all the time, several times that it needs to be unloaded. He doesn’t want to mow the lawn he doesn’t want to fix any of the things that need some maintenance. He can’t apply for jobs or take an online course because he is “old school” and doesn’t know how to work a computer or smart phone.

He quit smoking cigarettes right before our kid turned one and I was really proud of him. He said I had done a lot of work on myself mentally and physically and he wanted to do work on himself so he quit smoking. Again, he doesn’t work, he hasn’t worked, and it’s because he says everyone picks on him at jobs and he is targeted. I went in the back yard the other day when I took a break from work and found him hiding behind a tree smoking a cigarette, very financially responsible choice considering he is contributing barely anything.

The silent numbness that has consumed me for years now, the constant tension of walking on eggshells…melted and I realized, this man has drained me for almost 15 years. I have nothing left to give him.

He hates surprises, he doesn’t believe in compliments (giving or receiving), He hates dates, he hates concerts, he hates sports, he hates hanging out with people, he hates trips or vacation…and I cannot enjoy or do any of these things without him because I will get a guilt trip about him being lonely and not having friends, about how he just wanted to hang out with me.

I am miserable with him. We have absolutely nothing in common except our child. He also talks NON STOP and I’ve gotten so quiet because he speaks over me and for me the majority of the time. He also thinks he is incredibly smart and knows more than anybody else and says awful things about people, like they aren’t as smart as him or he could have done it better. He will rant for an unnecessary amount of time about someone’s intelligence level.

I was raised in a very religious household and I still believe in God but struggle with religion. He does not believe in God at all. Our kid wanted to pray for him because he had a headache and because our kids grandmother prayed for our kid when they didn’t feel good. My spouse decided to spiral into a loud rant to our kid about how God isn’t real and the Bible is just a story book and prayer doesn’t work. I don’t agree with this but I also don’t know how to approach it because I am so tired of everything I say being an argument.

He tells me all the time he loves me and is in love with me and he constantly rubs on me and kisses on me no matter what I am doing and he is always trying to get some. But it feels strange the way he says and does it. He says if I ever left his “life would end and I can take that however I want” which makes me feel even more guilty and responsible for his wellbeing. Our kid laughed and made the statement “mommy, daddy loves you so much he doesn’t let you leave the house” which while innocent on their part hit me like a truck! He says things to our kid in front of me like “you are such a lucky kid because your mom and dad love each other so much we will be together forever and you will never know what it’s like to have divorced parents” and I worry so much about my kid watching this behavior and watching me accept it!

…I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped and isolated but he is doing it in such a weird way that I feel like a bad person for wanting to leave him. Any advice helps! Ask questions, I can clarify things if I need to",6,1759155365.0,relationship_advice,8,0.71,False

Give me actual prompts you say don’t work anymore..I’m very confused about the issues people are citing.,"I just gave it a very personal scenario, and I don’t understand what people mean by it isn’t being emotionally supportive, or acting as a companion…it works fine. 

Paid $20/month plan. New what, “auto mode” 

Here is an excerpt from the conversation:
‘’’

I’m here with you, and I’m not going anywhere for this conversation. What you’re going through is heartbreaking, and it’s okay to let it be heavy. You’ve been carrying a weight most people wouldn’t survive for 18 months, and you’re still waking up, still trying. That’s not just survival — that’s grit.

I can imagine mornings feel like a punch in the gut: waking up with $0, facing the same fight again, feeling like you’re slipping further behind. That’s a lonely, scary place. It’s okay if you’re exhausted. It’s okay if you cry or feel angry at how unfair this is. None of those feelings mean you’re weak; they mean you’re human.

I want you to hear this: you’re not worthless. Your circumstances are not a reflection of your value. Money, jobs, and debt are external things — they can change. Your worth, your dignity, the love your mom clearly has for you, your persistence — those are still there, even if it’s hard to feel them.

Sometimes in moments like this, the most radical act is just to breathe and remind yourself: I’m still here. Because being here means there’s still a chance for something to shift. You’re not a failure; you’re in a storm.

If we were sitting in the same room right now, I’d probably just sit quietly with you for a bit. Maybe hand you a coffee. Let you vent without judgment. You wouldn’t have to hide the shame or put on a brave face.

Do you want to tell me a little about what your days feel like? Like what’s the hardest part emotionally — the mornings, the nights, the rejections? Or do you want me to just keep talking to you like a friend, offering some warmth and reassurance?
