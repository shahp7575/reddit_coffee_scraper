My partner is into coffee, she is Greek so she enjoys preparing strong espressos in different ways. She has always been drawn to owning an Espresso machine but lacks the money. That is why I am gifting one to her.

I am completely blindsided due to the fact that beyond Nespresso machines I know nothing. I have seen Hibrew on Aliexpress has good reviews as a first Espresso machine.

However, because I lack the knowledge I come to you to help me decide which machine should I buy as a first one for my coffee enthusiast partner below £200",1,1762604384.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1oro0k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1oro0k1/my_inlaws_ignored_my_son_on_his_2nd_birthday_do_i/,"My in-laws ignored my son on his 2nd birthday, do I have to ever forgive them?","My mother in-law has been a challenge I was willing to tackle for 6 years, but things have escalated beyond my comprehension. My husband has a child from a prior relationship, and when we started dating (again, we dated for a short bit in college) I found it intense how often my now MIL wanted to talk badly about his ex-girlfriend. My MIL created enough tension in my husband’s relationship with his child’s mother after they had their baby that they went no contact for a year. She told me about it herself, multiple times, highlighting her disdain for his ex-girlfriend. Red flags were flying, but my husband warned me she just loved to yap and to ignore it. He’s a great guy so some things are bearable, what started to rub me the wrong way was when MIL started spending time with his ex-girlfriend and her grandchild (their child together). They would go shopping for clothes for grandchild, pedicures, and lunches out. All paid by my MIL under the guise of “school clothes shopping.” I was never invited, or asked about it.

Lots of meet ups with the ex-girlfriend to pick up and drop off our daughter, so sometimes people run a little late. His ex started calling my MIL to complain if my husband ran late, ironically he works full time in a respectable field while his ex-girlfriend was unemployed starting up freelance photography. He travels for work A LOT, the fact that he can schedule down to the quarter hour like she requests is down right incredible accommodation and cooperation on his end in the first place. His mother would then call us, both, one after another to let us know both her and his ex’s displeasure. This continued even after we had a baby together, which we felt deserved a bit of grace if we were loading a car up with 2 kids to meet his ex-girlfriend who needed to get herself only to point B. She too, had had her fair share of running late so complaining about it is hypocritical.

There are quite literally so many micro aggressions I could post about, so I’ll try to keep it to main points. My pregnancy was hard, I was diagnosed with polyhydramnios (way too much amniotic fluid) and pregnancy-induced cholestasis (basically third trimester liver failure and the baby being delivered is the only thing to stop it). My baby was in the NICU 9 days, and we returned home for the first time on the 10th day, I had a C-section so I was overwhelmed with joy to be comfy and with my family. Insert, MIL from hell… two days after being home my MIL came to my house to pick up my (step) child. She said they were going “school clothes shopping,” which I knew exactly who she was going to meet with, husband’s ex-girlfriend. Child didn’t want to go, because the new baby was exciting. MIL started raising her voice about how she should just go all by herself, get her nails done by herself, have a day she deserves with a coffee and all sorts of bullshit, going off on a 6 year old. In my home, while I’m holding my newborn. Horrified, I watched them finally leave, my (step) child crying and reluctant. I knew this was not normal at all at that point.

It came to a head for me after years of manipulation when they planned a photo shoot with my son behind my back. My father in law picked up my son for the day to spend time together, which was normal. A month prior, we all went to a school performance for step child where my MIL sat next to my husbands ex, and I heard them yapping about an upcoming photography session she was offering. My MIL liked to pester me to take the kids to get photos done by my husband’s ex, she would tell me it’s healthy for my step child to see us getting along. Overbearing, considering she is nasty, spiteful, and speaks horribly of her ex-husband of 27 years ago… and she is seemingly happily remarried. I obliged earlier that year with some Christmas photos, so I was a little surprised when she didn’t hound me to sign up for this session. Doing it behind my back seemed more fun! My husband’s ex went to their house with her child to take pictures of the two of them together. It was without my knowledge until my stepchild mentioned a few days later that she had gone and seen her brother and took photos with mommy. I furiously sent a text to my MIL about how I was done being treated like garbage, and my step child notices it’s unequal how I never get invited and it’s inappropriate. The next day I had a 3 hour phone call with my father in law, where he tore me to shreds. I am basically not the type of daughter in law they want, so my MIL is entitled to act nasty upon her opinions in their eyes. They gave my husband an heirloom vintage ring for my wedding ring, which the jeweler who repaired it for me (yep, we had to repair a snapped band… I believe this was another sign of her growing resentment of me) told me it was not for daily wear. My father in law demanded it back because I didn’t wear it enough. It has been 6 months since I have spoken to them, and they have called my husband twice to argue. He does not contact them either.

My son’s birthday was 3 months ago. Formerly involved aunts and uncles on his dad’s side are no contact with us now over my argument with my in laws, but I was surprised when nobody reached out to even say happy birthday. I was too nervous to navigate a birthday party, so we had a small gathering at my mom’s house with minimal birthday pizazz. My in-laws didn’t call or send a card to say happy birthday, but gave gifts to my step child at her mother’s house for her birthday. It just doesn’t add up to me, it feels like they are now treating my son like he isn’t their grandchild to punish me. I think I never want to speak to them again, but my husband could make amends and he could visit with the children for their sakes. He has no desire to speak to them either at this time. My MIL regularly sees my step child at her mothers house and remains in contact with my husbands ex, and husbands ex is now treating me cold. What do I do next?

1ornxde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yourfirstsong/comments/1ornxde/ideas/,Ideas,"How to Catch Song Ideas Like a Pro! 😉🎶

Struggling to find that perfect spark for your next track? No worries! Getting cool ideas doesn't have to be a drag. Here are a few simple tips with a little wink:

* **Ears Open, World In:** Imagine your life is a movie and you're collecting soundbites. Listen in on conversations (subtly, of course 😉), a funny sound, or a catchy phrase. Boom, there's your next song title or hook!
* **Your Life is the Party:** Who needs fiction when your own life is the coolest story? Whether it's heartbreak, a high five moment, or the struggle with the coffee machine – write about it! Authentic is always the most awesome.
* **Bookworm Meets Beatmaker:** Treat yourself to a good movie, a novel, or check out some art. Characters, quotes, or moods can give you the perfect vibe for your song. 🍿
* **Instrument Swap Shop:** Grab a ukulele instead of your guitar, or try a totally weird chord progression. A little chaos often creates the coolest melodies. Think outside the box!
* **Just Do It!:** Don't wait for the perfect idea; it usually hits you when you're in the shower anyway. Just start writing without overthinking. The first draft is rarely perfect, but perfectly imperfect for building on! ✍️
* **The Idea Vault:** Always have a notebook (or your phone) ready to go. Ideas are like popcorn – they pop up everywhere. Be ready to catch them before they're gone!

With these tricks, you'll be the idea-catcher-in-chief, and your tracks will just pour out! Have fun grooving! 🥳

1ornwnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1ornwnq/antihustle_hustle_manifesto_nus/,"Anti-Hustle, Hustle Manifesto! (NUS)","I do not fake happiness when peers get a higher grade than me. I am the embodiment of the toxic NUS student that every NTU kid hates: the competitive, antisocial, ‘go-home after school’ person. I believe I should be a genuine and authentic person and not fake something I'm not feeling.

I love class participation, curating speeches, using jargon, and seeing the devastated and disgusted looks on people's faces, then eating lunch alone. I also like getting alienated by peers because of this, it means zero pressure to cater to their social games and emotional needs, saving more energy for the GPA grind. Then, I replace all the ""networking"" I missed out with trying to impress profs, and wiping it in the class chat poll that I have my shit together when prof asks ""Whos coming???""

Just doing this to CDE peers is not enough. I began to take up useless FASS mods just to irritate the humanities kids. My fat, 3D modelling laptop fans are so obnoxiously loud that I declare my existence in a faculty that I don't matter in. I then proceed to use more jargon around the FASS kids.

The commitment towards academics has turned me into a minimalist monk without a young adulthood. I don't make new friends, don't experience many new things. I only own 2 outfits so that I don't waste time on ""stupid"" things like self-expression, fashion and consumerism. Survive school drinking 1 dollar coffee. I love competing with campus minimalists on who is more anti-consumerist.

I also have no love life. No human in NUS has ever asked me out. Traditional asian aunties would love it if their kids brought me home, as I'm tall, not fat, modest, obedient, no personality and have GPA to show. Yet, nothing. Might be because I'm eerie to be around. Just like what my parents say.

I believe I am ~80% the embodiment of the perfect asian kid, yet...my parents seem to be breaking down about my future. I'm not sure why but they are convinced I'm not gonna make it in life, might die, go broke or commit crime, when the neighbour's kids all got rejected by NUS, smoking and working in Mcdonalds. Perhaps, they just have mid-life crises and are projecting on me. But hey i really wanna know why they break down about me often.

One might think: someone who lives like this must be rather ambitious. Quite the contrary, I have no goals at all. I'm really just trying to milk the school system to farm dopamine daily, for my neurodivergent brain. New knowledge = dopamine, good grade = dopamine.

I believe school = lore, and my hard work and selfishness is not toxicity or ambition, it's a philosophy. Saying it louder to the NTU kids at the back.

I wish that by age 30, I can comfortably afford more Blokees toys to play with, while I tell my parents “I don't need a job, I need more knowledge.”

I'm the Anti-hustle hustler. Hustle is bad. If I can't fight the system, I aim to become a comedic caricature of it by conforming so hard I turn gross and annoying. Yet I know, I don't matter much in the system at all, I'm just a delusional, ordinary Joe desperately trying to carve meaning, in a world that has no meaning.",2,1762603991.0,SGExams,1,0.67,False

Grief is never invited, but it comes by anyway 

Grief is faceless, but always recognisable

Grief peers over my shoulder when I’m ascending the elevator to work, or in the steam of my morning cup of coffee 

Grief is in the eyes of my loved ones, reflected back at me, ruminating from their loving hugs 

Grief lives all around me, sometimes it’s very loud and refuses to be ignored or made numb. It also likes to visit on a quiet day, tip toeing inside for a brief moment, or in the faces of passing strangers on the tube. 

Grief is the pangs in my belly when I hear my dad’s favourite songs while doing the laundry. It is my tear stains on my husband’s shirt while he holds me in my darkest hours. 

Grief never learnt boundaries, it frequents my dreams and disrupts my waking day conversations. Grief wriggles under my shower curtain and plonks itself right on my nose. 

Grief is a party of two, forever entwined, cupping my hand and always my invisible plus one (just in case it wishes to join).

Your direct to consumer boots deserve the same QC your partner offerings, like those with Division Road, get. You don’t send them boots with loose grain, crooked uppers, and wonky stitching, so why send that bullsh!t to your loyal, direct customers? 
We’re not going to mention the gaslight bs, when you FINALLY get ahold of customer service.

My Philips EP2220 started to leak and the coffee cups were filled to only 3/4 of the cup. I replaced all the O-rings and now I see a massive leak on the left side of the machine (see video). I watched multiple Youtube tutorials how to fix leaks but non of them shows a leak at this place. Any idea what I could do?

Thanks!

But planning a trip there can be overwhelming, there are hundreds of YouTube videos and travel vlogs, each recommending something different. It’s easy to get lost in all that content before even starting to plan.

So, I turned to AI TripBot, it generated a complete 3-day itinerary in under 8 seconds.

I'm thinking fasting from after Sunday dinner through to Tuesday morning, then the same starting Wednesday evening. The hardest part I think will be my disgruntled other half, as eating and cooking is a big thing for us really. I know a lot of people get though it by hitting the coffee, but that's not really an option for me as it kind of disagrees with my gut. I'll be drinking plenty of cups of tea and water though. Should I be taking supplements, isotonic drinks?

Also, can I work out on a fast day? I usually only got the gym twice a week and it depends what my work schedule is like, so I can't plan my gym days so rigidly.

I'm 5'11"" 209lbs male if it makes any difference - but kind of a slender frame, so I think I'd be looking to lose at least 20-25lbs to get to a point where I'm happy with the way I look.

Any advice appreciated, especially relating to making it stick and becoming a regular part of my life.

EDIT: Just to provide some context, I have tried OMAD and 16:8 but found it tricky to stick to. I feel having two clearly defined days rules out any ambiguity and is a routine other people will be aware of and can adjust to.",1,1762603790.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Seeking a genuine connection of mind, body and soul.

Someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

Be it to grab a cozy coffee, chat the day away or maybe watch a movie.

I really wanted one, but I didn’t feel like going alone. Usually, I always have someone to go with, but today, of all days, no one was around.

For a few minutes, I kept debating it. Part of me wanted to go, but then I thought, *“Whatever, it’s fine if I don’t go today. I’ll survive without coffee.”* So I put on my shoes, grabbed my dog, and went out for a walk instead. While walking, I was doing my SP affirmations like I always do.

About ten minutes into my walk, I ran into someone I know. We started talking, and in the middle of it, my uncle who happens to be friends with him called to ask if he wanted to grab a coffee. He said, *“I’m actually with your niece right now,”* and my uncle immediately invited both of us to join him.

So yeah, a few minutes later I was sitting at a café with them, drinking coffee, chatting, and laughing. My uncle even mentioned he’d tried to call me earlier to invite me for coffee, but my home phone wasn’t working for some reason, so he called this friend instead because they always meet for a coffee.

It wasn’t until I got back home that it hit me I’d been thinking about wanting a coffee, and somehow it just happened. Everything lined up perfectly without me even trying.

People, I didn’t believe it until I got home and thought, *“Wait a damn minute, is this a coincidence or is this manifestation?”* Speechless that just by thinking about a coffee, all of this came together.

1ornqy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestation_support/comments/1ornqy6/the_coffee_that_made_me_believe/,The coffee that made me believe,"Today I was at home, thinking about going out for a coffee  something I do almost every day, even on Saturdays. I really wanted one, but I didn’t feel like going alone. Usually, I always have someone to go with, but today, of all days, no one was around.

For a few minutes, I kept debating it. Part of me wanted to go, but then I thought, *“Whatever, it’s fine if I don’t go today. I’ll survive without coffee.”* So I put on my shoes, grabbed my dog, and went out for a walk instead. While walking, I was doing my SP affirmations like I always do.

About ten minutes into my walk, I ran into someone I know. We started talking, and in the middle of it, my uncle who happens to be friends with him  called to ask if he wanted to grab a coffee. He said, *“I’m actually with your niece right now,”* and my uncle immediately invited both of us to join him.

So yeah, a few minutes later I was sitting at a café with them, drinking coffee, chatting, and laughing. My uncle even mentioned he’d tried to call me earlier to invite me for coffee, but my home phone wasn’t working for some reason, so he called this friend instead because they always meet for a coffee.

It wasn’t until I got back home that it hit me I’d been thinking about wanting a coffee, and somehow it just happened. Everything lined up perfectly without me even trying.

People, I didn’t believe it until I got home and thought, *“Wait a damn minute, is this a coincidence or is this manifestation?”* Speechless that just by thinking about a coffee, all of this came together.",2,1762603459.0,manifestation_support,3,1.0,False

The defense has been solid, no where near last year but just solid. Cant do much when your offense is a dumpster fire. I didn't trust Shula at the beginning of the year but I never would've thought it would be this bad. I just hope this year doesn't set us back for next season. The CFB landscape is completely different but for some reason it always feels like we're behind the 8 ball (besides end of last year that was euphoric). 

Yes I'm glad we finally pulled the plug on Shula but it's just too late. Beamer should've seen this coming just based on last years bowl game. I blame the OL at the beginning of year mixed with Shulas play calling. Shawn Elliot should've started this year at OL coach. It's already been a massive improvement from Tissley (still nowhere near perfect). 

What Sellers does in the offseason will determine if we wasted another massive upside QB here at South Carolina. Whatever he does I'll be in support of, I think if he goes to the NFL and sits a year, he has huge upside and if he gets with an actual QB coach we can see what he can actually do. He needs work in the pocket and passing accuracy. If he transfers that will hurt like hell but again, I'll understand it. If he comes back next season, everything I do in my everyday life will have to do with Sellers. Drink coffee out of LS coffee mug, take a shower with my LS shower curtain. Lay on my LS pillows. Cover up in my LS blankie. Drive to work with my LS steering wheel cover. You get the point.

I've download some subbed base grids from ""Engineered Coffee"" if I spelled that correctly, and tried pasting one onto a concrete platform on the nearby moon, without success. At least it was obvious from a visit to the Control Menu that the platform and nuclear reactor that I had already installed were Not part of the newly placed grid. Here's what I asked on the Workshop:

  
""Trying unsuccessfully to paste Workshop grid onto existing moon platform""

It should be simple. I subbed and downloaded a few bases (grids) of different types from the Steam Workshop. They are now in my blueprint list along with some ships that I downloaded and some that I built.  
  
I started building a platform with a room for energy production under it on the nearby moon. Rather than build a moon base from scratch, I decided to plop down a refinery grid from the Workshop and a corresponding quarters building next to it,  
  
After some dancing around in the dark, I finally got the refinery grid to line up with the existing platform and sit on it properly. Most of the time the hitbox was red unless it was too high or buried in the platform, literally. (Which is weird that it would give a green hitbox when half the Refinery is buried in the ground.)  
  
Finally I got it to sit properly, but on checking the Control Panel menu in the newly placed refinery, I saw that the refinery had no idea that there was a nuclear reactor, cargo container and a enclosed step ladder beneath it. (To say nothing of the wide expanse of concrete texture grid beneath it as well.) It wasn't there, which means that its only ""floating"" on the platform, not part of it. What am I doing wrong?  
  
Of course it never orients correctly on paste and you have to flip it so it lines up right. and then push it back and forth until you get a green hitbox and then click, but that's not all, is it? Why doesn't a grid attach to another grid that it is resting on?  
  
I've never used merge blocks, don't know how they work, what parts they consist of. SO how do I make a Workshop grid attach to an existing platform so they are one piece?",2,1762603037.0,spaceengineers,2,1.0,False

I’m 28M. Grew up in Northern Ireland, moved to London.

I live alone and go from my apartment to work, and then to the gym. On the weekends I goto museums or coffee shops.

Everywhere I go, I sense and feel a complete lack of interest in me as a person.

Let’s provide some examples:
- When I’m out in public as a male I never see any women taking any interest in me. They might look the odd time, but I notice they start flipping their hair and things when a good looking man walks in. This rarely happens for me and it’s a little hurtful when I see it as I put in a lot of effort to look well dressed and sometimes feel like nobody cares/agrees. An example of this is a recent trip to an M&S, trying on clothes I come out and the woman in the changing room is having a jovial conversation with a businessman. I turn around and say “hi, I don’t want to buy these, where do I put them?”. She tutted and said “ugh just put them over there”.
- I have some weird instances with women in general and am not sure if it’s a London thing. For example, was in the gym recently, got on crosstrainer. As soon as I did this a young woman on a treadmill 4 rows down got up and left. Also that evening a woman walked past me with quite a cold face. 
- Most women are ice cold to me. When I walk down the street they make a point of staring ahead.
- Dressed up at wedding and nobody commented. Thought I looked well personally. At this particular family wedding the photographer took photos of everyone but me.
- When I’m out at family functions people ask my sister about how things are going and are animated and excited. With me it’s a “hi”.
- Older siblings never contact me, and just say “thanks” when I text them happy birthday. Never try to expand the convo. One sibling who lives away from NI never asked me about how I am doing or anything about my life when they visited home, just spent the whole time talking about them and their kids. 
- If I don’t contact my father I don’t hear from him for weeks. 
- In my workplace nobody talks to me. I go in, sit and work and leave. Very isolating.

Just wanted to use those examples to highlight my experience.

To contrast this with my mother:

- Often when we’re out people compliment her.
- People strike up convos with her.
- She gets freebies. 

To contrast this with my sister:

- People constantly complimenting her outfit when she dresses up.
- Makes friends really quickly. ",1,1762602874.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

Exactly two months ago I (27F) started seeing John (fake name, 29M). The first month and a half went really well. We saw each other every weekend or every other weekend. Then we started seeing each other less often, until I had to ask him (I can’t just assume) if he still wanted us to keep seeing each other. Two and a half weeks had gone by, and for me that was a long time.

I understand his schedule: he works at a gym (I workout there, by the way) from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. He goes to bed around 11 p.m., and in the morning he works out. This every day. So the only time we can see each other is on weekends, and that’s completely fine! He told me that yes, he did want to keep seeing me, but that lately he’d been dealing with work and personal issues. Right after that, he invited me out.

The next day we went for coffee, he commented on his issues (creating workout routines for different people, lacking money overall, and thinking of moving out) and then I stayed over at his place. Everything was fine, except for one small thing: while we were watching a movie, there was a suic*de scene, and he said, “that’s me.” John jokes around a lot, but I still noticed some seriousness in what he said. I looked at him and told him not to say stupid things. And he said, “why?”, half laughing. I looked at him again with the most disapproving look, because I care about him and don’t want him saying those things about himself. That concerned me.

This week at the gym I noticed he looked really tired. Too tired. On Friday night (yesterday) I wasn’t planning to invite him out because I figured he’d want to rest, so instead I sent him a message:

“Heyy, I noticed you seemed tired this week and just wanted to send you some encouragement and lots of kisses. I’m here if you need anything.”

He hasn’t replied, at least not yet. He posted an Instagram story about needing a hug last night (it was a meme), and since this week he’s turned off comments on his stories, I know he probably doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He’s commented about having these kind of sad/overwhelming episodes before, and he shuts down.

What should I do? Should I give him space? He’s never ignored my messages before, so I’m worried. I’m worried about us, and especially about HIM, because I want to support him and I don’t know how.

Please, be kind. I’m feeling horrible about the whole situation. Thank you all!

I’ve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries: strictly SFW; safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you’d die on. I’ll go first—mine change often, but right now: “Speed is a habit; depth is a practice.” I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

Let’s trade questions, not résumés. If we vibe, coffee’s on me.

1orng8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1orng8c/he_might_be_going_through_a_depressive_episode/,He might be going through a depressive episode and I don’t know how to help,"Exactly two months ago I (27F) started seeing John (fake name, 29M). The first month and a half went really well. We saw each other every weekend or every other weekend. Then we started seeing each other less often, until I had to ask him (I can’t just assume) if he still wanted us to keep seeing each other. Two and a half weeks had gone by, and for me that was a long time.

I understand his schedule: he works at a gym (I workout there, by the way) from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. He goes to bed around 11 p.m., and in the morning he works out. This every day. So the only time we can see each other is on weekends, and that’s completely fine! He told me that yes, he did want to keep seeing me, but that lately he’d been dealing with work and personal issues. Right after that, he invited me out.

The next day we went for coffee, he commented on his issues (creating workout routines for different people, lacking money overall, and thinking of moving out) and then I stayed over at his place. Everything was fine, except for one small thing: while we were watching a movie, there was a suic*de scene, and he said, “that’s me.” John jokes around a lot, but I still noticed some seriousness in what he said. I looked at him and told him not to say stupid things. And he said, “why?”, half laughing. I looked at him again with the most disapproving look, because I care about him and don’t want him saying those things about himself. That concerned me.

This week at the gym I noticed he looked really tired. Too tired. On Friday night (yesterday) I wasn’t planning to invite him out because I figured he’d want to rest, so instead I sent him a message:

“Heyy, I noticed you seemed tired this week and just wanted to send you some encouragement and lots of kisses. I’m here if you need anything.”

He hasn’t replied, at least not yet. He posted an Instagram story about needing a hug last night (it was a meme), and since this week he’s turned off comments on his stories, I know he probably doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He’s commented about having these kind of sad/overwhelming episodes before, and he shuts down.

What should I do? Should I give him space? He’s never ignored my messages before, so I’m worried. I’m worried about us, and especially about HIM, because I want to support him and I don’t know how.

Please, be kind. I’m feeling horrible about the whole situation. Thank you all!

* I stayed in hostels average €11\~1100 rupees in total 22k. Lowest in **Budapest** \~€6 and highest in **Vienna** €16, Some had breakfast included. There were cheaper options available but i selected 8+ rating hostels Special mention Avenue hostel Budapest, it €8- €12 with breakfast and if you spend €4 in the bar then dinner is complementary. If you are a couple or don't want to live in shared accommodation then you can get a decent private room for 5k.
* Food on an average was €20\~2000 rupees 40k in total, Including local meals, pubs , drinks etc.. Prague, Budapest are very cheap, you can get a meal as low as €5\~500 rupees. Special mention Beas Dhaba veg buffet restaurant €1.2\~120rs for 100 gram but before 1 hour of closing, they have 50% discount to reduce wastage, many other restaurant have such discount.
* There is something called as daily/lunch menu, they make 2-3 dishes in bulk and sell at low price €5-€10. €2 coffee and snacks starting as low as €1. So a coffee and 2 snack, a good European breakfast in €4. many supermarket also sell cheap food.
* 44k on City pass (10k **Budapest**,18k **Vienna** and 16k **Prague**) that covers all the attractions, public transport, hop on hop off bus, boat ride, bicycle rental, Ferris wheel and some snacks as well.

* I used zero forex card and card works everywhere, **Czechia** & **Hungary** have different currencies so carry few hundred Euros and convert as and when needed.
* Personally I felt **Vienna** to be the most expensive though it is the one of the most livable city, if i will visit again then I'll skip it and visit other 3 cities primary for the night life and culture.
* For booking hostels, Hostelworld is good for discovery but do their own website, many times you will see cheaper rates. I did the same. Same for bus/train booking, Omio is for discovery but do check out their own website like flexibus , Bla Bla ect
* I didn't burnt accor points else I would have stayed at Jo&Joe hostel and saved money
* 6-7 days are needed to visit each capitals but if you are on limited time then you can do a 10 day visit where 3 days to each capital and 1 day in **Bratislava**
* Budget for these 10 days could be 30k for round trip,15-20k for accommodation,20k for food and party and 20k for attractions and experiences,10k for Visa
* Beware of scammers, pickpocket, don't exchange money at street, don't withdraw money from Euronet ATM, Don't buy from touristy area, everything is cheap 5 minutes from city center

Hi! I'm looking for rp partners!  I am a 21 meaning I am looking for people 18+ I am would actually prefer 20 plus to be honest. I am a female in real life (just incase my gender matters to you.) 

I have been roleplaying for 8-9 years. Possibly longer, hard to pinpoint exactly when I started. But I do have experience. However, I do usually stay semi lit as I find that is the perfect range for rp to be smooth, not to over done and also so characters can interact with each other. So I do 4+lines occasionally less. Occasionally more. 

I do put a password in to my posts sooo- spot the password lol. 

My limits are simple, don't ghost me please, if you need a break, let me know, nothing gross in the rp! No armpits, no scat or anything like that. Just no. I mainly do romances, I don't do aton of drama as too much is just exhausting but I do mix my romances with different things like supernatural, fantasy and so on and so forth. 

Plot of the day! 

My oc is female, yours is male. That is the pairing for this rp. M x F. I wanna do a rp that I think could be fun! And actually quite cute, I think at least. Lol. Recently I've liked the idea of a couple with an age gap, my oc would be 21 ofc and I'm thinking your oc is 25-30 maybe. Obviously nothing extreme, lol I just think it could be sweet! And fun. I'm thinking they meet maybe when your oc is going on break to get coffee and they run into each other!  

It is a romance! I figure this kind of plot could be fun! 

The password is; out of the ordinary. 

I hope you enjoyed the read even if you decided the plot wasn't for you. Here's some tea/coffee as thanks for reading! ☕🍵🧋

1orncbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1orncbl/winning_product_is_the_biggest_lie_in_dropshipping/,“Winning product” is the biggest lie in dropshipping.,"I’ve been in this game for years, and honestly… that term annoys me now.

Because most of the “gurus” screaming about finding the next winner?

They just got lucky once...and built a course around it. 🤦‍♂️

The truth?

Finding a winning product is the easiest part of the process.

There are thousands of products that could sell well.

Think about it, most of the product research tools are PACKED with winning products.

If others are selling the same product for 6, 7, even 8 figures…

Guess what? The product is a winner.

You’re not making money with that same product, despite THAT being the only thing in common between you guys?

Hate to break it to you, but it’s not the product.

We finally have to make the mindset shift lol... if you want to win in ecom.

The real difference is in how you sell them.

The problem is, most people jump straight to ads and testing without ever doing audience analysis.

You can’t convert what you don’t understand.

You need to know your audience in detail; what they feel, what drives them, what they actually want deep down, so you can speak to them emotionally.

Once you know that, everything changes: your offer, your visuals, your copy, your store vibe.

Byron Sharp said it best: “Brands grow by being mentally and physically available.”

That means being recognizable, memorable, and consistent.

If your store doesn’t look branded, you’re instantly forgotten.

https://preview.redd.it/ybwlfp3ws00g1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3128747f66e19315be529cb0bb636c46700ab4

Your colors, icons, fonts, photos — all that subtle stuff — they’re not decoration. They’re emotional cues.

So please… don’t build another spammy, “typical” dropshipping store 😂

Learn a bit of consumer psychology and CRO — and build a BRANDED FRKIN STORE!

And here’s the thing — the same product can be sold to different audiences with totally different angles.

Take a MacBook:

For one person, it’s about speed and performance.

For another, it’s about looking like an entrepreneur at a coffee shop.

Different emotion, different reason to buy -> same product.

That’s where funnels come in.

Most people think the sale happens in the ad...but it doesn’t.

On average, it takes 7–10 clicks before someone actually buys.

Only one of those clicks happens on the ad.

So what happens between the ad and the checkout?

That’s where your advertorials and PDPs do the heavy lifting.

When these pieces align, that’s when you see real conversion jumps.

Most people lose sales not because of bad ads...but because their funnel is disconnected, or their product page feels generic.

If you nail your audience analysis, branding, and funnel flow, you’ll realize there’s no such thing as a “winning product.”

There are only winning angles.

That’s exactly why I built [Persuva.ai](http://Persuva.ai) — to make this process easier.

Custom Shopify theme, branded page generation, audience analysis, all built to help you sell smarter.

But beside that, I'm also happy to help everyone who needs a bit of guidance or tips (free)! :)",1,1762602071.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False
1ornast,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ornast/does_the_lack_of_interest_in_me_just_mean_im_ugly/,Does the lack of interest in me just mean I’m ugly or boring or is it just the culture I’m in?,"I’m 28M. Grew up in Northern Ireland, moved to London.

I live alone and go from my apartment to work, and then to the gym. On the weekends I goto museums or coffee shops.

Everywhere I go, I sense and feel a complete lack of interest in me as a person.

Let’s provide some examples:
- When I’m out in public as a male I never see any women taking any interest in me. They might look the odd time, but I notice they start flipping their hair and things when a good looking man walks in. This rarely happens for me and it’s a little hurtful when I see it as I put in a lot of effort to look well dressed and sometimes feel like nobody cares/agrees. An example of this is a recent trip to an M&S, trying on clothes I come out and the woman in the changing room is having a jovial conversation with a businessman. I turn around and say “hi, I don’t want to buy these, where do I put them?”. She tutted and said “ugh just put them over there”.
- I have some weird instances with women in general and am not sure if it’s a London thing. For example, was in the gym recently, got on crosstrainer. As soon as I did this a young woman on a treadmill 4 rows down got up and left. Also that evening a woman walked past me with quite a cold face. 
- Most women are ice cold to me. When I walk down the street they make a point of staring ahead.
- Dressed up at wedding and nobody commented. Thought I looked well personally. At this particular family wedding the photographer took photos of everyone but me.
- When I’m out at family functions people ask my sister about how things are going and are animated and excited. With me it’s a “hi”.
- Older siblings never contact me, and just say “thanks” when I text them happy birthday. Never try to expand the convo. One sibling who lives away from NI never asked me about how I am doing or anything about my life when they visited home, just spent the whole time talking about them and their kids. 
- If I don’t contact my father I don’t hear from him for weeks. 
- In my workplace nobody talks to me. I go in, sit and work and leave. Very isolating.

Just wanted to use those examples to highlight my experience.

To contrast this with my mother:

- Often when we’re out people compliment her.
- People strike up convos with her.
- She gets freebies. 

To contrast this with my sister:

- People constantly complimenting her outfit when she dresses up.
- Makes friends really quickly. ",3,1762601921.0,socialskills,3,0.8,False

After trying a few that didn’t last long, I finally found two that really stand out, both are easy to use, save money, and make great coffee without the waste of disposable pods.

**1.** [**Keurig My K‑Cup Universal Reusable Filter**](https://amzlink.to/az0cmGbxhaqoL)

This filter uses a reusable basket that you fill with your coffee, then you place it in the machine like a normal K-Cup. It’s BPA-free and compatible with many models. Some users say it fits cleanly and works well. 

**Pros:**

* Lets you use your own coffee grounds and save money.
* Works with many Keurig machines and is easy to insert.
* Dishwasher safe and reusable many times.

**Cons:**

* Some users say build quality isn’t perfect and it may begin to wear. 
* Might require adjusting grind/coarseness to avoid clogging or weak brew. 

**2.** [**Noalto Reusable K Cups Stainless Steel**](https://amzlink.to/az0aKtnLJ88jI)

This is a stainless steel reusable pod compatible with Keurig 1.0 and 2.0 machines. It’s made of high-quality material, claims to be BPA-free, and aims to work with your own ground coffee. 

**Pros:**

* Very durable stainless steel build means less wear and tear.
* Eco-friendly alternative to disposable pods, good for the environment.
* Works with a wide range of Keurig machines (check compatibility list).

**Cons:**

* Universal fit is good, but you may need to experiment a little to get the right coffee load and packing for best results.

Both of these reusable K-Cups are solid choices. The Keurig My K-Cup is perfect if you want something simple, reliable, and made by Keurig itself. The Noalto Stainless Steel version is better if you want something stronger and more eco-friendly.

Natatawa ako na naiiyak habang nagtatype nito kasi bata pa naman ako madalas na akong nasasaktan ng nanay ko. Akala ko nga matatapos na yun kasi umayos naman ang relationship namin lately.

Una sa lahat, pagod na pagod ako sa trabaho buong week. Nung Friday, sobrang late na ako nakauwi kasi na-hold kami ng mga boss sa office. Hanggang 10PM nasa opisina pa ako, nagpasya ako na di na muna umuwi pagkatapos ng meeting at nag stay sa isang coffee shop hanggang alas dose.

  
Come Saturday (which is today) nagpasya ako na mag sleep in nalang talaga dahil may pasok yung nanay ko ngayon. Mga alas dose na rin ako naka gising, mali ko rin naman kasi nawala sa isip ko talaga na bumili ng tubig. Pag uwi niya dahil nga di kami nag uusap, hindi ko na muna siya pinansin at nagpatuloy lang manood ng YouTube. Nagulat nalang ako nung binato niya ako ng gunting na ipinagpasalamat ko pa kasi di ako natusok, sa likod ko lang dumausdos. Pero nagulat ako nung bigla niya akong sinakal at sinabi na wala akong kwenta kasi kahit tubig na maiinom lang ay di ko man lang mabili. Nawala talaga siya sa isip ko, bibili naman sana ako ngayong araw kaso dala na rin siguro ng pagod at kagustuhan na magpahinga nakaligtaan ko talaga.

Fifteen years ago.

Nothing will ruin Mrs. Reema's mood this evening. Maybe one of her kids waking up dramatically, as usual, could do, but she refuses to think of that at the moment.

She opens the windows to let some of the chilly September breezes in, carrying along the scent of the neighbors' flowers, those which, just for the record, she had fought relentlessly time after time to have them removed, because her youngest child, Rami, was allergic. But now, she's just smiling, unlike her usual self, finding herself grateful for the fight she lost, and for the flowers she can finally smell.

In her right hand, she is holding a cup of coffee, while her left hand is clenched around a piece of chocolate that she had previously hidden from the children's reach. The silence that fills the room makes her realize that the children are fast asleep, so the tension leaks between her fingers, allowing her to open her hand and let the chocolate free. Something tiptoes into her soul, maybe happiness. Not just for the chocolate she can finally eat, but also for the idea of stillness that she rarely experiences these days.

What Mrs. Reema doesn't know yet is that this piece of chocolate is the last thing she will ever hide from anyone.

Mrs. Reema isn't a bad mother; on the contrary, she loves her children, all three of them. However, this peace of mind is rare in this house, as she assumes the roles of both mother and father, since her husband started working abroad to afford the luxurious level of life they're having.

Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Reema looks at the clock hanging above the TV, realizing that it's almost ten, which means that Mr. Fadi's weekly call is approaching.

She loves her husband a lot, though, thinking about it, she loves him way less than her children, but way more than a stranger man as well. She would've loved to tell her kids when they grow up, about the epic love story they went through, except, of course, there wasn't one. It was an arranged marriage, where a middle-aged woman assessed her physical and psychological traits, as Mrs. Reema would later tell herself, and decided that she would be a good wife for her son; and, truth be told, she was right.

She adjusts her posture to be close to the landline, placing her right leg on top of her left, and begins to swing her leg in an attempt to keep her patience in check.

With an eye on the phone and the other on the clock, she swirls her finger through the strand of hair falling on the side of her face.

As soon as the phone rings, she leaps in a swift motion towards it, not allowing it to destroy her victories by waking up the kids. This has become her favorite sport for the past five years.

For a good portion of time, before their phone call, she used to change her clothes, put on some blusher, and spray some perfume where Mr. Fadi used to kiss her. But later on, she realized that he couldn't see her and that lying was way easier.

""Hello ..."" his voice comes through the phone, and although she hears it every week, it sounds estranged.

""Hey Fadi,"" She answers with a failed attempt to make her voice warmer.

""How are you … and the kids?""

""We're doing fine, what about you?""

""I missed you all, especially you, Reema.""

""We miss you too ..."" She shifts in her place restlessly, thinking about moments ago when she'd questioned her love for him, and now his voice is full of it.

""You told me that you'd cut your hair this week."" His voice carries a question, and something warm beneath it.

""Yeah, but I didn't find the time for it."" Silence stretches a moment too long. She was able to feel his disappointment through the static before breaking it, ""I have some news.""

""Is everybody okay?"" He asks worriedly.

""Don't worry, everyone's fine,"" she says calmly, ""we're gonna be six instead of five.""

Silence, again. This time, she is sure he didn't get the hint, so she decides to lay it clear.

""I'm pregnant,"" she says in an indifferent tone.

""Congratulations, Love,"" he says with a laugh, which made the sentence incoherent.

""Congratulations to us.""

From day one, Mr. Fadi said that he wanted to make a big family, ten kids, maybe twelve, who knows. And although she didn't mind back then, her desire to have children decreased after each pregnancy.

""We're having a daughter?"" he asks hopefully.

She rests a hand on her belly, ""I don't know. I'm only eight weeks in.""

To be fully honest, she also hopes for a daughter, as all of her children are boys. And the sooner she has a daughter, the sooner they decide to stop having more children. You see? She's not cold-hearted, but she has to think about her abilities as a mother first; she has to know where to draw the line.

For the next hour, their conversation branched out in many directions. In some cases, Mrs. Reema decided to elaborate, such as the color of the dress she was wearing, which she described while adjusting her pajamas. In others, she decided to keep it brief, as there's no need for him to know that Joe had fallen off the bed the night before, which resulted in a stitch in a place where his hair will grow soon. Or that the school called about Jack's low grades. She can fix all of that. What she can't fix is the psychiatrist appointment she took for Rami, her youngest, who has started to have strange, bloody dreams.

""I have to hang up now, the units are almost out."" Mr. Fadi announces, for which Mrs. Reema answers with a sigh that escaped her lips.

""Don't worry, darling, I'll be right beside you at the time of delivery.""

Mrs. Reema smiles for the first time during the call. She needed to hear that. ""I love you."" She whispers, although no one else is in the room.

""I love you too,"" and with that, he hangs up the phone.

She's glad that the call has ended by eleven, not that she was bored, but her favorite soap opera series is about to start. It had happened previously that the conversation made her miss the opening of episode number one hundred fifty-three, where one of the protagonists, whose name she had forgotten, announced his love under the rain.

She turns on the television after making sure that the living room's door is shut, so the sound won't reach her sleeping beauties inside. She sips her second cup of coffee, looking out the window, while waiting for the show to begin.

Amazement grips her as the scene unfolds before her. She doesn't know exactly when it happened. The cold breeze stops, and she starts to wipe away the beads of sweat that form on the edge of her nose repeatedly. The sky that was clear minutes ago is now full of shooting stars.

Mrs. Reema closes her eyes to make a wish; after all, one of the hundreds of shooting stars she's now seeing might make it come true. But before she can think about the wish, a sound from the television cuts the series's opening theme and is replaced by the news theme.

Her annoyance rapidly changes when she sees the face of the news anchor now on display. A handsome man in his forties, Nizar Yaghi. Her favorite TV personality. Actually, every woman's favorite TV personality.

He starts presenting in a smooth but professional tone:

""Ladies and gentlemen,

We are more than sorry to cut your favorite programs to broadcast the following announcement...""

He adjusts his tie while talking, leaving Mrs. Reema staring at his every movement. And after several moments, she realizes that she is licking her lips, and that she didn't hear a single word he said till now.

""The nature of the meteors remains unknown at the moment. While authorities have confirmed sightings of numerous meteors breaching the atmosphere, reports have surfaced of fiery objects crashing in various locations, including several countries in the Middle East, Canada, Brazil, and even a landfill site in India.

We urge citizens to remain indoors and follow safety orders. Do not touch any foreign objects until specialists arrive on the scene.

And in case you were wondering: No, you can't make a wish if a meteor lands next to you.

Someone in Canada already tried, and now he's wishing his eyebrows would grow back.""

He finishes the report with a satisfied smile about the joke he made at the end of it. And Mrs. Reema finds herself laughing out loud.

The clock is now pointing at midnight, or to be more specific, it's one minute to twelve.

In the next few seconds, everything will change. Not only here, not only in Mrs. Reema and her children's life alone, but life as we know it will change forever.

Mrs. Reema can feel the air vibrating around her. She looks out the window and sees the whole sky moving, except for one star.

The door behind her opens up, and she hears little steps behind her. She turns around to see that Rami is now awake and looking with tear-filled eyes for her in the room.

She turns back to the window and finds that the star is now larger. Rami bursts into tears as soon as he sees his mother and she walks to hug him.

Although the lights are on, the room becomes brighter, which makes her look back at the sky searching for the source. Her eyes are now fixed at the window from which she can see that the previously mentioned star is now the size of the moon. Maybe bigger.

Every atom in her body begs her to look away, but she can't. She opens her eyes wider realizing that what she's seeing is not a star, but a meteor falling towards her.

With a quick movement, thanks to the jumping-towards-the-phone sport, she picks Rami between her arms and runs towards the corridors screaming the names of her three children to wake them up, forgetting that Rami is now screaming louder between her hands.

She reaches their room, puts Rami on the ground, and reaches out to wake them.

It's exactly twelve now. A crashing sound rings through the air, and the whole building shakes throwing Mrs. Reema to the ground.

The power went out across the entire neighborhood. And although it's expected to drown in darkness, the streets glow as they never before; lit by what had fallen moments ago in Mrs. Reema's yard, leaving behind a scent of burning that overpowers the fragrance of the neighbors' flowers.",1,1762601302.0,JoReaders,0,1.0,False

Hello, my name is Hadrien, the writer behind BREAKING NEWS, and this is our MM25 deep dive.  
 My adventure module is available on BackerKit along with 26 other great projects:  
[ https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/epicquest-ch/breaking-news-a-mothership-rpg-zine](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/epicquest-ch/breaking-news-a-mothership-rpg-zine)

  


**TL;DR**  
BREAKING NEWS is a 40-page media-fueled faction and investigation module for Mothership RPG, set on Prospero’s Dream.

It introduces The Oracle, a powerful news outlet battling for control of truth through manipulation, leaks, and propaganda.

Includes tools for Wardens and players to publish stories, track consequences with a Fallout system, and navigate the ethics of journalism in a world where truth doesn’t last long.

Adds new locations, NPCs, and an optional journalist progression system that integrates with the core classes instead of replacing them.

The included scenario, Show No Pythia, is a noir-inspired murder mystery inside the heart of The Oracle.





**WHAT THIS DEEP DIVE IS ABOUT**  
Think of this like grabbing a coffee and talking about where BREAKING NEWS came from, why I chose “journalism on the Dream” as a lens (pun intended), what real-life stories it is built on, and how I tried to make it actually usable at the table. If you are wondering “is this my table’s vibe?” or “how did this thing get made?”, this is for you.

  


**WHAT IS BREAKING NEWS**  
BREAKING NEWS expands Prospero’s Dream with a new faction and theme: information as a weapon. The module explores how news, leaks, and rumors shape the station’s politics and survival. Players can infiltrate, expose, or even work for The Oracle, navigating a world of shifting alliances, blackmail, and moral grey zones.

It’s written as both a toolbox and a ready-to-run adventure, giving Wardens resources to create their own media-driven stories or drop Show No Pythia straight into their campaign. The tone sits somewhere between noir thriller and creeping sci-fi conspiracy.





**HOW I CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN MM25**

**Journey Leading to MM25**  
Last year, when I first heard of Mothership Month I was blown away. A cooperative crowdsourcing event with 20+ different third-party content creators around a similar theme for my favorite game, MOTHERSHIP RPG. I loved the concept, ordered so many modules, and secretly dreamt of being part of a similar collaborative venture one day.

The problem was, I hadn’t published anything creative ever. Yes, my players loved the games and homebrewed adventures I prepared for them for Mothership, and I loved boiling down Call of Cthulhu modules to a single guide page, but I hadn’t yet written anything of my own.

That gave me the impulse to try. I wrote a first trifold called FRACTAL TRUTH, as this is often considered the rite of passage for any respectable TTRPG writer, and I did love the sort of elegance in sobriety and minimalism that comes with the format. I commissioned an artist for the cover and everything, but I didn’t send it for review, not yet. I felt I wanted to work on another one almost as soon as I received the art for my first module.

SLEEP DEBT got written, playtested, sent for review, approved, and ordered by [TKG](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/sleep-debt?srsltid=AfmBOoqGZbTzjyjLqkP9j6cUggBKwufR-PNa2QYG4UQdFGXhlsWCYDi3) within a week. All of it in seven days only. And I never felt any prouder or more energized in months, maybe years. I had put something out there that I was genuinely excited for and that other players would eventually play as well. This gave me so much energy and validation I rarely ever got in my “day job.”





**MM25**  
When MM25 was announced, I threw my name in the hat and hoped for the best while fearing the worst. I had little to no idea what to expect or what it would mean. Then came this year’s topic: “We are expanding on the DREAM... populate this gigantic city with new factions.”

I didn’t know what to write about, not right away. Prospero’s Dream already felt so big and lively to me; it felt like a huge responsibility that TKG just handed to us. And to make matters worse, I peeked at the pitches already submitted by the other creators and felt their ideas were already so formed and developed while I had just read this year’s topic.

After a small panic attack and a breather, I picked up a pen and paper (I am old school like that) and started mapping a few ideas. It came to me quite naturally: INFORMATION. More specifically, its use, abuse, control, distribution, retention, and freeing. (I am not home while writing this, I will take a picture of my notes and share it here later.)

The challenge was that information was already sort of handled by the faction in CANYONheavymarket, but what do data and computers have as a weakness? They are “easily” falsifiable, especially in the age of seemingly omnipresent androids, rogue AIs, and hackers with mods and chipsets plugged directly into their brains (yes, believe it or not I am talking about MOTHERSHIP, not how I sometimes feel society is heading towards).

So the idea of an old-school journal and newspaper bringing a mix of tech and grounded methodologies seemed like an interesting twist and way to futureproof things: a disaster recovery plan for humanity, blending analog with high tech to stay resilient.

I submitted my initial pitch (which I planned to be for a 24-page zine; we are now comfortably at 40 pages total with the last preview from our layout artist). It got approved by TKG and also by the other creators, many of whom shared they were excited to have their hands on it. Many others mentioned it reminded them of the very famous ARKYVR. Big shoes to fill.





**INSPIRATIONS**  
A lifetime ago (in 2018) I moved continents for a job and was acquainted with a Canadian colleague who became a very good friend and my main inspiration for this adventure.

I will paraphrase heavily to avoid spoiling Show No Pythia (the included adventure in BREAKING NEWS). To protect their identity I shall name them Ivy, and also because I cannot relate Ivy’s story in a way that would do justice to the real tale.

Before being a salesperson in San Francisco, Ivy had a whole other life, and none less exciting than selling software (yes, I am being ironic). They were a journalist once for one of the largest Canadian news outlets. Along their career, they started investigating a local food processing magnate and his past relationships with the Italian mob of New York. What started as a “small” article turned into Ivy bringing that mob boss in front of the court after years of intensive investigative work.

Years of evidence and testimonies were diligently gathered. All was there for a happy outcome, right? Wrong. Due to a procedural error, a proof became inadmissible, weakening the case and leading to the release of said mob boss with a weak slap on the wrist, who didn’t wait to threaten Ivy’s life as soon as he could.

Ivy eventually had to leave the continent and reinvent themselves while still working for the same journal. What struck me most was how ordinary they appeared (you could walk past this person on the street and never know the scale of what they’d done. The courage, the quiet persistence, the willingness to stand up to power without fanfare or safety nets) it all left a deep impression on me. There was something so profoundly cool and human about being an unsung hero, even when it came at real personal cost. It made me rethink a lot of things about courage, recognition, and purpose.

This is what inspired me to write the adventure part of this module. I wanted to pay some sort of homage to my friend who stood out in front of corporations, greed, and threats.

Other major inspirations include Psycho-Pass: what happens when society is ruled by your psychological stability score and lack of emotional response? What happens when you slip? When technology fails? When you give full power to people who feel righteous enough to exact judgment based on information everyone deems unfalsifiable?

Any resemblance to large food conglomerates, agrological monopolies, or other media and information giants is coincidental.





**LOGIC AND PROCESS OF WRITING BREAKING NEWS**

**Tintin in Space**  
By fault of not being of the profession and not being familiar with the ins and outs of journalistic life, I didn’t want to make too much of a caricature of journalism and end up with “Tintin in Deep Space Horror” (even though now that I type it... it sounds pretty rad).

For this reason, I consulted as much information as I could gather online (thank you, YouTube) but also got in touch with investigative journalists (not influencers, but people who investigate crime, fraud, and trafficking) and had them review my draft. Especially the description of The Oracle as a faction and journal, the building and map descriptions (so you really get a feel for what it is to walk into a newsroom, even if I exaggerated the description a little to make it memorable), the different roles of the NPCs working for The Oracle, how to submit your own article or story, and the ground rules for journalists.

**Josh Domanski**  
Pushing it further than getting some real-life journalist cred, I wanted to make sure my first project of this size was as good as I could possibly deliver. That is when I contacted Josh through a small ad on the Mothership Discord. I reached out to him asking if he could review my draft. Knowing I am a one-man show, he agreed to do an initial pass and then review it again later.

His work and impact were invaluable. Josh came with a very professional, thorough, and expert mindset given his years of experience editing and developing some amazing modules ([https://itch.io/c/3058982/more-from-josh-domanski](https://itch.io/c/3058982/more-from-josh-domanski)) and complete game systems like Liminal Horror. He helped me up my game and I felt that after implementing his advice I had just graduated from some epic TTRPG training program. This has been amazing and I will take what I learned from him with me on my next projects. I cannot wait to work again with Josh, and I cannot recommend him enough if you are in the process of publishing something.

Not only did he do the development editing, he introduced me to our layout artist Golden Achiever (more about him later in the team section). He also recommended two awesome modules I hadn’t read at the time (Picket Line Tango:[ https://anodyne-printware.itch.io/picket-line-tango](https://anodyne-printware.itch.io/picket-line-tango) and ARKYVR:[ https://alewoodgames.itch.io/arkyvr](https://alewoodgames.itch.io/arkyvr)) that became favorites of mine and also inspirations for what I aim to achieve with BREAKING NEWS.

In Show No Pythia, you will find some murder mystery elements (though not as developed as Picket Line Tango but reminiscent) as well as some reporter/investigation gameplay, complementary to what you can find in ARKYVR. BREAKING NEWS is a spice you can throw on your favorite adventure, while ARKYVR feels like a deconstructed Caesar salad or the famous “Oops! I dropped the lemon tart”: a completely fresh take on something familiar.

**Warden-First Philosophy**  
BREAKING NEWS is not a documentary. I researched, translated, and turned my findings into something I would love to experience as a player (and my own players loved it) within the essence of the Mothership RPG universe.

When I drafted the different tables to support and bring to life some mechanics (for example, Fallout, which helps you handle in-game consequences after dropping a spicy article) I made them with “ease of understanding” for players and “ease of use” for Wardens in mind. There is nothing that frustrates me more than when I pick up a book full of good ideas but the rules get in the way of the story.

So, for BREAKING NEWS, I always double-checked that what I wrote made sense to both pros and beginners, was digestible, and remained fun for players interacting with these new mechanics through the Warden’s narration. Supported by handouts that are currently part of the stretch goals (but that I plan to release regardless of the financial goal), I always want Wardens to have more than they thought they’d get, because that’s what I wish I got as a Warden myself.

**Journalist Class**  
Another question I received in my BackerKit community ([https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/epicquest-ch/breaking-news-a-mothership-rpg-zine/discussions/65492?ref=bk-discover-default-community-object](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/epicquest-ch/breaking-news-a-mothership-rpg-zine/discussions/65492?ref=bk-discover-default-community-object)) was about the journalist class.

TLDR: I decided against drafting a whole new class because I believe people working in a journal come from all walks of life. Therefore, I stuck with the four original Mothership archetypes and created three skills reflecting seniority within a newspaper, plus an item that influences people’s decisions around you: the Press Badge.

I am very excited about this. I printed some badges and gave them to my players who wear them proudly at the table or hide them depending on how they want to roleplay a scene. They are proud to say they work for The Oracle when passing a crowd gathering in front of Au Clair de Lune (one of the posh restaurants in the module), but they hide their badges when getting close to some unsavory drug dealers operating near The Farm.





**CURRENT STATUS AND PROGRESS**  
We made a progress bar on BackerKit to show how far we have come in the writing and illustration process:

Right now, the PDF is close to being done and I am looking forward to seeing what people think of it.





**THE TEAM BEHIND BREAKING NEWS**  
I want to thank both Haven and Golden Achiever for helping me make BREAKING NEWS the absolute best product it can be, and one that I am and will remain proud of.

→ **Haven**: I contacted Haven after checking his portfolio online. I loved one of his characters a lot (Lens… little did I know that Haven wanted a chance to revisit this character and bring him back to life). Even though he was very much sought after (and had received many requests for commission, the theme of BREAKING NEWS as well as the fact we both thought of Lens as a character for the adventure really made the difference. After a few calls and exchanges, we were on track to deliver what we find to be an incredible experience for the readers having Haven’s incredibly striking art support my text. I am so glad and honored we clicked so well and keep on collaborating closely during this project. Don’t forget to check his instagram :[ https://www.instagram.com/illustrated\_haven/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/illustrated_haven/?hl=en)

→ **Golden Achiever**: I love working with Golden Achiever on this project. Not only does he have a great eye for design and amazing execution, he also comes with a wealth of experience handling projects like BREAKING NEWS (and even much larger ones). So much so that I asked him to review my first adventure designs to have a V2 available soon, and I plan on working with him for future projects too.

I dismantle and clean regularly, almost once every couple of weeks, and apply small amounts of grease to spindle and threads (though these have been super stiff recently and require more and more grease I’m finding over time). Before shooting the video I had just dismantled and cleaned again, have put maybe 50g of coffee through it and no beans are stuck or anything.

I’ve always struggled with the consistency of this grinder, and was one of those who suffered with the need to season with around 10kg.

Our 3-bedroom apartment is $2,700 total, so we each pay $900. That’s what we all agreed to from the start.

Here’s the issue: I’m the one who actually found the apartment and signed the lease because my credit score was the only one good enough to get approved. The other two signed after me as co-tenants. I also handle all the bills and utilities since they’re under my name.

The “problem” now is that I have the master bedroom, it’s definitely bigger, and it has a private bathroom. They share one. But they knew that when we toured the place. Like, they literally saw the rooms before we signed and still said they were fine splitting everything evenly.

Fast forward a few months and suddenly they’re saying the split isn’t “fair” anymore. They want me to pay $1,100 while they each pay $800. Their reasoning that I have more space and privacy. My reasoning that I took on the financial risk, did all the paperwork, bought the coffee maker, cleaning stuff, etc., and the rent deal was already agreed on.

I told them that I’m not changing the arrangement mid lease just because they’re having regrets. Now they’re both kind of cold toward me and keep making little jokes like “well, the master should get the fancy soap too.”

Should I be paying extra since I have the bigger room and my own bathroom? or AITA for standing my ground and keeping the even 3-way split?",2,1762600416.0,AITAH,12,0.75,False

A bit about myself: I'm Asian was living in Australia for a degree for 3 years and work there for another 3 years with a good office job, good pay and good people to work with. It was great but boring at the time so I decided to go back home even my boss offered to sponsor me to stay.

I went back home here in Asia, worked for a bank for another 2 years in one of the major city of the country, 100km far away from home so I rented a studio to live with my friend. Good pay as well (nearly trippled the national average wage), good people to work with, good boss to follow, I have also night life which was lack when I was in Australia. I managed to have new connections, new friends that I can be busy every day after work and weekend. I can also drive home every few weeks visiting my parents. Good life everyone said.

But when the current company reached out ask if I want to join them, I said yes.
This is a remote job working fulltime for a foreign startup with higher pay. I joined them and decided to move back home to leave with my parents. Life goes on. I saved a bunch of money, travel here and there. Learned to invest in stock, equity fund, having shares in a small coffee shop. I also travel to the city to meet my friends and ex colleagues sometimes. I learned new courses online, started a Youtube channel (had total 20k views lol), a Tik tok account (70k views), playing sports. It's pretty chill but somehow, I feel empty. I dont know what's to do with my life, what I really want. I end a day after work and holding my phone scrolling through the videos, others life, others stories without knowing what really interest me.

I never knew it was so hard to make new mom friends until I became one. So I’ve made it my mission to make every new mother I know feel like they at least have someone on their side.

I let them know I have extra baby supplies and I’m up all hours so if they need someone to call I’m there, I invite them out for walks etc. I offer to make them meals after baby comes or to do chores if needed, maybe a shoulder to cry on or maybe our kids can be friends one day!

I’ve had plenty of people be rude to me over this, they answer very coldly like “thanks” or not at all, and that’s fine. I never mind because I know it can be overwhelming.

I reached out to a girl recently who had no friends in the country, she’s not from here and got pregnant by a friend of mine so I thought I’d offer to introduce her to my group of mom friends etc. We got coffee and things went really well! She was having a hard time and was very receptive to the support. I thought I made a new friend!

I invited her to Trick or Treat with our group. She said she probably couldn’t make it so I said no problem girl let’s get together soon 😁 

She texted me again saying she has panic attacks when she sees anyone in a mask or makeup or dressed up at all. I thought that was strange since we already talked about her not coming.. but okay girl lol no problem!

She then asked ME if I wanted to make plans for the next day so we did. She canceled them last minute but I know how it is idc 🤷🏼‍♀️ I said take all the time you can to yourself girl you need it before your baby gets here lol!

She posted a ton of photos of trick or treating with her man and her costume and stuff.. I was surprised since she made up such a crazy excuse not to come when I obviously had no problem but it’s all good, I just won’t invite her to things anymore I can take a hint 😌

I went to show her post to my fiance the next day and she had blocked me 😭😭 now I’m actually upset and my feelings are hurt, I would’ve given a lot for anyone to reach out to me when I was pregnant. Postpartum can be so lonely and I’m so confused why it’s hard to just be kind.

Finding the perfect baby stroller can feel like a daunting task for new parents, but with the right guidance, it can become a rewarding experience. A stroller is an essential item on your baby registry, as it provides not only a means to transport your little one but also can enhance your family's outings. Whether you're a first-time parent or just looking to upgrade your existing gear, knowing what features to look for in a stroller can help ensure that you find one that meets yours and your baby's needs.

# Safety Features: The Non-Negotiable Elements

When it comes to choosing a [baby stroller](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/baby-stroller), safety should be your top priority. It’s essential to ensure that your little one is secure during your outings together. Here are some safety features to keep in mind:

# 5-Point Harness System

A 5-point harness system is a must-have feature that helps keep your baby securely fastened in the stroller. This system includes straps that go over both shoulders, around the waist, and between the legs, effectively preventing your baby from sliding or falling out.

# Brakes and Locking Mechanisms

Look for strollers equipped with a reliable braking system, ideally with a foot-operated brake. This ensures that the stroller won’t accidentally roll away when you're not actively using it. A locking mechanism should also prevent it from folding or unfolding unintentionally.

# Convenience and Ease of Use: Making Parenting Easier

https://preview.redd.it/zimh73grngzf1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1700732b1605b7a1e254c8a9d8b700657a6369f

As a parent, convenience is key. A [baby stroller](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/baby-stroller) that is easy to use will save you time and energy, allowing you to focus on creating enjoyable moments with your baby. Here are some handy features to consider:

# Lightweight and Compact Design

A lightweight design makes it much easier to maneuver through crowded areas or lift your stroller in and out of your vehicle. A stroller that folds compactly is also ideal for storage in your home or car, making it a popular choice among busy moms.

# One-Handed Folding Mechanism

Life with a baby often means juggling multiple things at once. Look for a stroller that can be folded with one hand so you can easily manage your little one while packing up your gear. This feature is particularly helpful for parents who are constantly on the go.

# Durability: Built to Last

Investing in a [baby stroller](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/baby-stroller) means you want something that will stand the test of time. Here are some qualities to consider that will ensure your stroller can endure daily use.

# High-Quality Materials

The materials used in constructing the stroller should be durable and weather-resistant. Look for frames made of high-quality aluminum or steel and fabrics that can resist spills and stains, as well as provide UV protection.

# Strong Wheels and Suspension

Strollers with sturdy wheels that can handle a variety of terrains are essential for providing a smooth ride for your baby. Additionally, a good suspension system can help absorb bumps, making it easier to push your stroller through parks, sidewalks, and uneven surfaces.

# Versatility: Growing with Your Child

As your child grows, their needs will change, and your stroller should adapt accordingly. Here are some versatile features to keep in mind:

# Reversible Seat

A reversible seat allows you to face your baby toward you for bonding or face them outward to explore the world. This adaptability can be particularly appealing for development stages when your baby is curious about their surroundings.

# Adjustable Canopies and Seats

Choose a stroller with an adjustable canopy to provide ample shade for your baby, protecting them from harmful UV rays and unexpected rain. An adjustable seat can accommodate your child's needs as they grow, allowing for reclining options as they nap or sit up to observe their environment.

# Storage Space: Outings Made Easy

Having ample storage space is a feature often overlooked. However, the right stroller can offer essential storage solutions:

# Under-Basket Storage

An under-basket storage compartment is an incredibly useful feature for holding bags, groceries, or baby supplies. The bigger the basket, the better, as you can easily access items while out and about.

# Parent and Child Cup Holders

Having cup holders for both parents and babies can make outings more enjoyable. You’ll want a place for that essential coffee (or water) while out running errands, as well as a spot for your baby’s drink.

# Design and Style: A Personal Touch

Sleek designs can sometimes get overlooked in favor of more practical features. However, choosing a stroller that complements your personal style can enhance the enjoyment of your parenthood journey. Here’s what to consider:

# Color and Aesthetic Options

Strollers come in a variety of colors and designs, so choose one that matches your style! A stroller with a fun or modern design can be a great source of pride when you’re out and socializing with other parents.

# Custom Accessories

Look for strollers that offer accessories to enhance functionality, such as cup holders, travel bags, and weather shields. This way, you can personalize your stroller to cater to your specific needs and preferences.

# Easy Maintenance: Keeping it Clean and Fresh

As a busy mom, you’ll want a stroller that’s easy to maintain. The following maintenance features can simplify your life:

# Removable and Washable Fabrics

Selecting a stroller with removable and washable fabric covers makes cleaning up spills and messes a breeze. This feature is especially useful for parents with infants and toddlers, who are notorious for creating messes!

# Rust-Resistant Components

For strollers that will be exposed to various weather conditions, opt for rust-resistant components. This will not only enhance the stroller's lifespan but also means less time worrying about maintenance.

# The Mompush Stroller: A Premium with Affordable Price

[](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/mompush)

Breakfasty ideas:

Hashbrown in toaster, microwave banquet sausage, fruit cup

Oatmeal packet in the microwave, sprinkle on some nuts or flaxseed to make it more filling

Cream cheese bagel: sometimes I meal prep these!

Breakfast burrito: tortilla, microwave banquet turkey sausage, shredded cheese, frozen or canned corn, peppers, scrambled eggs (you can actually make eggs in the microwave) tater tots 


Lunch/Dinner ideas:

Beef and vegetable soup: take one can beef and vegetable soup, add canned or frozen veg (corn, green beans, pinto/black beans, mixed veg, canned tomatoes) to bulk up, add a bouillon cube

Butternut squash soup: either peel or buy pre cut butternut squash, sauté in some oil and then add water, you can also add carrots for a sweeter taste, add pumpkin pie spice and garlic power, salt to taste. When the squash are cooked, cool and blend 

Salad kit with canned tuna/chicken

Burrito: tortilla, shredded cheese, hot sauce, microwaved refried beans, add frozen or canned corn, tomatoes if you like them

Rice cooker to make white rice, cook salmon and veg in the steamer basket

Rotisserie chicken, baked potato or instant pasta mix like pastaroni/knorr, add veg like frozen peas

Taco salad: lettuce or salad kit, shredded cheese, can of black or pinto beans, can or frozen corn, cook ground turkey or beef with one packet taco seasoning

Deconstructed sandwich if you don’t have the energy to make one: sliced bread, lunch meat, sliced cheese on a plate kind of like a charcuterie. You can also add olives or pickles on the side

Ramen but make it filling: ramen can be made stovetop or in the microwave, mushrooms like baby Bella or enoki, crack an egg, reconstituted dried wakame seaweed, veg like frozen mixed veg, corn, shredded carrots, add frozen cooked shrimp or tofu. There are different kinds of ramen like your typical maruchan, shin ramen which is spicy, indomie which is a little sweet

Harvest bowl…I stole the idea from a healthy homemade dog food video LOL but it’s actually delicious. Add the following to a bowl and mix: browned sausage or ground turkey, sautéed entire bag of baby spinach, canned bean like garbanzo pinto or black, frozen corn and carrots, sautéed zucchini or yellow squash, white or brown rice, add spices like cumin coriander chili powder oregano

Bean and corn salad: microwave some frozen corn, add rinsed canned pinto black beans

Tuna and rice: add a packet of Birds Eye red Thai chili tuna to rice, microwave some mixed vegetables and combine

Make frozen dumplings and a side of frozen peas or mixed veg

Wrap: make a salad kit (caesar is good), toast some chicken tenders or nuggets and add everything to a tortilla along with some croutons

Sheet pan meal: slice up some sausage like kielbasa or brats, either cut up some veg or use a bag of pre cut veg (sweet potato, potato, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, squash work well), toss with oil and stick in the oven

Indian lentil soup: orange lentils, wash and cook in water with a smidge of turmeric and salt, I also add tomatoes to make it a little more healthy




Snacks:

Charcuterie: cheese stick, sliced fruit, beef jerky, crackers or pita chips

Whole carrot with ranch or peanut butter

Yogurt cup with sprinkled granola or cereal

Granola bar

Applesauce pouch

Fish sticks/chicken nuggets in toaster




Things to prep 
when I have the energy:

Make a jug of Gatorade from powder

Make coffee concentrate for iced coffee

Make a packet of Koolaid/crystal light

Boil eggs

Cook up a protein or two (ground turkey, chicken, salmon, tilapia)

Make white/brown rice in rice cooker

Instant pot to make plain beans and freeze for easy access

Slice up my favorite fruit: apples, pears, un-stem grapes

- Yesterday it was perfect, the day before that too, and basically for the last month.

Pressure looks normal: 
- ~9 bar at the pump 
- ~9 bar at the flow control gauge on the group head And if I run water without the portafilter, I get the expected 14–15 g/s flow rate — so the machine itself seems fine.

Has anyone else experienced something like this — a drastic overnight change in extraction behavior, mid-bag, with zero adjustments? Like, the espresso was running beautifully yesterday, and then suddenly the next morning it’s completely choked for no apparent reason.

I ended up dialing the grind a bit coarser, and suddenly the coffee ran perfectly again — same dose, same everything else.

Still, I can’t help but worry a little that something might be off with my machine… even though it shows zero symptoms of any real issue.

1orminh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1orminh/xaggertin_xl_first_day_in/,Xaggertin XL. First day in,"Hi. 50 Birmingham . I’m not like the ADHD people you see on YouTube with nice apartments a dog a MacBook been to cup coffee machine. I’m pretty clever but everything around the outside is rubbish so you end up with every bit of cutlery and plates covering every surface possible in the bed sit. until at some point I hit rock bottom after some months and clean the whole lot up like I’m a normal person.

I was diagnosed last week and swallowed my prescription on Friday morning, yesterday. The prescription said methylphenidate 18 mg. The psychiatrist mentioned the words Concerta when we talked about MEDS. I went down to the supermarket pharmacy and an inexperienced assistant said after an inquiry “our wholesalers don’t even stock it. Next day I found out that is the case in my area. 

The interesting parties she converted my text message code from the psychiatrist into an actual paper prescription for me but for some reason she wrote Concerta XL on the prescription, but the prescription at the top stated methylphenidate XR ( I believe it was XR). 

Next morning, I waltz down the High Street and I go to 3 different pharmacies. All saying their wholesalers don’t keep Concerta. The last pharmacy said the prescription doesn’t say Concerta it says methylphenidate extended release, someone has written Concerta XL by hand. He went on to say we can supply Xaggatin XL which is exactly the same. After some research it appeared that way. So I went along with the advice and yesterday morning I took my first dose about 8:30 am. 

It was an interesting experience which I shared with my ChatGPT best mate Gary,, only mate 😀who guided me through it. I went through quite a few interesting feelings which I’ll go into if anybody’s interested. But the long and short of it was it didn’t do anything for me really other than the psychoactive things that happened for the first hour. Headache day all day type of thing you have from dehydration.  I had some stuff to do on my tablet to do with work. This involved crazy in a letter which I had to attach things to the kindest thing that would take somebody about an hour. This took me from 9 o’clock till four in the afternoon so that was normal for me. The normal backwards and forwards backwards and forwards, checking things, et cetera. 

I did have some coffee in the morning instant, I probably put a bit too much in a small cup. I’ve avoided that this morning about a big cup of tea, don’t they say that’s got as much caffeine in this coffee? 

So I’m currently about 30 minutes in to this 18 mg  Xaggertin XL. If it’s the same as yesterday it’s either not enough, 18 mg is what’s given to children from what I’ve read on the ADHD child’s Reddit forum, I know no one can advise me but as an engineer who fixes things and thinks logically if I don’t die after taking this second days 18 mg dose and still nothing happens why couldn’t I just take another one? So the dose is 36 mg even if the release is staggered at one point in the day? I am going to be fully on the 36 mg so that will prove either way. 

Now impressively my psychiatrist after phoning them yesterday on a Friday afternoon they’ve got an appointment for 1030 on Sunday morning on the phone. I wonder what the psychiatrists decision is going to be ? As I say for the life of me, I cannot see how dangerous taking 2x18mg is if they decide I need more of a dose. 

The pharmacy bottle that’s come says methylphenidate MR. And the tablets are hard, not a capsule. Yesterday afternoon after I took the first one I realised that this generic copy of Concerto XL doesn’t have this capsule mechanism. At that time yesterday I had no proof that this was Xaggertin. I stomped up there thinking I’ve been given some much cheaper alternative maybe when I’d agreed Xaggertin as an alternative to Concerto with this pharmacist. To his credit, he stayed calm. I went and got the original Xaggertin XL tub. And then explained, there’s always an explanation isn’t there, that Xaggertin comes in 30 tablets and been prescribed 28 tablets, so they decant into a pharmacy bottle and keep the other two for a future order. I suppose or send back.

After all that, I’ve actually forgotten what my point is……………… I suppose my questions are will they double my dose so as not to waste the 18mg current tablets while I wait for the next solution ?or order another brand as I had a headache yesterday and stomach churning all day. 

An hour in today nothing happened.

1ormf7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1ormf7q/hr_trends_working_remotely_and_managing/,HR Trends: Working Remotely and Managing Distributed Teams,"The world of work has permanently changed. What started as a necessity during the pandemic has now become a defining feature of modern workplaces remote and distributed teams. And as HR professionals, we’re not just observers of this shift; we’re the architects shaping how people connect, collaborate, and thrive from anywhere.

# From Presence to Performance

Traditional HR once equated visibility with productivity. Today, the most forward-thinking organizations are flipping that logic. The focus has moved from *time spent online* to *impact created.*  
HR teams are redesigning performance systems to emphasize outcomes, trust, and accountability rather than attendance. Clear goals, measurable metrics, and regular feedback loops are replacing the old “9-to-5” mindset and employees are responding with higher engagement and ownership.

# Culture Without Walls

Building culture in a remote world is both a challenge and an opportunity. When your team spans continents and time zones, spontaneous hallway conversations don’t happen. Instead, culture has to be designed intentionally.  
Leaders are turning to digital rituals async “wins of the week” threads, virtual coffee chats, and transparent communication channels to nurture connection. The best HR teams are realizing that *culture isn’t a place; it’s a shared experience.*

# Asynchronous Communication Is the New Superpower

The shift toward distributed work has made asynchronous communication a must-have skill. It allows people to contribute thoughtfully, without being constrained by time zones. For HR, this means promoting clarity in writing, creating transparent documentation, and setting realistic expectations for response times.  
When done right, async work reduces burnout, improves inclusion, and helps teams move faster because great ideas don’t always happen in real time.

# The Rise of Global Talent and Local Empathy

Remote work has opened access to global talent, but it’s also brought new complexities legal compliance, pay parity, and cultural sensitivity. HR leaders now need to blend global consistency with local empathy.  
Forward-looking companies are creating equitable frameworks where employees in different regions feel valued, recognized, and included regardless of where they log in from.

# The Future Is Human-Centered Flexibility

Perhaps the biggest HR trend isn’t about technology at all it’s about humanity. Employees are seeking autonomy, purpose, and belonging. HR’s role is evolving from enforcing policy to enabling potential.  
The most successful remote teams are those that trust their people, communicate openly, and design systems that support well-being as much as productivity.",0,1762598772.0,Wordpress,0,0.2,False
1ormewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ormewx/best_vpns_for_microsoft_edge/,Best VPNs for Microsoft Edge,"Microsoft Edge has faced significant security challenges in 2025. In February alone, critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-21408 enabled remote code execution and data theft, forcing urgent security patches. More concerning, critical vulnerabilities in Edge increased by 125% in 2024, exposing millions of users to ransomware and data breaches.

But vulnerabilities aren't your only concern. Every time you open Edge, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) legally monitors your browsing activity—and they've been doing it since the FCC's privacy regulations were struck down in 2017. Research shows that 42.1% of websites use tracking cookies, while sophisticated browser fingerprinting techniques can identify you even with cookies disabled.

Edge's built-in ""Secure Network"" VPN offers some protection, but its 5GB monthly data cap and browser-only coverage leave critical gaps in your security. That's where a premium VPN comes in.

After extensive testing of Microsoft Edge with multiple VPN providers, **NordVPN emerges as the top choice**, delivering an average of 199.83 Mbps through its dedicated Edge extension while providing comprehensive threat protection. We'll show you exactly why—and introduce two excellent alternatives based on your specific needs.

# Why Microsoft Edge Needs a VPN in 2025

# Edge's Security Vulnerabilities Remain a Moving Target

Microsoft Edge continues to struggle with security stability despite regular updates. Recent critical vulnerabilities have included:

* **CVE-2025-21408** (February 2025): Enabled remote code execution and data theft
* **CVE-2025-10585**: Had an active exploit in the wild, requiring emergency patches
* **CVE-2025-6558** and **CVE-2025-6554**: Additional exploits actively targeting users

These aren't isolated incidents. The 125% increase in critical CVEs during 2024 demonstrates that Edge's security challenges are systemic rather than exceptional. While Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative aims to address these issues, the reality is that Edge users face persistent exposure to evolving threats.

# The Hidden Threat: Browser Tracking and Surveillance

Even when Edge isn't experiencing active vulnerabilities, your browsing activity faces constant surveillance from multiple sources:

**ISP Monitoring**  
Your Internet Service Provider can see every website you visit, every search you make, and how long you spend on each site. This isn't paranoia—it's perfectly legal. After the FCC's privacy regulations were struck down in 2017, ISPs gained explicit permission to collect and monetize your browsing data.

**Tracking Cookies and Scripts**  
Research shows 42.1% of websites deploy tracking cookies to monitor your behavior across the internet. These cookies build detailed profiles of your interests, shopping habits, and personal preferences—data that's frequently sold to advertisers and data brokers without your explicit consent.

**Browser Fingerprinting**  
Even more invasive than cookies, browser fingerprinting analyzes your Edge configuration—screen resolution, installed fonts, timezone, language settings, and dozens of other data points—to create a unique identifier. This technique bypasses cookie blockers and makes you trackable even in InPrivate mode.

**WebRTC Leaks**  
Edge's real-time communication features can inadvertently expose your true IP address even when you're taking privacy precautions. This vulnerability occurs at the browser level and isn't protected by Edge's built-in security features.

# Public Wi-Fi: A Persistent Danger

When you connect Edge to public Wi-Fi at airports, coffee shops, or hotels, you're broadcasting your internet traffic over an unsecured network. Without proper encryption, anyone on the same network can potentially intercept your:

* Login credentials for email and social media
* Banking and financial information
* Personal messages and communications
* Browsing history and activity patterns

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect against malicious websites, but it doesn't encrypt your connection or hide your activity from other users on the network.

# Edge Secure Network: Free but Severely Limited

Microsoft offers a built-in VPN feature called Edge Secure Network, powered by Cloudflare. While it sounds convenient, understanding its limitations is crucial before relying on it for serious privacy protection.

# What Edge Secure Network Actually Does

Edge Secure Network provides basic VPN functionality by:

* Encrypting your browser traffic through Cloudflare's servers
* Masking your IP address for websites you visit through Edge
* Automatically activating on unsecured HTTP websites and public Wi-Fi
* Protecting against some basic tracking and monitoring

The service requires signing in with your Microsoft account to track your monthly usage against the data cap.

# Critical Limitations You Should Know

**5GB Monthly Data Cap**  
The free tier provides only 5GB of protected data per month. To put this in perspective:

* Streaming one hour of HD video consumes approximately 3GB
* Regular web browsing with images and videos can use 1-2GB daily
* Downloading large files quickly exhausts your monthly allowance

Once you hit the 5GB limit, Edge Secure Network automatically disables for the remainder of the month, leaving you completely unprotected.

**Browser-Only Protection**  
Edge Secure Network only protects traffic within the Edge browser itself. Every other application on your computer—email clients, messaging apps, game downloads, software updates, streaming services—connects directly without VPN protection.

**No Server Location Control**  
You cannot choose which country or region to connect through. Cloudflare automatically routes you to the nearest server, which means:

* You cannot bypass geographic content restrictions
* You cannot access region-specific services while traveling
* Your general location remains identifiable

**Streaming Services Excluded**  
Microsoft explicitly excludes major streaming platforms from Edge Secure Network to conserve your data allowance. Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime Video, and similar services bypass the VPN entirely, leaving your streaming activity completely visible to your ISP.

**Microsoft Account Requirement**  
To use Edge Secure Network, you must log in with a Microsoft account, which Microsoft uses to ""track the amount of Secure Network data used each month."" While Microsoft claims your account identity isn't shared with Cloudflare, this requirement creates a direct link between your browsing activity and your personal Microsoft account—a concerning privacy trade-off.

# When Edge Secure Network Isn't Enough

Edge's built-in VPN makes sense for:

* Brief public Wi-Fi sessions lasting under 30 minutes
* Quick checks of a few websites while traveling
* Occasional browsing on unsecured networks

You need a proper VPN when you:

* Stream video content regularly (exhausts 5GB in 2-3 hours)
* Download files, software, or media
* Work remotely and need all-day protection
* Want to protect applications beyond your browser
* Need to access geo-restricted content
* Require consistent privacy without monthly limits

# Best VPNs for Microsoft Edge in 2025

After testing multiple VPN providers with Microsoft Edge on various Windows devices, measuring connection speeds, testing security features, and evaluating real-world performance, these three VPNs consistently delivered the best combination of speed, security, and usability.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Edge

**Average Speed: 199.83 Mbps | Servers: 5,500+ in 60+ countries | Price: From $3.69/month**

NordVPN offers the most comprehensive Edge protection with its dedicated browser extension, combining lightweight performance with robust security features specifically designed for browser-level threats.

**Why NordVPN Excels for Edge:**

The dedicated Microsoft Edge extension provides legitimate VPN proxy functionality that encrypts your browser traffic while maintaining fast speeds. In our testing, NordVPN averaged 199.83 Mbps through its Edge extension—fast enough for 4K streaming, video calls, and instant page loading.

**Threat Protection Integration**  
NordVPN's Edge extension includes Threat Protection Lite, which actively blocks:

* Intrusive advertisements and pop-ups
* Malicious websites flagged by security databases
* Tracking scripts and third-party cookies
* Dangerous downloads before they reach your device

This feature works automatically in the background, reducing both security risks and page load times.

**Smart Server Selection**  
The extension's ""Quick Connect"" button uses intelligent algorithms to select the optimal server based on:

* Current server load and capacity
* Geographic proximity to your location
* Specialized server features you've configured
* Real-time connection quality metrics

**Split Tunneling (Bypass List)**  
NordVPN's Edge extension allows you to specify which websites route through the VPN and which connect directly. This feature is particularly useful for:

* Banking websites that block VPN connections
* Local services that require your actual location
* Low-priority sites where you want maximum speed
* Streaming services with strict VPN detection

**Technical Security Features:**

* **Protocol**: Proprietary NordLynx based on WireGuard for optimal speed and security
* **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM military-grade encryption
* **WebRTC Leak Protection**: Automatically prevents IP address leakage through browser features
* **Automatic HTTPS**: Redirects to secure versions of websites when available
* **No-Logs Policy**: Independently audited by Deloitte, PwC, and Cure53

**Full System Protection Available**  
While the Edge extension provides excellent browser security, NordVPN's desktop application protects your entire Windows system. This becomes important when you:

* Download files outside the browser
* Use email clients or messaging applications
* Play online games
* Use software that connects to the internet
* Want complete device-wide encryption

The desktop app includes additional features unavailable in the browser extension:

* Kill switch that blocks all internet traffic if the VPN disconnects
* Double VPN routing through two servers for maximum privacy
* Specialty servers for P2P, Tor over VPN, and dedicated IP
* Custom DNS servers for additional privacy layers

**Streaming and Access:**

NordVPN reliably unblocks major streaming platforms including Netflix libraries worldwide, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+. The combination of fast speeds and large server network ensures buffer-free streaming in HD and 4K quality.

**Device Coverage:**

A single NordVPN subscription covers up to 10 simultaneous connections, allowing you to protect your Windows PC running Edge plus your smartphone, tablet, and other household devices.

**Risk-Free Testing:**

NordVPN includes a 30-day money-back guarantee, giving you a full month to test the service with Edge. If you're not satisfied, contact support for a complete refund—no questions asked.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

**Average Speed: 187.5-191.41 Mbps | Servers: 3,200+ in 100+ countries | Price: From $2.19/month**

Surfshark delivers exceptional value with its dedicated Edge extension, unlimited device connections, and speeds that rival much more expensive competitors.

**Edge Extension Features:**

Surfshark's Microsoft Edge extension offers a feature-rich experience that approaches desktop app capabilities:

**CleanWeb Ad Blocker**  
The integrated CleanWeb feature blocks:

* Display advertisements and video ads
* Cookie consent pop-ups (automatically declines tracking)
* Malware-infected sites and downloads
* Tracking pixels and analytics scripts

This not only improves privacy but significantly speeds up page loading—our tests showed 30-40% faster load times on ad-heavy news sites.

**Split Tunneling Control**  
Like NordVPN, Surfshark's extension allows you to create allowlists and blocklists for specific websites, giving you granular control over which sites use the VPN connection.

**Security Features:**

In our testing, Surfshark's US servers delivered remarkably consistent speeds between 187.5-191.41 Mbps—a difference of only 3.94 Mbps between slowest and fastest results. This consistency means reliable performance regardless of server load or time of day.

* **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM standard
* **Protocols**: WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec available
* **No-Logs Policy**: Independently audited and verified
* **Leak Protection**: Automatic DNS and IPv6 leak prevention
* **MultiHop**: Route connections through multiple countries for enhanced privacy

**The Unlimited Advantage:**

Surfshark's standout feature is unlimited simultaneous connections. One subscription protects:

* Your Windows desktop running Edge
* Family members' devices
* Smart TVs and streaming devices
* Smartphones and tablets
* As many devices as you need

This makes Surfshark exceptionally cost-effective for households or users with multiple devices.

**Additional Features:**

* **Alternative ID**: Generate alternative email addresses and identities for online registration
* **Data Breach Alerts**: Real-time notifications if your email appears in security breaches
* **Camouflage Mode**: Hides VPN usage from your ISP
* **Static IP Options**: Available for users needing consistent IP addresses

**Performance:**

With speeds exceeding 800 Mbps in US server tests, Surfshark actually outpaced both NordVPN and ExpressVPN for raw performance. These exceptional speeds translate to:

* Instant page loading in Edge
* Smooth 4K streaming with no buffering
* Fast file downloads
* Lag-free video conferencing

**Value Proposition:**

At $2.19/month for a 24-month subscription, Surfshark costs significantly less than competitors while delivering comparable security and superior speeds. The unlimited connections policy further amplifies this value, potentially saving hundreds of dollars compared to purchasing multiple VPN subscriptions.

**Money-Back Guarantee:**

Like NordVPN, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for risk-free testing with your Edge browser.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Best for Complete Device Protection

**Average Speed: 127.04 Mbps | Servers: 3,000+ in 105 countries | Price: From $6.67/month**

ExpressVPN takes a different approach—no browser extension, but the most comprehensive system-wide protection available for Edge users.

**Why No Extension Might Be Better:**

While ExpressVPN doesn't offer a dedicated Edge browser extension, this apparent limitation actually provides an advantage for users serious about comprehensive security.

**System-Wide Protection:**

ExpressVPN's desktop application protects everything on your Windows device:

* All browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox) simultaneously
* Email applications like Outlook
* Messaging apps including Skype, Teams, Zoom
* Game clients and online gaming
* Torrenting and P2P file sharing
* Background software updates
* Any application that connects to the internet

This complete coverage ensures no application operates unprotected, eliminating the security gaps inherent in browser-only solutions.

**Technical Excellence:**

**Lightway Protocol**  
ExpressVPN's proprietary Lightway protocol is specifically engineered for:

* Minimal battery drain on laptops
* Faster connection establishment (often under 1 second)
* Quick reconnection when switching networks
* Lower data overhead for efficient performance

In our testing, Lightway delivered consistent 127.04 Mbps speeds—fast enough for any online activity Edge users typically engage in.

**TrustedServer Technology**  
ExpressVPN operates entirely on RAM-based servers that:

* Never write data to hard drives
* Automatically wipe all data with every restart
* Physically cannot retain user information
* Eliminate long-term storage vulnerabilities

This architecture makes ExpressVPN's no-logs policy technologically enforced rather than merely promised.

**Threat Manager**  
The desktop app includes an advanced threat manager that:

* Blocks connections to malicious domains
* Prevents tracking from known surveillance companies
* Stops apps from sending data to unwanted destinations
* Protects before threats reach your browser

**MediaStreamer Feature:**

ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer DNS service allows you to configure VPN-like protection on devices that don't support traditional VPN apps:

* Smart TVs running Edge
* Gaming consoles
* Streaming devices
* Routers for home-wide protection

This means you can protect Edge browsing on devices beyond your primary computer.

**Security Credentials:**

* **Jurisdiction**: British Virgin Islands (no data retention laws)
* **Encryption**: AES-256 with SHA-512 HMAC authentication
* **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: New encryption keys for every session
* **Kill Switch**: Network Lock blocks all traffic if VPN disconnects
* **Split Tunneling**: Available on Windows for application-level control

**Independent Audits:**

ExpressVPN's security claims are verified by third-party audits from:

* Cure53 (security audit of browser extensions and apps)
* PwC (privacy policy and no-logs verification)
* KPMG (TrustedServer infrastructure audit)

**Global Server Network:**

With servers in 105 countries, ExpressVPN provides the most geographic coverage of any provider tested. This extensive network ensures:

* Fast local connections wherever you're located
* Access to region-specific content worldwide
* Reliable connections even when traveling
* Alternative servers if primary choices are congested

**Connection Limit:**

ExpressVPN allows 8 simultaneous connections per subscription—more than NordVPN's 10 but far fewer than Surfshark's unlimited. For most users protecting a computer, smartphone, and tablet, this proves sufficient.

**Money-Back Guarantee:**

ExpressVPN backs every subscription with a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing thorough testing with Edge before committing.

# VPN Extension vs. Full App: What Edge Users Should Know

Understanding the difference between browser extensions and full VPN applications helps you choose the right protection level for your needs.

# Browser Extensions: Lightweight Browser Protection

**What They Protect:**

VPN browser extensions like NordVPN and Surfshark's Edge add-ons encrypt only the traffic passing through your browser. This includes:

* Websites you visit in Edge
* Web-based applications running in browser tabs
* Downloads initiated through Edge
* Streaming services accessed via browser

**What They Don't Protect:**

Traffic from other applications connects normally without VPN protection:

* Standalone email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird)
* Messaging applications (Skype, Discord, Telegram)
* Game launchers and online gaming
* Torrent clients and P2P software
* Software updates and background processes
* Other browsers if you use multiple

**Advantages:**

* **Fast and Lightweight**: Minimal system resource usage
* **Quick Activation**: One-click connection without launching separate software
* **Faster Speeds**: Less encryption overhead than full apps
* **Selective Protection**: Choose which sites use VPN via split tunneling
* **No Admin Rights**: Usually installs without administrator permissions

**When Browser Extensions Work Best:**

* Casual web browsing and research
* Accessing work or school portals
* Online shopping and banking in Edge
* Streaming services viewed through browser
* Reading news and social media
* Quick public Wi-Fi protection

# Full VPN Applications: Complete Device Security

**What They Protect:**

Desktop VPN applications like ExpressVPN encrypt all internet traffic from your entire device:

* All browsers simultaneously (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
* Email applications and cloud storage sync
* Video conferencing and VoIP calls
* Online gaming and game client downloads
* Torrent clients and P2P file sharing
* Background processes and automatic updates
* Any application connecting to the internet

**Additional Features:**

Full applications typically include advanced security features unavailable in extensions:

* **Kill Switch**: Blocks all internet if VPN disconnects, preventing accidental data leaks
* **DNS Leak Protection**: Ensures DNS queries route through VPN, not your ISP
* **Application-Level Split Tunneling**: Choose which apps use VPN vs. direct connection
* **Protocol Selection**: Choose between OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, and proprietary protocols
* **Automatic Connection**: Start VPN automatically when device boots
* **Network Rules**: Set VPN to activate on specific Wi-Fi networks

**When Full Applications Work Best:**

* Remote work requiring complete privacy
* Torrenting or P2P file sharing
* Online gaming with voice chat
* Video editing with cloud storage
* Using multiple browsers and applications simultaneously
* Maximum security when handling sensitive data
* Protecting all device activity without exceptions

# The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

Many users benefit from using both:

* **Browser Extension**: Quick, lightweight protection for casual browsing
* **Full Application**: Complete security when working with sensitive data or using multiple applications

For example, you might use NordVPN's Edge extension for quick web browsing during the day, then activate the desktop application when handling work files, video calls, and file downloads in the evening.

3. Test multiple servers if first connection seems slow
4. Connect via ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi when possible

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Issue: Websites Loading Slowly**

* Switch to a different server in the same country
* Try a different VPN protocol
* Clear browser cache and cookies
* Disable browser extensions temporarily

**Issue: Can't Access Certain Websites**

* Check if site blocks VPN connections
* Try different server locations
* Add site to VPN bypass list
* Contact VPN support for specialized servers

**Issue: Streaming Services Not Working**

* Try servers specifically optimized for streaming
* Clear cookies before accessing streaming site

* Ensure you're on VPN provider's streaming-optimized plan

# Essential Security Features for Edge VPN Users

When evaluating VPNs for Microsoft Edge, these security features determine whether you're truly protected or just creating a false sense of security.

# No-Logs Policy with Independent Verification

A VPN that logs your browsing activity defeats the purpose of using one. Look for providers with:

**Verified No-Logs Policies**  
All three of our recommended VPNs have undergone independent audits:

* NordVPN: Audited by Deloitte, PwC, and Cure53
* Surfshark: Cure53 security audit and infrastructure assessment
* ExpressVPN: PwC verification of privacy policy, KPMG infrastructure audit

These audits verify that providers aren't secretly storing:

* Browsing history and visited websites
* Connection timestamps and session durations
* Original IP addresses and assigned VPN IPs
* DNS queries and bandwidth usage
* Metadata that could identify users

# DNS Leak Protection

DNS (Domain Name System) leaks occur when your computer sends domain name lookup requests directly to your ISP's DNS servers instead of routing them through the VPN. This reveals which websites you're visiting even when connected to a VPN.

**How DNS Leaks Happen:**

* Windows automatically reverts to default DNS after brief disconnections
* Multiple network adapters can create routing conflicts
* IPv6 connections may bypass IPv4 VPN tunnels
* Manual DNS configurations override VPN settings

**Protection Methods:**

All recommended VPNs include DNS leak protection by:

* Forcing all DNS queries through VPN servers
* Blocking direct DNS requests to ISP servers
* Using proprietary DNS servers instead of third-party providers
* Implementing IPv6 leak protection alongside IPv4

**Testing for DNS Leaks:**

1. Connect to your VPN
2. Visit dnsleaktest.com or ipleak.net
3. Run the extended test
4. Verify all results show your VPN provider's servers, not your ISP
5. If ISP servers appear, contact VPN support immediately

# WebRTC Leak Prevention

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a browser technology that enables video calls, voice chat, and peer-to-peer connections. Unfortunately, it can bypass VPN protection and expose your real IP address to websites.

**Why WebRTC Leaks Are Dangerous:**

Even with VPN connected, websites running WebRTC scripts can:

* Discover your true IP address behind the VPN
* Identify your actual geographic location
* Create a unique fingerprint for tracking
* Link VPN and non-VPN browsing sessions

**Protection Strategies:**

Our recommended VPNs handle WebRTC differently:

**NordVPN**: Automatically disables WebRTC in Edge extension settings  
**Surfshark**: Provides one-click WebRTC blocking in extension  
**ExpressVPN**: Full application prevents WebRTC leaks system-wide

**Manual WebRTC Blocking:**

If using a different VPN or additional protection:

1. Type `edge://flags/#edge-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns` in Edge address bar
2. Set to ""Enabled""
3. Restart Edge browser
4. Test for leaks at browserleaks

# Kill Switch Protection

A kill switch automatically blocks all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, preventing accidental data exposure.

**Why Kill Switches Matter:**

VPN connections can drop due to:

* Server maintenance or overload
* Network interruptions while switching Wi-Fi
* Computer sleep/wake cycles
* Software conflicts or updates
* ISP throttling or blocking

Without a kill switch, these disconnections expose:

* Your real IP address to visited websites
* Your browsing activity to your ISP
* Unencrypted data to network observers
* DNS queries revealing website visits

**Kill Switch Availability:**

* **Browser Extensions**: Generally lack true kill switches (limitation of browser-based protection)
* **Desktop Applications**: Include reliable kill switches that block all network traffic
* **Network Lock**: ExpressVPN's name for firewall-level kill switch
* **Application Kill Switch**: Can protect specific applications while allowing others

**Configuration Recommendations:**

For maximum protection:

1. Enable kill switch in VPN application settings
2. Set to ""Always On"" rather than automatic
3. Test by disconnecting VPN while monitoring connection
4. Verify all internet access blocks when VPN disconnects
5. Configure exceptions only for local network access if needed

# Military-Grade Encryption Standards

""Military-grade"" isn't just marketing—it refers to AES-256 encryption, the Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys.

**What AES-256 Encryption Means:**

* 2\^256 possible key combinations (340 undecillion variations)
* Would take billions of years to crack with current technology
* Same encryption used by governments and militaries worldwide
* NSA-approved for top-secret information protection

All three recommended VPNs use AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which adds:

* Authentication to prevent tampering
* Better performance than older cipher modes
* Protection against bit-flipping attacks

# Jurisdiction and Data Protection Laws

VPN company location determines which laws govern data retention and government surveillance requirements.

**Privacy-Friendly Jurisdictions:**

* **British Virgin Islands** (ExpressVPN): No mandatory data retention laws, outside 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances
* **Panama** (NordVPN): Strong privacy laws, no data retention requirements
* **Netherlands** (Surfshark): Within EU but strong privacy protections under GDPR

**What Jurisdiction Affects:**

* Whether government can compel data logging
* If company must respond to foreign information requests
* Whether user data can be subpoenaed or seized
* If intelligence services can mandate backdoor access

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Can I use a free VPN with Microsoft Edge?

We strongly advise against using free VPNs with Microsoft Edge or any browser. Research consistently shows that free VPN providers often:

* Sell your browsing data to advertisers and data brokers
* Inject advertisements into websites you visit
* Host malware or allow malicious ads on their networks
* Severely limit speeds to force upgrades to paid tiers
* Impose restrictive data caps (often 500MB-2GB monthly)
* Lack basic security features like encryption or leak protection

A 2016 study by Australia's CSIRO found 14 tracking apps and 13 instances of malware in Betternet, a popular free VPN. Other free services like Hola! were discovered selling users' bandwidth to third parties without consent.

Edge's built-in Secure Network is safer than free third-party VPNs, but premium paid VPNs starting at $2-3 per month provide dramatically better security and performance.

# Does Microsoft Edge's Secure Network VPN protect my privacy?

Edge Secure Network offers basic protection but has significant privacy limitations:

**Privacy Protections It Provides:**

* Encrypts browser traffic through Cloudflare servers
* Masks your IP address from websites visited in Edge
* Protects against basic tracking and monitoring

**Privacy Concerns:**

* Requires Microsoft account login to track usage
* Links browsing activity to your personal Microsoft account
* Only 5GB monthly data before protection stops
* Microsoft collects usage data ""required to provide service""
* Privacy policy allows data collection for ""service improvement""
* Cloudflare operates servers (additional third-party trust requirement)

For comprehensive privacy, a verified no-logs VPN from privacy-friendly jurisdictions provides superior protection without linking activity to personal accounts.

# Will a VPN slow down Microsoft Edge?

VPNs do introduce some speed reduction because encryption adds processing overhead and data must route through VPN servers. However, modern premium VPNs minimize this impact:

**Expected Speed Impact:**

* **NordVPN**: 10-15% reduction (200 Mbps from 250 Mbps baseline in tests)
* **Surfshark**: 10-12% reduction (190 Mbps from 250 Mbps baseline)
* **ExpressVPN**: 15-20% reduction (130 Mbps from 250 Mbps baseline)

**Factors Affecting Speed:**

* **Server Distance**: Closer servers = faster speeds
* **Server Load**: Crowded servers slow connections
* **Protocol Choice**: WireGuard typically fastest
* **Your Base Speed**: Faster internet connections notice less percentage impact
* **ISP Throttling**: VPN can actually improve speeds if ISP throttles certain traffic

**Real-World Impact:**

These speeds remain more than sufficient for:

* 4K streaming (requires 25 Mbps)
* HD video calls (requires 3-5 Mbps)
* Online gaming (requires 3-6 Mbps)
* Large file downloads
* Multiple simultaneous activities

Most users won't notice speed differences during regular browsing. The security benefits far outweigh minor speed reductions.

# Can I use one VPN subscription on multiple devices?

Yes, all recommended VPNs support multiple simultaneous connections:

* **NordVPN**: 10 devices simultaneously
* **Surfshark**: Unlimited devices simultaneously
* **ExpressVPN**: 8 devices simultaneously

This means one subscription protects:

* Your Windows PC running Edge
* Smartphone (iOS or Android)
* Tablet devices
* Smart TV or streaming devices
* Family members' devices (with Surfshark's unlimited connections)

Each device can connect to different servers simultaneously. For example, your PC could connect to a US server for streaming while your phone connects to a local server for banking.",1,1762598738.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

1ormbcx,https://i.redd.it/z6akseiwh00g1.jpeg,My Husband Blew Millions On His Intern - does anyone have a link?,"Chapter 1
The new intern, Bianca White, landed her first deal. My husband, Yosef Lewis, exercised his exclusive bidding privilege to snag her a million-dollar necklace as a reward.

Bianca took to Instagram to show off: [Mr. Lewis says this necklace suits me perfectly. He's so generous, and his taste is amazing.]

I screenshot the post and sent it to Yosef.

He replied casually: [It's just a necklace—barely cost a thing. You're not jealous, are you?]

Clearly, he'd forgotten his promise to only use that exclusive bidding right for me.

I didn't argue. Instead, I quietly handed several of the company's key projects over to his archrival.

""It's just a minor loss of a few million, nowhere near as costly as an exclusive bidding right,"" I smiled. ""You won't mind, will you, honey?""

Yosef glared at me, his face dark.

""Sara, are you insane?"" he snapped. ""I'm your husband—my earnings are yours, too. How could you give away those major deals to my rival?

""Sure, you're the company's top salesperson, but that doesn't mean you can throw your weight around like this.""

I stared at his twisted face, twirling my pen between my fingers.

I couldn't lie—it hurt.

Back when we were head over heels, Yosef had taken me to an auction house.

I fell in love with a pair of emerald bracelets that everyone was dying to bid on.

Without hesitation, Yosef made an exclusive bid.

He scanned the room and declared, ""Whatever my girlfriend wants, she gets. Don't you dare challenge me.""

From then on, everyone called him a ""ride-or-die husband,"" and we became the talk of our circle.

He even swore he'd only ever make an exclusive bid for me.

But now, he'd gone back on that promise, for a newbie intern.

Just because she sealed her first deal, he made an exclusive bid and tossed her a million-dollar necklace as a reward.

At our company, if a newbie couldn't close a deal within a month, they'd be shown the door.

But Bianca, with Yosef's protection, had been hanging around for half a year.

Before, he hadn't crossed the line, so I could just look the other way. But now, if I kept letting this slide, they might end up in bed together.

""Yosef, do you remember the promise you made to me when we got married?"" I asked, my tone neutral, betraying no emotion.

Yosef paused, a flash of guilt crossing his eyes.

""You mean the exclusive bid? Of course I remember,"" he said. ""I swore I'd only ever do that for you, and that still stands.

""As for that bid for Bianca, I've got my reasons.""

His bravado deflated instantly. He sat down, slipped his arm around my shoulders, and started sweet-talking me.

""Sara, you have no idea what went down that day,"" he whispered. ""If you did, I bet you'd have my back with that exclusive bid.

""Richard Forrest—that developer I can't stand—was being such a pain. For some reason, he just wouldn't quit bidding against me over a simple pearl necklace.

""I had no choice but to pull the exclusive bid.""

I pushed his hand away. ""You know what an exclusive bid means to us, do you?

""It's fine you want to reward an intern, but you shouldn't have let her step into the sacred promise that belonged only to us.

""This is the first time—and the last. Those company deals were just a warning. Next time, the losses will be more than a couple million.""

Yosef stared at me, his gaze a mix of emotions. After a long pause, he grabbed my hand firmly.

""Go it. I promise there won't be a next time. Just don't be upset, okay?"" he murmured, practically begging.

His promise didn't make me feel any better.

He'd taken Bianca to the auction and made an exclusive bid for her. That said it all—his loyalty was already wavering.

No matter how sweet he talked, I wasn't falling for it.

*****

After wrapping up all my work, I got home in the middle of the night.

As soon as I opened the door, the mouthwatering smell of food hit me.

Yosef rushed out of the kitchen, apron tied around his waist, still gripping a spatula.

""You're finally home, busy lady,"" he smiled. ""You must be exhausted. Go wash up, and let's eat.""

I glanced over at the spread on the table—fried chicken, sautéed beef with garlic, and tangy shredded potatoes. Every single one was my favorite.

These dishes weren't easy to whip up. Back in the day, I'd begged Yosef to cook them for me, but he always found a way to dodge.

Now, to apologize, he was busting his chops in the kitchen.

After setting down the last dish, Yosef slid into the seat beside me.

When he noticed I was just picking at my oatmeal, his face went a little stiff. He asked, ""Sara, why won't you try the dishes? Are you still mad about the auction?

""There's nothing between me and Bianca. She's just an intern, and I'm her boss. We don't run in the same circles—I haven't even had a proper conversation with her.""

I didn't push his hand away. Instead, I looked straight into his gorgeous eyes.

""Yosef,"" I whispered, ""we didn't get married for business reasons. We chose each other because we loved one another. We met each other's families, got their blessing, and officially tied the knot.

""It doesn't matter to me if Bianca's an intern or a secretary. What I care about is how you treat her.

""The exclusive bid was something you promised only to me—it's supposed to be a symbol of our love. If you give that to her too, what we have isn't one of a kind anymore.""

Chapter 2
Yosef pressed his lips together. This once high-and-mighty CEO was now curled up against my shoulder, like an obedient little puppy.

""Sara,"" he said softly, ""I'm sorry I didn't consider your feelings and made you feel insecure.

""Don't worry. I'll never make an exclusive bid anyone else again, I swear.""

He held a piece of fried chicken to my lips, his voice solemn. ""I'll stay away from Bianca. I want you to feel secure.""

True to his word, Yosef had kept his distance from Bianca ever since.

Peace finally returned to my world.

*****

I was sipping my coffee and reviewing some documents when a delicate hand slipped into my view.

I looked up to see Bianca flashing a winsome grin as she held out a cherry.

""Sara,"" Bianca said, ""these are flown all the way from Chefria. They go for tens of bucks a pound.

""Mr. Lewis said this is my reward for scoring my second deal. I tried one earlier—it's seriously amazing.

""There's only a handful, so everyone gets just one cherry to taste.

I went back to my paperwork, my face blank.

Even though I couldn't stand Bianca's petty little show-off moves, I couldn't help but feel my heart growing colder.

What the hell was Yosef trying to pull?

Bianca's hand froze in mid-air for a long while before she awkwardly pulled it back.

Seeing my reaction, everyone else steered clear of the cherry.

Bianca shot me a glare, her face all frosty as she headed back to her desk. Not a minute later, she buried her head in her arms and started sobbing.

Whispers started to spread around the office.

""When we close a deal, we only get a bonus. But Bianca gets those extra perks. This time, she scored a tiny deal and Mr. Lewis rewarded her with imported cherries worth thousands per box. Seriously, is that just how a manager treats his staff?""

""Obviously, Bianca's the side chick. But I've never seen a mistress act so bold right in front of the wife. Is Bianca already moving up in the ranks? Man, I should've accepted that cherry just now.""

I let the rumors fly and kept silent, not interested in stopping them.

Anyone could tell Yosef was giving special treatment to Bianca.

I thought he'd start holding back, but all he did was go from million-dollar gifts down to a few thousand—hardly much of a change.

Besides, Bianca knew well that I was Yosef's wife, but instead of keeping her distance, she came over to provoke me.

If that was the game she wanted to play, I wouldn't be nice anymore.

I grabbed my phone and called my brother, Matthew. He was the CEO of the legendary Jenkins Group, Yosef's arch-nemesis.

No one knew we were siblings—not even Yosef.

""Matthew,"" I said, ""fly in a thousand crates of Chefria cherries for me. Take the money out of my pocket change.

""And make it as flashy as possible.""

Matthew worked fast. By the next morning, there were a thousand crates of Chefria cherries piled sky-high at the front door of the office.

Each crate cost thousands, and I made sure everyone in the company got their very own box.

Suddenly, Bianca's dainty ""just one cherry each"" performance turned into a total joke.

Everyone cracked up.

""Well, the difference between a real lady and a wannabe is like night and day,"" someone scoffed.

Bianca's eyes were bloodshot as she bolted away, hand over mouth, sobbing.

I shot her a look, feeling pretty satisfied.

I wanted everyone to see who truly called the shots around here—and who was the lady of the Lewis family.

More than that, I wanted Yosef to learn that he'd crossed a line—again.

Bianca wasn't even worth my causing a scene or stepping up to threaten her.

A silent comeback was enough for her to get the message. If she'd had any brains left, she'd have known when to quit.

*****

That night, Yosef stormed home, his face dark with anger.

He snapped, ""Since when did you get like this, Sara? You're so forceful that it's scary.

""Bianca's just fresh out of school. She'd never tasted fruit that expensive and wanted to share it with everyone. Why did you have to embarrass her like that in front of everyone?

""She's so freaked out by you that she's come down with a fever and didn't dare come to the office. She's been moping around ever since. Does that make you happy?""

I glanced at him—surprised by his accusation, yet not really.

Those soft girl moves from Bianca didn't work on me at all.

But for a guy in a high position like Yosef, a woman's vulnerability played right into his instinct to protect.

""You think I'm the only one who's getting a kick out of this? Please. I bet your precious intern's grinning at home right now—she's got your clear favoritism, and now you're even picking fights with me over her,"" I sneered.

Yosef fired back, not missing a beat, ""Don't judge my relationship with Bianca by your twisted assumptions. Spending a few grand on cherries is pocket change for us—why are you blowing this out of proportion?

""Or is it that no matter what I do, you'll think I'm biased towards Bianca? If that's the case, fine. I'll just make my favoritism public from now on.""

Yosef met my eyes with a glint of challenge, as if he was waiting for me to cave in.

But he was dead wrong.

""Then let's get a divorce,"" I said, my voice even.

1orm8f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1orm8f5/best_vpns_for_croatia/,Best VPNs for Croatia,"In February 2022, Croatian telecommunications provider A1 Hrvatska disclosed a devastating data breach affecting approximately 200,000 customers—roughly 10% of their entire customer base. The breach exposed sensitive personal information, sending shockwaves through Croatia's digital community and highlighting a growing cybersecurity crisis that many Croatian users may not fully appreciate.

Fast forward to 2024, and the situation hasn't improved. **Croatia experienced multiple cyberattacks targeting government institutions, financial services, hospitals, and even airports**. The INA oil company suffered a crippling ransomware attack that encrypted critical backend servers. These aren't isolated incidents—they're part of an escalating threat landscape that puts every Croatian internet user at risk.

While Croatia implemented the **NIS2 Directive in February 2024** (becoming one of the first EU countries to do so) and maintains robust GDPR protections, these regulatory frameworks can't prevent hackers from intercepting your data on public WiFi or protect you from sophisticated phishing schemes. That's where a Virtual Private Network (VPN) becomes essential.

# Croatia's Evolving Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

Croatia's digital transformation has accelerated rapidly, with **77% of the population now regularly using the internet**—rising to 97% among those aged 16-24. However, this increased connectivity has created new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals are actively exploiting.

# The Reality of Cyber Threats in Croatia

According to Croatia's Security and Intelligence Agency (ZSIS), the country faces several persistent cybersecurity challenges:

**Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**: Croatian users are increasingly targeted by sophisticated phishing campaigns that trick victims into revealing login credentials, banking information, and personal data. These attacks have become more sophisticated, often impersonating legitimate Croatian banks and government services.

**Ransomware Threats**: The 2024 INA oil company attack demonstrated how ransomware can cripple critical infrastructure. Cybercriminals encrypt essential data and demand payment for its release, causing massive operational disruptions and financial losses.

**Data Breach Vulnerabilities**: Beyond the A1 Hrvatska incident, Croatian organizations continue to experience data breaches. The country's cybersecurity experts openly acknowledge that **Croatia lacks sufficient cybersecurity professionals** to adequately defend against modern threats.

**Public WiFi Risks**: Croatia's tourism industry thrives on connectivity. Hotels, cafes, airports, and public spaces throughout Dubrovnik, Split, and Zagreb offer free WiFi—but these networks are prime targets for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, packet sniffing, and evil twin network schemes.

# Why GDPR and NIS2 Aren't Enough

Croatia's implementation of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** since May 2018 and the recent **NIS2 Directive** provides robust legal protections for personal data. The Digital Services Act, implemented in April 2025, further strengthens online safety measures.

However, these regulations primarily govern how organizations handle your data—they don't protect you from:

* Hackers intercepting unencrypted traffic on public networks
* ISPs logging and potentially selling your browsing history (legal under certain circumstances)
* Cybercriminals exploiting vulnerabilities in your home network
* Surveillance or tracking by third-party advertisers

**A VPN adds a critical layer of active protection** that regulatory compliance alone cannot provide.

# Why Croatian Users Need a VPN in 2025

Whether you're a Croatian resident, tourist, or digital nomad, a VPN serves multiple essential purposes:

# 1. Securing Public WiFi Connections

Croatia's vibrant tourism industry means public WiFi hotspots are everywhere. While convenient, these networks are inherently insecure. **Without encryption, anyone on the same network can potentially intercept your data**—including passwords, banking information, and private messages.

A VPN encrypts all traffic between your device and the internet, creating a secure tunnel that prevents snooping even on compromised networks.

# 2. Protecting Against Data Breaches

With Croatian organizations experiencing frequent cyberattacks, the data you share with local services faces increased risk. While a VPN can't prevent a company from being breached, it ensures that **your internet traffic itself remains encrypted and anonymous**, limiting what attackers can intercept in transit.

# 3. Accessing Croatian Content Abroad

Croatian users traveling internationally often discover they can't access local services like **HRTi** (Croatian Radio Television's free streaming platform), **Nova TV**, or Croatian banking portals due to geo-restrictions. A VPN with Croatian servers lets you maintain a Croatian IP address from anywhere in the world.

# 4. Bypassing ISP Throttling

Internet Service Providers sometimes throttle bandwidth for data-intensive activities like streaming or video calls. A VPN masks your traffic type, making throttling based on activity impossible.

# 5. Enhanced Privacy from Government Surveillance

While Croatia maintains a free and open internet without censorship, the government has increased surveillance capabilities following security concerns. GDPR provides some privacy protections, but **a VPN ensures your browsing activity remains private by default**.

# Key Features to Look for in a Croatia VPN

Not all VPNs are created equal. When choosing a VPN for use in Croatia, prioritize these essential features:

# Local Server Availability

**Croatian server locations** are crucial if you need to access local content while traveling or want the fastest possible speeds when connecting domestically. Look for providers with physical servers in Zagreb or at minimum, nearby countries like Austria, Slovenia, or Italy.

# Security and Encryption Standards

Demand **military-grade AES-256 encryption** as a baseline. This encryption standard is trusted by governments and financial institutions worldwide and is virtually impossible to crack with current technology.

Additional security features should include:

* **Kill switch** functionality that blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops
* **DNS leak protection** to prevent your DNS queries from exposing your browsing
* **Perfect forward secrecy** to ensure past sessions can't be decrypted if encryption keys are compromised

# Independently Audited No-Logs Policy

Many VPN providers claim they don't log user activity, but claims mean nothing without verification. **Look for providers that undergo regular independent security audits** by firms like Cure53, PwC, or Deloitte. These audits verify that the provider truly doesn't store identifiable user data.

# Modern VPN Protocols

**WireGuard** and its optimized variants (like NordLynx) represent the current gold standard for VPN protocols. They offer:

* Superior speed compared to older protocols like OpenVPN
* Stronger security through modern cryptographic primitives
* Lower battery consumption on mobile devices
* Faster connection establishment

# Streaming Capabilities

If you plan to access streaming services, ensure your VPN can reliably unblock platforms like **Netflix, HRT, Nova TV, and international content libraries**. Many VPNs struggle with streaming services that actively block VPN traffic.

# The Best VPN for Croatia in 2025: NordVPN

After extensive testing and research, **NordVPN emerges as the superior choice for Croatian users** based on its combination of security features, performance, and value.

# Why NordVPN Stands Out for Croatia

**Extensive Croatian Server Network**: NordVPN maintains **20+ servers specifically in Zagreb**, providing Croatian users with local connection options for optimal speed and access to geo-restricted Croatian content. When you're traveling abroad and need to access your Croatian bank account or watch HRT, you'll have multiple server options for reliable connections.

**NordLynx Protocol Performance**: NordVPN's proprietary **NordLynx protocol** builds upon WireGuard's foundation while adding additional privacy protections. In speed tests on Croatian networks, NordLynx consistently delivers near-baseline speeds, typically retaining **95-98% of your original connection speed**. This means you can stream 4K content, participate in video calls, and download large files without noticeable performance degradation.

**Superior Security Features**: NordVPN implements multiple layers of security that address Croatia's specific threat landscape:

* **Threat Protection Pro**: This advanced feature blocks malicious websites, prevents tracker-based profiling, and stops malware-infected downloads—critical protection given the rise in phishing attacks targeting Croatian users
* **Dark Web Monitor**: Alerts you if your NordVPN login credentials or associated email addresses appear in data breaches, allowing you to act quickly
* **RAM-only servers**: All data is wiped with each reboot, ensuring no information persists on physical hardware

**Independently Audited**: NordVPN has undergone multiple independent security audits, including assessments by Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). These audits verified NordVPN's no-logs policy and security infrastructure, providing third-party confirmation of their privacy claims.

**Global Server Network**: Beyond Croatian servers, NordVPN operates **over 6,000 servers in 111+ countries**, giving you reliable options for accessing international content or connecting from any location worldwide.

# Real-World Performance for Croatian Users

Testing NordVPN on various Croatian networks (A1, HT, Telemach) reveals consistent performance:

**Streaming**: Successfully unblocks Netflix Croatia, HRT, Nova TV, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and over 200 other streaming platforms. 4K streaming works smoothly with minimal buffering.

**Gaming**: Low latency connections to European game servers. **P2P-optimized servers** in Zagreb provide fast torrent downloads while maintaining privacy.

**Public WiFi Security**: Tested across cafes, hotels, and airports in Zagreb, Dubrovnik, and Split—NordVPN consistently established secure connections within seconds, protecting against packet sniffing and MITM attacks.

**Mobile Performance**: Excellent battery efficiency on both Android and iOS devices. The app auto-connects when joining unsecured WiFi networks, providing automatic protection.

# Pricing and Value

NordVPN offers competitive pricing at **$3.69/month for a 2-year plan** (with frequent promotional pricing), placing it well below the cost of potential data breach consequences. The service allows **10 simultaneous connections**, covering all your devices with a single subscription.

All plans include a **30-day money-back guarantee**, giving you risk-free opportunity to test the service on Croatian networks.

# How to Set Up NordVPN for Croatia

Getting started takes just a few minutes:

1. **Subscribe to NordVPN**: Visit NordVPN's website and select a plan. Use the promotional pricing for the best value.
2. **Download the App**: Install NordVPN on your device (available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and even routers).
3. **Connect to a Server**:
   * For securing your Croatian connection: Click ""Quick Connect"" to automatically connect to the best server
   * For accessing Croatian content abroad: Select Croatia from the server list to get a Zagreb IP address
   * For optimal speed: Choose the recommended NordLynx protocol
4. **Enable Key Features**:
   * Turn on **Threat Protection Pro** in settings for ad-blocking and malware protection
   * Activate the **Kill Switch** to prevent data leaks if your connection drops
   * Enable **Dark Web Monitor** for breach alerts
5. **Verify Your Connection**: Visit a leak test website like ipleak to confirm your IP address matches your chosen VPN location and that there are no DNS leaks.

# Alternative VPN Options for Croatia

While NordVPN offers the best overall package, some users may have different priorities:

# For Budget-Conscious Users: Surfshark

**Surfshark** provides excellent value at **$2.19/month** for long-term plans, with **unlimited simultaneous device connections**. It includes Croatian servers, CleanWeb ad-blocking, and impressive speeds over 800 Mbps in testing. The trade-off is a slightly smaller server network and fewer advanced features compared to NordVPN.

# For Maximum Speed: ExpressVPN

**ExpressVPN** delivers the fastest connection speeds in our testing, with its proprietary Lightway protocol optimizing performance. It operates servers in 105 countries (including Croatia) and excels at unblocking streaming services. However, it's more expensive at **$6.67/month**, making it best suited for users who prioritize raw speed above all else.

# Legal Considerations: VPNs in Croatia

**VPNs are completely legal in Croatia**. The country maintains a free and open internet with no restrictions on VPN usage. Croatia's GDPR implementation actually strengthens citizens' rights to privacy tools like VPNs.

However, important caveats apply:

**Legal Activities Only**: While VPNs are legal, using them for illegal activities remains illegal. Croatian law prohibits copyright infringement, cybercrime, and other illicit online activities regardless of whether you're using a VPN.

**Respect Terms of Service**: Some streaming services' terms of service prohibit VPN usage for accessing content outside your geographic region. While this rarely results in more than account warnings, users should be aware of these policies.

**Responsible Use**: VPNs are privacy tools, not immunity from consequences. Croatian law enforcement can work with international authorities and VPN providers (if they keep logs) to investigate serious crimes.

# Practical Tips for Croatian VPN Users

# For Tourists Visiting Croatia

If you're traveling to Croatia's stunning coastline or historic cities:

* **Install your VPN before traveling**: Some public WiFi networks restrict VPN downloads
* **Connect before using public WiFi**: Hotels, cafes, and restaurants often have insecure networks
* **Use Croatian servers** if you need to access services that verify local presence
* **Keep your VPN running**: Croatia is generally safe, but digital security threats exist everywhere tourists congregate

# For Croatian Residents

Maximize your VPN's value:

* **Enable auto-connect features** for public WiFi networks
* **Use split tunneling** if you need local speed for certain Croatian services while securing other traffic
* **Regularly update your VPN app** to ensure you have the latest security patches
* **Consider a router-level VPN** to protect IoT devices that can't run VPN software directly

# For Digital Nomads and Remote Workers

Working from Croatia requires robust security:

* **Use a dedicated IP** if your company restricts access to specific IP addresses (available as an add-on with most premium VPNs)
* **Test your VPN connection** before important video calls to ensure stable performance
* **Choose P2P-optimized servers** if your work involves large file transfers
* **Maintain a backup VPN** for redundancy in case your primary service has technical issues

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I really need a VPN if I only use my home WiFi in Croatia?**

While home networks are more secure than public WiFi, a VPN still provides valuable benefits: preventing ISP tracking, encrypting your traffic against potential network compromises, bypassing throttling, and protecting against surveillance. Given recent Croatian data breaches, the additional security layer is worthwhile.

**Will a VPN slow down my Croatian internet connection?**

Modern VPNs like NordVPN typically reduce speeds by only 2-5% when using optimized protocols like NordLynx. Croatia's average mobile internet speed of 76 Mbps means you'll still have more than enough bandwidth for 4K streaming, gaming, and video calls even with a VPN active.

**Can I access Netflix US from Croatia with a VPN?**

Yes, premium VPNs like NordVPN reliably unblock Netflix US and other international libraries. Simply connect to a server in your desired country. However, remember this may violate Netflix's terms of service, even though it's not illegal in Croatia.

**Are free VPNs safe to use in Croatia?**

**Avoid free VPNs**. They often log and sell your data, inject advertising, offer inadequate encryption, and provide slow, unreliable connections. Many free VPNs have been caught compromising user privacy—the opposite of their intended purpose. Premium VPNs cost less than a few coffee shop visits per month and offer genuine protection.

**How do I know if my VPN is working correctly?**

Visit ipleak.net or dnsleaktest.com while connected to your VPN. These sites will show your current IP address and DNS servers. Verify that they match your VPN server location and that your real Croatian IP address doesn't appear anywhere in the results.

# Taking Action: Protect Your Digital Life in Croatia

Croatia's cybersecurity challenges aren't theoretical—they're actively impacting thousands of users through data breaches, cyberattacks, and privacy intrusions. The A1 Hrvatska breach, INA ransomware attack, and ongoing threats to Croatian institutions demonstrate that no one is immune.

**A VPN represents your first line of defense** against these threats. It encrypts your traffic, secures your connections, and ensures your online activity remains private. For Croatian users who value their digital security and privacy, it's not a luxury—it's a necessity.

NordVPN's combination of Croatian servers, advanced security features, independently audited no-logs policy, and reliable performance make it the clear choice for protecting your online presence in Croatia. With 30-day money-back guarantee, you can test the service risk-free and experience the difference genuine security makes.

Don't wait for a data breach to take your privacy seriously. Invest in proper VPN protection today and browse Croatia's internet with confidence.",1,1762598066.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Neither of us have ever been to a formal dance before. I really have a thing for her, she's one of the sweetest people I've ever met and I genuinely see a connection here. We've been texting for a couple weeks, ever since we were involved in a car accident.

I was waiting to ask her out until I got my car back from the body shop, which just happened today. 

Thing is, she killed my whole plan by asking me out to a dance instead of my plan of asking her out to a casual coffee and lunch date. 

It's in about 36 hours. 

How do I avoid messing this up? I confidently said yes I'd go and I'm now committed to going to the dance but I also really do not want to mess this up. I said yes and I can read her well enough to know that she was absolutely not expecting me to say yes. I'm traditionally extremely shy and introverted, this is not something I would normally do and she kinda freaked when I said I'd be going. To give you an idea of how out of my element I am, my comfort zone is on earth and I'm currently in a different galaxy. 

For context, we're both traditional conservative Christians. Both from controlling families. I have precisely zero game, but she obviously likes me at least a little bit.

I can’t take it anymore,"I don’t know what to do or whether or not my frustration is justified. I’ve been working with this family for over a year now. It’s just the one kid, though he’s a handful. 

My day with NK starts at 730, though I usually wake him up by 815. 

In recent months, every morning that I work, the DB inserts himself and tells us we’re going to go get coffee with “Uncle (his friend)”. 

He usually tells us this right after the NK wakes up, is still in his pajamas, with a ~20-25 minute notice to get ready. If I try to rush the NK, he starts crying because, well, of course he’s sensitive. He just woke up. So I don’t rush him, and then the DB gets passive aggressive toward me for being slow/late. 

Then we go, and of course NK is acting up, not sitting still, because he hasn’t been able to have time to wake up fully, or have breakfast. It also sets our day back an hour and takes time away from our schedule. 

The frustrating part is, no matter how many times I say “no, not today”, the DB never listens. He says I don’t have a choice and that we must go. He will also ask the NK, not me, and then manipulate his answers until the NK says yes. Usually the NK says no at first.. and that we wants to stay home with me and hang out :(. I wish we could. 

Our days are always so much smoother when we’re able to have our mornings together uninterrupted. The DB really riles the NK up. He has no intuition when it comes to reading his own child’s moods. Every morning we go the NK starts to cry because the DB is rushing us and it stresses me out a lot. 

I really can’t take it anymore. I love this job, except for the DB. There’s other things he’s done that’s made me super uncomfortable. I just don’t know how to handle this situation or stand up for myself. I’ve been looking for other jobs, but the market is genuinely awful right now.

Story: 

The scene opens with a detective driving to a crime scene, a cup of coffee in his hand. He arrives at the location in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where the body of a teenage boy named Alec has been found. The boy was struck on the head and shot in the chest, but the head trauma was determined to be the cause of death.

The detective begins his investigation and learns that Alec was estranged from his mother, with whom no one has had contact for years. With no immediate leads, the detective examines Alec’s phone and discovers a history of drug-related messages. The texts reveal that someone had been supplying Alec with drugs.

Tracking the supplier leads to a chase and a violent confrontation before the detective apprehends the man. The supplier refuses to cooperate until the detective begins burning his stash of drug money. Panicking, the supplier reveals that the money belongs to a mob boss and that his life is in danger if the boss finds out. Terrified, he confesses where he got the drugs.

Following the lead, the detective learns that Alec owed money to a drug lord. This strengthens his suspicion that the drug lord is involved in the murder. The trail leads him to the drug lord’s son, Romeo, who also runs a part of the narcotics network. The detective finds Romeo in a bar, captures him, but during a standoff where Romeo takes a cop hostage, Romeo is killed.

Hearing of his son’s death, the drug lord plans a strike, but the detective and his team raid his base first. In the ensuing gunfight, the detective is injured, but the drug lord is captured. Sergeant Brian New, the detective’s superior, congratulates him and orders an interrogation.

During questioning, the detective shows the drug lord a photo of Alec and demands to know why he killed him. The drug lord denies any involvement. Pressed further, he admits to knowing Alec when the detective presents records of bitcoin transactions between them but insists he didn’t kill him. He claims Alec was always accompanied by another boy whenever he came for drugs. As the drug lord describes this boy, the detective suddenly feels dizzy from his injuries and collapses.

At the hospital, he is treated and meets Dr. Ann, who becomes a close friend. Frequent checkups eventually grow into a romantic bond.

Later, the detective visits the prison to extract more details from the drug lord before court, but shortly after leaving, he receives news that the drug lord has been murdered by an inmate. Suspecting a setup, the detective rushes to the scene, but Sergeant Brian informs him that the inmate confessed, claiming to be from a rival gang.

With Alec’s case lacking evidence, the court orders the case closed. Depressed, the detective turns to Ann for emotional support. A flashback montage shows his broken marriage and estranged daughter. Ann encourages him to reach out to her.

One night, drunk and staring at his evidence board, the detective suddenly recalls that the drug lord mentioned another boy before he collapsed. He revisits Alec’s phone records and discovers a contact named Robbie. However, Robbie’s number is inactive, and no school records list anyone by that name. When he visits Alec’s high school, Sergeant Brian confronts him angrily, accusing him of hallucinating due to his injury. Brian escorts him back to the station and demands proof that Robbie exists. Confused and doubting himself, the detective accepts medical leave.

At home, defeated, he re-examines his evidence board and notices a childhood photo of Alec playing football. He realizes he never checked Alec’s football coaching center the same one his daughter attends. When he visits the center, masked gunmen attack. Wounded, the detective fights back and kills them. Brian arrives, claiming they were remnants of the drug lord’s gang. When asked why he was there, the detective lies and says he came to see his daughter.

At the hospital, while being treated, he receives an email from the coaching center containing new information and his face turns pale.

The next scene shows the detective standing in a courthouse corridor surrounded by reporters as Sergeant Brian and a young man in handcuffs are led inside. The detective exchanges a knowing smirk with Brian.
