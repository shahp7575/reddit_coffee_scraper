Hello! I need some kind of surface between the couch and the tv, since

1. I need a place to put the keyboard connected to the laptop connected to the tv

1. if I invite people over I would like them to have someplace to put their drinks, perhaps even food in case we order pizza or smth

Both of these problems would be solved by a coffee table but I only have 120 cm between the couch and tv and as such dont know if any coffee table would fit and not make it too cramped.

[$2000-5000],"We've happily used a Rancilio Silvia with a PID for about 7 years, but we've started wanting to make milk drinks a bit more often, and are finding it frustrating temperature surfing between steaming and brewing. We like the Silvia, but honestly don't do much in terms of customization other than dial in our coffee with our grinder (Sette 270wi). We've done a lot of reading, and understand that our next step is probably either a HX machine, or a DB.

The number of machines available is \*very\* daunting. We like the idea of a DB where we can only turn on the steam boiler when needed. Usually we know we want a milk drink ahead of time, and that would save the electricity of constantly having a second boiler. But then I wonder if this means we'd be better off with a HX?

In terms of machines, seems like the Profitec 300 might be a reasonable DB, along with Silvia Pro X (although we abhor the drip tray of our Silvia, and are not keen on upgrading with that feature still in place) and Breville DB. But then there are the higher end options, things like Profitec 600, etc.

Any suggestions from folks who have also moved on from a Silvia? What worked for you? Or does a particular machine come to mind reading our scenario? Lastly, opinion on whether we really \*need\* a DB, or if HX would work perfectly fine for our scenario?",1,1733666542.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1h9jfxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1h9jfxj/from_idea_to_llc_a_stepbystep_guide/,From Idea to LLC: A Step-by-Step Guide,"So you've had that lightbulb moment—an idea that could change everything, or at least provide you with a solid side hustle to fund your coffee addiction. But before you go marching off to your future empire, there's a little bit of groundwork to lay down. Taking a business idea from your brain to something official is like baking a cake: mix the ingredients just right, and you've got a treat. Miss the mark, and you might create a disaster that you'll need to sweep under the rug.

Let’s break this down, step by step, with a dash of humor and a whole lot of practical advice.

**Step 1: Forming an LLC**  
In the world of business structuring, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are the cool kids on the block. Why? Because they protect your personal assets like your grandma protects her secret cookie recipe. To file for an LLC, first, check your state’s specific requirements—these vary like opinions on pineapple on pizza. You’ll generally need to:

1. **Choose a Name**: Something catchy but not a tongue twister. Make sure it’s unique! You don’t want to get your heart set on “Chris’s Wondrous Widget Co.” only to find out there’s already a “Chris’s Wombat Widget Warehouse.”
   
2. **File Articles of Organization**: This is the official paperwork to register your LLC. Most states allow you to do this online—you know, just like buying shoes at 2 AM.
   
3. **Create an Operating Agreement**: While not always mandatory, having one helps outline how your business will run. It’s like a playbook that keeps everyone on the same page, or at least in the same chapter.
   
4. **Pay the Fee**: There’s usually a fee associated with filing, so make sure your wallet is ready. And just like a trip to the dentist, it’s best not to think about it too much.

**Step 2: Getting Your EIN**  
Next up is the **Employer Identification Number (EIN)**. This lovely little number is like a Social Security number for your business. Think of it as your business’s VIP pass to the corporate scene. Here’s how to snag one:

1. **Visit the IRS Website**: You can apply for an EIN online through the IRS for free—yes, F-R-E-E. It’s like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocket; it just feels good.

2. **Fill Out the Form**: Provide basic information about your business. It’s like a quick dating profile, but instead of “loves long walks on the beach,” you’re discussing your business structure.

3. **Submit and Wait**: Once you hit send, just sit back, grab a snack, and wait for your official EIN. It usually comes through pretty quickly, but if you run into issues, don’t hesitate to reach out for help.

**Step 3: Opening a Business Bank Account**  
So, you’ve got your LLC and your EIN. Now it’s time for the financial side of things: the business bank account. This is like giving your business its very own wallet, separate from your personal funds. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Choose a Bank**: Look for one that offers the best perks for small businesses—think lower fees, online banking options, or that charming local bank where everyone knows your name. 

2. **Gather Your Documents**: You’ll generally need your LLC documents, EIN, and a form of identification (which hopefully doesn’t look like you just rolled out of bed).

3. **Open the Account**: Sit down with a banker and discuss your options. They’ll guide you through the process. It’s a bit like ordering a fancy coffee—there are a lot of options, but you can always ask for help.

**Final Tips**:  
– **Stay Organized**: Keep track of all your documents. Make a neat little folder so later you won't be searching through crumpled receipts and random papers like a detective in a bad mystery novel.
  
– **Consult Professionals if Needed**: If taxes and legal jargon make your head spin, don’t hesitate to hire an accountant or lawyer. They can help you navigate the confusing maze of business regulation.

– **Connect with Your Community**: Reach out to other local business owners. They can offer advice, support, and maybe even some leads on where to get the best coffee around town.

Embarking on this journey might feel overwhelming at moments, but remember—you’re not in it alone. Lean into your community, ask for help, and keep your faith at the forefront. Sometimes the toughest challenges lead to the sweetest victories. Now go out there and make that idea official!",1,1733666461.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend (24F) and I (26M), based in Dubai, are in a bit of a unique situation—we don’t have many friends and it’s starting to feel a little lonely when we go out. So, we’re hoping to connect with another couple who might feel the same way!

A little about us:
	•	I’m South Indian, and my girlfriend is North Indian.
	•	We love exploring new places, trying out different cuisines, and having chill, meaningful conversations.
	•	Whether it’s a fun day out, dinner, or just sitting and chatting over coffee, we’re up for it.

We’re looking for a couple (roughly in our age group) who’s also looking to expand their social circle. If this sounds like you, drop us a DM or comment here—we’d love to get to know you!

(P.S. Just to clarify, this is not some kind of sexual or swinger thing. We’re genuinely looking for platonic couple friends to hang out and share good vibes with)

I’m a still single, 21-year-old guy from the UK (specifically the North West of England), and I am looking for my person. Been looking for a while but with no success, so hopefully this helps change my fortunes!

I graduated from university in the summer, and am currently working in finance. I do not, however, have a trust fund or blue eyes, nor am I 6’5”! To be honest though, I quite like the job, and it’s in my hometown, so it’s nice to be able to stay connected to it. Also work with some nice people, which always helps.

About me personally, I quite like physical contact in a relationship. I’d say that’s my love language along with giving/making things for people. I love baking and cooking so, if I ever try a new recipe, I’d like someone to test them out with! I love video games—I’ve recently been playing a game called Coffee Talk which is honestly really good—and music, particularly classic and prog rock. I also like puzzles like crosswords and word searches, as well as keeping up with the news and sports (I’m a Liverpool fan, if that helps my case!). I’m also trying to lose some weight at the moment so, if you have any advice, I’d love to hear it! One other thing to note is that I *might* be autistic. Waiting for someone to come back to me about a diagnosis at the moment so I obviously can’t say for sure, but I feel like that’s something to keep in mind.

As for what I’d want in a partner, I just want someone kind and loyal who loves a good laugh! I’m not *that* fussy about specific looks, but I’d prefer someone a little shorter than me (I’m 5’7”). I’d also like someone who loves to talk about their interests, as I’d love to learn more about what you’re interested in. Oh, and I’d also prefer someone who loves hugs and physical affection if possible 😅

Anyway, if you’ve read this far, please leave a ✨ in your message if you want to dm me, and tell me about yourself and what you’re interested in. Either way, I hope whoever reads this is having a good day!",1,1733666423.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.99,False

A few months ago I posted about how my fiance had withdrawn steadily since moving in together. He was still incredibly thougthful and considerate, bringing me coffee in bed every morning, cooking dinner, active listening, planning and paying for trips, putting in effort with my family...etc. But our sex life went from being fantastic, to minimal, to completely gone within a few months. We had a lot of life stressors hit us right at the same time we moved in together (I was miserable at my job, his dad got sick, we had a rocky engagement since it occurred during a bizarre 5 months period when he suddenly developed a bad drinking and lying-about-his-drinking problem) so I figured we just had a rocky start. But as the months went by, even though our life circumstances were improving (I got a new job, his dad got better, he remained sober), I still felt him withdrawing from me more and more until it felt like there was a massive wall up between us. 

He never initiated sex, never kissed me, never hugged me, never said I love you first....and when I would express distress at this he would ignore me or get frustrated. He emotionally detached. I felt like he still cared about me but had lost attraction to me from those few rough months where I wasn't at my best (being very negative about my job, not supportive enough of him...etc). But I was working hard to do better and be better, but it seemed like it didn't matter what I said or did, his lack of affection was consistent. He took us on a trip to Boston for our 3rd anniversary but never posted it on social media even though he always had in the past. 

Then September 29th we were in bed and I saw him enter his phone passcode. I saw him notice that I was watching him and I remember thinking, ""he's going to change his passcode"" and sure enough by the next day he had.

Of note, despite being together 3 years and engaged, he would NEVER let me know his passcode saying he ""deserved his privacy"".

That night, like an idiot, I suddenly got the impulse to try the passcode on his ipad. It worked. I browsed quickly through his texts and found nothing that jumped out at me and was just going to leave it at that.

When I suddenly had the idea to find his text message thread with his last ex, Kiya. Just because he never could explain why they broke up (just ""we weren't compatible"") and would never give details and I wanted to see if maybe their last texts to see if their relationship ended due to his withdrawing or something similar. 

I found that they had been texting a little, intermittently, for over a year. Just casual things, a few inside jokes, but nothing crazy inappropriate. Until one night while drunk he texted her asking for nudes and to come over (she declined). The saddest thing is I was supposed to see him that night and he cancelled on me saying he was too tired and busy from work. 45 minutes later he was texting her. He had always told me that they never had the kind of sexual chemistry we did and yet here he is trying to have sex with her. And this was at a time when our sex life was great, or at least I thought it was.

Even worse, he specifically said he missed her ""peach emogi"" which hurts because while i'm an attractive woman with nice tits, I have an insanely flat ass. It makes me feel like he was literally trying to cheat on me simply because he liked her ass more than mine. 

He asked to meet her for drinks 5 days after our engagement and his last text to her was in March of this year saying he noticed she removed him from their joint spotify and amazon accounts. 

I confronted him and he cried and begged for another chance. Says he was just drunk and sick during that time period and he doesnt even remember doing it and that he was only texting her the other times because he ""felt guilty for hurting her when he broke up with her"".

2 nights later I went back into his ipad and found a text he sent just a week after our 2 year anniversary (still during those drunk months) to an escort trying to set up a time to meet for services. He was specific about dates/times; she seemed to get suspicious of him and stopped replying at some point.

Same thing, he cried and said he didn't remember that either. I was shocked he didnt change his passcode or go through deleting things which makes me believe he truly did forget this too. 

Of note, one year into our relationship I saw an email from Bumble saying he had renewed his subscription. At the time he said it was a phishing email which two years later he admitted was a lie. I reached out to his ex-girlfriend Kiya and she confirmed they never met up during our relationship, but said that there were “things between him and other women” during their relationship as well, but she refused to elaborate.

We went to a few sessions of couples counseling which was a disaster. He said he was carrying resentments due to my negativity about living in Florida (I stayed here, away from my family, for him) and making snide comments about his work-from-home job back when I was miserable in my own job. These things are true and were things I was trying to work on improving over the previous few months. 

I told him that I needed him to go to personal therapy to work through whatever internally is going on to have caused the months of drinking, lying, cheating...etc.

He kept saying he would but 2 months went by and he never went. 

I did feel like he was trying to be kinder in the ways that are easy for him (more acts of service) but there was still no increase in verbal or physical affection. Even after forgiving him and saying we would try to work through it, he never once said i love you unless i said it first. 

So after a few weeks I stopped physical and verbal affection too. 

Everything came to a head the day after election day when I was upset over the results and instead of comfort I was met with an attitude of, ""it wont be that bad; you just think it will be terrible because you live in an echochamber"". I also saw some texts his friends sent him the morning after the election which were a repulsive misogynistic nightmare. I always hated these 2 friends of his because they were misogynistic creeps but he always made excuses for them. I'm a vocal liberal feminist; if this was the kind of shit he was tolerating with his friends, I don’t understand why he was ever with someone like me. In fact, along with my negativity, the other thing he said in couples counseling that he didn’t like about me was that I “hated all his friends” which was very frustrating because I literally only hated these two and for very good reason. 

We broke up during an argument about this. 2 days later we sat down and had a talk, which looking back on it was mostly me apologizing for the ways in which I hadn't been a great partner to him and then he suddenly scooped me into his arms and said maybe he made a mistake and only broke up with me in the heat of anger. It was my birthday weekend and he said ""lets celebrate it"" and took me to the casino that night, a museum the next day, and a 4 star resort for the weekend. For 4 days it was heaven. It was like the man I dated for 2 years, before we moved in together, before the drinking months, was back. He looked at me with love in his eyes, he put his hand on me knee while driving.....he was just \*different\*.

But within a day or so of getting back home and being back in reality, he went back to the way he was before. 

Finally, I told him I was going to move back home to be closer to my family at the end of our lease in January. He simply replied, ""I'm not moving to nashville"".I left for work and never saw him again. He made an excuse to need to stay in a hotel that night so he could be closer to where a race he was running was the next morning and I left that next morning out of town. When I came back he had moved out without a word.   
I am devastated. I dont see how he went from wanting to marry me and moving in together to this in 7 months. I never could have imagined it would all unravel so fast. I feel like my entire life has been ripped out from underneath [me.Now](http://me.Now) I am able to move to be near my family and now all I want it my life here with him. I finally found a job I liked, i was finally starting to make some friends.....but it all came too late. A few shitty months after moving in together was all it took to destroy his feelings for me, even though i forgave him through his rough patch of drinking/lying and even his cheating.   
I dont understand why he begged for a second chance if he didnt like me or was so unhappy with me.   
I know I shouldnt want him back but I miss him terribly and keep focusing on all the ways he was an incredible, almost too good to be true, partner, and I was a shitty one. 
I know I struggled with negativity and at times took him for granted, but I was working on those things and I always apologized for my part when we had arguments. He would always shut down and I would be the one to re-approach and try to fix things.

So why does this hurt so much? I should hate him and feel like I dodged a bullet for a man who clearly has deep internal issues that he refuses to work on. But day to day, he was such an incredible partner for so long that it’s hard not to keep just thinking of him that way and that I was this negative ungrateful partner who lost out on him.

She also acts like we're her servants- she asked me to refill her soda the other night 'it's so hard to get off this sofa bed'... okay, but you owe me one. But the next morning we're getting ready to go down to the beach in the same quiet hotel room, making jokes and comments while we're getting ready, she asks me what im making for a drink to take down to the beach. I tell her coconut rum and coke, and she goes 'ooooh that sounds good!' A few minutes later she said she'll meet me down there, I say okay, then when I come to the kitchen to make my drink, I see her cup and a sign next to it that says 'drinky-poo por favor!'

Dude... you could have just asked me? That's so wierd. She probably knew I was going to say no because I'm gonna be carrying my own drink and my snorkelling stuff- she was carrying just her bag. So I make her a drink but leave it there. She asks me to text my husband to bring it down, but hes not coming down for a while. Itd take all of 3 minutes  to get it herself- the hotel is small and 10 feet from the water. When I get there I see she'd reserved chairs for all of us earlier that day. I was VERY surprised by her even thinking about us once, so the people pleaser in me goes back to get it since she's reserved the chairs for us.

Every time someone goes anywhere it'd 'where are you going? Oh can you bring me a ___'?

This is such a first world problem I know, and I haven't had to pay for anything and I'm having a great time when I get out of the room, but this just puts me in a horrible mood every morning and night.

The rest of her asking us to do things for her all the time wouldn't be so bothersome if she'd just take the bedroom and let us give her privacy- I'm not here to watch TV like her, I'm here to enjoy the beach and my family.",1,1733666304.0,rant,0,1.0,False

She got no friends, like real best friends that she can talk to and be with, because she'd tell me that her friends are like ""inggit"" sakanila and back biting them, that's why I let her be in my circle. 

First few months it went well. We go on night food trips, coffee, drink etc. 

Second thing I know, she would rant about my bff's lifestyle (that my bff can afford), like she doesn't want to be around her because she's magastos and all. 

Then there's this instance where we didn't invite her to go with us because she doesn't know the people that we're going to meet and catch up with, she had a bad taste about it, She didn't take it well. she'd ignore us, and for me that's fine, then be it. Then this brother of mine didn't take it well, he'd ignore me, well okay fine. If that's what you want. 

Fast forward cause we're still family I gave it another shot, being the younger sib I reached out and restored the bond. 

Few weeks had past and we're still in good terms, after sometime she's ranting about this certain person that is not paying debts to them and I explained the situation of this certain person.

She got mad at me for not taking her side, when in fact I didn't take sides, I just explained the situation then she told me things I didn't expect to get from her, of course I didn't answer her in a bad manner, I still respect her being my brother's wife. 

And again, I'm an invisible person to my brother. 😢

I 33F work pretty closely with 43M colleague. In my 5 day work week 4 of those days we work alone together and all in all we get along great. 

However I have noticed that he acts slightly different with me. Not like I get special treatment from him but I feel like he is more playful with other members of staff than he is with me, they all range in ages from 21 to 61.

Also at lunchtime when he goes out he brings me back a coffee I like because it's part of his lunchtime deal and he doesn't drink coffee. 

More recently when we have been out for drinks with out colleagues and we have had a little too much he tells me he loves me and when it's time to leave he says goodbye to me at least 4 times and each time he hugs me tells me he loves me then pecks my neck.

I just, I feel like I'm overthinking every interaction we have now and adding 2 and 2 together and coming up with 8 and asking him about it is not an option",2,1733666006.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I have a few date ideas in mind, but I'm open to suggestions too. Here they are:

1. **Study date** \- Honestly, I’m leaning toward this idea because finals are just around the corner, and I really need to hit the books. It’s a chill way to spend time together while being productive.
2. **Badminton battle** \- Are you ready to show off your badminton skills? Let's hit the courts together and have a thrilling match. We can challenge each other, improve our game, and have a great time while breaking a sweat. Don't worry if you're not a pro—having fun is what matters most!
3. **Fancy dinner/coffee date** \- We can choose from a variety of culinary destinations, ranging from cozy bistros to fine dining establishments. Perhaps a coffee date is more your style. It's the perfect setting to get to know each other better, share stories, and enjoy the warm ambiance.

A little bit about me:

* I'm a 21 y/o female who enjoys living life to the fullest (as much as possible). I consider myself to be an easy-going and realistic person. I'm an undergraduate student currently studying in Manila. As a student, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, both academically, personally and socially.
* I believe that physical attributes are just one small aspect of who we are as individuals. While I'm proud of my appearance and take care of myself, I believe that true connections and friendships are built on shared values and interests, not just physical attraction. That being said, I'll share a bit about my physical attributes. I'm a shortie girl, short hair, morena, fair complexion.
* In addition to working out, I also enjoy in exploring other ways to stay active, such as badminton, swimming and lil bit of volleyball. I believe that staying active and challenging myself physically is not only good for my body, but also for my mental health and well-being.
* I'm someone who chooses not to drink, smoke/vape, or use illicit substances. I personally prefer to live a lifestyle that aligns with my values of health and well-being.
* I value authenticity and genuine connections.
* Manila

What am I not looking for?

* I'm not looking for someone who is overly aggressive or disrespectful. I believe that mutual respect and kindness are the foundation of any healthy relationship, whether it's romantic or platonic.
* I'm not interested in someone who is only looking for a casual fling or hookup. I value meaningful connections and deep conversations.
* As someone who values honesty and integrity, I want to make it clear that I'm not interested in getting to know any man who has a history of cheating or being unfaithful in their past relationships.

If you share similar values and interests and are also seeking for someone, feel free to send me a message! Let's chat and see if we click.",3,1733665998.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.8,False

Looking at the best home base for a whole month of cycling/working from Gran Canaria, i've found a good spot on Playa de Salinetas near Telde but it seems very quiet/not lots of shops around ?   
Ideally a spot not too touristy but with a few high quality coffee shops near the beach.

ChatGPT told me being based on the east side of the island isnt the best because of constant dominant winds, is it true ?

No one wants an electric shock when they grab the handle to pull that beer.

This is why Underwriters test Laboratories (UL) specifies these testing protocols and has been important to society with that UL stamp, preventing fires and electric shock is still important as a sustainability metric.  But, we're reading of ""micro chips"" according to some on the internet.  This is the domain of science engineering and math, mostly invisible to most of society.  We're too busy with TickTock and Facebook and elections to care.

Now, imagine nano-scale processes inside micro scale parts and process on a printed circuit board or macro power system or device application ranging from toasters to buildings to planes trains and automobiles and power plants.  And space and weapons systems.

Key words for my morning coffee reading and reference this morning, ""lower current leakage"" for folks who observe and understand how design around, measure such things, and why it matters.

Maybe let’s all revisit our theories why the company has been under attack since July?

Happy Sunday morning reading.

You've probably heard the term ""fully on-chain games"" thrown around with question marks. Most games claim to be fully ""web3"" but keep their actual game logic hidden on private servers because, the matter of fact, putting everything on-chain was technically impossible. Until now.

The rewards for players is that - if games could run entirely on-chain, players actually own everything. Not just your heroes and items, but the entire game logic. Your stuff would be truly yours, working the same way forever, even if the game distributor disappeared tomorrow.

Easier said that done.

We're just three indie devs who spent the last 12 months chasing this idea. Could we make an on-chain game that actually plays like a proper game, meaning the true web 2 experience? Inspired by the love of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy, so we went all in on making a tactical RPG with that kind of strategic depth.

We built it on a tile-based system (because trying to calculate complex 3D physics on-chain would probably break everything, or our team is not that good yet). It gives us great flexibility for movement, abilities, and quests. Plus, we've got these random bots that remix the maps to keep things interesting.

For heroes - yes, they're NFTs (we know there's been a lot of sketchy projects). We're trying to do it right - these are actual game characters you'll own forever, with real gameplay mechanics behind them.

After many late nights and probably too much coffee, we've got an early alpha running.

It's far from perfect, but we think it shows what's possible.

Here is a quick video showing how it gonna work : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TtETDLtC93M](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TtETDLtC93M)

We're still figuring a lot of things out and would love your feedback.

What would you want to see in a game where you can verify everything? What could we do better? Let us know!

Thanks so much, have a great Sunday.",0,1733665647.0,Games,6,0.09,False

1h9j67j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h9j67j/do_you_believe_some_kids_really_have_imaginary/,Do you believe some kids really have imaginary friends?,"I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid. 



Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 



The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 



“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 



I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”



“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”



“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”



“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”



Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 



I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 



I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 



Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.



That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.

We shared a kiss and went to bed.



For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.



As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.



When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.



“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.



Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”



“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”



As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.



“Hey dude, how’s school going?”



“It’s soooo good dad”



“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile



“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”



“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”



“Whatcha mean daddy?”



“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”



Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.



I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 



It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 



I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.



“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”



“No.”



“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”



“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.



“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 



Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.



“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”



Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.



“Who are you talking to?”



“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”



“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”



“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”



I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.



“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”



There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.



“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”



“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”



That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 



The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.



“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”



“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 



“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”



“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”



I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.



“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”



“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 



“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 



“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”



A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.



“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”



“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”



I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 



What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.



“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.”

Our daughters are sleeping on an air mattress in the next room because I can’t bear to be home. I couldn’t sleep anymore. I got up and decided I’d write all my thoughts down. Maybe it would get them out and they’d go away. I wrote for an hour. I wrote all the things I want to say to you that I know won’t make a difference. I wrote down the memories I have of moments when I fell in love with you, when my love grew and when I felt safe because of you. I cried when I wrote the word husband, because I know I will never call you that again out loud. I cried when I wrote about all the thoughts I have about the woman you left our family for, the one you say you’re in love with. The one that isn’t me. And then I decided I’d drive to our home alone and pack some of your things. I’m going back there tonight, so our children can go to school and sleep in their own beds. The last time they slept in their beds they woke up and you were there, with me, drinking coffee together. I drove the same route I’ve drove countless times, even when we were dating and I’d drive to come meet you. The same long road for 30 minutes. I looked at all the things I passed, that I’ve passed a trillion times when you loved me, or at least when I thought you did. I listened to sad songs and I let myself sob. And when I pulled into our drive way and saw that the things of yours that were waiting on the porch were gone, that you took even the small statue on our front porch of the firefighter with the dog, I let myself cry so hard I almost screamed in my car. I’m sitting here now looking in the backyard we once watched our kids play in together. The tire swing and the baby swing you hung up yourself for our kids. I am going to go inside and let myself cry while I pack whatever things I can handle packing. I feel like once I let myself cry I will never stop but I can’t do anything else, so I’ll just let myself do it. I miss you. I feel your absence everywhere. But I know you don’t feel mine because you left me for someone else and told me you haven’t loved me in a long time.

1. It takes me a while to wake up in the morning, I love having a slow morning with my coffee and a book. I feel like I’d really miss this part of my routine and I’m not sure I would successfully be able to wake up 5 am to make this fit my schedule. How do I get over this mental block of “losing” something I enjoy?

2.  What do you eat and when? I don’t really have an appetite for breakfast and most days I just have a protein bar but that doesn’t really seem like enough food to fuel/ recover from a workout. Do you eat something before you go? Or just wait until you come back? Or both?

3. I have a dog who is not a morning doggy, if I stayed in bed until 8 or 9 am she would sleep in too. If I wake up early though she’s ready to start her day when I am. Should I start shifting her whole schedule and feed her when I leave for the gym or just keep her day consistent and feed when I get back? 

Ideally I would like to be back home and ready to start my workday around 8-8:30 and the gym typically takes me 1-1.5 hours, this includes the drive there and depending on if I include cardio/ sauna as well. So I would need to wake up around 6 to make this work I think. I currently wake up around 7 so it’s not THAT big of a change but every time I try to I just tell myself I’ll start tomorrow instead. I feel like I just have so many mental blocks to switching to the morning and I need tips on how to overcome those ",4,1733664855.0,xxfitness,10,1.0,False

The campfire crackled and popped in the chilly dawn air as Joe, the camp cook, took his first sip of coffee. His eyes widened in shock as he spit it out in an impressive spray, extinguishing part of the fire and dousing a few unfortunate soldiers sitting nearby.

""Joe, what the hell?"" barked Sam, his gruff companion and fellow early riser.

Joe grimaced, staring into his tin mug as if it had personally offended him. ""The coffee tastes... wrong,"" he muttered, swishing the remaining liquid around and sniffing it.

""Wrong? Coffee's coffee,"" Sam replied, rubbing the droplets off his coat. ""What could possibly be—""

Joe grabbed the ancient, dented coffee pot and tipped it over, pouring the contents onto the dirt. A single bug fell out with the last splash of liquid—a plump stink bug, its shiny body unmistakable even in the dim firelight.

Sam leaned in, inspecting the unwelcome guest. ""Huh. Well, that explains the 'wrong.'"" Then, to Joe's dismay, Sam slapped him on the back with a grin. ""Could’ve been worse. Strange taste, sure, but it wasn’t half bad!""

Joe glared at him. ""You’re joking.""

""Dead serious. You’ve made worse coffee before, Joe."" Sam smirked and took another swig from his own mug.

As the morning wore on, the stink bug incident became the joke of the day. Soldiers teased Joe relentlessly, offering to fetch more ""coffee bugs"" or asking if stink bugs were a new ingredient in his stew. Joe waved them off with a scowl, but the idea nagged at him.

That night, while the camp was silent and Joe was dreaming, inspiration struck—a strange, vivid dream where he stood in a forest teeming with enormous bugs, each one more colorful and grotesque than the last. In the dream, he was stirring an enormous pot of stew, the rich aroma wafting through the woods. The soldiers cheered, raising bowls high in gratitude.

Joe woke with a start, and the image burned into his mind. ""What if…"" he whispered to himself, a plan already forming.

**The Birth of ""Joe's Surprise""**

The next day, Joe got to work. He collected every strange and unidentifiable vegetable he could find from the sparse supplies, throwing them into his trusty pot. For meat, he scavenged bits of leftover rations, some scraps from hunting, and, as a bold experiment, a handful of stink bugs he plucked from under rocks near the camp.

When dinner was served, the soldiers gathered reluctantly, half-expecting another bland, uninspired meal. But as soon as Joe ladled out the first bowl, their skepticism melted away.

The stew was unlike anything they’d ever tasted. It was rich, hearty, and flavorful, with a hint of something earthy and aromatic that no one could quite place. Bowls were emptied and thrust back at Joe for seconds, then thirds.

""What’s in it, Joe?"" Sam asked, wiping his bowl clean with a crust of bread.

Joe grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. ""Secret recipe.""

The stew was such a hit that Joe was ordered to make it again. But the secret ingredient proved to be the hardest to come by. Joe spent hours wandering the outskirts of camp, flipping over rocks and digging through leaves in search of more stink bugs. It became a running joke among the soldiers, who nicknamed him ""Bugman"" and occasionally joined the hunt to help restock his supply.

**A Cook’s Legacy**

Over the months, ""Joe's Surprise"" became a staple of the camp menu. Soldiers swore it gave them strength for the long marches and battles that defined their grueling campaign. As morale improved, so did their effectiveness as a unit.

Word of Joe’s cooking spread beyond the camp. Other units began sending messengers to barter for his stew, offering their own supplies or labor in exchange for a taste. Joe’s reputation grew, and so did the demands on his creativity. He began experimenting with other bugs, wild herbs, and even fermented rations.

By the time the war ended, Joe’s unconventional cooking had earned him a strange sort of fame. Some credited the army’s victories to his stew, claiming it was Joe’s meals that kept them strong and united.

Years later, Joe retired to a quiet life on a small farm. But his legend lived on. Soldiers who had fought alongside him told wild stories of the “mystical stew” that had carried them through the hardest days.

As for Joe? He never revealed the secret ingredient. But every now and then, he’d catch a whiff of something earthy and aromatic in the air, and he’d smile, remembering the unlikely role a single stink bug had played in changing his life—and perhaps even the course of history.",1,1733664683.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

Can't quite pinpoint it, but I know it's not *us*… I'm more confident than ever before that we will find a way — have been finding a way — to love each other. Though I do miss you a ton… Oh, don't get me wrong, I *love* our messenger interactions, though I gotta find some better pages to follow — so often my timeline is just pure garbage. Ah, but I get such a thrill when I'm driving somewhere and I see that notification… ""So-and-so has sent you an attachment"". Makes me smile the rest of my drive, enjoying the anticipation of wondering what it's going to be… a silly Star Wars reference? LoTR? Or maybe a song aimed straight at my heart…

It's never too much, I hope you know that. I *always* welcome *anything* from you. Hearing from you, even if it is just some weird 90s culture reference, always, *always* makes my day *so much* better.

So, no… not us. I dunno. I think I started the weekend on the wrong foot when I misread my watch yesterday morning. Took me too long to figure out why the coffee hadn't been made yet. But, once I'm out of that bed, there's not a chance I'm going back. So I went and sat in my favorite chair and dozed off…

Well. This part was good. This part was *very* good… I had a dream. You were in it. You… probably don't want to know. I'll just say, the pearl strands on that dress look so lovely against the bare skin of your shoulder……… turns out, the other strands look very, *very* nice against your bare skin elsewhere… never mind that in reality they're probably attached to the dress… and I do so enjoy the thought of worshiping *all* of you, even if I seem to sometimes fixate on one particular part, lol.

But anyhow.

Well, that was an awfully nice way to start the day, but it went downhill fast from there… just a tension in my shoulders… even now, after getting a much better night's sleep, I just had to remind myself to relax them…

It's the situation with the kid, most likely. Plus a few stark reminders of reality, a thing I read that I'm probably worried too much about, the surprise vet bill (turns out both animals are temporarily gross, in different ways), maybe a touch of seasonal affective disorder, the plan we were tossing around last weekend most likely being scuttled (trying to plan things in this house is a bit like trying to plot a course through white water before you've even seen the rapids, so… not a surprise to me, but don't be too shocked when the invitation never comes…), and just… you know… the world.

*sigh*

I dunno, babe. I don't know much, but I know I love you, and I know you love me, and we'll both make it through.

And, hey… some warmer (not warm!) weather is coming, not to mention 10 days of relative peace (for me). I'm sure we'll find some time together in there somewhere, and that always does my heart good. Plus I have questions! And I'd rather ask them face-to-face…

Well. Soon, I'm sure. For now, gonna close out with a song for you, babe… for us:

It still hasn't opened up. He was out to get some sunlight. He remembers how evening shifts and no exposure to sun had yielded effect as joint pains last year. But the day was as gloomy as it becomes during storms. Monsoon had already arrived it seems. Such a mood really makes one crave spiced chai and smoke. But there weren't any chai shops nearby to soothe his cravings. He had to settle on just a smoke. Lighting a cigarette he took a drag and letting the spiced taste hit his upper throat, made his eyes close. Tilting his head to get a look at the dark clouds he exhaled. Smoke was in front of his face, opaquely hiding the shops in front of him as he tried to see across the road A café came into view as the smoke cleared. Amber shaded lamps hung on the dark brown walls gave the café an antique view. He remembered this café had great mutton cutlet and caramel custard. His craving for chai had definitely found a home.

Crossing the street he entered the café and ordered a chai at the counter while he walked inside. The café was beautifully inside a contrast kept at every visible surface to make it look aesthetically antique. All chairs and tables were dark brown matching the walls and tablecloth, white and red chequered with a beige colored flower vase kept atop. There was a blackboard kept on the wall for dishes of today. It read, Mutton cutlet, chicken cutlet, chicken fry, cream soda, chai, coffee, caramel custard written in white chalk. There was great vibe to the place. But as he walked inside he found all the chairs empty. There was one cook, who was not visible but the voice of gas and a ladle clanging against the pot made his presence clear. And then there was the cashier at the counter who was apparently gazing into a distance with some incense burning beside him on his counter.

Still trying to figure out why is the place so empty he looked around. He saw someone sitting at the center table, midnight blue T-shirt with back towards him, sipping on what seemed to be cream soda. A black cap lay on table alongside a small waist pouch. There was a bowl of caramel custard already on the table waiting to be dug into. They might be alone, he assumed. He was not much of a social person and would love to sit alone at another table but he felt like he should be sitting there, right beside them not across but beside them. He walked towards the table and sat beside them in the empty chair. *I should be socializing with this person, I have sat beside them. I don't want to make them uncomfortable,* he thought to himself.

Suddenly feeling conscious about his appearance he took a glance towards his shirt and jeans and started talking, ""Hey... I am just getting chai. I will just sit for a while...."". His breaking words and trembling voice had exposed his confidence. He couldn't make eye contact with such a nervous sentence. And there was no response from the person either. He had to make small talk. So he cleared the lump formed in his throat and tried talking again, ""I will just finish my chai...The weather is gloomy outside."" He turned his face towards them trying to make it less awkward. While slowly lifting his face up, he came to realize it was a girl. Short yet perfectly stout. He gasped as his eyes fell upon the face. There was nothing at all. It was a clear white light, stinging in his eyes. He tried to narrow his eyes but it was just stinging his eyes to keep focus and looking what it was. Instinctively he raised his hands and tried to touch the face to get an idea of the features of the face. *I don't understand why am I even doing this.* But he couldn't touch it. More he tried to more it felt distant like it was constantly repelling his touch. He got up in a hurry and ran backwards looking at this absurdism. He went to the cashier. Hurriedly he tried speaking to the cashier, ""What is that?...Forget it cancel my order!"" But the cashier didn't react, still as a rock. he lifted his wrists and curled into a ball to knock on the counter when his gaze fall on a notepad which was surprisingly was kept straight as if meant to read. It read:

>

>

He felt a sharp sting in his eye as the he had ignored the incense stick burning beside the notepad. The smoke engulfed his vision. And then a waft blew across his face. He opened his eyes, his eyes were watery. He was leaning on a wall. He closed his eyes again to loose the teary eyes. The cigarette in his hand was still burning. He felt a little lightheaded. He dropped the stick and crushed it beneath his boots. He felt a person staring at him in distance. He looked across, spotting a middle-aged guy at a counter across the street.",1,1733664614.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Author's Foreword
As a writer, I’ve always believed that stories are more than just words on a page—they are vessels of emotion, connection, and the complex, often messy, journey of life. This story is no exception. It’s a reflection on love, loss, and the inexplicable ways in which the past and present collide.
The relationship between Callia and Jacky was built on years of friendship, unspoken feelings, and shared memories. But at its core, it was always about resilience—both in the face of their own challenges and in how they navigated the twists and turns of life together. Their bond is something I’ve always found inspiring, and writing about it allowed me to explore not just the beauty of a deep connection, but also the heavy burden of unexpressed love and the healing power of time.
As the story unfolds, it becomes more than just a love story. It’s a testament to the complexity of human relationships and how, sometimes, the most meaningful connections defy time and even death. What I hope readers will take away from this is that love never truly fades; it changes shape, evolves, and finds ways to remain present in our lives, even when we least expect it.
This book wouldn’t exist without the characters who breathed life into it. Callia’s strength and vulnerability, Jacky’s charm and loyalty—these two characters have been with me from the start, and I hope they find a place in your heart as they did in mine. Their journey was never meant to be easy, but it was always meant to be worth it.
To everyone who’s ever loved, lost, or struggled to make sense of the forces that shape their lives—this story is for you. It’s a reminder that the people we care about never truly leave us. They may change form, but they stay with us in ways we never expect. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Thank you for joining me on this journey
nly! Here’s a more detailed version of the letter that fills the available word space and expands on the sentiments, emphasizing gratitude and looking forward to the future:

We’ve all contributed to something truly special, and I want to take a moment to acknowledge the collective energy, passion, and hard work that have gotten us to this point.

When I first began this journey, I never could have imagined how much I would grow—not just professionally, but personally. The feedback, the ideas, and the collaborative spirit of this community have been the fuel that has kept me going through the tough days. Whether it’s been sharing advice, brainstorming new strategies, or simply offering moral support when needed, you have all been there for me. I want you to know that your time, your contributions, and your belief in the project are never taken for granted.

The road we’ve traveled hasn’t always been easy. We’ve faced our share of obstacles, but each challenge has brought us closer together. I’ve learned so much from each of you, whether it’s been about business, creativity, or simply the importance of perseverance. You’ve shown me what it means to build something meaningful and worthwhile. Every single step of this journey has been made better because of the incredible people I’ve had the privilege to collaborate with.

And now, as we look ahead, the future is bright. We’ve laid a strong foundation, and it’s time to build on it. I’m incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead and the potential we have to grow even further. The next steps are filled with exciting possibilities, and I want you all to know that you are an integral part of what is to come. We’re not just building a business; we’re creating a movement—a community that values creativity, collaboration, and innovation. We’re just getting started, and there’s so much more to come.

What excites me most is knowing that this journey is something we’re all on together. The direction we take, the decisions we make, and the success we achieve are all shaped by the contributions of this amazing group. I want you to know that your role is invaluable, and that every one of you has played a part in where we are today. Whether you’ve been here from the start or just joined, your ideas, your energy, and your passion are what make this all possible. Thank you for being part of this dream, and for helping it evolve into something more than I could have ever imagined.

As we continue on this journey, I will be doing everything I can to ensure that we reach new heights. We have big plans for the future, and I’m confident that with your continued support, there’s nothing we can’t achieve. Together, we can scale this project into something truly groundbreaking, something that will not only change the way we approach business, but also make a positive impact in the world. We’re building something that will outlast us all, and I couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve accomplished so far.

Before I sign off, I want to thank each and every one of you again for being here. You’ve made this journey more fulfilling, more rewarding, and far more meaningful than I ever could have imagined. As we move forward, I want to continue learning from all of you, and I hope you’ll continue to share your thoughts, your feedback, and your ideas. There’s always room for growth, and I’m excited to continue this adventure with such a talented, creative, and dedicated group of people.

Now, as promised, here’s a little something to lighten the mood:

Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts! 😄

Thanks once again for everything. I can’t wait to see where we go from here. Together, we are unstoppable.

With appreciation,

Prologue: Jacky's Redemption and Callia's Shock
A year earlier, “Jacky” Stone was a different man. The bar was dimly lit, the air thick with the smell of spilled beer and stale cigarettes.  sat at the counter, nursing his fifth—or was it his sixth?—glass of whiskey. His massive frame hunched over the drink, his blue eyes dark as the lake he grew up near, staring into the amber liquid as though it held the answers to questions he didn’t dare ask.
When the shove came, it wasn’t unexpected. Bars like this always had someone looking for trouble, and Jacky’s size made him a magnet for insecure tough guys who wanted to prove themselves. Normally, he’d shrug it off.  hated violence when he was sober. But tonight, he wasn’t sober.
“You gonna move, big guy?” the man sneered, his smaller frame puffed up like a rooster in a barnyard.
 sighed, setting down his glass. “You don’t want this,” he said softly, his voice rumbling like distant thunder.
But the man wanted it. And so did his six friends.
What followed was chaos. wasn’t just big; he was fast, a mountain that moved like a storm. Growing up as white boy in the ghetto, he’d learned to fight young—it was a skill you needed when the world didn’t give you much choice. His punches landed like sledgehammers, his movements calculated and relentless. Blood spilled—some his, mostly theirs—until the bar was a wreck and stood alone, panting, a predator surrounded by fallen prey.
The cops arrived, weapons drawn, shouting commands. turned slowly, his face a grotesque mix of blood and a crooked, open-mouthed smile. He dropped to his knees, raising his hands. The fight was over.
Prison was the next chapter, but even there, made an impact. His time behind bars was short—six months, reduced for good behavior—but it wasn’t wasted. He reorganized the jail’s chaotic cell system, rebuilt the crumbling library shelves, and donated his own money to replace the jail’s outdated books and supplies.
When the photo of presenting a $500,000 check to the six men he had beaten went public, it made waves. He promised to pay their hospital bills and provide ongoing support for their recovery. The gesture stunned everyone. The donation to the jail, the thoughtful reorganization of its resources, and his commitment to sobriety earned him the respect of the community—and the attention of one Callia ""Calli"" Hartman.
Callia’s Prologue: Coffee and Confusion
Callia sipped her coffee slowly, enjoying the quiet of her morning. Her small art studio was bathed in soft light, brushes and canvases scattered around the space like a colorful explosion. She had just finished grading a stack of papers from her elementary school art students when her phone buzzed.
It was a news alert.
Curious, she clicked on it—and promptly spit her coffee all over her sketchbook.
“Jacky?!”
The headline read: “Local Giant Turns Over New Leaf: From Bar Brawl to Redemption.” There he was, her best friend since childhood, towering in the center of a photo, handing over a check to the men he had nearly destroyed months earlier. His expression was subdued, almost shy, but his eyes carried that familiar spark she hadn’t seen in years.
Callia couldn’t help but laugh, a mix of exasperation and affection bubbling to the surface. Typical Jacky. Even when he screwed up, he somehow found a way to make it right—and make a scene doing it.
She read the article twice, her mind swirling with memories. had always been larger than life, not just in size but in heart. They’d drifted apart over the years, life pulling them in different directions, but the bond between them never fully faded. Seeing him now, after all this time, brought a flood of emotions she wasn’t ready to unpack.
She grabbed her phone, her fingers hovering over his contact. She hadn’t spoken to him in months, years, maybe longer. What could she even say? Before she could decide, her phone buzzed again—a text from him.
Jacky: ""Hey, Cal. Are you busy?""
Callia stared at the message, her heart pounding. She didn’t know what he wanted, but she had a feeling life was about to get a lot more interesting.
Callia: ""Depends. Are you about to talk me into something crazy?""
His reply came almost instantly.
Jacky: ""Always.""
Chapter 1: Seeds of the Past
The quiet hum of Jacky’s ancient laptop filled the cramped Milwaukee apartment as he reread the email Callia had sent the night before. It was simple, even friendly—like so many messages they had exchanged over the years. Yet, there was something unspoken in her words, a crack in her normally unshakable exterior.

“Hey, Jacky,That sounds great, Been thinking about you a lot lately. We should catch up. Call me when you can.—Callia”

 Leaned back in his chair, the springs groaning under his weight. His arms stretched wide and muscles made the shirt tight around his skin. He absentmindedly scratched his goatee, eyes drifting to the photo pinned above his desk—a snapshot of him and Callia on a summer day, barefoot at the river. Her smile had been as radiant as the sun that day, but it was her eyes he couldn’t forget: green like gemstone pools.

The years had been unkind to him. At thirty-nine, his body carried the scars of a lifetime’s worth of battles—most of them fought against himself. The fainting spells had worsened. The hallucinations were harder to shake. And the truth, which he rarely voiced, was becoming impossible to ignore: his time was running out.

Still, the thought of seeing Callia made his chest tighten. She was always a whirlwind, a storm in human form—bursting into his life with color and chaos, leaving behind a mess of feelings he’d never quite sorted through. She was the one that got away in every way that Mattered. And she was also his best friend, the only person who had ever truly seen him.

His phone buzzed, snapping him back to the present. It was Callia.

“Hey, Jacky!” Her voice was as lively as ever, though he caught the slight hesitation beneath it.“Callia,” he replied, leaning forward. “What’s up?”“Not much. Just… I don’t know. I Need to hear your voice, I guess.”

That was how it always started with them—some vague excuse, a half-explained reason, until the truth finally bubbled to the surface. He waited.

“You know, I was thinking,” she continued. “Remember those road trips we used to dream about? Just you and me, no destination, no plans?” Chuckled. “Yeah. I remember you saying we’d end up broke and stranded in the middle of nowhere.”“Well, I think it’s time we found out.”

The words hung in the air. For a moment, wasn’t sure he’d heard her right.

“You’re serious?” he asked.“As serious as I can be,” she said, her voice softening. “I need this, Jacky. We need this.”

He leaned back again, the springs groaning in protest. It wasn’t just about the trip. It never was with Callia. There was something behind her words, a plea she wasn’t saying outright.

“I don’t know, Callia,” he said after a moment. “It’s been years since we’ve done anything like that. You’ve got Micah, your job—”“That’s the thing,” she interrupted. “Micah’s fine with it. He knows how much you mean to me. And work… I just need a break. From everything.”

She didn’t elaborate, but she didn’t have to. knew Callia well enough to hear the strain in her voice. He thought of all the times she had been there for him—when his first dog, Duke, died; when his marriage crumbled; when his health began to fail. She had always shown up, no questions asked.

“Okay,” he said finally.“Okay?” she echoed, surprise laced with relief.“Yeah. Let’s do it. Just tell me when and where.”

She laughed, the sound like a warm breeze cutting through the heaviness of the moment. “You won’t regret it, Jacky. I promise.”

As the call ended, stared at the photo on his desk again. For the first time in years, a flicker of excitement stirred in his chest.

He didn’t know where the road would take them, but he knew one thing for sure: it was a journey he couldn’t afford to miss.

Chapter 2: A Reluctant Yes
The rhythmic tapping of Callia’s ukulele filled the small, sunlit condo as she plucked aimlessly at the strings. Halyi, her aging Golden Retriever, lay sprawled on the carpet, snoring softly. Callia’s mind wasn’t on music, though. It was racing, tumbling through memories and second-guessing her own impulsiveness.

Author's Foreword

As a writer, I’ve always believed that stories are more than just words on a page—they are vessels of emotion, connection, and the complex, often messy, journey of life. This story is no exception. It’s a reflection on love, loss, and the inexplicable ways in which the past and present collide.
The relationship between Callia and Jacky was built on years of friendship, unspoken feelings, and shared memories. But at its core, it was always about resilience—both in the face of their own challenges and in how they navigated the twists and turns of life together. Their bond is something I’ve always found inspiring, and writing about it allowed me to explore not just the beauty of a deep connection, but also the heavy burden of unexpressed love and the healing power of time.
As the story unfolds, it becomes more than just a love story. It’s a testament to the complexity of human relationships and how, sometimes, the most meaningful connections defy time and even death. What I hope readers will take away from this is that love never truly fades; it changes shape, evolves, and finds ways to remain present in our lives, even when we least expect it.
This book wouldn’t exist without the characters who breathed life into it. Callia’s strength and vulnerability, Jacky’s charm and loyalty—these two characters have been with me from the start, and I hope they find a place in your heart as they did in mine. Their journey was never meant to be easy, but it was always meant to be worth it.
To everyone who’s ever loved, lost, or struggled to make sense of the forces that shape their lives—this story is for you. It’s a reminder that the people we care about never truly leave us. They may change form, but they stay with us in ways we never expect. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.

So I went to an animal sanctuary (not going to disclose the name) and I was so upset, I know it is horribly wet but it was so muddy, looking at pictures it looks like they do have hard standing and shelter but the ground in the yard was so muddy. I'm not sure if this is okay, I know pigs in the wood is also muddy. They also a pig on site that has no other pig companions and did ask the owner about this and was told due to the pig's age it was unfair to bring another pig in, now I am no pig expert but I know pigs are social creatures and shouldn't live alone, so that confused me.

This was also a minor thing and more of  a new vegan and rare cofee drinker me fuck up, but I asked for a black coffee and was told they didn't have any, first red flag, was they said while they didn't have it, they had sachets, now I thought they meant they didn't have black filter coffee, and I didn't know as someone who doesn't drink coffee regularly and thought they wouldn't try and give me milk coffee instead, but nope it was a milky coffee and due to the bubbles and only noticed after I took a sip. Now I know it was a fuck up in my part but I would think you would tell someone it has milk in.

Whether it’s providing workers with 20t of bread, establishing trade rights with your toughest opponents or even wiping out the competition. In almost 6 years since the game was released most people have probably done all of that and more. How about an ultimate achievement?

First and foremost there has to be a large group of friends who actually play Anno. My estimate is at least 100 to pull off a 16 player run. That means each participant needs to have quite a few friends in different time zones to be able to pass the baton. This may seem like a lot but if you factor in 2 huge Anno subreddits with 106k members combined, 100 friends isn’t that big of a number. There is also a newly created subreddit dedicated to Anno 1800 multiplayer

It doesn’t have to be a chore so it’s best not to ignore “how about a cup of coffee” prompt as it’s a good opportunity to pass the torch, reassign factions and change the host if needed.

 

Execution

Since there is no built-in PUBG type lobby where the game automatically starts once a certain number of people join, it’ll have to be done manually.

I currently have 9 “up-to-date” friends who have recently showed interest in Anno multiplayer but as always the reality is that a fraction of that number would actually show up. Last time it was 3 out of 9 and we hadn’t even started since we were aiming for at least 4 and even if we did start I’d expect 1 or both of them to drop out at any point.

1h9iico,https://i.redd.it/t6jd7hr6jm5e1.jpeg,Fragrance World Star Men Nebula- A comprehensive review from an amateur enthusiast.,"Name- Fragrance World Star Men Nebula 

Price- ₹1400/ $16.53

Fragrance Family- Oriental Woody

Overview of the essences- Fruity, boozy, whiskey, woody, sweet, warm spicy, floral.

What does it make you smell like ?
 An individual with an air of mystique and sophistication. The fragrance's blend of fruity top notes, warm malt and whiskey heart, and a rich base of vanilla and musk would reflect sophistication and confidence, characterized by an adventurous spirit and a love for life's finer things. The gourmand, and woody notes suggests a warm and inviting demeanor, making you approachable yet intriguing. You would be seen as someone who enjoys exploring new experiences while exuding a magnetic charm that leaves a lasting impression on those around you.

Notes Experienced- 

The spray opens with vibrant and zesty Orange blossom a tad bit of sharpness from the Bergamot and citrus from the lemongrass.

The heart reveals itself very quickly and it smells like a well peated single malt (Personally it instantly reminded me of Laphroaig Lore and Amrut Peated Single Malt). The peat gives it a well rounded smokiness that balances the booziness of the whiskey malt and blends it ever so gently with the woody cedar and the earthy, musky patchouli. There is a slight nuttiness, chocolate and caramel that emanates from the coffee that is lingering in the background. 

The base, once settled is peaty, smoky but not overpowering but in a subtle an elegant way, the vanilla notes come into play with some musk and amber and my favorite part is when you pick orange blossom again but infused with the whiskey this time around. The end result is a beautiful woody, boozy, gournmand-ish, aromatic fragrance that makes you feel this warming effect while wearing it, kind of like after you swig a good whiskey neat.

Wearability- This would be a great wear for the colder seasons, I feel that this would cut through even on the coldest of days. Personally, I'd recommend this as a fragrance to be worn on date nights, dinners or other special occasions.
Longevity and Sillage- Nothing nuclear, lasts a cool 6-7 hours, pushing the 8th hour mark. Sillage is a moderate but captivating, noticable one that lasts in the space even after you've left it. 

Compliment Factor- 
This one got me a few compliments and a few stink eyes. Let's start with the compliments, my partner said I smell somewhere between a nice glass of whiskey and a mimosa, friends loved the whole boozy leathery aroma ( I pick no booze in here). Now the stink eyes, was going through the security check at the metro and the personnel thought I was drunk and would not let me through until I proved it to him that it was my perfume, later some aunties at a mall shot displeased glances at me, most probably because of the boozy sillage.

Thoughts- 
I think it's a job well done by Fragrance World, a well blended boozy, fruity, woody fragrance to have in your collection. I feel, the issue with a lot of fragrances with boozy notes is that they have an alcohol blast that makes it smell like cheap liquor but I was surprised at the refined notes that I got here and I just can't get enough of the drydown which is a beautiful whiskey with orange, vanilla, musk with some smoke in the background. The elements like vanilla, coffee, chocolate and caramel that make make this fragrance tip toe the territory of gourmands are absolutely well balanced with the other elements go hand in hand.
I've read about it being a clone of Thierry Mugler A Men Pure Malt but I cannot comment on that as I've never smelt the original but at this price point, it's a win win fragrance. I would rate it a solid 9/10. Though this was a blind buy on my part, I'm quite satisfied with it, but nonetheless, I'd recommend y'all to get a decant and then purchase a full bottle as fragrances are subjective.

Thank you for reading, feel free to ask any questions.

1h9ihgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1h9ihgd/anno_1800_pc_multiplayer_ultimate_achievement/,Anno 1800 PC multiplayer ultimate achievement,"We all love achievements and challenges. Whether it’s providing workers with 20t of bread, establishing trade rights with your toughest opponents or even wiping out the competition. In almost 6 years since the game was released most people have probably done all of that and more. How about an ultimate achievement?

In a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1h8xh0q/did_you_know_that_anno_1800_supports_up_to_16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I shared my Easter egg 16 people multiplayer support discovery and how you can keep a large project running with that many people involved by sharing save files.

First and foremost there has to be a large group of friends who actually play Anno. My estimate is at least 100 to pull off a 16 player run. That means each participant needs to have quite a few friends in different time zones to be able to pass the baton. This may seem like a lot but if you factor in 2 huge Anno subreddits with 106k members combined, 100 friends isn’t that big of a number. There is also a newly created subreddit dedicated to Anno 1800 multiplayer

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/)

It doesn’t have to be a chore so it’s best not to ignore “how about a cup of coffee” prompt as it’s a good opportunity to pass the torch, reassign factions and change the host if needed.

 

Execution

Since there is no built-in PUBG type lobby where the game automatically starts once a certain number of people join, it’ll have to be done manually.

The process of gathering people is described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/comments/1h95sas/makeshift_solution_for_inefficient_anno_1800/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) or you may come up with better ideas.

I currently have 9 “up-to-date” friends who have recently showed interest in Anno multiplayer but as always the reality is that a fraction of that number would actually show up. Last time it was 3 out of 9 and we hadn’t even started since we were aiming for at least 4 and even if we did start I’d expect 1 or both of them to drop out at any point. That's why the number of active friends should be about 10 times the number of concurrent players you're aiming for. At the end of the day even if this project fails you’ll end up with more friends.

I'll be in this [https://skribbl.io/?PGCIUYTP](https://skribbl.io/?PGCIUYTP) 20 player private lobby for the next 30 minutes. I'll get sound notification when someone joins.

I know this can be extremely slow and complicated process and it doesn't have much of a chance to succeed but if the outcome is guaranteed it’s not exactly an achievement.",1,1733663250.0,anno,0,1.0,False
1h9ih1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1h9ih1i/how_5_days_can_change_your_life_a_friendly_advice/,How 5 Days Can Change Your Life – A Friendly Advice from Someone Who’s Been There,"There was a time in my life when every day started the same way—a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. It wasn’t just a habit; it was my way of coping, of finding a moment of calm in the chaos. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t calm I was creating—it was a storm brewing inside me.

You know that feeling, don’t you? The tight chest when you climb a flight of stairs. The guilt when your kids ask why you’re coughing so much. The nagging thought at the back of your mind: *“What if I can’t stop? What if it’s too late?”* Those symptoms aren’t just physical—they’re emotional, too. They weigh on you, even when you try to ignore them.

For the longest time, I told myself that quitting wasn’t realistic. *“It’s too hard. I’ve tried everything. It’s part of who I am.”* But here’s the thing: smoking doesn’t define you. What if, instead of seeing it as a battle against yourself, you saw it as a gift to yourself? A gift of health, time, and freedom. That small shift in perspective changes everything.

I’ll admit it—I had my excuses. *“I’m too stressed to quit right now.”* *“It helps me think.”* But those excuses were just habits. They weren’t me. They weren’t stronger than my will to breathe freely, to be present for the people I love, and to take control of my life. And guess what? They aren’t stronger than you either.

Here’s something that helped me see things differently: quitting doesn’t have to be a monumental, all-or-nothing leap. It’s a series of small, doable steps. The wisdom here? You don’t have to figure it all out at once. You just have to focus on one day, one step, one choice at a time.

Sure, quitting has a cost—time, effort, maybe even a few tears. But think about the price of not quitting. What does smoking take from you every day? Your health, your energy, your confidence? What would you pay to get those back? Turns out, it’s a lot less than you might think.

Long searches on google gave me a great solution  **Quitify5** . That is something I was long searching for -  It’s a proven 5-day challenge that breaks quitting into small, actionable steps.

* Daily guidance to keep you on track
* Expert support so you’re never alone
* A community cheering you on every step of the way

For less than the cost of a cup of coffee per week, you can transform your life and finally break free from smoking, you can transform your life in just 5 days. It’s that simple.

Quitting smoking is like finding a lighthouse in the middle of a storm. You don’t have to conquer the storm all at once. You just need a light to guide you. Quitify5 is that light. It’s not about perfection; it’s about progress, one small step at a time.

Quitting smoking was one of the best decisions I ever made. It wasn’t easy, but with the right plan and support, I was able to overcome my addiction and embrace a healthier, happier life. If you’re struggling to quit, remember that you’re not alone and that change is possible.",2,1733663211.0,quittingsmoking,1,0.63,False

1h9ifrg,https://i.redd.it/27wjgtkfim5e1.jpeg,Fragrance World Star Men Nebula- A comprehensive review from an amateur enthusiast.,"Name- Fragrance World Star Men Nebula 

Source- Talib Bhai

Price- ₹1400

Fragrance Family- Oriental Woody

Overview of the essences- Fruity, boozy, whiskey, woody, sweet, warm spicy, floral.

What does it make you smell like ?
An individual with an air of mystique and sophistication. The fragrance's blend of fruity top notes, warm malt and whiskey heart, and a rich base of vanilla and musk would reflect sophistication and confidence, characterized by an adventurous spirit and a love for life's finer things. The gourmand, and woody notes suggests a warm and inviting demeanor, making you approachable yet intriguing. You would be seen as someone who enjoys exploring new experiences while exuding a magnetic charm that leaves a lasting impression on those around you.

Notes Experienced- 

The spray opens with vibrant and zesty Orange blossom a tad bit of sharpness from the Bergamot and citrus from the lemongrass.

The heart reveals itself very quickly and it smells like a well peated single malt (Personally it instantly reminded me of Laphroaig Lore and Amrut Peated Single Malt). The peat gives it a well rounded smokiness that balances the booziness of the whiskey malt and blends it ever so gently with the woody cedar and the earthy, musky patchouli. There is a slight nuttiness, chocolate and caramel that emanates from the coffee that is lingering in the background. 

The base, once settled is peaty, smoky but not overpowering but in a subtle an elegant way, the vanilla notes come into play with some musk and amber and my favorite part is when you pick orange blossom again but infused with the whiskey this time around. The end result is a beautiful woody, boozy, gournmand-ish, aromatic fragrance that makes you feel this warming effect while wearing it, kind of like after you swig a good whiskey neat.

Wearability- 
This would be a great wear for the colder seasons, I feel that this would cut through even on the coldest of days. Personally, I'd recommend this as a fragrance to be worn on date nights, dinners or other special occasions.

Longevity and Sillage- 
Nothing nuclear, lasts a cool 6-7 hours, pushing the 8th hour mark. Sillage is a moderate but captivating, noticable one that lasts in the space even after you've left it. 

Compliment Factor- 
This one got me a few compliments and a few stink eyes. Let's start with the compliments, my partner said I smell somewhere between a nice glass of whiskey and a mimosa, friends loved the whole boozy leathery aroma ( I pick no booze in here). Now the stink eyes, was going through the security check at the metro and the personnel thought I was drunk and would not let me through until I proved it to him that it was my perfume, later some aunties at a mall shot displeased glances at me, most probably because of the boozy sillage.

Thoughts- 
I think it's a job well done by Fragrance World, a well blended boozy, fruity, woody fragrance to have in your collection. I feel, the issue with a lot of fragrances with boozy notes is that they have an alcohol blast that makes it smell like cheap liquor but I was surprised at the refined notes that I got here and I just can't get enough of the drydown which is a beautiful whiskey with orange, vanilla, musk with some smoke in the background. The elements like vanilla, coffee, chocolate and caramel that make make this fragrance tip toe the territory of gourmands are absolutely well balanced with the other elements go hand in hand.

I've read about it being a clone of Thierry Mugler A Men Pure Malt but I cannot comment on that as I've never smelt the original but at this price point, it's a win win fragrance. I would rate it a solid 9/10. Though this was a blind buy on my part, I'm quite satisfied with it, but nonetheless, I'd recommend y'all to get a decant and then purchase a full bottle as fragrances are subjective.

Thank you for reading, feel free to ask any questions.

Frustrating, isn't it?

I've been there. After investing thousands of hours testing email platforms for clients ranging from solo entrepreneurs to 8-figure businesses, I'm about to share the unvarnished truth about MailerLite and GetResponse.

**Warning**: This isn't your typical sugar-coated comparison. I'm pulling back the curtain to reveal exactly what works, what doesn't, and most importantly – what nobody else is telling you.

# The Real Cost of Your Decision (Beyond Just Dollars)

Let's cut through the noise about pricing:

**MailerLite's True Investment:**

* ***Free Forever***: Up to 1,000 subscribers (Yes, really)
* ***Premium Access***: Starting at **$9/month**

**GetResponse's Investment Levels:**

* ***Starter Package***: Up to 500 free subscribers
* ***Growth Plan***: Beginning at **$15/month**

But here's what others won't tell you: The real cost isn't just financial. It's the hours you'll spend learning the platform, the opportunities lost to technical limitations, and the revenue left on the table due to missing features.

# The Hidden Power Features That Could Transform Your Business

**GetResponse: The Secret Weapon for Scaling Businesses**

What if you could automate your entire sales funnel, from lead capture to purchase follow-up, without hiring a team of developers? GetResponse makes this possible with:

* ***Advanced Automation that Works While You Sleep***

   * *Picture*: Launching your first campaign before your coffee gets cold

   * *Visualize*: Your subscribers getting exactly the right content at the right time

# The Truth About User Experience (From Someone Who's Actually Used Both)

Here's something fascinating: During my recent client project, we tested both platforms with complete beginners. The results? Shocking.

**MailerLite's Learning Curve:**

* ***Day 1***: Creating and sending first campaign
* ***Day 2***: Setting up automated welcome sequence
* ***Day 3***: Building landing pages and forms

**GetResponse's Reality:**

* ***Day 1-3***: Understanding the dashboard

# Real Results From Real Users

*""GetResponse's automation helped us generate an additional $127,000 in our first quarter using their platform.""* \- Michael R., E-commerce Owner

# Your Turn To Decide

The choice is yours, but don't let analysis paralysis hold you back. Every day you spend without proper email marketing is leaving money on the table.

**Ask Yourself:**

* Are you ready for sophisticated automation?
* Do you need webinar capabilities?
* Is ease of use your top priority?

Your answers to these questions will guide you to the right choice.

**What's holding you back from making your decision? Share your concerns below, and I'll personally address them.**

>The man has no hobbies as he runs a business and works every day of the week for 10-11 hours a day. He doesn't read, doesn't smoke, can't drink due to a pervious stroke(im also under 21 and can't buy that stuff)

>I live with him as i am a college student as well as work with him so spending time is already happening.

>He is never happy with clothing that is bought for him so thats out of the question. My mom already got him orthopedic shoes as he has flat feet.

>He is particular about his coffee and only likes one type of brand and has a $600 coffee maker. so thats a no go.

I am looking to purchase a super automatic for my hair salon as a value ad for clients. While we’re not a very large space we are very busy. 

I anticipate being somewhere around 40-50 drinks a week. Surely some weeks will be higher and lower, but just trying to provide content for an average range. 

I’m looking for is the best machine for value which can handle the volume, somewhat easy to clean and service for maintenance, has a clean aesthetic, and can make a variety of drinks (even though I think most people will opt for something like a latte or something simple like an espresso, coffee, or some hot water for matcha. 

I’ve been doing a ton of research and reading many of the helpful posts channel, but I guess I am most concerned with the volume and being able to ensure that whatever I go with can handle it ( I don’t have much experience with this outside of owning a simple machine at home). 

Any and all help is beyond greatly appreciated so in advance, I think all of you for your time and support. Everything I see from the post on here speaks nothing of how awesome this community is.

I live in New York and budget ideally is sub $1k but open and could go higher if absolutely necessary.

I've been a home barista for over 5 years now, and I've learned quite a bit about getting the best deals on quality espresso machines. Today, I want to share my insights about Breville espresso machines and the best times to snag one at a discount.

From my experience, Breville typically offers their biggest discounts during major shopping events. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are absolute goldmines for espresso machine deals, with discounts ranging from 20% to 35% off. I actually got my Barista Express during last year's Black Friday sale and saved almost $200!

But here's the thing - you don't have to wait until November to get a good deal. Amazon Prime Day (usually in July) often features substantial discounts on Breville machines. I've seen some great prices on models like the Bambino Plus and the Oracle Touch during these events.

Here's a breakdown of when you're most likely to find Breville espresso machines on sale:

1. Black Friday/Cyber Monday (November)
2. Amazon Prime Day (July)
3. Holiday sales (Christmas, Memorial Day, Labor Day)
4. End of season clearance (January/February)
5. Random flash sales throughout the year

Pro tip: Some retailers offer additional discounts when you sign up for their newsletter or create an account. I've also noticed that prices tend to drop slightly when newer models are about to be released.

Right now, I've actually found some pretty sweet deals on various Breville models here: https://athometouch.com/breville

Beyond the regular sale events, I've noticed that warehouse stores like Costco occasionally offer bundle deals that include extras like a milk pitcher or cleaning supplies. These bundles can offer better value than waiting for a traditional sale.

Something I learned the hard way: don't just jump on the first sale you see. Prices can vary significantly between retailers, even during major sales events. I always recommend checking prices across multiple stores and keeping track of historical prices using tools like CamelCamelCamel.

Store credit card rewards can also make a difference. Some retailers offer additional cashback or points when you use their store card, effectively giving you an extra discount on your purchase.

Remember, while getting a good deal is great, make sure you're choosing the right machine for your needs. I've seen people buy cheaper models during sales only to regret not spending a bit more on features they really wanted.

Hope this helps you time your purchase perfectly! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers make informed decisions.",1,1733662094.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

My diagnosis happened in parallel with my leaving my parents' house - which was quite turbulent. I won't dwell too much on the issue of family problems (because I don't think it adds to the story), but the main point is that I come from a family of religious fundamentalists and that I have always been charged with acting (from my earliest childhood memories). as “a normal person”, and the older I got, my behaviors (sensory overload, discomfort with noise, isolating myself, having a fixed routine such as always taking a shower at the same time or only drinking coffee in a single specific cup) were labeled as someone “crazy”. There was never a chance for understanding, nor space for it. When I left home, I chose a place where I didn't have any kind of roots, I didn't know anyone, almost a thousand kilometers from where I was born and raised and lived my entire life. I saw the chance to start from scratch.

It's been three years since I've been living alone. In practical terms, I have managed to adapt well, and I realize that it was the best decision I could make, especially for quality of life - having my space, being able to do things my way. Perhaps the biggest difficulty is adapting socially to a place where I know practically no one, and I have almost no duties to fulfill here (I work from home).

Some time after I started living alone and resolving some personal issues, I started using dating apps (Tinder, Grindr) and what at first seemed like a solution to break this isolation, perhaps over time it became the main one. source of problems for me. I met several people, some of whom I really liked, but for me the problem is the after - I can never understand what they expect from me, sometimes I have a great first contact and I want to keep in touch: then the person disappears. Or if I don't stay in touch for a while until I realize later (and sometimes too late) that I was actually being used and the person was taking advantage of me in some way (why can't I not be so naive?).

I got to the point where meeting someone became a huge affliction. Unpredictability consumes me: I don't know how to act, I don't know what to expect, I don't know what the other person's true intention is. I understand rationally that the problem is not with me, it is not me. But at the same time, sometimes I think it would be cool to get closer to someone, to establish a bond. But what if loneliness is less painful than repeated and frustrated attempts at getting closer? That only makes me feel a palpable incomprehension, and that same feeling that in the eyes of others, I am “the crazy one”.

It's more of a rant, but if anyone has similar experiences to share, I'd be happy to read it.",3,1733661998.0,aspergers,1,0.72,False

Hi all, woman in her 20s here. Thought I’d ask this question to gain some perspective in hindsight. If you have a crush on him and there’s some interest on his end and he asks you out but it’s still within a university context where people are talkative and friendly with everyone, is it a date? (I ask because in my introverted delusional bubble I could think whatever I want being blinded by infatuation and excitement, so I seek a third person assessment:D)

I’ll explain for context. Reflecting back on my first “date” ever at 20yo, til this day it’s unclear whether it was one or not. I guess date means different things to different people. So I’ve had a crush on him for 2-3 months and he was in my class at university. We were talking on WhatsApp for group projects and when we would meet in person during lectures the communication was getting stronger both in person and online. But tbh knowing him it’s still blurry as to whether it was a date or not back then since he was the typical extroverted kind that had large friend groups, talked and was friendly with everybody. He kept insisting to go have beer/coffee and celebrate that we passed a very difficult course. We went at an outdoor café/pub/garden under a castle in the evening with light bulbs on trees, very fancy decor and overall lovely vibes. 
Our hangout/date lasted 7 hours and he was mesmerised, didn’t wanna go home, was staring at me almost with sparkles in his eyes, constantly smiling (I had never seen him smile THIS MUCH in person at school). If I didn’t remind him that the last bus leaves at 11pm he wouldn’t have left. Immediately when we parted ways he texted the aftermath text to thank me and that he had a great time.

You might think this is obvious, but it’s not that clear since he talked and would hang out with girls as friends and in general he was very popular and had a loooot of friends (guys and girls) and was very extroverted constantly surrounded by people. So, what would you say?",0,1733661969.0,AskMenOver30,7,0.5,False

>My wife (50yo) is extremely hard to buy for. It wasn't always this way. She reads *constantly* but since I bought her a tablet years ago, she *only* reads digital books, so I can't buy her books anymore. There's no point in giving her a giftcard to buy digital books, because our money is shared, so, I'd just really be giving her something she already has.

>Budget can be up to $150

>She *used* to knit, she *used* to enjoy scrap-booking, she *used* to like to play Magic The Gathering and other card games, but these days she does only the following:

>\- Binge TV shows in her favourite chair  
\- Play Pokemon Go when she is out  
\- Go to the movies (with me or alone), especially the drive-in  
\- Read books purchased digitally  
\- go out with her friends for lunch or dinner  
\- Drink coffee (already getting her some coffee pods)  
\- Build lego *occasionally* (she still hasn't built the lego I got her for her birthday back in Feb).

>That's pretty much it. She just got a new car, so I'm getting her some things for her car, but *that's* not fun.

>I really want to get her something fun, but she just says ""Oh, I don't know, I don't need/want anything"".

>Help, I'm desperate!

I (18F) have been going out with one of my classmates (18M) for almost two months now, we are not official but weve done the normal couple stuff like going out for dinner and having sleepovers. Yesterday I was planning on finally making it official with him during a little coffee date BUT on our way to the café he said ""i gotta tell you- im taking -name of his friend, who is a girl- to prom, just so you know"". This made me lose any confidence i had on asking him to be my boyfriend. I told him thats okay and that i would probably just go with my friends anyways and we ended up having a very sweet date.   
After the date we also hung out with some of his friends and towards the end of the day his friend TRIED asking us if we were going to put a label on us soon but both me and the guy acted confused and moved onto another subject. 

  
Basically, I am very confused and unsure of what to do. He is very sweet and treats me well when we hang out and texts me a lot so I dont think this is just a fling to him, but him mentioning that his taking one of his female friends to prom is making me feel less secure. He is going out of town for two weeks soon so I have about a week to either make it official with him or wait until he is back, what is the best thing to do in this situation? Wait and see if he tries making it official or take the step myself?

  
TLDR; Been going on dates with this guy for 2 months soon and he told me he is taking his female friend to prom, how do I move forward in this relationship? Make it official or wait?",3,1733661650.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1h9hyws,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1h9hyws/day_8_amateur_review/,Day 8. Amateur review,"Today’s pick, **Kiamugumo AB** from Kirinyaga, Kenya, offered an interesting variation on Kenyan coffee. While it’s not the most typical Kenyan in terms of its punchy acidity or complexity, it’s light, fruity, and wonderfully easy to enjoy. This is the kind of coffee that feels at home on a quiet relaxed weekend morning, with just enough nuance to keep you intrigued without demanding too much of your attention.

**BREWING:**

https://preview.redd.it/jr57446fdm5e1.jpg?width=2947&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9155c9b823372c4a5c51fd6a383b2b16be90fe15

Following the instructions on the site for this brew required some mental math. First to adjust for the 16g dose (the suggested 30g of coffee is not what I want from a canister in an advent calendar) and then to actually have the protocol because the description is a bit unclear. Anyway, while it added a layer of complexity to the process, it felt like part of the ritual—turning the brewing into a small puzzle to solve before enjoying the reward :) So, here's the recipe I went for at the end:

* Brewer: Origami + Abaca filter
* Ratio: 1:16 (16/256) 
* Gring: 25 clicks on Comandante
* Water: 92c
* Protocol:
   * 0-0:30 - Bloom with double the amount of coffee (30g). Swirl to moisten all the grounds
   * 0:30 - First pour (75g) up to 105g
   * 01:20 - Second pour (75g) up to 180g
   * 03:10 - Last pour (76g) up to 256 g
   * TBT: 03:28

**ROAST:**

[Day 7 \(left\) vs Day 8 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/zkmuwftfdm5e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=200fe49c497df647dd87a2d0a2a792cf4cb01239)

Slightly lighter than yesterday’s Costa Rican CentroAmericano, the roast is clean and consistent, with very few defects. The beans’ quality is apparent from their even appearance and suggests a refined cup.

**AROMA:**

* **From the Canister**: The initial aroma is subtle, almost subdued—pleasant but lacking strong personality. Just a generic coffee aroma
* **Ground**: Grinding reveals more character. The aroma shifts to **chocolate**, **amaretto liquor**, and a dark sweetness reminiscent of **molasses**.
* **Brewed**: The brewed aroma transforms beautifully, bringing in **sweet berries**, **fruits**, and a hint of **cane sugar**. The amaretto note persists, adding an elegant touch.

**TASTE:**

The cup produced had a really beautiful reddish color. This coffee is light-bodied with a tea-like mouthfeel, making it incredibly drinkable. It’s fruity, leaning towards **blueberries** and **blackberries.** Otherwise, the flavors remain subtle and hard to pinpoint exactly. The sweetness is reminiscent of **caramel** or **cane sugar**, balanced with a gentle chocolate undertone.

https://preview.redd.it/k6419orddm5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22945239ef278b2937c8309f9686c1edcff8dc8d

While the cup was delightful at 1:16 ratio, it left me curious about brewing it with a 1:15 ratio or grind slightly finer next time for a slightly bolder expression. Nevertheless, it’s a refined and fruity coffee that doesn’t overwhelm, making it an excellent choice for those who appreciate a lighter, elegant cup.

All in all, today's pick delivers a subtle and light coffee experience, one that’s delightful without being overly bold or demanding. It’s not the punchy, bright Kenyan profile many might expect, but its approachable, fruity nature makes it a great entry point into Kenyan coffees or a go-to for those seeking a gentle and refined brew.

He still can't taste a thing and it's making him so depressed. He refuses to join me for lunch or to go out for coffee like we use to as he doesn't see the point...my heart breaks for him as he's already said he isn't looking forward to Christmas. Is there anything I can do to help him? He's taken part in acupuncture but to no avail. ANY help would be so much appreciated! ,6,1733661404.0,HeadandNeckCancer,4,1.0,False

1h9hxxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h9hxxp/howwhen_to_escalate_with_girls_26m/,How/when to escalate with girls [26M],"Ngl, I [26M] am quite frightened of approaching girls. I can talk to them, get to know them but then can't take it any further out of fear.

For example, I can chat to friends of friends whilst at social events. However, I wouldn't have the confidence to drop them a message the day after asking if they'd like to meet up for coffee or whatever. I can message them and ask them if they enjoyed the party yesterday but convo would die after that and I don't want to harrangue them and spam them with inane messages.

I just fear I'd become known as a creep who badly flirts with girls. In some respects ik I'm probably too respectful and keep my distance from women I'm attracted to too much.

Any advice on how to respectfully escalate with girls after a brief introductory conversation, without being pushy, would be very much appreciated.",1,1733661331.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I spent the remainder of the evening at an art show that spanned four different stories of a building. I now have 12 new artist friends.

I ate a corn beef sandwich that I bought from a waitress that I had a small crush on this summer. Then I had a nap. Period.

And it was a different woman, but I had a halfway decent date with a 23-year-old who is kind of beautiful. We made some porn. But really I regret not taking a page out of P.

1h9hrec,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1h9hrec/21_f4m_are_you_the_catalyst_to_my_reaction/,21 [F4M] Are you the catalyst to my reaction?,"As the year winds down, it feels right to find someone who brings a bit of magic to the ordinary days, someone I’d genuinely want to call “mine.” We still have a month left, so maybe it’s time to meet someone special and make those days count. 

I know a dating app isn’t exactly Cupid’s ideal setup, but hey, I’m open to taking the chance! Who knows, maybe it’ll lead me to you, the “favorite person” who’ll add that extra sparkle to my days. If it’s you, I’ll happily make you the reason behind my smiles, the name on my notifications that makes me look twice, and the thought that sneaks into my daydreams.

I’m not looking for a fairy tale, just someone who’ll be the sunshine in my life—someone to share laughter, silence, small talks, and deep talks. Someone who’ll make even the most ordinary days feel like they mean something. Let’s be each other’s “everyday” from simple study dates  to late-night movies, and quiet moments we’ll remember just because we’re together.

**A little about me:**

* 5’0 college student who juggles books, chemicals, and a whole lot of caffeine (and somehow still finds time to date)
* I can be your partner in crime, your personal cheerleader, and the one to listen when life feels heavy
* Also, I have a sport, so introduce me to something you’re interested in too—let’s make it a way of sharing our little worlds with each other.

**Dreaming of someone who:**

* Doesn’t just say “hi” but knows how to keep a conversation going and has a curious mind (bonus points if you’re as random as I am!)
* Bonus if you’re from the yellow school (matic paskuhan date chz)
* Ideally from NCR so we can meet for coffee and long walks; in short, I’m not down for LDRs
* Has a warm heart, patient, and accepting of my quirks, late-night study sessions, and school stress
* I’d prefer someone taller, and the vibe matters.

If you’re someone who’s looking to build something real, someone who’s up for the small moments and big dreams, let’s make this connection one that we both look forward to every day.

Thanks for reading my ad to the universe, hoping it reaches the right person. Include “compatibility” in your message if you read the whole thing. I’ll be waiting to hear from you.

Raven Maddox: I think it’s fair to say that once-long-shot-candidate Jane Allgood shellacked her political opponent, embattled President Amanda Knutson. We’re going to keep our eyes on this. There’s still time. From the city of Chicago and the final presidential debate, this has been Raven Maddox, reporting live for the Free News Broadcasting Station. Back to you in Washington, George.

Alan pressed the side of his VR glasses. The large screen before his eyes faded, and the lenses cleared. He stood at the window. The cement sidewalk three stories below glistened wet beneath amber streetlights. He took off the headset and rubbed the bridge of his nose. It had been a gift to himself for getting through most of October, yet he resented the contraption—too absorbing. He had to be wary of things that were absorbing. That morning he’d lost himself for two hours on a DIY pornography channel full of shaky videos and bad lighting. Twisting the glasses in his hands, he felt the plastic crack and the lenses pop out. He went to the kitchen, dropped the mangled devise in the trash, then poured himself another glass of wine.

“TV on. Sync.”

The television that monopolized most of his living room wall, another gift, instantly sprang to life.

>George Staff: Thank you, Raven. For post-debate analysis, we are joined by two people at the very top of this electoral race. President Knutson’s campaign manager, Hillary Reed, and Joseph Porchsmith, campaign manager for Security Party candidate Jane Allgood.
>
>Joseph, to you first. How do you think the debate went?
>
>Joseph Porchsmith {laughing}: Well, George, what you witnessed here tonight was Jane Allgood’s death blow to Amanda Knutson’s jugular. As Allgood stated, under Knutson’s leadership the economy has tanked with anywhere from fifty percent to sixty percent unemployment—depending on whose figures you’re inclined to trust. The war on the eastern front is caught in a quagmire. A fact Knutson avoids at every opportunity is that we’ve actually lost ground in the country of Georgia. The nuclear strike on Tbilisi, now more than thirteen years past, goes unaccounted for by yet another liberal hive-mind administration. You’ve got to wonder whose side these people are on! The Federation of Eastern European Nations, FEEN, is clearly responsible for that tragedy, and they need to be dealt with like the fiends they truly are! It’s time to bring President Orlov and his sons to justice!
>
>Hillary Reed {clapping}: Bravo! Very nice rhetoric, Joe. I think the American people see it for what it is. The Security Party intends to use Allgood to bulldoze through a radical agenda designed to trample on the Constitution. There’s nothing in your platform that will fix the challenges America is facing.
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Excuse me, Hill, is this how you want to play? Fine, let’s talk about domestic policy. President Knutson has failed to pass meaningful health care reform—a key campaign pledge she made four years ago. Additionally, because of this administration’s liberal policies, the nation’s youth have been devastated, *absolutely devastated,* by the scourge of designer Escape drugs. What’s the death toll now? I’m afraid to look. Fifty million! That’s straight from the CDC. Fifty million dead, and an estimated one hundred million more are addicted—and that number is rising daily. Not only that, since Knutson took office, the average age of first use has dropped to below eighteen. On top of everything, we at the Allgood campaign have come across studies that suggest Escape may be responsible for certain viral infections. Anyone in their right mind can see that this administration has lost control—
>
>Hillary Reed: Viral infections? George, I can’t let this go. Those studies were conducted by agenda-driven research. Haven’t the drug-addicted suffered enough? And now you’re trying to stigmatize them with rumors about viruses. Nice talking point, Joe. Joe the Scarecrow!
>
>George Staff: Ms. Reed, please—
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: George, I know this is your show. I’m sorry, but I’m just going to keep talking until I’m given a chance to actually speak—
>
>George Staff: Ms. Reed, please. You will have your chance. And I think we’re above name calling on this show.
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Thank you, George. Finally, and most critically, under Knutson’s watch, America suffered the largest terrorist attack since 9/11. Of course, I’m referring to the Super Bowl Los Angeles attack two years ago when a radical environmental organization—linked to the Gretas and President Knutson—released a chemical weapon at a stadium filled with innocent men, women, and children—
>
>Hillary Reed: Lie! That’s a Lie. George. There was no link to the president, or the Gretas! Joe, you *know* that—
>
>George Staff: Ms. Reed. Don’t make me cut your mic.
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Bomber number one was a Greta. That’s established. What is also established is the fact that these homegrown terrorists had ties to the Knutson White House—
>
>Hillary Reed: Stop! George—Joe! Stop! I can’t let that go. Half-baked truths, lies, and conspiracy theories! That’s what you’re peddling today, Joe. You pull these things out of your ass, and you’re never held accountable.
>
>George Staff: Ms. Reed, language, please! Your mic is off. You will have your say in just a moment. Mr. Porchsmith, get to the point.
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Thank you, George. So, *Hillary,* you might want to listen carefully. What America is desperate for, and what Jane Allgood proposes, is a radical restructuring of society to restore the values of our founders and America’s safety. That is why on day one of Allgood’s presidency, she is going to introduce the Third Eye legislation to Congress—the votes are there for its passage—and she’s going to sign it on the same day, thus granting her the authority to install cyber and homeland security that has been lacking under *your* boss. How many hacks in this admin⁠—
>
>George Staff: Okay, Mr. Porchsmith, thank you. That was a lot in one breath {laughs}. Hillary Reed, to you. Your response to Porchsmith and the debate.
>
>Hillary Reed: Thank you, George. First, I want to say it’s disgraceful that Porchsmith and his candidate continue to lie and perpetuate these conspiracy theories about that terrible attack. Everyone knows—
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: It was on *her* watch. It happened on President Knutson’s watch!
>
>Hillary Reed: Excuse me, *Joe*. Don’t interrupt me. I let you make your point. Now I’ll tell the truth. First, the Gretas are a massive, global phenomenon, and there are a lot of nut cases out there. They cannot be held responsible for one—
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Do you deny that bomber number two was once an intern for Knutson when she was on the board of directors for Earth Peace, itself a far-left environmental group?
>
>George Staff: Mr. Porchsmith. Ms. Reed, please finish.

Alan opened the back door, stepped out onto the little balcony covered by a half-awning to keep the weather from coming directly through the entry, and lit a cigarette. The sleet still fell, and above the apartment block, the low carpet of clouds reflected the amber hue of small-town lights. Snow incoming. The pinot noir and tobacco swirled an intoxicating dance in his mouth. The television droned on.

>Hillary Reed: As I was saying, President Knutson has had to fend off this disinformation campaign by Allgood and her goons in the Security Party for almost two years now. Anyone who wants to can go read the Independent Investigator’s report, the CIA’s report, and the FBI’s report, all of which have found absolutely *no* link or relationship between bomber number two and the president. That terrorist—I’m not afraid to say it—that *terrorist* was one of three hundred volunteers working at Earth Peace on a part-time internship administered by a third party. President Knutson did not know the man, nor had she ever met him. Those are the facts.
>
>See, George, this is what Porchsmith and the Allgood campaign have done from the very beginning. They twist, mislead, and obfuscate through lies and conspiracy theories in order to muddy the waters. And then, while Americans are distracted, they plot to destroy the Constitution. The point is, if Americans elect Jane Allgood, they are going to get this Third Eye legislation, giving the president broad powers to allow artificial intelligence to track your every move. There will be intrusive psychological monitoring and profiling, and who knows what else because the bill is expected to be classified as soon as it’s introduced. A vote for Allgood is a vote against American values.
>
>Joseph Porchsmith: Nice Try, Hill. That was desperate.
>
>George Staff: Thank you both. Emotions are high. The stakes are high. We’ll be back with further analysis by our expert panel.

Alan switched off the television. His wall turned black, and silence pervaded his small apartment. Like many Americans, he was riveted to the drama of this election season, and like many Americans, he’d lost hope in the political process. He had no plans to vote.

He flicked his cigarette into the alley.

To avoid getting worked up over things far outside his realm, he poured himself another glass of wine, tipping the bottle up to get the last dribbles of the crimson nectar. The warming numbness of onsetting drunk warmed his cheeks and fogged his mind. His fingers tingled. Something smooth behind his eyes said, *relax*. He turned the music station to midnight jazz and dimmed the lights. A mournful trumpet wept into his apartment. The expensive sound system was a gift to himself last Christmas for making it through the year. This year, a mountain bike. The plan was to tackle the second half of middle age with a vengeance.

Somewhere near the crepuscule of sleep in his cushy leather recliner, his phone began to vibrate, which caused the coffee table to hum, sending little ripples across the surface of his wine.

“Alan, it’s Paul. Put the Merlot down and listen,” said a rough voice that sounded like it had choked back a couple hundred thousand too many filterless cigarettes. “I’ve got a client for you.”

“Jesus, Paul. It’s 11 PM, and it’s pinot.”

“What are you, eighty-five years old? I’m still fucking my mistress at 11 PM. I really need your help on this one.”

“No, Paul. No more AI analysis. No more displaced worker syndrome. No more election derangement cases. I don’t care if they are in the manual.”

“You told me you were looking for something different. I’m just doing my part to keep psychotherapists off the breadline.”

“I figure as soon as Allgood gets in, I might as well join the other over-educated, under-employed professionals. You know the Security Party is going to gut the clinic’s funding.”

“Don’t drink the kool-aid, Alan. It’s just a bunch of political bullshit. If there’s one thing AI won’t be able to replace, it’s shrinks. Nobody is gonna want to talk to a robot about the robot that stole their job.”

“You’ll be singing a different tune when AI red-flags you for your lunchtime cigar and cognac problem.”

Dr. Paul Murphy, it was well known, enjoyed things a little bit on the luxurious side for a homegrown Montana psychiatrist.

“Who says there’s a problem?” said Murphy. “Anyway, Alan, I called you because I know you did your dissertation on juvenile offenders.”

“Oh, did you finally read it?”

“Abstracts and conclusions are all that matter. Christ, I’m an old man, grasshopper.”

Alan suppressed a bitter chuckle. Apart from his dissertation adviser and Zoey, no one had actually *read* his research. His adviser didn’t wholly agree with his conclusions, and Zoey had read it because she loved him, and she was a whiz at grammar.

“It’s a kid,” Murphy said.

Silence spanned between them. The trumpet was wailing in his ears.

“No,” said Alan.

“Alan—”

“Paul, I’m not… I don’t… I can’t…”

“He’s a native boy, lost as fuck, Alan. County’s going to run him through the ringer.”

“Becky, Paul. She went after me before.”

“If you don’t take this, I’ll have to put it on her desk. Do me a solid, for Christ’s sake. I don’t care about the other ones, but this one, Alan, this one is for you. And I don’t want Dr. Madison to touch it with a ten-foot pole.”

Alan opened the door and stepped back out onto the little veranda. The snow had started. He lit a cigarette. “She’ll just go to the board and tell them the dream-interpreting Escape addict is working with children again. They’ll run me through the whole gamut.”

“You detoxed. That’s an achievement in itself. I’ll lobby on your behalf. I founded this clinic. I might be emeritus, but I still got pull with the board. Christ, she’ll medicate him first thing.”

“They can’t do that. He’s a kid.”

“They can do that because they’re going to play the predator card.”

“Cunt,” Alan breathed.

“I didn’t hear that, Dr. Smith.”

“I’m not suited...”

“Look, at least do the initial eval and tell me what you think.”

Alan slammed the last of his wine. He had a bottle breathing on deck. “Fine, alright. I have time on Monday.”

“Nope. It’s got to be tomorrow. First thing in the morning.”

“Shit, I got a 9:30 with a spinner. Need to convince her that her dead husband isn’t talking to her from the toilet bowl.”

“You’ll have time. Or cancel with the spinner. She won’t know the difference. You need to get there before the sheriff gets in. This shit is going to blow up. There’s a big name involved.”

“Yeah? Like who?”

“Like John Taylor’s daughter.”

“The senator, that John Taylor?”

“The one and only.”

“Christ.” Alan rubbed his eyes and wished he hadn’t uncorked the second bottle.

“They brought him in tonight from the police station. They’re going to interrogate him tomorrow. He’s Native, so the tribe will want an eval first since he’s a minor. Cover their bases, and make sure he’s not loony tunes. It’ll be an uphill fight.”

“Anywhere but Montana,” said Alan.

“Be careful who you talk to. This case is a little sensitive. I’ll send the file to your email. He’s almost a John Doe. Both parents are MIA, probably spinners. Orphan most likely. No address. We got him in D-Pad for his safety and comfort.”

“Fuck, is it that bad?” D-Pad, or Padded Room D—deep, depressed, dungeon—was the clinic’s safe room for clients, usually Escape addicts, intent on self-harm.

“Better safe than sorry. Better than a jail cell. Security Sam is on the job, so I’m confident the boy’s okay until you get there tomorrow morning.”

“I’ll be there.”

“I know you will, Alan. Thank you. I feel better now. Oh, and one more thing. You didn’t forget, did you?”

“Forget what?” He played dumb.

“Come on, man. The Lake County Halloween Gala is the day after tomorrow. You promised. The deep pockets are gonna be there.”

“Yeah. Fuck it. I know. But I’m not dressing up.”

“Fine, fine, come as you are. It’s costume enough.”

*Click*.

The thought of getting off the chair annoyed him. He had to do something with that wine. The screaming in his head told him to dump it down the sink. He jerked to his feet, went into the kitchen, and picked the bottle up by the neck.

“Öküzgözü Boğazkere,” he said, trying to read the label. His research on the internet had informed him that the two little dots over the vowels meant you pronounced them in the back of your mouth. The crescent moon over the g meant you didn’t say it at all. “Ookuuzgoozuu Boazkeray.”

Satisfied with his pronunciation and gripping the bottle by the neck, he took it to the veranda along with another cigarette. He lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply. The snow had matured into a proper front. Flakes hit his face and melted. From the sound system, the trumpet spoke to a piano about sorrow. He brought the bottle to his lips and let the wine unfurl its ribbon over his tongue and through his teeth. He closed his eyes and could smell and taste the sweet oats they used to keep in a bag on the tack shed floor for the horse, the plum fruit of her nape, the crisp pine needle crushed between finger and thumb and inhaled up a nostril, and a dark chocolate finish. “Öküzgözü Boğazkere.” The design on the bottle was a field, and in that field the golden silhouette of a man walked against a black sky. He filled his lungs with smoke again, then tipped the bottle to his lips, and did not pull away until the wine was gone.

He stepped in his bare feet onto the wet deck, sucked on his cigarette, and threw the bottle with all his might over the corner of the next block, where it shattered on the street in a moment of racket. A dog barked. A porch light came on. He finished his cigarette and flicked it down into the inch-deep snow. The swoon took him in its swell, and he became sick, leaned over the rail, and expelled two bottles of wine, crackers, and cheese from his gullet. He stayed leaning over, saliva dripping from his nose and mouth, and tried to breathe and to decipher the Rorschach of his handiwork on the street of new-fallen snow.
***

At 6:15 in the morning, Doctor of Psychology Alan Smith left his man cave apartment in the small Rocky Mountain town of Ronan, Montana and headed due north on Highway 93 for fourteen miles to the Clear Hope Mental Wellness Clinic in the uppity, lakeside town of Polson. Ronan and Polson, sister cities in the cradle of Mission Valley, were bitter rivals on the football field—black and orange for the Ronan Chiefs, purple and gold for the Polson Pirates.

He sipped his coffee from a stainless-steel tumbler and let the self-driver (a gift to himself for making it to forty) take over as it synced with a little jolt into the automated grid of the road. He closed his eyes, fighting back the soft *thump thump* in his temples and the temptation to nap.

Over the radio, the calm, authoritative voice of FNBS host Raven Maddox read the news and commentary, a soothing salve for millions of liberal early-bird commuters across the country.

On his right the foothills of the Mission Mountains were skirted in snow. They rose from the earth and vanished into the low bank of clouds that had ceased their precipitation but held the world hostage should it get any colder.

In the broad ditch off the highway, fitful camps of climate refugees hunkered—perhaps still in sleep or warming themselves by internal heaters—beneath canvas tents butted up against un-gridded vehicles; sometimes a smokestack belched a plum into the morning dusk.

It was the twilight hour. He preferred its anonymity to the revealing light of day. He felt alone, incognito, only him and the occasional self-driving truck full of cargo but empty of any conscious human mind on its predestined course.

Going to meet the occupant of D-Pad, an unsettled sensation filled his chest. Why had Paul Murphy saddled him with this task?

“Raven,” he said to the AI.

“Good morning, Dr. Smith, PhD, winner of the Distinguished Dissertation award for the best dissertation in a class of seventy-five students. How can I be of assistance?” responded the car’s computer in a rather sultry, if robotic, deep fake of Raven Maddox. The journalist had been a sex symbol in her prime. Her reportage from the Korean peninsula as the North descended upon the South and the sea washed inward was renowned. She’d been fond of white dress shirts left open to reveal ample bosom, her wild, wavy hair blowing across her face, and her old-fashioned microphone held forth like a sword to the throats of warlords, dictators, and democrats alike.

“Uhh… Please read the file I received last night from Paul Murphy.”

“Of course. Shall I use my sexy voice?”

The fact that he had to ponder the question. “Professional voice, please.”

The computer read out in an academic tone, “October 29. Case report. Written by responding officer Gwendolyn Wolf of the Lake County Sheriff’s Department.

“Francis Builds A Fire, thirteen years old, was arrested Friday morning at Ronan High School for suspected sexual assault of a classmate, fourteen-year-old Amy Taylor, and the attempted sexual assault of a teacher, fifty-seven-year-old Dorothy Dale.”

“Pause.” The narration fell silent. “Project the PDF.” The case file appeared on the heads-up display of his windshield. He flicked to the front matter of the holographic document. The profile picture had been taken from a school photograph. The boy’s face seemed thin and undernourished, his eyes large and questioning, his long hair pulled back in a ponytail. He wasn’t smiling. The fields for his birthdate, home address, and parents were all blank.

“What’s the place of birth for Francis Builds A Fire?”

“Searching… Place of birth: St. Luke’s General Community Healthcare.”

“Legal guardians?”

“Unknown.”

Odd. This information should have been readily available in the school district’s files.

“Can you read the description of the assault?”

The computer continued: “Two witnesses were interviewed by the responding officer. Here is the quote from the first witness.”

“My name is Dorothy Dale.” A woman’s excited voice spoke too close to the mic. “I’m an English teacher here at Ronan High School. I teach freshman English. I came into class about 8:25 this morning and saw Francis in the back of the room with his hands on Amy Taylor. She’s Senator Taylor’s daughter, you know?”

“I’m aware of that, thank you,” said deputy Wolf. She had a soft, almost smoky voice.

“Amy was crying. I had to act quickly because of our no-physical-touch policy. I knew something was wrong. I shouted at him to get his hands off her!” Alan rolled his eyes. The teacher sounded like a spoiled child having a fit. “That’s when he came at me. I don’t know what he would have done. It looked like, you know, he was sexually aroused.”

“You mean to say he had an erection?” asked Wolf. There was a moment of silence. “You need to verbalize. This is a recording.”

“I don’t know. He could have!” said the teacher.

“And you think he intended to assault you?” said Wolf.

“I don’t know. I’ve been through the training module on male aggression. You can’t be too careful with boys his age.” said the teacher.

“You said he came at you? Did he run at you?” said Wolf.

“Why are you interrogating me? I’m the victim.” said the teacher on the verge of tears.

“Ms. Dale. I need—” said Wolf, but the teacher cut her off sharply.

“It’s not Ms. it’s Mx. Shi/hir, with an *i*—Okay? Get it right. He came at me. He came toward me. I was too far away from the panic button, but luckily another student stopped him. Mac Winesworth.”

Alan shook his head. Goddamn schools, they always overreacted. Once you passed through those doors, common sense and reason were replaced by politically correct groupthink. It could have been anything, a lovers’ spat, anything.

The computer narrated Deputy Wolf’s report: “The victim, Amy Taylor, was taken to St. Luke’s General Community Healthcare for evaluation and immediately flown to Helena. She was unable to give a statement.”

“What about the Winesworth boy?” asked Alan.

“Witness. Mackenzie Winesworth, age fifteen,” said the computer, followed by a teen’s deep voice—again too close to the mic.

“I came into the room when I heard Mx. Dale yelling and saw that fucking pervert going after her, so I took him down. He’ll feel that in the teepee for at least a week.”

Deputy Wolf: “How did you subdue Francis?”

Winesworth: “Clocked him in the face with a right hook. I went to State last year in boxing, and I work out with the Junior All-stars, so he went down hard. I kicked him a few times cause my dad says you don’t let a bully get back up.”

Deputy Wolf: “What makes you think Francis was a threat that you had to use force on him?”

Winesworth: “Oh, he’s a weirdo, alright. Always in his own world. Nobody likes him, and I guess now we know why—sexual problems. Can’t fix someone with sexual problems. Pastor Tony says you gotta put a bullet in their head.”

“Jesus Christ,” Alan muttered. “Are there any more statements?”

“No further statements,” the computer replied.

“Have charges been filed?”

“Charges should be filed by noon today, pending primary mental health evaluation.”

“Ethnicity of the people in this report?”

“Victim: Amy Taylor, Caucasian. Witness: Mackenzie Winesworth, Caucasian. Witness: Dorothy Dale, Caucasian. Perpetrator: Francis Builds A Fire, Native American. Enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Parents’ identities are absent.”

Due to the Escape pandemic and the refugee crisis, orphaned, even homeless, children were a common issue across the United States and the globe at large.

“Why aren’t the names of Builds A Fire’s parents listed?”

“Authorized redaction.”

“Authorized by who?”

The computer did not respond.

Racial tensions in Ronan were long-simmering but had escalated in recent years. Most of the problems originated from disputes over water rights between White farmers and the tribe, that was, by treaty, in charge of the Mission Valley’s water works. When Knutson came into office and declared such resources a strategic asset, the pressure cooker started to rattle.

In the intervening years, the price of water climbed. As it got more expensive, White nationalist groups began to come out of the woodwork. Of course, they were always there, but now they were asserting a presence in the Mission Valley. They would guard irrigation ditches with hunting rifles to block the ditch rider from turning off the water. They gained a Robin Hood mystique with some of the locals. Many businesses displayed covert symbols of White power in their windows. Each January 6th the local militia, the High Mountain Rangers, and other far-right groups would boldly march down Ronan’s Main Street, showing off their guns, tattoos, and bad haircuts.

There was even a crypto supremacist organization in the local high schools, Pastor Tony’s Junior All-Stars, the child-friendly version of Pastor Tony’s Boys. It masqueraded as a fitness club, but curiously, all the members were lily-white.

Pastor Tony, the moral compass of conservative America, was a steroid-enhanced mountain of a man whose vehement sermons were tinged with innuendos of supremacy and an Old Testament view of how the world should be. No expense was spared as he took his message to the metaverse. Among his many lunatic claims was that a certain variety of AI had a soul. It was not uncommon to see a group of Pastor Tony’s Boys standing on a street corner wearing their VR glasses and preaching up a storm to a virtual stadium of bots.

“Did the police find any signs of sexual assault?”

“No evidence of physical or sexual assault can be confirmed at this time,” said the computer.

“End session.”

The computer-generated voice went silent to be replaced by Raven Maddox.

Hi all, woman in her 20s here. Thought I’d ask this question to gain some perspective in hindsight. If you have a crush on him and there’s some interest on his end and he asks you out but it’s still within a university context where people are talkative and friendly with everyone, is it a date? (I ask because in my introverted delusional bubble I could think whatever I want being blinded by infatuation and excitement, so I seek a third person assessment:D)

I’ll explain for context. Reflecting back on my first “date” ever at 20yo, til this day it’s unclear whether it was one or not. I guess date means different things to different people. So I’ve had a crush on him for 2-3 months and he was in my class at university. We were talking on WhatsApp for group projects and when we would meet in person during lectures the communication was getting stronger both in person and online. But tbh knowing him it’s still blurry as to whether it was a date or not back then since he was the typical extroverted kind that had large friend groups, talked and was friendly with everybody. He kept insisting to go have beer/coffee and celebrate that we passed a very difficult course. We went at an outdoor café/pub/garden under a castle in the evening with light bulbs on trees, very fancy decor and overall lovely vibes. 
Our hangout/date lasted 7 hours and he was mesmerised, didn’t wanna go home, was staring at me almost with sparkles in his eyes, constantly smiling (I had never seen him smile THIS MUCH in person at school). If I didn’t remind him that the last bus leaves at 11pm he wouldn’t have left. Immediately when we parted ways he texted the aftermath text that he had a great time and thanked me.

You might think this is obvious, but it’s not that clear since he talked and would hang out with girls as friends and in general he was very popular and had a loooot of friends (guys and girls) and was very extroverted constantly surrounded by people.

Our group are in the library researching the holt family to see how steven holt could have gotten his hands on a magical paintbrush a fellow student receives a phone call. She's a journalism student who runs the student paper 'the crows eye' and she's received a hot tip. Sal Vanderholt sees the group after the call and ask that they accompany her encase of funny business and there's a trip to the pizza barn in it for them if they agree. 

  
On the way she explains that some animal attacks have been occurring on campus and someone, Mark, have said he knows what's causing it. A chupacabra! For $200 he says he has proof and bring a camera at midnight. 

Sal goes ahead and the rest hide in a bush nearby. Tied to a street lamp is a small ferret shivering in fear. Then Sal with her camera and Mark wearing a long coat and a t shirt that says dig this with a middle finger. He smells hungover even from this distance. 

A Gray shape blurs out of the underbrush and goes straight for the ferret. Deciding he is the real threat the group shoots Mark 'in the shoulder' the dice explode and Mark is in serious trouble. Lucy heart the cheerleader grabs hold of the creature (ewwww) they put their pistol to its head and kill it. 

Its blood glows green in the dark then fades. They take Sals camera from her by force and stabilise Mark. Luckily the bullet went through his shoulder. They put him and the dead thing in the car and drive to the hospital. (They wanted to keep the ferret but it....escaped in the confusion. Yes it bite through a steel chain. No it wasn't a supernatural ferret just really scared)

They see the baboon has an autopsy scar meaning it was, at some point, dead and has a tag for ETU biomedical. It's past midnight but they decide to go there next after dropping Mark off at the  Pinebox hospital sacred heart. 

They building is being refurbished so it open to the public but there is a light on. They rush in guns drawn and see its a a gas lamp. Someone has set up a mini lab in the  building. There's notes too complex to understand and several empty cages. Also a phone. Its 1985 so there is no dial 69 but they are able to dial the most commonly used number. It dials to Sara Stalinski and confused older women who asks if they are marks friends?

Using an incredible persuasion skill and the bad connection to convince the women that one of them IS mark they get the address of the bar he spends his time. Sticks.

At the bar they bribe the barman to give them the lowdown on mark. Hes a loser who lives with his mom who incredibly has a sweet, lovely if a bit sad girlfriend Julie Alvereze whose a 4th year medical student.

Its now 2am so they go to sleep and wake up early the next morning and feed Pumpkin the cat. 

They head straight for the lab and find Julie there arguing with mark who 'discharged' himself from the hospital. They arrive just as the argument reaches its peak and Mark knocks her down and pulls out the syringe of green fluid he swiped from her lab. It seems he was going to make some money by injecting some of Julies dead animals with her experimental serum and make a quick buck by selling the pictures. 

Julie lunges for the needle the same time as Lucy the cheerleader there's a tussle and mark falls on the needle pushing down the plunger. Julie immediately panics. Its never been tested on live people!

Mark leaps up one eye bulging in green energy and his left arm devolving into a whipping tentacle and attacks. 

The fight is tough with many hits landing but doing no damage. Dana coffee asks if there's a way to reverse the process and lucy remembers there is an untested anti serum in the safe in the lab but no idea what might happen. Options are limited so they go for it. 

The cheerleader leaps onto Mark-things back Buffy the vampire slayer style and plunges the anti serum into his neck. He falls down the mutations across his body reversing themselves. Mark is unconscious but breathing.

Julie decides to burn her notes whatever she's created its not the death cure shed hoped for. They all go for pizza and Julie agrees to help them with their end of summer school exams in exchange for not handing her in to the police. 

  
They pass their exams with flying colours and next month they will be able to enter East Texas University!

As they celebrate someone approaches Julie at her home. Rather than burning her notes she decided to pass them on to someone who was always so interested in her work. Perhaps they can do something better with them

""Thankyou Julie"" the women says ""I'm sure I can find a use for this""

1h9hoyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1h9hoyg/lady_having_interest_in_you/,Lady having interest in you?,"Hello :)

I recently was invited to a holiday party and met a nice lady who is my age (23) and made small talk for a while until she left with other friends that she had came with. I ended up texting a mutual friend of ours to pass along my number as I was not sure the most respectful way to ask for hers, but the lady responded not long after to my suprise. I mentioned that I enjoyed talking with her and wished her the best with her exam finals and she said it was nice meeting me and hopefully we could get together after finals. 

My question is more or less, how to tell if a lady does have interest in you regarding a situation like this? Forgive me as I know this isn't a lot to go off of, but it has been since Covid started since I last had a girlfriend and I would hate to take this person's time if her replies are more of a friendly remark vs actual interest, as she is in university and I work 50+ hours a week.

We've texted for a week now and the conversations seem fine, usually it's about every few hours or so for replies but she's asked a few questions such as favorite movie, go to snack, energy drink choice. Some times there's been 16hr + gaps in conversations which I have been chalking up to 1. Talking with stranger 2. Exam / finals / studying for them, but I am beating myself up over re assurance she may actually have interest. As much as I would like to offer to go out for coffee as a break away from exams / studying, I don't want to come off rude as she said shed like to hang out after finals.

The last thing is maybe I am not with it when it comes to texting, but even though each of our messages are usually 4-5 sentences long, she has lols in every text and sometimes multiple times, and I cannot decipher if this is just a way to be friendly and not sure or if she may be shy, but it's got me, lol.

I appreciate and thank you to all who may see this message, and if you leave your input as well. I'd be happy to reply as much information as I can if needed, but just needed someway to ask, something.",1,1733660399.0,Crushes,0,0.99,False

Ergonomics is like giving your body a cozy hug while you work, especially when it comes to keyboards. You might be wondering, ""What’s that all about?"" Well, ergonomics, in simple terms, is the science of designing things—like desks and keyboards—so that they fit us humans better. This means reducing strain and discomfort while improving productivity. When I first laid hands on an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad, I had one of those “Aha!” moments where the light bulb flickers on above your head, you know? It felt like my fingers were finally dancing to the right beat instead of clumsily stumbling around.

Before this magical moment, I was battling a pesky repetitive strain injury (RSI)—you know, that nagging pain that feels like your wrist is auditioning for the next big horror flick. But after a few days with my ergonomic buddy, my discomfort started to fade like magic! The split design lets my hands rest in a more natural position, and the touchpad? Oh boy, it’s like my fingers found their long-lost best friend. 

The physical benefits were immediate: less wrist fatigue, no awkward angles, and a much more relaxed vibe while typing. I felt like I could tackle my to-do list with the energy of a raccoon after finding a stash of snacks. Who knew a keyboard could be such a game changer?

## The Touchpad Advantage

I can tell you, having a touchpad integrated into your keyboard is like finding out your favorite pizza place delivers free sodas – it just makes everything better! I remember this one time, I was working on a project late at night. There I was, hunched over at my desk, frantically trying to meet a deadline. My mouse had other plans, though. It decided to phase out during the most critical moment, resulting in an epic battle of me sprinting after it as it rolled under my desk. Spoiler alert: I lost that battle, along with some valuable time! Since then, I’ve embraced the magical combination of an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad, and it’s been a game-changer for my workflow.

Now, let’s talk touchpad technologies. There are mostly two types: capacitive and resistive. Capacitive touchpads respond to your finger's electrical charge, which means they’re super sensitive and can detect multi-touch gestures. On the flip side, resistive touchpads require pressure, which can be a bit of a workout for your fingers but helps when you’re wearing gloves. Each has its pros and cons, but honestly, having that built-in touchpad has saved me from more than a few mouse chase incidents. Imagine no more tangled wires or frantic searches! Now, if only I could figure out how to use that touchpad to make coffee…

## Size Matters: Choosing the Right Keyboard

When it comes to keyboards, size really does matter. I mean, have you ever tried typing on one of those tiny keyboards? It’s like trying to play piano with marshmallows for fingers! I remember my first experience with different keyboard sizes. I was on a quest—like a knight in search of the Grail, but instead of a fancy cup, I was hunting for the perfect keyboard.

At first, I tried a compact one, claiming it was “cutting-edge.” Spoiler alert: my fingers began to protest, sending urgent signals of pain after just a few minutes. As I ventured deeper into Keyboardville, I stumbled upon a mid-size option which seemed promising. It was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that wasn't too hot or too cold. But alas, it still wasn’t quite right. My wrists were beginning to feel like they were auditioning for a drama about arthritis.

Then there was the glorious discovery: an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad! Not only did it fit perfectly in my hands, but the wrist rest was a game-changer. It felt like my wrists had found their own cozy sofa. That, coupled with the adjustable height, made a world of difference. I realized that maintaining good posture is like finding the balance in a seesaw—too high or too low, and it’s all a mess. So, folks, choosing the right size in keyboards can make all the difference between smooth sailing and a rocky ride!

## Programmable Keys: The Power of Customization

Programmable keys can turn your ordinary work experience into a supercharged productivity machine. Imagine having a magic button right at your fingertips that performs tasks faster than you can say “I need a coffee break.” I remember when I first discovered how to customize the keys on my ergonomic keyboard. It felt like finding a secret weapon in a video game. Suddenly, all those repetitive clicks and tedious commands disappeared, replaced by a few easy taps on customized keys.

Creating custom shortcuts was a game-changer for me. For example, I set a single key to open my email app. Just one tap, and boom—my inbox is ready! I also programmed another key to insert my email signature, saving me precious seconds that might otherwise have been spent watching the cursor blink impatiently while I clicked and typed.

There are different software options out there to help you program your keys, from basic setups to more sophisticated choices. Some let you record macros or even create unique profiles for different software programs. Did you know that some programs even allow you to set up keys that perform multiple actions with one press? Talk about being a wizard of efficiency! With a little exploration and creativity, you can customize your keyboard to fit your workflow perfectly and grab back those lost minutes. So, give those programmable keys a whirl—they're not just buttons; they’re your ticket to a more streamlined day.

## Setting Up Your Ergonomic Workstation

Setting up your ergonomic workstation is like finding the right rhythm in a dance; it can elevate your comfort and productivity to a whole new level. When I first transformed my workspace, I didn’t just feel a difference—I experienced it in my bones. Here’s how I did it.

Start with your chair. Get it adjusted so that your feet are flat on the floor, and your knees are at about a 90-degree angle. Trust me, you don’t want to look like a flamingo while typing! Next, your desk height should allow your elbows to sit at a comfortable angle too—again, around 90 degrees. My desk used to be too high, and I felt like I was typing from the treetops!

Now, let’s talk screens. Your monitor or laptop screen should be at eye level. This means you don’t have to crane your neck like a giraffe to see what’s on it. A quick tip: place books or a sturdy box underneath your monitor if it’s too low. Just make sure whatever you use is stable—nobody wants a monitor avalanche!

Lastly, don’t overlook your keyboard and touchpad placement. They should be close enough so you don’t have to stretch your arms, creating a cozy little bubble of productivity. Trust me, with just a few adjustments, your workspace can become a comfort zone where your creativity can thrive!

## The Future of Ergonomics: What's Next?

I’ve been thinking a lot about what the future holds for ergonomic keyboards with touchpads, and let me tell you, the innovations brewing out there are, quite frankly, mind-blowing. We're not just talking about those same old designs with a few bells and whistles. No, no! I’m talking about an exciting shift towards smarter, more adaptive technology that can really change how we work and play at our computers.

For one, trends in ergonomic keyboard design are leaning heavily on integration. Imagine a keyboard that adjusts to your hand position automatically. Like, one minute you're typing and the next, it knows you’ve gone for a snack (don’t judge, we all do it) and adjusts its height or angle to keep your wrists relaxed when you get back. Pretty neat, right? Plus, there’s this growing emphasis on sustainability, so keyboards might soon be made from recycled materials, putting the “eco” in ergonomic. 

But wait—there’s more! Have you ever wished your keyboard could learn how you type and adapt its sensitivity? Well, it might become a reality soon. With AI and machine learning making waves, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a keyboard that becomes your personal typing tutor over time. What do you think? What’s the next big thing in ergonomic keyboards that will knock our socks off?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, an ergonomic keyboard with touchpad isn't just a gadget; it's a life-changer. It's been my companion in reducing strain, boosting productivity, and making my workspace a genuinely comfortable place to be. So, if you're ready to take the ergonomic leap, don't hesitate - your wrists (and your future self) will thank you!
