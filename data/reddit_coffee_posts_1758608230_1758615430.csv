Chapter 17: Furlough.

Kael sat on the bench, feeling like an exhibit in a museum of a life he was once a part of. The warmth of the afternoon sun was strangely alien on his skin, intrusive and unnatural, like the touch of someone long forgotten. In his hand, he held a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's. It wasn't about the taste, the bouquet of oak and caramel that connoisseurs praised. It wasn't even about the alcohol. It was about the ritual. The familiar weight of glass in his hand, the motion of raising it to his lips, the peaty, sharp liquid running down his throat, bringing a momentary, dull numbness. It wasn't about getting drunk. It was about the silence. The alcohol was like a volume knob for the screams in his head—the screams of people he didn't know and those he knew too well, the metallic clash of weapons, and the low, vibrating hum of the Plague ships' engines that still rang in his ears, even here, in the apparent, insultingly normal peace of civilization.

Only a week had passed. Seven days. One hundred and sixty-eight hours. Each one dragged on like a watch in the freezing cold. This was one week of the year-long furlough he’d been given—he and everyone else who had survived the hell of the ""Arrow"" battle group's expedition. A year of freedom that weighed on his shoulders like armor made of lead. What was he supposed to do with these hundreds of empty days that stretched before him like the barren, irradiated desert of Proxima b? His squad mates had their ways. They spent their time mostly drinking, smoking, and shoving every substance they could find into themselves to forget who they had become and what they had to do. Kael had tried, but for him, it was like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound. The emptiness was still there, black and hungry, devouring every attempt at normalcy.

Time to eat. The rumbling in his stomach was the only real sensation that reached him, an anchor in the physical world. He looked around, squinting against the sun, which seemed to accuse him for the very act of squinting at all. Across the street, the neon sign of a small Asian joint flickered with a tacky, red light, interrupted by a capricious hiccup. ""CHOJ'S NOODLE BAR.""

Chinese with rice and chicken. That would be enough. A simple objective. A simple mission.

The plan for the rest of the day formed in his head with military simplicity. Step one: eat. Step two: sober up under an ice-cold shower to wash away this sticky calm. Step three: go to a bar, a place where loneliness was the norm, not a deviation.

Maybe I'll fuck some cunt. Maybe I'll get lucky. The thought was as mechanical as reloading a rifle. A simple, biological objective, devoid of emotion, like a training exercise. It was easier than thinking about a future that seemed more alien than the landscapes of the planets he had fought on.

A final, long swig emptied the bottle. Kael stood up, his movements stiff as if his joints had rusted from inaction. Then, with a sudden, uncontrolled impulse that concentrated all his frustration, grief, and helpless rage at a world that ordered him to fight and then ordered him to rest, he swung his arm and smashed the glass on the sidewalk with all his might. The sound of the shattering bottle was satisfyingly loud, sharp, and clean. For one, wonderful second, it drowned out everything else.

The meal was good. The hellishly hot sauce burned his esophagus, tearing him from his apathy. Fucking amazing, he thought, forcing down another portion of rice and chicken, feeling sweat bead on his forehead. This was real. Taste, pain, food. Simple, primal things that made sense.

Suddenly, a shadow grew over his table. He looked up, instinctively reaching for the spot where his pistol should have been holstered. A woman in an impeccable, navy blue military police uniform, with sergeant's stripes, looked down at him. Her face was stern, with sharp features, and her eyes were as cold as ice drifting in interstellar space. Next to her stood her subordinate—a mountain of muscle in old-model Satyr armor, but without a helmet. His shaved head and thick neck screamed ""MP."" He looked like he was born to break people's necks for an improperly fastened button, and now he was clearly bored on duty. The giant wordlessly raised a scanner and began to pass its beam over Kael’s face. A routine identification procedure. The light was irritating.

""Is everything alright?"" the sergeant's voice was as sharp as a shard of glass from the bottle he had just broken. ""Was it you who decided to decorate the sidewalk? Are you on leave, soldier?""

The tone was accusatory, aggressive. She saw a common grunt making trouble while drunk. Another recruit who couldn't adapt and thought he could raise hell and litter.

""And how do you know I'm a guardsman?"" Kael mumbled, more to himself than to her. Another wave of fatigue washed over him. He felt like just collapsing under the table and falling asleep.

""The boots,"" she replied without hesitation, her gaze as piercing as a laser rangefinder. ""You wear them as if they were part of your feet. Even in civilian clothes. Your posture and the way you plant your steps give you away. As if you're still marching on uneven ground, ready to drop at any moment.""

Kael glanced at his worn-out military boots. He smirked crookedly. ""Ah, right.""

At that moment, the sergeant's massive partner touched her arm. His face, previously indifferent and hard as an armor plate, changed expression. He showed her a tablet. Kael saw his file appear on the screen: name, rank, assignment… and a long, scrolling list of decorations that looked like a system error. The sergeant's eyes widened, and her stern mask cracked with a quiet, almost audible snap.

""Corporal…"" her voice was now several tones lower, almost uncertain. Her rigid posture relaxed slightly. She went from being a cop to a subordinate. ""We apologize for the trouble. Nothing happened. Enjoy your meal, we won't disturb you.""

The sudden shift in atmosphere was so absurd it sobered Kael up faster than a whole pot of coffee. From a neighborhood hooligan, he had become a war hero in the span of five seconds. He felt a rising tide of irritation and embarrassment. This was worse than the accusation.

""I'm the one who's sorry for the bottle,"" he said, the words tasting strange in his mouth. ""Things have changed a bit around here since last time. And I think I've changed even more.""

The MP private, the same one who moments ago had looked at him like a bug he was about to squash, suddenly snapped to attention and extended a massive hand toward him.

""Corporal, may I… shake your hand? It's an honor.""

The sergeant, still stunned, joined the request, extending her own much smaller, but equally firm, hand.

Kael sighed. This whole charade was pathetic. He gestured with his head toward the chairs at his table.

""Sit down. Get something to eat before you start saluting a bowl of rice. I'm no hero. I just got damn lucky on Proxima b.""

And then the words started to flow on their own. He told them about the mission, and they listened as if it were the most important story in the world, setting aside their duties and their patrol.

""I got hit by the blast from a Plague grenade. Woke up, and the sergeant was lying next to me with a hole in his chest the size of a fist. Guts everywhere. I had seven people left from my platoon. Someone had to take command. And I was the senior rank.""

He paused for a moment, looking at the steaming noodles on their plates, which they had ordered a moment before.

""We took cover behind the wreck of a transporter. The Plague had us pinned down with fire from some ruined office building. We thought it was the end. Luckily, my sister, Lyra, is a hell of a sniper. And her… spotter and lover, Jimmy, is an even better spotter.""

""Lover?"" the sergeant asked quietly. ""But relationships in the Guard are discouraged.""

Kael laughed bitterly. ""Fuck that. After what we saw on Proxima, you can shove the regulations up your ass. The only thing that matters is surviving the next minute and making sure the person next to you survives it too. They saved my ass. And my people's.""

He continued, his voice growing more empty, more mechanical, as if he were reading an autopsy report.

""Then I lost two more. The Plague warriors ran out of ammo, so they just jumped them. Tore right through their powered armor with their reptilian claws. Hoplite armor didn't do a thing. They didn't even have time to scream. They’re strong, those bastards… In a Satyr, you wouldn't have stood a chance,"" he looked at the giant, suddenly realizing he didn't even know their names. ""What do they call you?""

""Andrew Koll, Corporal,"" the large MP replied in a low, rumbling voice.

""Sergeant Anna Biggs,"" the woman introduced herself.

Kael nodded, returning to his story. He told it with all the drastic details. About the sight of burned, torn bodies, the pervasive sight of blood and bolts of plasma fire. About the sound a bone makes when it cracks under a boot. About the six-hundred-year enslavement of the L'thaarr race, about their sad, large, warm eyes, and how, after being freed, they learned to laugh again.

""They liked us,"" he said quietly. ""On the way back, they were learning our languages. They loved Spanish the most. They said it sounded like music. I talked to them for hours. They told me about generations born and dead in captivity, about how the Plague fed them fear. About their homeworld before the invasion, which only the oldest consciousness copies remembered, stored like holy relics. They even managed to download them onto a quantum flash drive.""

He also told them about the first battle for the orbit of Proxima c, when their fleet dropped out of 0.5c right on top of them, at the braking point. About how he sat helplessly in the guts of transport number 9, listening on the intercom to the screams and explosions shaking the hulls of the ships that shielded them, praying to gods he didn't believe in. He spoke of the ""Raven"" fighter pilots, madmen who danced between beams of fire, and of the damaged carrier ""Atylla,"" whose Higgs engines were being replaced on-site with ones salvaged from the wrecks of destroyed Thor-class battleships—powerful, forty-seven-thousand-ton beasts, now just cold scrap.

The pair of MPs had become his confessor and psychologist in one. And they listened, moved, forgetting about their patrol and the broken bottle. At one point, the owner of the establishment, an elderly Chinese man named Mr. Choj, who had been listening to everything from behind the counter, silently placed a stout, unlabeled ceramic bottle and three small cups on their table.

""Dragon's Breath,"" was all he said, with a slight bow.

The Chinese moonshine burned the throat more than the sauce, but it loosened tongues even more.

At that same moment, thousands of miles away and entire stratospheres higher in the social hierarchy, in a sterile, air-conditioned room in New York, Admiral Marcus Thorne stood before the assembly of the world government. They were in the historic hall of the former headquarters of the disbanded United Nations, which in itself was an irony the Admiral privately appreciated. His face, displayed on a gigantic holoprojector, was focused, the lines around his eyes a testament to decades spent making impossible decisions. His eyes, however, glittered like steel.

""Ladies and gentlemen. Madam Chancellor of Earth,"" his voice was calm, but it carried the weight of a battle won and the gravity of the future. ""We were victorious. Battle group 'Arrow' has succeeded. But victory on the battlefield is only half the war. Now, we must win the peace.""

He paused, letting the words resonate in the tomb-like silence. He saw the finance minister, Jean-Luc Dubois, already nervously calculating something on his tablet.

""It's time to de-escalate. I propose an immediate forty percent reduction in industrial quotas for the armaments sector. Shipyards and weapons factories will return to producing civilian goods. People need new toasters, not more plasma cannons. They need hope, not fear. People want self-driving vacuum cleaners that don't get stuck under the couch, not a new generation of orbital defense platforms.""

""That's a drastic cut, Admiral!"" Dubois hissed. ""Our economy is based on…""

""On war, I know,"" Thorne interrupted him. ""And that's why it's sick. It's time to heal it. We're also easing up on the propaganda. I watched the news last night, for the first time in years. We've gone too far. I felt like I was watching television in old North Korea. We are ending this cult of personality and the eternal threat. Enough posters with my face on them; I look like I'm constipated. It's time to explain things to people and reward them for over twenty years of hard work, of denying themselves everything in the name of a war that was fought light-years from their homes. We must allow for partial freedom of speech. We must let them live again. These changes must happen quickly.""

His voice took on a harder edge.

""I also want to declassify all data on the battle for the Proxima system for the public. Publish the data on the L'thaarr race, their six-hundred-year enslavement. Reveal the truth about the 122 victims of Professor McKenzie's experiments, who sacrificed their minds so that we could disable the consciousness-uploading devices. To save the rest of them. We have invaluable intelligence from the L'thaarr about the Plague, and thanks to them, we've learned some of their technologies. I want to ensure that humanity accepts them and sees them as allies, not as another problem. They deserve the truth. Our citizens do, too.""

The Admiral sat down, and silence fell upon the hall. A heavy silence, charged with political electricity, full of unspoken questions and calculations. The Chancellor of Earth, Agnes Cerutti, looked at him with a mixture of admiration and dread. She knew he was right. She also knew he had just unleashed political and economic hell.

Down on Earth, Corporal Kael was just pouring the fourth round of ""Dragon's Breath"" for two MPs in a small, cheap diner, trying to tell them the price of this new, wonderful world whose shape was being decided right above his head. The alcohol and the shared story had created a strange, temporary bond between them. Kael looked at Sergeant Biggs, who was listening to him intently, her face no longer showing any trace of its earlier severity. He saw a person in her, not a uniform.

""What about you?"" he asked, straight to the point. ""You have a boyfriend?""

Anna Biggs blushed slightly, surprised by the sudden change of topic. Whether from the alcohol or a desire to keep talking, she shook her head.

""No. Not in this job. As MPs, it's hard for Andrew and me to find partners. Regulations advise against relationships in the Guard. There's always the risk of transfer, and relationships complicate the chain of command.""

Kael waved his hand dismissively. ""Don't worry about it. Find someone in less than three years…""

He trailed off, and they began to listen more intently. There was something final in his voice.

""What's in three years?"" they asked almost in unison.

Kael looked at them, and a shadow of knowledge appeared in his eyes, a knowledge heavier than all his medals combined.

""You saw my last name on the tablet. Thorne. It's not a coincidence.""

Andrew Koll frowned. ""Like Admiral Thorne?""

""Worse. I'm the son of Aris Thorne, the Guard's chief scientist. The one behind the drives, the weapons, and all the rest of it.""

Sergeant Biggs drew a sharp breath. That explained more than the entire list of medals.

""It's not a coincidence!"" Kael repeated, as if trying to convince himself. ""I can't tell you… ah, fuck it, I like you guys.""

He leaned over the table, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

""In less than three years, a fleet will depart for Habitat 1, to defend the first of the races on the Plague's list. Four hundred ships, including forty of the largest, two-hundred-thousand-ton transports. There's a chance you'll be sent. So live your life to the fullest, because the journey there at 0.5c will take about fifty years.""

The MPs' faces froze. Fifty years.

""Fifty years on a ship in the monotony of daily duties. Then decades building planetary defenses for that system and a possible battle with a Plague fleet. If you come back, it's another fifty years for the return trip. Though in my father's opinion, it will be a one-way expedition to establish a permanent base there for the centuries to come.""

He looked them straight in the eyes, his gaze cold and sober.

""So don't worry about the regulations and what's allowed or what's not. Because in three years, your life as you know it might be over forever. Your only home will be a metal can speeding through the void. And the only people you'll have are the ones next to you. So yes, Sergeant. Find someone. Or you, Andrew. Because you might not get another chance.""

Silence fell in the small diner, broken only by the sizzle of the wok from Mr. Choj's kitchen. The three soldiers sat over their empty cups, the awareness of the future—long, dark, and infinitely lonely—hanging over them. Kael's furlough suddenly seemed unbearably short. And their service—potentially eternal.

""So, esteemed MPs,"" Kael said, breaking the silence. ""After your 24-hour shift tomorrow you'll probably have the day off. Let's call each other for a beer."" They exchanged numbers and said their goodbyes. Kael thanked them for not arresting him.

Then he walked over to Mr. Choj and asked, ""You got any more of that good stuff?""

1nobjcf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nobjcf,DeLonghi Magnifica S (ECAM 21.116.B) – Coffee always watery no matter the grinder setting,"Hi everyone,
I recently got a DeLonghi Magnifica S (ECAM 21.116.B), but no matter how fine I set the grind and adjust the coffee strength, the coffee still comes out very watery.

The beans are definitely good – I’ve used the same ones in my old Jura J6 and they worked perfectly for both espresso and coffee. That’s why I don’t think it’s the beans.

I’m starting to suspect that the grinder on the Magnifica S simply doesn’t grind fine enough. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any tricks, hidden settings, or adjustments I might be missing?

Would really appreciate any advice before I give up on this machine.

Thanks!

1nobepp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nobepp/espresso_machine_for_weekend_coffee_1500/,Espresso Machine For Weekend Coffee [1500],"Hi all, currently my weekday coffee routine is a Hario Switch with the Kingrinder, been really enjoying it and the coffee is some of the best tasting Ive had outside of specialty shops. When I lived with my parents a few years ago they had a sage/breville machine that I got used to operating, and I quite enjoyed being able to make my own lattes/flat whites at the weekend that tasted good and was a fraction of the price of what it'd be in a coffee shop.

Have bought my first home, and looking to get back into some ""casual"" weekend espresso, and to be able to host some friends and make them coffee occasionally. From what I remember of the sage machine was that the milk frothing was fantastic, the grinder was kinda terrible, but if you dialled in a process well enough you could make decent espresso based drinks. I'm looking for basically the ""optimal"" version of this setup, likely a dedicated grinder (needs to also be good for brewing with the Hario), automated milk frothing isn't a must have as I am willing to practice and learn, budget for everything would be between 1k to 1500.

I'm a 29-year-old guy born and bred in this wild, vibrant city.

I’m a creative soul with a love for storytelling—whether it’s binge-watching indie films, getting lost in a good book, or debating the best Bollywood plot twists (90s SRK movies, anyone?).

Oh, absolutely—vada pav runs in my veins, but I’m game to try anything from street-side bhutta to fancy sushi dates.

1nobaqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1nobaqj/his_death_certificate_her_new_life/,"His Death Certificate, Her New Life","# Chapter 1: Chapter 1

 

My husband, Liam Miller, and I were married for five years. 

He was a smokejumper, killed in action during a wildfire that raged out of control. 

I was devastated. 

In my grief, I tried to end my life more than once, but Liam's family saved me each time. 

His twin brother, Caleb, brought home his belongings and stayed by my side while his family urged me to let go of the past. 

Liam's last wish, they said, was for me to be happy. 

But three months after his ""death,"" I discovered a shocking truth. 

He wasn't dead at all. 

He had assumed his twin brother's identity. 

He’d spent every moment at the side of his brother's widow, Olivia Hayes. 

He confessed, claiming it was all to protect Olivia and her unborn child. 

He swore he’d explain everything and bring me home after the baby was born. 

But for Olivia's safety, he asked me to move out. 

Don't come for me, Liam. 

I'm never coming back. 

———————— 

1 

My fifth suicide attempt failed, just like the others, leading to a complete breakdown. 

The love of my life, Liam Miller, was gone. 

My world had lost its meaning. 

That night, I drove to the memorial grove for fallen firefighters. 

I needed to see him, even if it was just his name etched onto a cold, metal plaque. 

Just as I reached the entrance, I heard a familiar voice. 

It was my mother-in-law, Sharon Miller. 

""Liam, are you sure you want to keep up this charade?"" Sharon asked. 

""I have no choice, Mom. Olivia just lost her husband, and she’s desperate to have Caleb's baby. If she finds out the truth now, she'll shatter. I don't think she could survive it."" 

""But Chloe will find out sooner or later. What are you going to do then?"" Sharon questioned. 

I froze on the spot. 

What were they talking about? Liam was dead… wasn't he? And who was impersonating whom? 

""Olivia just lost her husband, Mom! How can you tell me not to worry about her? Once she has the baby, she'll have something to live for. Then I'll tell Chloe the truth. I'm sure she'll understand."" 

They were talking about Olivia Hayes, the wife of Liam's brother, Caleb Miller. 

Sharon’s voice was laced with desperation. ""Even so, you shouldn't be impersonating Caleb! Chloe is already heartbroken. Have you ever considered the agony she’ll feel when she finds out that you, her husband, are not only alive but have been pretending to be Caleb just to stay by Olivia's side?"" 

Pretending to be Caleb? 

My mind went blank. 

And then I understood. 

The one who died was Caleb. 

For the past three months, Liam had been pretending to be his dead brother. 

A bone-deep chill shot through me, as if I’d been plunged into a frozen lake. 

Liam and Caleb were identical twins. 

They looked exactly alike. 

Even Sharon got them mixed up sometimes. 

I had never imagined Liam would use that to deceive me. 

Recalling his coldness toward me and his devotion to Olivia these past three months, my heart twisted in a vise-like grip. 

Once, he had been so tender with me, too. 

From the day we met, he had cherished me. 

Every moment of our marriage had been filled with love and passion. 

Now, he was treating me like this. 

He had been deceiving me all along. 

My mind reeling, I stumbled back to my room and collapsed onto the floor. 

I thought this was my home, but Liam had destroyed it with his own two hands. 

Finally, I dialed a number. 

I called my parents in Seattle—Richard Lancaster and Eleanor Vance. 

""Chloe, how have you been?"" my mother's warm voice filled the line. 

""Your mother and I miss you terribly. When are you coming back to see us?"" my father added. 

Hearing their voices, my eyes instantly welled with tears. 

Separated from my parents as a child, I had only reunited with them two years ago. 

I was the long-lost daughter of the Lancaster family, renowned art collectors in Seattle. 

But I loved Liam too much to leave the small Oregon town he called home, so I’d never told him I had found them. 

Who could have known he would treat me this way... 

""Mom, Dad, I…"" I couldn't find the words. Finally, I just choked out, ""Mom, Dad, I miss you. I don't want to be alone anymore. I want to come home."" 

My parents on the other end of the line were ecstatic. 

They immediately said they would arrange everything and wait for my return. 

Liam and I met five years ago. 

At the time, I had just returned from studying art restoration in Europe and had no interest in romance. 

When he asked me out, I flatly refused. 

He didn't push. 

Instead, he quietly watched over me. 

He'd appear with a hot coffee just as I finished my morning run. 

On rainy days when I'd forgotten an umbrella, he’d appear like magic outside my studio to walk me home. 

When I was sick, he stayed by my side, tending to my every need. 

Slowly, he melted my heart. 

When he confessed his feelings again, I said yes. 

When he learned I had been separated from my family as a child and had grown up alone, he held me tight and promised to give me a home. 

But now, this was no longer my home. 

Perhaps it was time to leave. 

Suddenly, Liam walked into my room. 

He frowned. ""Chloe, who were you on the phone with? I heard you mention Seattle. Where are you going?"" 

I sucked in a sharp breath, swallowing the pain. ""What are you talking about? I didn't say anything about Sea— I'm not going anywhere. I was just going for a walk."" 

Liam looked at me suspiciously. ""Tell me the truth. I know Liam's death has been hard on you, but you need to take care of yourself. His last wish was for you to be happy."" 

""If you want to go somewhere, just wait. When I’m free, I’ll take you myself. Just… don't do anything foolish again."" 

I nodded in silence. 

Liam was about to say more when Olivia walked out of her room, her face pale. 

She clutched her stomach and cried out, ""My stomach hurts so much, Caleb, and I'm bleeding…"" 

Liam instantly grew tense. ""What's wrong? I'll take you to the hospital right now!"" 

He swept Olivia up in his arms and rushed out. 

As he passed, he didn't even glance my way, just ordered, ""Chloe, come with us. You can help look after her."" 

I had no choice but to follow them into the ambulance Liam had called. 

On the way, he held Olivia tightly, his face etched with a frantic worry. 

Watching my own husband dote on another woman felt like a thousand needles pricking my heart.

# Chapter 2: Chapter 2

 

As soon as we arrived at the hospital, Olivia was rushed in for an examination. 

The doctor emerged and announced, ""Congratulations, Mrs. Hayes. You're one month pregnant. However, your condition is fragile, so you'll need to be very careful to maintain a stable pregnancy."" 

Olivia was pregnant? 

I stood there, stunned, while a look of pure joy lit up Liam's face. 

He gripped Olivia's hand tightly, exclaiming, ""This is incredible news! Olivia, we're having a baby!"" 

Olivia's face was also filled with joy. ""Thank you, Caleb."" 

Watching them, so close and joyful, a sharp pain lanced through my chest. 

Liam had once looked at me with that same devoted gaze, but now, it was all for another woman. 

""There's one more thing,"" the doctor said. ""The patient's blood type is a rare Rh-negative, and the hospital's supply is low. Is either of you Rh-negative? It would be best if you could donate blood for her."" 

Hearing this, Liam immediately turned to me. ""You're Rh-negative, Chloe. Please help Olivia."" 

I was floored. 

I never imagined he would ask such a thing of me. 

""I..."" 

Liam cut me off. ""Chloe, I know this is a lot to ask, but Olivia is so weak. If she doesn't get a transfusion soon, she and the baby could both be at risk. Please, save her! I swear I'll make it up to you."" 

Seeing the desperate plea in his eyes, my heart filled with a profound bitterness. 

He had once treated me like a precious treasure, but now, he was begging me to donate blood for his and another woman's child. 

How ironic. 

But I still agreed. 

After all, an innocent life was at stake. 

Giving a little blood was nothing. 

What truly broke my heart was his attitude. 

""Fine. I'll donate."" 

Liam froze for a moment. 

He didn't seem to expect me to agree so easily. 

""Thank you, Chloe! You're so kind!"" 

He looked at me gratefully. 

I caught a flicker of guilt in his eyes, but what did it matter? 

I had already given up on him. 

I lay on the hospital bed as the doctor drew my blood. 

Watching it drain from my body, my heart felt as cold as ice. 

The last time I lay here was after a car accident. 

Liam had rushed me to the hospital in a panic. 

Before the surgery, he held my hand, his eyes filled with tears. ""My love,"" he’d whispered, ""I swear I will never let you get hurt again."" 

Now, he had shattered that vow himself. 

After donating blood, I went home alone. 

The house was empty. 

Liam was still at the hospital with Olivia. 

It was as if he had completely forgotten I existed. 

A few days later, Olivia was discharged. 

Liam brought her home and doted on her, not even letting her pour a glass of water for herself. 

He beamed as he told the neighbors he was going to be a father, basking in the glow of his new role. 

Watching their happiness, my heart ached with a bitter, twisting pain. 

I had imagined having a child with Liam countless times, picturing our happy family of three. 

That dream was now shattered into a million pieces. 

To thank me, Olivia suggested taking me out to dinner. 

""Thank you so much, Chloe. If it weren't for you, the baby and I might not have made it,"" Olivia said, holding my hand. 

On her wrist was a bracelet Liam had woven for her by hand. 

I forced a smile. ""It's all right. It was the least I could do."" 

At the restaurant, Liam took the menu and ordered all of Olivia's favorite dishes. 

Throughout the dinner, he peeled shrimp for her and placed choice morsels on her plate. 

He had completely forgotten I was there. 

Not wanting to watch their affectionate display, I lowered my head and quietly picked at my food. 

Suddenly, I felt a wave of suffocation. 

My throat felt like it was closing up, my skin began to itch, and my breathing became ragged. Then I collapsed to the floor. 

My vision tunneled as the metallic tang of seafood coated my tongue, and then everything went black. 

There was seafood in the appetizer. 

Liam had ordered the dish because Olivia liked it, completely forgetting that I was severely allergic. 

Liam let out a cry and rushed over to help me up. 

However, Olivia clutched her stomach and cried out, ""Caleb! My stomach hurts so much..."" 

At her cry, Liam shoved me aside to catch her. ""What's wrong, Olivia? Are you okay?"" he asked, sweeping her into his arms and bolting from the restaurant without a second glance in my direction. 

I watched them leave, my heart aching to the point of numbness. 

Before I lost consciousness, I heard the distant wail of an ambulance. 

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. 

There was no one beside me. 

Only the medical equipment blinked quietly in the dark. 

Liam and Olivia hadn't come to see me. 

It was as if I didn't exist at all.

# Chapter 3: Chapter 3

 

I signed my own discharge papers. 

Just as I reached the hospital entrance, I saw Liam. 

He was gently supporting Olivia, his face a mask of deep concern. 

When he saw me, a flicker of embarrassment crossed his face, but he quickly composed himself. ""Chloe, you're discharged?"" 

I nodded without speaking. 

He shot me a quick glance before his gaze snapped back to Olivia. 

""Be careful, Olivia. Don't fall."" 

Hearing his gentle tone, I felt a sharp sting. 

He used to be like that with me. 

But now, Olivia was the center of his world. 

Not wanting to look at them for another second, I turned and walked away. 

On my way home, I passed a few neighbors and overheard their chatter. 

""Olivia really married a good husband. Ever since she got pregnant, Caleb has been spoiling her rotten!"" 

""Poor Chloe. A widow so young. And no one to even look after her in the hospital."" 

My nose stung, and I fought back tears. 

They were right. 

From the moment Liam decided to deceive me, I had lost my husband. 

That night, Liam suddenly came back. 

He placed some bottles of supplements on the table. ""Chloe, I bought these for you."" 

I thanked him curtly, feeling nothing but a vast emptiness inside. 

I no longer needed his concern. 

Suddenly, the world started spinning, and I fainted. 

I don't know how much time passed. 

When I woke up, I was back in the hospital. 

Liam looked relieved. 

He rushed over, held me tight, and exclaimed, ""Chloe! You're finally awake! Thank God!"" 

His voice was thick with emotion. 

It sounded like he had been worried sick. 

I could feel his body trembling against mine. 

I was about to speak when he suddenly cupped my face and moved to kiss me. 

I shoved him away and looked at him coldly. ""Be careful, Caleb."" 

He froze, his expression faltering. ""What did you just call me?"" 

A flash of panic crossed his eyes before he hastily corrected himself. ""I'm sorry, Chloe. I... I got confused for a second. I thought you were Olivia."" 

With that, he hurried out of the ward. 

Of course, I knew he hadn't mistaken me for someone else. 

He was just acting. 

Watching his fleeing figure, the last shred of hope in my heart was extinguished. 

The man I had once loved so deeply was now nothing more than a stranger. 

Back home, I lay in bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. 

Suddenly, my phone rang. 

It was my mom. 

""Chloe, I'm sending someone to pick you up in three days. Are you ready?"" Mom asked, her voice full of concern. ""We've already tidied up your room. We're just waiting for you to come home."" 

I almost burst into tears. ""I miss you guys too. Yes, I'm almost ready. I can leave in three days."" 

I had just hung up when the bedroom door was suddenly pushed open. 

Liam strode in, his face thunderous. ""You're leaving? Where are you going?"" 

I frowned and ignored him. But he snatched my phone and demanded, ""Were you contacting those friends of yours again? How many times have I told you not to hang out with those shady people!"" 

I snatched my phone back, shouting, ""What right do you have to dictate my life? I'm not your property! You've had me locked up in this house ever since I got out of the hospital."" 

""You won't let me go to my studio or even see my friends! How far are you planning to push me?"" 

Liam was stunned. 

Panic flashed in his eyes, but he quickly regained his composure. ""Chloe, I'm doing this for your own good. You haven't fully recovered yet. What if you faint outside again?"" 

I retorted coldly, ""You don't need to worry about me. You should be worried about Olivia. As for me, my husband is dead. I have the right to decide my own life!"" 

Liam stared at me, his expression a mixture of hurt and disappointment. 

After a long silence, he turned and left. 

I collapsed to the floor, crying silently. 

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. 

Suddenly, the bedroom door was thrown open, and a tall figure stumbled in—it was Liam. 

He reeked of alcohol. 

He was clearly drunk. 

He fumbled his way to the bed and gripped my hand tightly. ""I love you, Chloe. I really do. Don't leave me, okay?"" 

His voice was choked with emotion. 

I could feel the warmth of his palm. 

But I pulled my hand away and looked at him coldly. ""You're drunk."" 

He shook his head, his eyes hazy. ""No, I'm not drunk. Do you know how much I love you, Chloe?"" 

""From the moment I left for that mission, I've been thinking about you. Every single day, I just wanted to see you."" 

""But I couldn't. Olivia is pregnant. I can't just abandon her. Can you forgive me, Chloe, please? Once she has the baby, I'll..."" 

He didn't finish his sentence before he leaned in, trying to kiss me. 

I shoved him away and yelled, ""Caleb! Sober up! I'm Chloe! Not Olivia!"" 

Just then, I heard footsteps at the door. Olivia walked in. 

The moment she saw us, her expression twisted into a mask of pure venom. 

I quickly composed myself and explained, ""Caleb is drunk, Olivia. I think he mistook me for you."" 

""You should take him back to your room."" 

Olivia didn't say a word. 

She glared at me coldly, then helped the stumbling Liam out of the room.

# Chapter 4: Chapter 4

 

The next day, as I came downstairs, I ran right into Olivia. 

She stormed up to me and slapped me hard across the face. 

Caught off guard, I clutched my cheek and stared at her. ""What do you think you're doing?"" 

""Chloe, you bitch!"" she shrieked, her eyes blazing with hatred. ""How dare you try to seduce my husband?"" 

I frowned, correcting her calmly, ""You're mistaken. Nothing happened between Caleb and me."" 

She sneered, ""Nothing happened? Do you think I'm blind? I saw everything last night! I'm warning you, Chloe. He is my husband. Don't you even think about taking him from me!"" 

Before I could respond, she lunged at me. On the slick wooden steps of the lake house, I lost my footing. We both went tumbling down the stairs. 

I landed hard on the floor, a sharp, splintering pain shooting through my right leg. 

Olivia also lay motionless on the ground. 

Hearing the commotion, Liam rushed over. 

His face paled when he saw the scene. 

He ran to Olivia's side, scooped her up, and cried, ""Olivia! Are you okay?"" 

His voice was filled with panic, his eyes only with worry for her. 

He didn't even look at me. 

It was as if I were an insignificant stranger. 

Looking at him, a fresh pain pierced my heart. 

The man I had once loved so deeply was now so cold. 

I tried to stand, but an excruciating pain in my right leg pinned me to the floor. 

Liam, cradling Olivia, hurried away, completely forgetting about me. 

I lay on the ground, watching their retreating backs. 

Tears blurred my vision. 

A memory from five years ago flashed through my mind. 

Our wedding. 

He had knelt before me and vowed, ""Chloe, I swear I will protect you with my life. If I ever let any harm come to you, may God strike me down."" 

However, he was no longer the man I could rely on. 

I lay on the living room floor, enduring the intense pain, and called an ambulance for myself. 

I don't know how long it took, but the ambulance finally arrived and took me to the hospital. 

The diagnosis came quickly. 

My right leg was broken and required a metal plate to be implanted. 

After the surgery, I lay in the hospital bed, pale and exhausted. 

Liam walked into the room, his expression cold. ""Chloe, why did you push Olivia? She's pregnant! If something had happened to her, could you have lived with yourself?"" 

I was completely stunned. 

I looked at him in disbelief. ""You think I pushed Olivia?"" 

""Didn't you?"" he retorted coldly. ""Are you going to deny it? Olivia told me everything."" 

I closed my eyes, but tears still slid down my cheeks. 

An overwhelming sense of despair consumed me. 

I shoved him away. ""I won't admit to something I didn't do!"" I screamed. ""Now, get out."" 

""I need to rest!"" 

Liam's brow furrowed. ""Look, I know you're upset, but Olivia is pregnant. Once she has the baby—"" 

""I told you to get out! I don't want to see you!"" 

Perhaps he didn't expect me to be so furious. 

He opened his mouth, but ultimately turned and left in silence. 

I saw the apple he had peeled and left on the bedside table and, without a second thought, threw it into the trash. 

A day later, I arranged for an early discharge. 

Back home, I packed my things, ready to leave for good. 

I was dragging my suitcase toward the door when Liam blocked my way. 

""Where are you going, Chloe?"" he asked, his eyes searching mine. 

""Nowhere,"" I answered calmly. ""Just packing up some old paintings for a charity auction."" 

""Oh, I see,"" he said, visibly relieved. ""I know you've been through a lot lately. Just wait a few more months."" 

""After Olivia has the baby, I'll explain everything to you."" 

A few more months? 

I don't want to wait another minute, Liam. 

And your explanation doesn't matter to me anymore. 

""Okay,"" I replied coolly. 

I had just walked past Olivia when I heard her scream. 

I turned around in confusion to see her collapsed on the floor, clutching her abdomen in pain. 

""Olivia!"" Liam exclaimed, rushing over to help her in a panic. 

""What's wrong? Are you in pain?"" 

Olivia gritted her teeth, glared at me, and said, ""It was Chloe… she pushed me…"" 

""What?"" Liam's head snapped up, his eyes glaring at me with raw fury. ""What did you do, Chloe?"" 

I insisted, shocked, ""I didn't! She fell on her own!"" 

However, Liam refused to listen. ""You've gone too far, Chloe! Olivia is pregnant! How can you be so cruel? Why do you keep hurting her?"" 

Liam, the man who once loved me with his entire being, would rather believe her lies than a single word from me. 

A cold numbness spread through me. 

I lowered my head and said coldly, ""Since you believe her, I have nothing more to say."" 

""You…"" Liam seemed not to have expected that. He was at a loss for words for a moment, then reined in his anger and said, ""Chloe, it's best if you move out immediately."" 

I pursed my lips and replied, ""Fine."" 

He glanced at me and continued, ""After Olivia has the baby, I'll bring you back. Your presence is threatening her life right now."" 

""Okay,"" I nodded. 

But in my heart, I thought, You won't have to bring me back. 

I will never come back here again. 

I left without looking back. 

A new life was waiting for me at my destination, along with my loving family—my parents and my brother. ",1,1758613774.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I finally found two shades that not only *last* but also make a bold autumn statement:

💋 [**beMineral Lip Kit in Red Poppy**](https://moodmineral.am/bemineral-bebeautiful-lips-kit-red-poppy)

A bright, classic red that feels creamy going on but sets in place beautifully. The matching liner keeps everything sharp and prevents that dreaded feathering when the wind blows hair across your face. It’s chic and timeless — perfect for an evening glass of wine near Cascade.

💋 [**beMineral Lip Kit in Coral Red**](https://moodmineral.am/bemineral-bebeautiful-lips-kit-coral-red)

This one leans a little warmer, almost with a subtle orange undertone. It’s bold but playful, great for daytime strolls down Northern Avenue or weekend brunch. Same creamy texture, same long-lasting comfort.

Both kits come with a jumbo lipstick pencil, matching liner, and a sharpener — super practical. And best of all, the formula doesn’t dry my lips out, even when the wind tries to.

If you’re in Armenia and looking for lipsticks that can handle our windy autumn evenings, these two are the ones to try. 🍂

1nob6ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1nob6ex/wellbutrin_xl_300_mg_dosage/,Wellbutrin XL 300 mg Dosage,"Hello.

I plan to talk to my psychiatrist to this in about 9 days when my appointment is due, but I have some questions for Reddit in the meantime.

I've been suffering from depression for about 6 years. I used Effexor and Abilify for a good portion of those years, but they eventually stopped working and did little to improve my mood. So, my psychiatrist prescribed 150 mg Wellbutrin XL about 3 weeks ago. I saw a steady improvement in my mood, but not enough. My psychiatrist increased the dosage to 300 mg a week ago, and I started feeling a lot better. My depression is 60% gone now, I would say. Moreover, I don't have as much of an appetite for fast food anymore, so I've been losing weight, and my activity/productivity levels have improved drastically.

However, I'm concerned about some of the side effects. In particular, I've read online that it can cause irregular heartbeats and high blood pressure. However, I haven't experienced those just yet. My psychiatrist prescribed 2 mg Rivotril daily to help alleviate some of the side effects and reduce heart palpitations (a problem I previously suffered with due to anxiety). I occasionally have very mild breathless/palpitations these days, but I've had those for years, and now is the mildest they've ever been.

The only major side effect I've experienced is a slight blurriness of my vision when I read, even while wearing glasses. This wasn't a problem before I increased the dosage. Besides that, though, this is the best I've felt in years.

\-Side note: I also drink coffee while on this medication. My psychiatrist recommended to do it 90 minutes before or after taking 300 mg Wellbutrin in the morning. I just drink 1 cup of coffee (4 teaspoons of Nescafe) a day 2 hours after taking my medication.

Anyone have any similar experiences with this dosage or know of any really bad side effects that popped up for them after a while?

Trained to take over from her Father, Zalia is shocked when her best friends turn against her, but Zalia has found the perfect way to get back at them. 



She will humiliate every male that thinks a female shouldn’t be in a Pack’s leadership and she will show her best friends what they will be missing in their leadership.



\*\*\*



**Zalia**



My name is Zalia, I am a twenty-six-year-old Lycan and the future Gamma of the Moon Stone Pack. Our Pack is the largest Pack after Mystic Moon Pack, the King’s Pack. 



Also, our Pack is one of the few Packs in our Kingdom that is a mix of Werewolves and Lycans, with my family being one of the Lycan families that live in our Pack.



Our current leadership each has a male and female Pup, but unlike what everyone seems to think, our future leadership will have two males and one female. Because I am the first born Pup of our Pack’s Gamma, it means that I will be taking over from my Father when they step down, something I have been training for since I turned fifteen.



As the future Gamma, I am smart enough to know how to take every precaution to counter any attack. Our Alpha has seen it happen over and over again during our training, that I have been putting the future Alpha and Beta on their asses more than once and I can see that our Alpha always had to hide his laughter at the embarrassment his Son faced. 



Luckily every Pup in his Pack was raised the same way, and no one got angry when they got their asses kicked by me. No one ever treated me differently because I am a female; they always listened if I pointed out where they made a mistake and most of our Warriors have grown because of it.



I am very contented with my position and my Pack. The only thing that annoys me is the Pack Visits we have to conduct every now and then: I need to tag along but no one in other Packs even realize that I am my Pack’s future Gamma.



When we arrive at Onyx Moon Pack, the Alpha and Luna are looking down on me, and they act as if I am the help.



This has been going on for a few years now and each time it gets more difficult to hold my tongue during Pack visits, but Alpha Brad had been very clear in his warning towards me: I am not allowed to harm anyone, just because I am better trained than most Pups I meet.



“You, get me some coffee.” Layla, Alpha Mike’s Daughter, is pointing me. 



“Why don’t you get off your lazy butt and do it yourself.” I growls at her and Donovan, our future Alpha and Gibson, our future Beta, start laughing their asses off. I doubt anyone has ever spoken to her like that and the dumbfounded look on her face is priceless. 



Her high pitched cry for her Daddy has me rolling down the aisles with Twilight, my Lycan. For Goddess' Sake, She is an adult and she should be able to fend for herself. 



Donovan stops laughing the moment Alpha Mike steps into the room, but there is no way on earth I can stop laughing and I don’t even try to hide it. 



Alpha Brad tries to talk to Alpha Mike in a normal fashion, but Alpha Mike is demanding an apology from us for making his Daughter cry, and we just stare at him in surprise. Donovan actually does apologized to her, but I flat out refuse to do it and Alpha Brad knows better than to try and force me. 



Alpha Mike is unaware of my temper and gets into my face, yelling at me to apologize to his Daughter. 



“Why on earth would I apologize to her? She acts like a spoiled six-year-old, maybe you should have raised her better.” I yell back at him and my Lycan Twilight nearly takes over control when he raises his hand, and he is lucky that Alpha Brad steps between the two of us. 



I would have kicked Alpha Mike’s butt if he had tried to hit me. Alpha Brad is very aware of the fact that I would have been able to take him down. 



This is why I don't like Pack visits so much, some act like everyone owes them something and as if they're so much better than the rest of us. On top of that there is the way they talk to anyone who isn't of an Alpha bloodline, would it hurt them to treat someone with some respect? 



Other than that accident, some even thought I was there because I was Alpha Brad’s mistress and some thought I was sleeping with Donovan or Gibson. None of them even thought I was there because I am Donovan’s Gamma.



I was surprised when Donovan didn’t correct them, but I blamed it on their Daughter who was ogling Donovan and her relentless attempts to get him to go with her. 



I am grateful that Alpha Brad instilled a great respect for the Mate-bond in all of us at an early age: you don’t sleep with everyone that is willing and you certainly don’t sleep with someone from your own Pack. 



I never slept with a male, even though many have offered but I shot each and every one of them down and I might have punched a handful of them for not taking a hint.



If Donovan or Gibson get agitated with females that can’t take No for an answer, they go for a run or to spar at the training grounds of the Pack we visit. 



I can’t do that because no one knows that I am the future Gamma of Moon Stone Pack and that means that they don’t allow me to train with the members of the Packs we visit. I don’t have an outlet for my frustrations during a visit. 



I always envy them because I can’t even go for a run without a Luna or Alpha talking down to me. No one questions Donovan and Gibson when they take off for a run or some training. 



That's why I chose to keep to myself during the visit—it causes trouble if I interact too much with those bimbos and assholes. 



Aside from my run-in with Alpha Mike, I stayed quiet the entire time, and he nearly paid the price for all the crap I heard during the visit.



Another thing I dislike about these visits is the fact that everyone tells me to eat less. I need the food to keep up my stamina and I need a lot of stamina for the patrols I run every day. I am a Lycan, it isn’t as if I will become fat and even if some of it sticks to my bones I don’t care.



Every Luna would tell me that I needed to watch what I was eating, that my Mate wouldn’t appreciate a Mate that ate so much, and that my Mate wouldn’t like a Mate with a size more. 



Ha, a size more. I have a size six and am proud of it, I don’t need to look like a stick.



Most of the Lunas are so thin I fear they would be blown away during a storm and still they complain about being overweight. 



During this visit though it was almost every female that made remarks about my food consumption and from the corner of my eye, I had seen Donovan and Gibson laughing, but I thought they were just commenting on the females through their mind-link. 



I am just glad that this visit is over, but unfortunately we have to attend to another grand meeting next: a meeting between the Alphas of all the Packs in the Kingdom and the Alpha King.



For over a decade I have been forced to come to this meeting. I didn’t have a choice though, our King demands that the future leadership of a Pack start attending after the future Alpha turns sixteen.



“Calm down, Zalia. You have two months of peace and quiet.” Donovan says teasingly. 



“Okay, was it necessary to remind me of that? As if I am looking forward to spending four days with them and no way to get out of it or to get rid of the frustration by running border patrol.” I growl.



**Chapter 2 The All Alphas Meeting**



**Zalia**



The day is finally here, note the sarcasm. The annual All Alphas Meeting has arrived and I have been training or running border patrol most of the time. Anything to keep my mind off the next four days.



We were taught that we needed to come to this meeting to learn how to get along with other Packs, but I think most Alphas use it to find a suitable Mate with a high rank for the future leadership of their Pack.



Because every Pup of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma that is fifteen or older tags along, just to make sure they get noticed by other Packs, and maybe a male or female takes an interest.



For our Pack it means that right now, our Alpha and his two Pups, Donovan and his baby sister Elinor are present, our Beta’s two Pups, Gibson and his baby sister Kali are also here, and then there is me and my baby Brother Slater. 



As usual, we are the first Pack to arrive, and a Warrior escorts us to our table in the largest meeting room.



More Alphas walk in right behind them and each of them has the Pups of their leadership with them. The males are dressed properly, but the females… I am not sure how to describe it. Some are wearing a skirt and top, but it looks as if they bought them a size or two too small as it barely covers their skin.



I wonder why their parents allow them to dress like that, my Father would kick me back up the stairs to my room to change. 



*“What is so funny, Gamma?”* Donovan asks through the mind-link and when I tell him my train of thought, Dad nearly chokes on the sip of water he took.



*“You’re straight I would kick you back up the stairs. I don’t understand their parents either.Why would they allow their Daughters to degrade themselves like that?”* Dad growls through the mind-link and we are all laughing as we see another female walk in, wearing a dress that leaves almost all of her skin exposed.



I scrunch my nose as I smell so many males and females covered in a thick, lingering scent and I nearly gag when a future Gamma sits down at the table behind us. 



*“Ugh, couldn’t he have showered?”* Kali shouts over the mind-link as a male sits down behind us, the scent drifting our way and I ask her how he is supposed to do that if it happened only a few minutes ago.



*“Can you imagine that you would be able to smell almost all of them covered in that promiscuous scent?And not all of them did it with their Mate.”* I ask her and every head snaps in my direction.



Our Alpha tells us that he feels sorry for us as we as Lycans, are more affected by it than Werewolves. 



*“Yeah, right. How often have you asked Dad if someone smelled of that scent that wasn’t his Mate?”* I ask him.



Dad starts laughing out loud and I know I hit the bullseye with my question. Kali and Elinor giggle as our Alpha turns slightly red. 



By the time everyone is seated, my Brother, my Father and I are breathing through our mouths and even the others have trouble breathing normally.



Today is for the King to welcome everyone to the venue and for everyone to mingle before the Pack meetings begin tomorrow, something I really dislike to be a part of. Most of these Alphas have outdated ideas about females or twisted ideas about fated Mates and I don't like the way they always stare at me or ignore my presence.



We all stand when the Royal Family finally enters the room and I see each of them scrunching their noses. *“Looks like they smell it too.”* Elinor says and I just nod my head. 



I had already seen the barely dressed female saunter over to a table near the stage and I felt sorry for whoever she came for. She sits down next to Mavka, the future Royal Gamma’s Mother, and both of them are talking softly as the female’s eyes keep wandering towards the stage.



Whoever she is after doesn’t respond and the scowl on her face becomes worse by the minute and I hope that none of the males in this room are her fated Mate. 



I hear Twilight, my Lycan, giggle at my thoughts. *“What about females?”* She asks and I am so thankful for the training Dad gave me or I would have been rolling down the aisles here.



The Royal Family allows everyone their five minutes of gossip. I never understood the meaning of it and I doubt I ever will. Why would you want to discuss which male could be your Mate? 



But then again only the future Royal Gamma is unmated and I actually feel sorry for him. *“That is why she is sitting with Mavka.”* Twilight states, *“She must be after her son.”*



**Deimos**



Four days of dealing with Alphas and Lunas that want to shove their Daughter in my bed, four days of my Mother Mavka trying to help those Alphas and Lunas. I am wishing I could just disappear while Goliath, my Lycan, is growling in my head at the prospect of the next four days and I know he will snap at our Mother eventually.



No matter what either one of us says to her, she keeps bringing females with her and I am glad the King told her she was no longer allowed to bring a guest when she comes over for dinner, but now she tries to force me to come home for dinner. Which I refuse to do and luckily I have my duties as the future Royal Gamma as an excuse.



My parents were chosen Mates and I know Dad regrets that he didn’t wait for his fated Mate. Mother started cheating on him almost immediately and when she was pregnant with me he refused to believe her until Doc could prove that I was his Son. After that he went to see the King and he was allowed to reject her on the grounds of infidelity. 



Dad raised me on his own, but Mother stayed in the picture hoping that I would get her back in to the Palace.  



It was my eighth birthday when I decided I didn’t want her there and she tried to persuade me by telling me that she was my Mother and that she loved me.



“Mother, you don’t love me. You just love the fact that I will be the next Royal Gamma and you want to take advantage of that status. The only time I see you is when you know that a lot of important Wolves and Lycans will be around, hoping you can find another chosen Mate to give you status and to cheat on.” 



Even Goliath hates her and her Wolf for putting their own needs before those of their Pup. Yes, even my Mother’s Wolf had been neglecting us, which is rare as a Wolf or Lycan’s instinct will always be to put their Pup first.



Ammon, our future King, pulls me from my thoughts as we walk towards the meeting room and we both stick our noses in the air, “Ugh, this is going to be one tough day.” He says as we both smell the promiscuous scent and I know it will hit us full force the moment we step into the room.



*“Why is it necessary for them to screw around just before these meetings?”* Asha, Ammon’s Mate, asks over the mind-link and Ammon decides to give her multiple reasons for it to distract her from the smell, unlike us she has more trouble hiding her disgust with these Wolves and Lycans and as the future Queen she can’t show those emotions outward.



I keep my eyes on our seats, but as every year I am surprised to see the females of Moon Stone Pack. They are the only ones that actually dress like leaders and I smile as I see all three of them doing the same thing I am. *“Asha, I see at least a few females know how to behave themselves.”* I say with a chuckle.



I nearly lose my temper when I see Mavka, my so-called Mother, at a table near the stage and besides her is a female dressed in… well, I am not sure what it is supposed to be. If that is meant to turn a male on, then I am probably broken and when I say that through our mind-link, Asha nearly trips up, it is a good thing Ammon always has a good grip on her.

**Chapter 3 Food**



**Deimos**



We sit down in our seats as the King motions everyone to quiet down and it takes a few minutes before everyone is quiet, except of course for a few females that think talking about whatever is more important. The King keeps quiet until a few of the Alphas finally realize it is because of the females with them that the King isn’t speaking.



Goliath points out that everyone at the table of Moon Stone Pack has a smirk on their faces and I have to stifle a smile as I look at each of them, *“The females are better at hiding what they are looking at than the males.”* I say to Goliath and we both chuckle as one of the females shoves her elbow into the side of the future Alpha.



I see the brunette smiling as she looks past us for a second and I wonder what is so funny, *“Someone is trying to get your attention, Son.”* Dad says through the mind-link and I already know what he is talking about, probably also the reason why the brunette is smiling.



The King’s speech is something we all worked on and we tried to get as many words in without actually saying a thing, it was good fun making this speech. 



Our Queen had made the start of the speech in which he welcomes the Alphas and Lunas for attending and Asha was the one to put in the Pups that were accompanying their parents.



We had laughed our asses off when she tried to find subtle ways to tell them to stop fooling around, but in the end she had managed to find a rather romantic way of putting the message out there. 



“Alphas and Lunas, your brought along the Pups of your current leadership and they will be our future.



A future we as the Royal Family have been granted already, we found a Daughter in your future Queen and our Son’s fated Mate. Something we all are longing for, something we are all waiting for and when we find our fated Mate we will become stronger and better.



Prince Ammon and Princess Asha had both been waiting for their fated Mate to step into their lives, and both of them want to express to all of you how grateful they are that they waited for the other to start their life’s journey, to have all the firsts as adults with one another.” He says.



I know he had struggled with that last sentence and he had thrown a few things my way every time I laughed my head off, he had choked on the words every single time. I hear Ammon laughing in our mind-link as the King looks from Ammon to Asha and we all see the look he gives Asha.



Eryx, the future Royal Beta, and I had taken it upon ourselves to put the meetings into the speech, but like Asha, we struggled to put down a lot of words that meant absolutely nothing and we needed help from the others to get anything on the paper. The King had said it was never easy to say a lot without actually saying anything.



At least we got the chance to practice, because in the future we have to do this for ourselves and it is not something I am looking forward to. 



“In the next few days, we all hope to have good and meaningful discussions about a variety of subjects, from training to security and from Balls to meetings.



We all hope that by the time each and every one of you goes home, that it will have been a fruitful event in one way or another and that we all can look back on a successful meeting.” He says as we see a lot of the Wolves and Lycans smile, but Asha points out that the members from Moon Stone Pack look as if they know that the King actually said nothing at all.



“Lunch has been served in the main dining room. I ask you kindly to stay seated until a Warrior comes to your table and he will guide you to your table in the dining room. It will be the table you will be seated at during every meal for the next few days.” He says before we all get up and follow him out of the meeting room.



We get some food from the buffet before we sit down and the Queen nods her head at her assistant, giving the unspoken order to let the others join us for lunch. The first Pack to be seated is Moon Stone Pack and they are at the table closest to ours.



The Alpha and Gamma sit down while the Pups walk over to the buffet and the brunette is joggling three plates with ease. I know everyone is watching her as she fills each plate with food, before she heads back to their table and places a plate in front of the Alpha and the Gamma and both of them thank her with a smile.



Many females look at their table with anger or envy in their eyes, but I know it is an unspoken rule that Moon Stone Pack gets seated near the Royal Family and I know they will not cause any problems with us. They like to keep to themselves just like we do.



Every female that walks to the buffet looks at our table for as long as they can, but none of us respond to it and I can feel their anger growing more and more. I see them walking in their high heels and it doesn’t look very steady to me, but with a plate of food they sway even more on their legs.



I keep my eyes on my plate as I hear Eryx chuckle when a blond nearly loses her balance. 



*“Who on earth let her walk off without a guard?”* Asha snarls through our mind-link and Sila, Eryx’s Mate, asks her why she is so concerned. 



*“What will happen if that plate of food flies out of her hand and onto another Alpha’s Daughter?”* Asha asks.



**Zalia**



This food is amazing and I can’t wait for everyone to have had their first serving. I need to get to that buffet again. Twilight agrees with me as a blond walks past us swaying on her high heels. 



*“Why would you wear those if you can’t even walk on them?”* I ask over the mind-link and as expected the males call out in unison, *“Because they think it is attractive.”*



I stare at each of them before I ask over the mind-link, *“They really think it is attractive that they look drunk?”*



Kali and Elinor burst out in laughter with me. Slater just chuckles as Dad shakes his head and Donovan just stares at me. And as always Gibson thinks my question is sincere and answers that they meant the high heels.



*“Okay, you did notice that the Queen is also wearing high heels, but she doesn’t walk around as if she is drunk.”* I say as I look at him and he finally realizes I had been pulling their chains. 



“Zalia, how did patrol go last night?” our Alpha asks to change the topic we are discussing.



“When I got there at eleven there was nothing to report, but about an hour into my shift, we had two Rogues at our eastern border. When they saw me they thought I was ripe for the picking, but Twilight decided to show them that we don’t back down from anyone and both were dead in a minute or so.



We didn’t have any other problems during the rest of our shift and before we left, I checked in with morning patrol, but between six and eight there had been nothing to report.” I answer him as I ask Kali through the mind-link if the buffet is finally free again.



She tells me that everyone has gotten their plate of food, but before I can get up my Dad growls at me, “Zalia, you are telling me you stayed out on patrol all night, that you haven’t slept at all?” He says and as I get up to head for the buffet I say, 



“Just like always, Dad. Why would going to this meeting need to change my routine? 



I didn’t ask to be dragged down here. I didn’t ask anyone to make up this rule that the Pups of our leaderships need to be paraded in front of everyone and I sure didn’t ask anyone to force the future leaderships to be present at every boring meeting.



Now, if you’ll excuse me or not for that matter, I need some more food before Twilight decides she is going to eat and then it won’t be from a plate.” 



I walk away knowing full well that everyone in the dining room heard his question and my answer and I know that is what Dad was going for.



I keep my eyes on the buffet, but I can see a lot of males staring at me and I know I will get a lot of questions during our mingling session after lunch. Yippie, already looking forward to it, Not. At least now all of them will know that I am a Gamma’s Daughter and that means that their attentions will most likely be far from sexual.



“You run border patrol often?” I hear the King’s voice ask as the entire room goes quiet and I turn towards him as I answer him, “Yes, Your Majesty. I run border patrol in the same shift as my team, just because I am the Daughter of our Pack’s Gamma doesn’t mean I have to act like a spoiled little brat.



I can take care of myself as I have been training since I turned seven and I started running border patrol when I was forced to come to these meetings. I told our Alpha if I was old enough to be dragged down here, I sure was old enough to run border patrol.



Just between you and me, Your Majesty. I think running border patrol is a lot safer than coming here.” I make a little bow before I head back to our table and I can hear the King chuckle behind me, everyone at the Royal table is chuckling and giggling.



**Deimos**



How does she look so good after missing a good night’s sleep? I always feel like crap after running patrol at night and I always need most of the day to sleep it off. Goliath is rolling down the aisles when she answers her Father and I hear Ammon laughing through our mind-link.



*“Dad, can we keep her?”* He asks and I know exactly why he is asking, she isn’t shy with her opinions. 



**Chapter 4 Unfriendly Looks**



**Deimos**



The Royal Family can’t talk like that, but luckily for them, we can and having her around would be so refreshing. The only answer he gets is in the form of the King getting up to walk towards the buffet.



She is joggling three plates again and from watching her the first time, I know which plate is hers, it is filled more than that of her Alpha or her Father. 



*“She needs it if she runs border patrol on a regular basis.”* Goliath says and the moment I hear her say that running patrol is safer, I know that I want to get to know her a whole of a lot better.



Maybe I can even convince her to stick to my side and chase away all the females that want the last spot within the Royal ranks. 



“Deimos.” Our queen calls out to me and as I turn my head towards her I know I am in trouble, “How is it that a Gamma’s Daughter from a Pack almost as large as Mystic Moon Pack can still function?



I mean, whenever you return from border patrol at night you need the rest of the day to sleep it off and she is walking around as if she just returned from a day at a spa.” Our Queen says loud enough for everyone to hear and I hear Zalia laughing at my expense, but I also take it as an opportunity.



“Your Majesty, I have no idea. Maybe Zalia is willing to keep me company for a while after lunch, see if I can figure out what her secret is or find out if she wants to become Prince Ammon’s baby Sister. After all he did ask if he could keep her.” I answer and Asha is in stitches as Ammon tries to object.



“Deimos, that is an excellent idea. If Zalia is willing to, of course.” The Queen says as she walks over to the buffet, she likes to get her own food whenever she can. 



“Of course I am willing to talk to the future Royal Gamma, Your Majesty. If I can help him figure out what he does wrong, we might be able to keep Prince Ammon from finding a replacement.” She answers.



My jaw drops while Ammon spits out the sip of coffee he took, and I can see that the King has trouble keeping a straight face.



“Your Majesty.” I hear Zalia say to our Queen, and we all look at her, “I think you need to check on your Mate, he looks a bit bloated.” She says with a straight face.



This time none of us can stop it as we burst out in laughter and I know that these few days will be very different from other years. I wonder why I never noticed her before. 



*“We were always too busy avoiding Mavka and whatever female she brought along.”* Goliath replies and I am afraid that he is correct.



Once everyone is finished with lunch, they get escorted back to the meeting room and I see that every table is filled with empty glasses and plates, some of them empty while others are still half full. I look at the table of Moon Stone Pack and not only is every glass and plate empty, they are also neatly stacked near the edge of the table.



We make our way over to Moon Stone Pack and it doesn’t take me long to figure out that Zalia is the first born to the Gamma, she will be taking over from her Father when he steps down. However, it doesn’t look like most males figured that out, and for a second born Beta or Gamma she would be a great catch.



Goliath growls at my train of thought and I chuckle as I realize he doesn’t like the prospect of her with another male. 



I step up next to Zalia to offer her my arm and I hear three males standing beside her growl, “Back off.” 



She growls back. “Do I have to spell out to you three idiots why Deimos asked me to join him?” 



Everyone stares at her when one of them asks her to please enlighten them.



“He is using me as a shield. He is the only one still unmated and that means the only one that might give a female some status. You and Gibson know this better than anyone, Donovan.” She points out and all three males stare at the floor.



“Sorry, Sis. It is just strange seeing you on the arm of a male, unless you are ready to smack him dead center to the ground.” The younger Pup says and Zalia introduces him as Slater, her baby Brother. 



*“Good to know that he is protective of his Sister.”* Goliath states.



Sila walks up to Slater and asks how serious he was with his statement. 



“I believe everyone heard her when she said she took out two Rogues last night. My Sister can defeat Donovan and Gibson and she has done so on more than one occasion.” He answers.



I stare at the 5”8 brunette by my side, she is wearing straight legged pants with a high waist and a short blazer that reaches her hips. A white tank top with scalloped edge and a V-neck under neath it, but I can’t tell if it is sleeveless or short sleeved and she has finished it off with black laced boots with a block heel.



The heels look to be about two or three inches and far better to walk on than the heels most females wear. She is confident as she wraps her arm around mine. 



“You will get a lot of glares, sorry for that.” I whisper in her ear and she giggles before she tells me she can handle it.



**Zalia**



I know I painted a target on my own back when I accepted Deimos’ request, but I am not one to walk away from a fight and it doesn’t matter if it is a physical fight or a verbal fight. Twilight doesn’t object when I wrap my arm around his and she just lies down in the back of my head, keeping an eye on our surroundings.



He wasn’t kidding when he said I would get glares and Twilight is on full alert as we walk further into the room. A female walks up to us to get Deimos’ attention which she doesn’t get. We both scrunch our noses at the same time and I wonder how long there had been between her leaving the dining room and us leaving.



“Hello, Deimos.” She says as she looks up at him and by holding her hands in front of her she manages to press her breasts together, making them almost jump out of her top. “I was hoping you could tell me a few things about what you do around here.” She continues. 



*“Avoiding females like you.”* Twilight responds.



She steps forward to try and place herself between Deimos and me, but Twilight makes sure I have a firm grip on his arm and she softly growls at the female. She turns to me with a shocked look on her face. 



“Sorry, my Lycan doesn’t like it when someone steps into our personal space.” I say loud enough for a few females to hear.



“Well, then maybe you should go back to your little Pack and leave the real males to females like me.” She says as she looks me dead in the eye, my Dad warns me over our mind-link to behave myself and I tell him I always behave myself.



I turn to Deimos with a serious look on my face before I ask, “What does an unreal male look like?” and I see quite a few Wolves and Lycans turn away. 



“I have no idea.” He says and he looks as if he is thinking about an answer to give me.



“I might have an idea, but I doubt it is a good idea to say it out loud.” He says while he still looks as if he is thinking about something. The moment the female asks him to say what he thought of, I realize he had been setting her up. 



He leans towards me as he says, “I think she meant her friend on batteries.” I know exactly what he means, but I really can’t help myself.



“She has a robot that works on batteries, that is cool.” I say as I look at Deimos and I hear a few Wolves and Lycans choke on their laughter, while Deimos is turning slightly red at my words. At least we got rid of the female as she runs out of the room with a face as red as a lobster.



*“Is it from embarrassment or from anger?”* I ask Twilight, but she is in no state of answering me as she is rolling around in my head. 



For a moment I think we will have some peace and quiet for a while, but I know it was an idle thought when Mavka approaches us and I feel Deimos stiffen beside me.

Obviously I make mistakes because I don’t know the best way to ring something up or there are questions for specific items I need to ask about (example, I just started working at a coffee shop and wasn’t told that I need to put in the system “room” or “no room” for cream in Americanos). This is both extremely frustrating for my experienced coworkers and me because I’m doing things wrong that I wouldn’t be doing wrong if I was just ✨trained✨properly✨

My genuine question is why do managers not train new employees? It makes no sense to me. Why would you give me to someone who is also making minimum wage trying to survive on the floor and then told they need to then do/teach the work of two people by themself. It’s not fair, and either way it makes business suffer in the long run (incorrect or inconsistent orders lead to customer dissatisfaction and make them not want to return, etc). That and also teaching standards of how they want things done. I’ve never been trained by someone who hasn’t said “so this is what you’re technically supposed to do, but this is how I do it.”

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time, I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face who looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.",2,1758613197.0,deepnightsociety,1,1.0,False

I've been trying ways to stay awake during lecture and coffee didnt even have an effect on me anymore and I stopped drinking it because it was too much sugar. My friend said I should try to pop a zyn before the class starts and he gave me a pack from his tin. He was taking zyn so he would stop vaping and thats his new thing I guess.

When class started I popped it in my mouth and it started tingling between my gums, I also noticed that strong taste of nicotine in my throat everytime I swallowed. After 5 mins I started to focus better, but after 10 mins I started to feel nauseated and light headed. This class was 2 hours long, I didnt have water and the AC wasnt turned on low and I had a jacket on. I started sweating like crazy and I felt like I was drunk. I didnt even get to focus on class because I couldnt hear anything and my ears were buzzing. 40 mins in I decided to take a bathroom break and went straight to the canteen and bought 2 bottles of cold water and a snack. I spit out the zyn in the bathroom and washed my face. On the way back I bumped into my research adviser and asked if what was the update on our thesis. I couldnt speak properly and said I told him I was feeling sick so he wouldnt catch on, idk if its illegal to take zyn in school but Ive seen people take it in class. 

I texted my friend who gave me one and he says he takes like a pack for very class. Idk how he does it and stays fine. I vaped before for like a month until I ran out of juice and stopped, I havent smoked either so maybe I was just couldnt handle the nicotine.

I now 38F dated a now 43M about 7 years ago for about a year and ultimately I ended it as I thought he was treating me like a throwaway. 
A few occasions towards the end he planned to meet up with an ex in another country. He also expected me to cook and make his coffee in a morning. 

That being said we work in the same industry, and have a huge shared passion as well as an interest in the naughtier side of things. We had a lot of fun together and laughed a lot. We did a lot of awesome things together too. He told me then he would probably never marry anyone as he'd cheat on them. 

He has suggested meeting up with me over the years and I thought it was it was to mess me around again. 

We finally met for lunch recently and he apologised for treating me terribly. He admitted he finds me attractive, he said had a lot of fun together and told me how much he liked me then and still has an desire to keep some things alive since it doesn't happen at home.

But now he's married and would like to have children with this woman.

She is pretty, skinner, has perfect skin and hair and is rich. But she doesn't share any interests with him. (He said he married his best friend.)
I feel rubbish knowing he chooses to share his life with her.

I feel like I missed out on a guy who has become a very decent man. He told me he still likes me, enjoys our company together and would like to see me more me over the longer term.

The story, as all of New York's elite knew it, was a tragic high-society fable. Eighteen years ago, Caroline and Richard Sutton's newborn daughter, Aria, was stolen from the hospital, replaced with another baby girl. That replacement was Evelyn.

Now, the real Aria had been found and triumphantly returned.

And Evelyn's expiration date had arrived.

This dinner wasn't a meal; it was a public execution of her identity.

Tonight, the silence was heavier than usual, thick with the cloying scent of lilies and the murmur of polite, predatory gossip.

The dining room of the Suttons' Manhattan penthouse offered a dazzling, floor-to-ceiling view of the city skyline, a glittering tapestry of a world she could see but never touch.

But tonight, no one was looking at the view. All eyes were on the girl seated at the head of the table, shimmering under the crystal chandelier: the real heiress, Aria Sutton.

""Daddy's getting me the new Porsche 911 Turbo S in Carmine Red,"" Aria announced, her voice a little too loud, a little too bright. She made a show of examining her perfectly manicured nails. ""He says a girl of my standing needs a car that makes a statement.""

Her friends, Tiffany and Brittany, a duo of sycophants who clung to Aria's rising star, cooed with practiced admiration.

""Carmine Red! It's just divine, Aria,"" Tiffany sighed, her eyes wide with envy.

Aria took a delicate sip of her water, her gaze sweeping the table before landing, with calculated disdain, on Evelyn.

Evelyn sat motionless, a perfect statue of indifference, her fork resting beside her untouched plate of seared scallops. Aria's smile sharpened at the edges.

""Well, one must be taught what true class is, after all,"" she added, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. ""It doesn't come naturally to everyone. Some people are just born in the mud.""

The jab landed, hanging in the air like a foul odor. Several guests shifted uncomfortably, while others hid smirks behind their w-ine glasses.

Evelyn didn't react externally. Inside, her mind was a calm sea. Mud? she thought, a flicker of amusement in her mind. An interesting choice of words from a girl whose grandfather made his fortune in waste management. She had learned long ago that reacting was giving them power. Silence, true silence, was her armor and her weapon. So she focused on the intricate patterns of the silverware, counting the tines on her fork. One. Two. Three. Four. It was a small, grounding exercise that kept her centered while the world tried to tear her apart.

The guest of honor, a real estate magnate's wife named Mrs. Davenport, a woman known for her sharp tongue and sharper jewels, was mid-anecdote about her latest trip to Monaco.

It was then that Aria saw her opening for the evening's main event. She abruptly stood up, lifting her glass of expensive Bordeaux, the deep red liquid sloshing precariously.

""Oh, Mrs. Davenport, your dress is simply stunning,"" Aria gushed, gliding closer, her movements a little too theatrical. ""Is that the latest from Chanel's runway?""

And then it happened. It was a masterpiece of calculated clumsiness. Aria's arm jolted as if she'd stumbled, but Evelyn, watching with heightened senses honed by years of observation, saw the truth—the deliberate twist of her wrist, the flicker of triumph in her eyes an instant before the act.

Red w-i-ne arced through the air, a perfect splash of crimson against the pristine white silk of Mrs. Davenport's gown.

A collective gasp filled the room. Mrs. Davenport looked down, her face a mask of cold fury as she watched the s-t-a-in bloom across the thirty-thousand-dollar fabric like a grotesque flower.

Before the older woman could even speak, Aria spun around, her eyes wide with fabricated horror, her finger pointed directly at the still-seated Evelyn.

""Evelyn! How could you be so clumsy?"" she cried, her voice breaking with practiced hysteria. ""You bumped my arm! You have to be more careful! Look what you've done!""

All heads swiveled. Judgmental eyes, cold and sharp, pinned Evelyn to her seat.

Mrs. Davenport's gaze snapped towards Evelyn, her voice dangerously low. ""Is this true? This gown is haute couture.""

Caroline Sutton was on her feet in an instant, rushing to Mrs. Davenport's side with a flurry of napkins and apologies. ""Eleanor, I am so dreadfully sorry! This is all my fault. Evelyn, stand up and apologize this instant! This is unforgivable.""

Evelyn remained seated. She slowly placed her napkin on the table and looked not at her accuser, but at the victim. Her voice was quiet, yet it cut through the room's tension with chilling clarity.

""Mrs. Davenport, I was not near her. My hands have not left my lap."" She paused, her eyes calmly flicking down to the floor near Aria. ""However, I did notice the leg of her chair catch on the edge of the Aubusson rug when she stood up so quickly. Perhaps she stumbled.""

Her statement was not an accusation. It was a simple, logical observation. It offered a plausible alternative, painting Aria not as malicious, but merely as clumsy and flustered.

The effect was instantaneous. Aria's feigned tears froze. She had expected hysterics or a cowed apology, not a calm, rational defense. ""That's not true! She's lying!"" Aria shrieked, her voice becoming shrill and losing its carefully constructed pity.

Caroline's face went from pale to crimson. The scene was spiraling out of control. In her world, the truth was irrelevant. Appeasing the powerful guest was everything.

""That is enough, Evelyn!"" Caroline snapped, her voice cracking like a whip. ""You will not make this worse by slandering your sister. You have become a constant source of embarrassment for this family."" She turned to Mrs. Davenport. ""Eleanor, we will of course cover the cost of the dress. And I will handle this. Right now.""

The finality in her voice was unmistakable. This was the moment. The excuse she had been waiting for. The chapter of the substitute was about to be violently closed.

The farce of dinner ended abruptly, the dessert course left to melt in the kitchen.

Caroline Sutton's fingers, adorned with a gaudy diamond ring, dug into Evelyn's upper arm like talons. She yanked her from her chair without a word and began dragging her into the grand living room. The marble floors felt like ice beneath Evelyn's thin shoes, the chill seeping into her bones. The guests lingered in the doorway, a silent, smirking jury, pretending not to watch the public execution.

""I have had enough of your ingratitude,"" Caroline hissed, her voice low and furious, shoving Evelyn toward the center of the room. ""For eighteen years, we gave you a life you could only have dreamed of. We plucked you from filth, gave you a name, a home. And this is how you repay us? By embarrassing this family in front of everyone?""

With a flick of her wrist, Caroline tossed a check onto the polished coffee table. It fluttered down, a flimsy white rectangle against the dark, unyielding stone.

""Five thousand dollars,"" Caroline said, her voice now rising, dripping with a contempt colder than the marble. ""That's more than your kind deserves. This is the last shred of decency you'll get from us. Don't be ungrateful.""

The amount was a calculated insult, a pittance meant to signify Evelyn's worthlessness after eighteen years of service as the family's stand-in, place-holder daughter.

Just as the humiliation was settling in, Aria rushed to her side, a vision of counterfeit sisterly concern. Her eyes were already welling up with glistening, fake tears, her acting skills far superior in life than they ever would be on a st-a-ge.

""Evelyn, please don't go,"" she pleaded, her voice trembling for her audience. She grabbed Evelyn's hand, her touch cold and clammy. ""I'll beg Mom to let you stay…""

She paused, looking around the room to ensure everyone was watching, letting the dramatic effect build.

""...even as a maid. You could still have a home here.""

The words were a stiletto, slid expertly between Evelyn's ribs. The humiliation was the entire point. The guests murmured, a symphony of feigned pity and hidden glee. Aria was solidifying her position as the kind, benevolent heiress, while simultaneously cementing Evelyn's status as worthless t-r-a-sh.

Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on the check. She felt nothing. The emotional calluses she'd built over the years were thick and strong. This was just the final, predictable scene of a long-running play.

Just then, a quiet presence appeared at her elbow.

It was James, the family's elderly butler, a man who had been with the Suttons for over two decades. He had seen Evelyn arrive as a silent, watchful child. In his hand, which trembled ever so slightly from age and nerve, was a glass of water.

He offered it to Evelyn without a word.

His eyes, clouded with age but clear with intent, were filled with a quiet, defiant kindness. It was a small act, a silent protest against the cruelty of the house he served. It was a gesture that said, I see you.

Caroline's eyes narrowed, her scowl deepening at the butler's insubordination. ""James! Get back to the kitchen.""

But James didn't retreat. He held his ground, his gaze steady on Evelyn, waiting until her fingers wrapped around the cool glass.

Evelyn met his eyes, and for the first time that night, a flicker of genuine warmth touched her frozen interior. She gave him a barely perceptible nod. A silent thank you that conveyed more than words ever could. It was a glimmer of humanity in a room devoid of it, a final, quiet connection before she walked out of their lives forever.

With the glass of water still in her hand, Evelyn walked up the sweeping staircase to pack. She took a slow sip, the coolness a welcome contrast to the burning animosity downstairs. She would not give them the satisfaction of seeing her rush.

Her room was at the far end of the hall, the smallest and sparest in the sprawling penthouse. It felt more like a servant's quarters than a daughter's bedroom, with its single window facing a brick wall and furniture that was a collection of mismatched cast-offs from other rooms. This room was a constant, physical reminder of her status. She was not family. She was an obligation.

She pulled a single, worn canvas bag from the back of the closet. Her possessions were minimal—a few changes of simple, unbranded clothes, a handful of well-worn paperbacks, and a small, locked wooden box she kept hidden under a floorboard. The Suttons had never seen the point in wasting money on the substitute, and Evelyn had never asked for anything. Asking was a sign of weakness.

A figure appeared, leaning casually against the doorframe, bathed in the warm, golden light of the hallway that seemed to mock the dimness of her room. It was Aria, here to savor the final act of the play.

She dangled a bracelet from her fingers, its cheap, oversized crystals catching the light and scattering tacky rainbows on the wall.

""Here,"" Aria said, her voice laced with a triumphant smirk. ""A parting gift. I wore this to a charity ball last year. Tiffany said it was stunning on me.""

She held it out, letting it swing like a hypnotist's pendulum. Her eyes glittered with malice.

""It might fetch you a few months' rent in whatever slum you're heading to. Consider it a final act of charity from your big sister.""

The words were sharp, designed to cut deep, to paint a pathetic picture of Evelyn's future.

Evelyn paused her packing, her back still to Aria. She carefully placed a book into her bag, her movements deliberate and unhurried. For a long moment, she said nothing, letting Aria's venom hang in the air. Then, slowly, she turned.

Her eyes were calm, devoid of the anger or tears Aria had been so desperately hoping for. They were cold, analytical, like a scientist observing a particularly uninteresting specimen under a microscope. Her gaze flicked from Aria's face to the swinging bracelet.

""That bracelet,"" Evelyn said, her voice even and flat, ""is from Vogue Style's fast-fashion line. The spring collection, two years ago. Item number 88-B42.""

Aria's condescending smirk faltered, a hairline crack in her perfect facade.

""It's made of a zinc alloy with glass crystals, not Swarovski as the knock-off description claimed. The clasp is prone to breaking,"" Evelyn continued, her gaze unwavering, her memory photographic. ""Retail price was two hundred and ninety-nine dollars. It's now on clearance at the outlets for forty-nine ninety-nine. If you're lucky, a pawn shop might give you twenty for it, but only if the plating isn't already flaking.""

She held Aria's stunned, furious gaze.

""Are you sure it's worth as much as you think?""

The smile completely froze on Aria's face. The color drained from her cheeks, replaced by a blotchy, ugly red. In a single, precise strike, Evelyn had dismantled her pathetic offering, exposing the cheap pretension beneath her polished veneer. She hadn't just insulted the bracelet; she had insulted Aria's taste, her intelligence, her very identity as a connoisseur of luxury.

It wasn't an emotional outburst. It was a factual execution.

Evelyn turned back to her bag, zipped it shut, and walked toward the door. She passed the speechless, humiliated Aria without another glance, leaving her sputtering in the doorway of the sad little room that had never been a home.

1noamjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1noamjr/the_ceos_wife_ran_away_after_rebirth/,The CEO’s Wife Ran Away After Rebirth,"Chapter 1Felicia Pascal reborn on her wedding day with Willard Cobb, the first thing she did was connect Willard first love and invited her back.In her previous life, she got what she wanted—being Willard's wife. But no matter how hard she tried, he remained cold, refusing intimacy, and eventually sent her father, Darren Pascall, to prison.This time, her story would have a different ending.The sound of running water from the bathroom snapped Felicia out of her thoughts.She picked up her phone and called to arrange for someone to pick up Alicia Cohen—Willard's childhood sweetheart—in Switzerland.Just as she hung up and turned around, she met Willard's eyes.He had just stepped out of the bathroom, clad in a bathrobe, his hair still damp. He approached her slowly, his expression icy. ""You're bringing Alicia back?""His eyes, devoid of any emotion, were like a knife, twisting deep in Felicia's heart.She clenched her phone until her knuckles turned white, but managed a casual smile. ""Isn't that what you want, given how close you've been since childhood?""She kept her gaze fixed on his unreadable face. ""I just found out that my mom gave Ms. Cohen a lot of money and forced her to go abroad. When Ms. Cohen comes back, I'll make it up to her. She can have whatever she wants.""Anger burned in Willard's eyes. ""How generous of you, Felicia!""With that, he strode out and slammed the door shut. The loud bang echoed through the bedroom.After staring at the door for a long moment, Felicia was finally certain he wasn't coming back. Then she slumped weakly onto the bed.In her previous life, during the third year of their marriage, Willard was found and brought back by his grandfather, Gregory Cobb—the head of the family—and named as his heir.As soon as he assumed control of the powerful Cobb Group, he sent for Alicia in Switzerland.At the same time, he acquired the Pascall Group, threw Darren in prison, and had Felicia's legs broken.It was only then that Felicia learned the truth. To fulfill her wish, her mother, Laurel Pascall, had split Willard and Alicia up behind her back.Perhaps that was the moment Willard's hatred for her took root.Now that she had been given a second chance, all Felicia wanted was to keep her family safe.She wouldn't try to win Willard's heart again—it simply wouldn't happen.For the next three days, Willard didn't return to the Cobb's villa.Today, he was supposed to go with Felicia to visit her parents, yet she was sure he wouldn't come.Grabbing her bag, she decided to go alone. But just as she reached the courtyard, the housekeeper's voice rang out. ""Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.""Felicia stopped in her tracks, watching as Willard stepped out of the car.She was overcome with an indescribable emotion—perhaps surprise, since she had assumed he'd forgotten the arrangement.Just as she started to approach, the other rear door opened. A beautiful woman in a white dress came into her view.It was none other than Alicia!Felicia froze, a wave of bitterness and jealousy coursing through her.A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips as she thought, ""Now it makes sense. He isn't coming back for me and never would.""Noticing the servants trailing behind Felicia, their arms laden with boxes of gifts, Willard, walking over with Alicia, paused, a puzzled frown on his face. ""Where are you going?""Felicia glanced at Alicia, then back at Willard. ""You're supposed to come with me to visit my parents today. Remember? But since you're occupied, I'll go alone.""Willard studied her face and eyes, surprised to find no trace of the anger he had expected.Once the servants had finished loading the gifts into her car, Felicia walked toward the gates, ignoring the probing stares of Willard and Alicia behind her.At the Pascall's villa, after chatting with her parents for a while, she retreated to the small attic, her eyes red.It was her precious secret base, a trove of mementos she had collected since childhood and gifts from family and friends.In her previous life, after her family went bankrupt, the villa was sold, and she never set foot there again.Tears filled her eyes as she looked at the beloved objects and the photos of Willard on the wall.Meanwhile, from the attic doorway, Willard watched as Felicia stared blankly at a music box that felt somewhat familiar to him, her eyes red-rimmed.Suddenly, his chest tightened as a strange scene flashed across his mind.In a torrential downpour, Felicia—dressed in a ruined, extravagant gown—knelt miserably on the ground, her pale fingers clutching his suit.""Willard, my dad was framed. He'd never do such a despicable thing!""Willard, let's get a divorce. I'll disappear from your life forever. Please... help my dad!""Her voice, raw with desperation and sadness, felt as real as if he were hearing it right there.Willard frowned, subconsciously rubbing his temples.Was it a hallucination? He'd never seen Felicia so distraught. Where could that vivid vision have come from?He shook his head, trying to dispel the lingering frustration, and knocked on the door.Felicia looked up instinctively, surprised to see him.She thought, ""Alicia has just been brought back to the Cobb's villa. They haven't seen each other for so long. Shouldn't he be with her?""Unless... he came here to honor his promise?""Could it be that he... actually cares about me, even just a little?""But in the next second, Willard's icy voice shattered her fleeting hope.""Alicia isn't feeling well. Could you get Dr. Meyer to check on her? He's one of the best.""Chapter 2Sunlight streamed through the window and fell upon Felicia, yet a sudden chill seeped into her bones.After a moment of heavy silence, she slowly rose to her feet and said flatly, ""OK.""Now she understood why Willard had left Alicia's side to seek her out.In her previous life, this realization would have shattered her heart. But now, she felt an eerie, unsettling calm.Eric Meyer was the doctor Laurel had hired to help improve her health. At Felicia's request, Laurel had scheduled him for a session at the Cobb's villa in three days.After dinner, Felicia and Willard went back to the Cobb's villa.They sat close to each other in the back seat of the car, yet she felt a world apart from him.She turned her gaze away from him—immersed in his work—and looked out at the passing world beyond the window.This time, she refused to be consumed by the exhausting triangle between Willard, Alicia, and herself. She'd live for herself.When they arrived at the villa, Willard suddenly said, ""Thank you.""Without another word, he got out of the car and walked toward the courtyard, not even glancing back.Staring at his retreating figure, Felicia felt a sudden wave of release, as if invisible chains around her heart had shattered. In a clear, brisk tone, she said, ""Willard, let's get a divorce.""He jerked his head back abruptly, fists clenching unconsciously at his sides. A trace of coldness flashed in his deep-set eyes.""What are you talking about? You ask for a divorce the moment Alicia returns? Are you trying to ruin her reputation in showbiz?""The blade of his harsh words plunged deep into her heart.His first thought was to protect Alicia—even though Felicia hadn't even mentioned her name.He cared for Alicia so deeply that even when granting her a proper status, his first concern was protecting her reputation. Yet toward Felicia, he held nothing but suspicion. Though she was willingly stepping aside so he could be with the one he loved, he still accused her of scheming.A peculiar feeling stirred within Willard when he saw Felicia's red-rimmed eyes, and he instinctively averted his gaze.The feeling was so unsettling that he turned to leave, not wanting to see her red eyes for even another second.For the next few days, both Alicia and Willard left early and returned late, and they barely saw each other.The villa was cavernous, and Felicia had grown accustomed to being the only one sitting at the long dining table.That morning, she was awakened by a knock at the door.The housekeeper's voice sounded from the hallway. ""Mrs. Cobb, Mr. Cobb wishes to see you as soon as possible. He's waiting downstairs.""Still groggy, Felicia was puzzled. How come Willard was home today?By the time she had washed up and gone downstairs, she found Willard, Alicia, and Eric in the living room.Her hand tightened slightly on the railing, a pang of bitter understanding shooting through her.Willard, who went to the office without fail every day, had stayed home today all for Alicia.He had even asked her to go downstairs to provide a cover for Alicia's examination, lest their arrangement tarnish Alicia's precious reputation.Eric examined Felicia with his usual skill and efficiency. Finding nothing seriously wrong, he prescribed some daily maintenance medication.After instructing her on its use, he packed his bag to leave. Just then, Willard said, ""Dr. Meyer, could you examine Alicia as well?""Eric couldn't help but shoot a surprised glance at Felicia. His arrangement, after all, was exclusively for her care.Felicia's hand holding the coffee paused for a second. Then she looked up and said softly, ""We would appreciate it, Dr. Meyer.""Eric nodded and proceeded to examine Alicia before writing out a prescription for her.A maid stepped forward to pour coffee. Suddenly, her hand slipped, and the scalding coffee pot she was holding fell, shattering directly toward them.Startled, Felicia instinctively moved to shield Willard.But Willard, seated beside her, leaped forward and protected Alicia instead.Staring blankly at his retreating back, Felicia felt the sight slice through her like a sharp blade, piercing straight into her heart.People always said that instinct revealed the truth.In that moment, Willard, the man she had tried to protect, was shielding another woman.Tears blurred her vision, and the bitterness was so overwhelming it felt as though it would tear her apart. She stood frozen, even forgetting to dodge as shattered pieces of the coffee pot hit the floor.The scalding water splashed onto her bare ankle, and she cried out in sharp pain.But her soft cry was drowned out by Willard's low growl.""You can't even do this right? Go see the housekeeper and collect your final paycheck.""Terrified, the maid quickly looked toward Alicia.A trace of anxiety flashed across Alicia's face as she said softly, ""Willard, come on. Don't be so hard on her. I was just startled, that's all. I'll be fine after resting a bit.""But he still looked grim. Noticing this, she continued, ""The housekeeper mentioned she comes from a very poor family. Can't we give her another chance?""Only then did his frown ease, his anger dissipating. ""Tell the housekeeper to see that she's properly trained. I won't tolerate another mistake like this.""The maid quickly thanked them.Willard carefully guided Alicia away from the shattered porcelain on the floor, saying to Felicia, ""Alicia is shaken. I'll take her upstairs to rest.""With that, he supported Alicia up the steps, not even glancing at the pale-faced Felicia.Felicia had believed her heart was already numb from bitterness, yet a fresh, lancing pain struck her now—so sharp it stole her breath away.In the living room, the maid was quietly clearing the shattered pieces from the floor.Eric was just about to take his leave when his eyes fell on the large, red burn across Felicia's ankle. He exclaimed, ""Mrs. Cobb, you're injured! You need to treat the burn immediately. I'll prescribe an ointment for you. We must avoid scarring.""He carefully applied the ointment himself, offered a few quiet words of instruction, and then departed.Back in the bedroom, Felicia leaned against the headboard, gazing absently at the wedding photo hanging on the wall.In the picture, she was radiant, smiling brightly, while Willard was expressionless.It was clear now that she had been the only one immersed in the joy of their marriage.Her heart felt as though it had been plunged into icy water. A deep, chilling cold began to spread throughout her entire body, and she could do nothing but wrap her arms tightly around herself.Just then, Willard pushed open the door and walked in with a glass of warm milk.Seeing her in bed, her gaze distant and lost, he handed the glass over and said gently, ""The housekeeper mentioned your calf is burned. Let me see.""Without bothering to look up at him, she lay down and slid under the blanket, saying flatly, ""I'm fine. Go ahead and take care of Alicia. I'm tired and need to sleep.""Her tone was nothing but detached.Willard's grip tightened around the glass. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but seeing her eyes already closed, he swallowed his words. Without another sound, he turned and left.Soon, Felicia drifted into sleep—and then, the nightmare came.In the nightmare, she was back in her past life, begging Willard to help Darren out of jail.Rain fell in heavy sheets, drenching her completely as she slumped to the ground.Clutching the hem of his trousers, she pleaded desperately, ""Willard, I know you hate me. Come at me then! Let's get a divorce. l'll disappear from your life forever. Please... Help my dad, I'm begging you.""But he turned around, his eyes devoid of any emotion.Her hands closed around nothing but cold air, and her heart plunged into an abyss.All that remained was the echo of his icy, merciless voice. ""Felicia, the evidence is solid. This is what your family deserves.""Chapter 3Felicia's body trembled violently, and she jolted awake with a sharp cry, ""No!""The echo of Willard's cold, heartless words still pierced her heart like a blade.She wiped away the tears that had fallen, her sleepiness gone. Draping a coat over her shoulders, she decided to go downstairs for a walk in the garden.Just as she reached the first floor, the crisp sound of plates and soft murmuring voices drifted from the dining room.Among them, Alicia's gentle tone was unmistakable.""Willard, the medicine is so bitter... But I'll take it, no matter what, since you prepared it for me.""Oh, Felicia was startled today, too, wasn't she? It's so late. Shouldn't you go to her? She might be upset if she sees you here with me.""Felicia held her breath and stood perfectly still, not making a sound.After what felt like an eternity, Willard's voice came. ""It's fine.""He had protected Alicia perfectly during the day. And though she hadn't been hurt in the slightest, he still stayed by her side.Yet toward Felicia, he had never cared—not whether she was jealous, not if she was injured, not even if she was hurting.Who held his heart was painfully clear.The night breeze was cold, piercing right through Felicia and freezing her in place. Though she pulled her coat tighter, no warmth reached her heart.She glanced back at the soft, warm glow spilling from the dining room, which only deepened the bitterness overwhelming her.Turning away, she retreated to the bedroom, all desire for a walk gone.She tossed and turned in bed, sleep stubbornly out of reach.Then she heard the door push open. Instantly still, she held her breath, not daring to move a muscle. She squeezed her eyes shut, feigning sleep.Familiar footsteps drew near, then grew faint as they passed by. He must have gone into the bathroom. Soon, the sound of running water filled the room.In a daze, she fell into sleep and dreamed that a warm, broad hand was gently holding her injured ankle.When she woke the next morning, she was alone. She reached out to the other side of the bed—only to find it cold and empty.A faint, self-mocking laugh escaped her. Sure enough, it was just a dream.Willard had slept in the guest room on their wedding night. In all the days since, he only ever entered their bedroom to use the shower.Suddenly, someone pounded heavily on the door. The housekeeper's anxious voice broke through, snapping Felicia abruptly back to reality.""Mrs. Cobb, Mr. Cobb has been hurt! Someone caused trouble at the opening ceremony, and he took a blade for Sir Cobb! His condition is serious!""Felicia's expression changed drastically. She scrambled for the nearest clothes, threw them on, and rushed out the door.She reached the hospital as quickly as she could, just in time to see Willard being lifted from the ambulance on a stretcher, covered in blood.The medical team waiting at the entrance hurriedly transferred him to a gurney.His white shirt was soaked through with crimson, his face frighteningly pale.Felicia's breath caught in her throat. For a moment, she felt as if her heart had stopped beating.Noticing the sweat beading on his forehead, she quickly reached for a tissue to gently wipe it away.But the moment her hand drew near, he turned his head sharply away as if recoiling from the touch of some vile plague.Her hand froze in mid-air, and she could only stare at him in stunned silence.His lips pressed into a thin, hard line before he closed his eyes, shutting her out completely. The message was unmistakable—he had no wish to speak to her, leaving her stranded in a void of helplessness.Just then, Alicia rushed over. She brushed past Felicia and leaned in close to Willard to carefully wipe the cold sweat from his forehead.""Willard can't stand being touched by just anyone. We grew up together, and I'm the only one who can go near him.""Her words sent a piercing pain through Felicia's heart again.Felicia clenched her fists, her nails digging into her flesh. Lowering her gaze to conceal the bitterness in her eyes, she said softly, ""I see.""The doctor soon hurried into the operating room, and the procedure began.Hours passed. Felicia, who had been waiting anxiously by the door, grew more restless with every moment.Just then, the light above the OR door switched off. The doctor emerged, followed by Willard being wheeled out by the medical staff.The doctor announced, ""The surgery was a success. The patient just needs to be monitored closely overnight.As the doctor left, Alicia quickly said, ""I'll take care of Willard, Felicia. You can go back now.""Thinking of Willard's rejection and his obvious comfort with Alicia, Felicia was overwhelmed by bitterness again. She gently nodded and left the hospital without saying another word.Worried about Willard, she couldn't go to sleep whatsoever, even till the dead of the night.It was nearly dawn before she finally felt the faint pull of sleep. Just as she lay down, however, another knock came at the door.""Mrs. Cobb, Sir Cobb has decided to name Mr. Cobb as his heir. He wants to see you at the hospital now.""Chapter 4Felicia was taken aback by the housekeeper's words.In her previous life, it had taken three more years before Willard was officially named the heir. How come it was happening now?She changed her clothes and went downstairs. At the sight of her, the housekeeper approached with a grin. ""Mrs. Cobb, once Mr. Cobb takes charge, you'll be the lady of the house!""Gregory's eldest son had passed away. His second son showed no interest in the family business, and the youngest lived a frivolous, extravagant life, devoted to pleasure only.Among all the grandsons, only Willard, who was newly acknowledged, possessed a sharp mind for business.Gregory had always scrutinized potential heirs with extreme caution.He had never committed to a will or openly favored anyone.What could have compelled him to make such a hasty decision now?Felicia smiled bitterly, ""Is that really a good thing?""In her previous life, the moment Willard was named heir, he had begun his retaliation against the Pascall family.His reason was simple—he had always harbored a deep grudge against Laurel for forcing Alicia away.But this time, Felicia had already brought Alicia back herself.If she took the initiative to propose a divorce—to step aside so Willard and Alicia could be together—perhaps he wouldn't go after her family.The faint murmur of voices from the ward felt unusually harsh, causing Felicia to freeze just outside the door.""Willard, get better soon... Alright? I've been so worried about you.""The door was slightly ajar. Through the gap, Felicia saw Alicia holding Willard's hand, gently pressing it against her own cheek.He showed no intention of pushing her away, not even a flicker of impatience crossed his face.A cold numbness shot from Felicia's hand on the doorknob straight through her body. She let go, her nails digging sharply into her palm.Walking in now would only intrude, shattering their tender, intimate moment. She was certain neither of them wanted her there.Turning decisively, she walked away. She had no intention of torturing herself any longer.Just as she stepped out of the hospital, a deafening clap of thunder shattered the air. The once-clear sky was suddenly choked with dark clouds, and a heavy downpour began without warning.It reminded her vividly of that day in her previous life—the day she had begged Willard desperately in the relentless rain.Her thin clothes were soaked through in an instant. She looked ahead and walked slowly toward the parking lot, her gaze empty and distant.Seeing Felicia like this, the housekeeper was terrified, and her expression changed drastically.She quickly retrieved a blanket from the car and carefully handed it to Felicia. ""Mrs. Cobb, you should dry yourself off before you catch a cold.""After arriving home, Felicia ate the soup the housekeeper had made for her and gazed out at the dark sky.In her previous life, everything she had done was a mistake, each action only fueling Willard's anger.He and Alicia were truly in love, and she had been nothing but a joke standing between them.As much as it pained her, letting go and divorcing him was the only way to protect her family.She sat motionless through the entire night.Early the next morning, she let out a breath, turned on her laptop, and printed out a divorce agreement.Just as she held the papers in her hand, the housekeeper knocked and informed her that Willard wished to see her at the hospital.""Alright. I'll be there right away.""Felicia's voice was eerily calm as she clutched the divorce agreement, its crisp touch a constant reminder that everything between her and Willard was about to end.Today, Willard was alone in the ward.After pushing the door open, Felicia stood by the door and shot him a meaningful glance before approaching the bed.Looking at her, Willard opened his mouth.He wanted to ask her—why hadn't she come to see him after he was injured?Did he mean so little to her?But before he could speak, she handed him the document.""Willard, this is the divorce agreement. Sign it.""Chapter 5Willard's expression darkened instantly as his gaze fell upon the divorce papers.The ward fell into a dead silence.Felicia's hand, still holding out the papers, remained suspended in the air. His motionlessness puzzled her.Willard loved Alicia so much. Shouldn't he be eager to sign without hesitation?Did he think this was some kind of joke?Setting the papers beside his hand, she raised her voice slightly and stated, ""Willard, I'm doing this so you and Alicia can...""Before she could finish, Willard suddenly snatched the papers and tore them ruthlessly into pieces. He said coldly, ""Now is not the time for a divorce. We'll discuss this later.""Hearing this, she couldn't help but look up. At the sight of his icy expression, she was a bit stunned.He had already closed his eyes, clearly refusing to say another word.Left with no other choice, she turned and left, more confused than ever. What exactly did he want?She walked absent-mindedly when she turned a corner and bumped squarely into someone.Stumbling off-balance, she couldn't help but exclaim.Just then, someone quickly leaned in and steadied her before she fell.A male voice tinged with a smile rang out. ""You haven't changed at all, Felicia—still just as careless as when you were a kid.""""Tristram? When did you get back?"" A surprised smile touched her lips.She and Tristram Gordon had grown up together, though he'd gone abroad three years ago.""Not long ago.""As Tristram helped her regain her balance, he noticed one of her pearl earrings had tangled in her hair. He reached out to free it and then tucked the loosened strand behind her ear.Having always seen him as an older brother, she didn't find the gesture inappropriate.She smiled and was about to thank him when a familiar female voice rang out behind her. ""Felicia, you and Mr. Gordon are childhood sweethearts indeed. See how close you two are.""Turning around, she saw Alicia and Willard standing side by side.Willard's eyes were utterly cold.He couldn't recall Felicia smiling at him like this.Out of the corner of her eye, Alicia noted his darkening expression, and her smile turned icy.""Mr. Gordon, did you come straight to see Felicia as soon as you returned? Well... She's married now. Perhaps you should mind your boundaries.""Felicia frowned and was about to retort. However, Willard didn't give her a chance. In one swift motion, he strode forward, pulled her firmly back toward the ward, locked the door behind them, and yanked the curtain shut.Finally coming out of her trance, she struggled. ""You're hurting me, Willard. Let go!""Seeing the impatience flash in her eyes, he was suddenly filled with a nameless fury.Instead of releasing her, he pinned her down on the bed, ignoring the sharp protest from his own wound, and gripped her chin, forcing her to look at him.""You're so eager for a divorce,"" he demanded, his voice thick with anger. ""Is it really for my sake? Or is it to be with Tristram?""Chapter 6Willard's grip on Felicia's chin was iron-tight, leaving her utterly immobilized.She struggled even harder. ""Let go!""She kept struggling, not even stopping when she struck his wound, just to return to Tristram as soon as possible. That realization struck Willard like a physical blow, and a dark, inexplicable rage surged within him.Blood soon seeped through his hospital gown, staining it a deepening crimson, yet he seemed numb to the pain. With his left hand, he pinned both of hers above her head. With the other, he yanked open her collar and pressed his mouth roughly to her slender, fair neck, every movement driven by raw, reckless impulse.Felicia froze for a heartbeat, then began to fight with all the strength she had left, but it was useless.Tears streamed silently down her cheeks, and when she finally spoke, her voice was broken with sobs.""Willard, what kind of person do you take me for?""Her scalding tears fell on Willard's fingertips.He froze, then withdrew his hand as if burned.His gaze dropped to Felicia, who was softly crying, and then he quickly looked away.""Sorry."" He stood up, fingers curling tightly at his sides, a flicker of restraint crossing his face.Felicia immediately crossed her arms over her chest, shielding herself from him with unmistakable wariness. A sharp, suffocating tightness seized his chest at the sight.""Is Tristram that good?""A wave of bitterness surged through Felicia's heart at his question.She chose to let go so that Willard could be with the woman he truly loved. Yet, here he was, accusing her of being involved with someone else.Clutching her collar tightly, she lowered her gaze to hide the pain in her eyes and drew back slightly. ""What's between us has nothing to do with Tristram. You and I aren't cut out for each other, that's all...""Even now, she was protecting Tristram. Willard's fists clenched at his sides, veins pulsing along the backs of his hands.""Leave. I'll grant your wish soon enough.""With that, he turned to face the window, no longer sparing her a glance.She straightened her disheveled clothes and gently wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes.Two lifetimes entangled with Willard had left her utterly exhausted.Hearing him finally agree to the divorce brought nothing but a wave of overwhelming relief.From that day on, she never returned to the hospital.Since their marriage was nearing its end, she had no intention of disturbing him and Alicia or making a fool of herself again.The next time she saw Willard was at an amusement park.She was standing in line for the Ferris wheel with her young nephew when she noticed Willard and Alicia not far ahead in the same line.Willard was holding a drink, and Alicia leaned against his shoulder, smiling sweetly.Felicia froze where she stood, the smile on her own lips stiffening as a sharp, familiar pain pricked at her heart.She remembered all too clearly how she had once begged Willard to bring her here—only to be coldly rejected. He'd said he wasn't interested.It turned out, he simply hadn't wanted to come with her.Felicia stared blankly as Willard and Alicia stepped into one of the carriages.The Ferris wheel began its slow ascent, and she stood motionless, her gaze fixed unblinkingly on them as time seemed to stretch into an endless eternity.She didn't even remember how she made it home.That night, as she lay in bed, her mind replayed the same torturous images—Willard's weight above her, and then the tender way he had kissed Alicia at the highest point of the Ferris wheel.After she tossed and turned for what felt like hours, sleep never came. Finally, she threw on a coat and went downstairs.As she approached the courtyard, she saw Willard and Alicia stepping out of the car. Alicia was holding a neatly wrapped gift box.Noticing Felicia, Alicia walked over with a soft, enthusiastic smile. ""Felicia, tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Willard has promised to come with me to the cemetery to visit my parents, so he won't be able to go back with you to see yours.""As she spoke, she held out the box.""This is a gift we picked out for you to take to them.""Felicia's breath hitched. Almost instinctively, she looked toward Willard.His cold expression offered a silent endorsement of Alicia's words.Perhaps in his eyes, it was only natural for Alicia to speak with the tone of his wife.Felicia couldn't bear to stay another second, as each moment only magnified her humiliation.Clenching her fists, she swallowed hard against the bitterness rising in her throat. Then she said flatly, ""No need. I've prepared a gift already.""Without another word or glance in their direction, she turned and strode back toward the bedroom.As Willard stared at her retreating figure, his gaze darkened.The next day, as soon as Felicia stepped out of the car, she saw a group of uniformed officials affixing official seals to the entrance of her family's villa.The onlookers were whispering among themselves while pointing at the villa.""Have you heard? The Pascall family has gone bankrupt. The CEO was arrested.""Chapter 7Felicia stood in place, stunned.Her mind went blank. Though noise and chatter filled the air around her, she couldn't hear a thing, as if she'd gone deaf.She felt suffocated, struggling to breathe.She pounded her chest lightly, gasping for air.She felt helpless. Even after taking Alicia back and asking Willard for a divorce, why couldn't she still prevent the same tragedy from befalling the Pascall family? And it happened even earlier than it had in her previous life.Memories from her previous life flooded her mind.""Mom... Dad..."" Felicia murmured distractedly as she walked toward the Pascall's villa gate.Why couldn't she change anything? She'd already let Willard go.A hand reached out to block Felicia.She snapped back to reality and heard the middle-aged women gossiping, each comment harsher than the last.""The Pascalls seemed so decent. Who knew the couple were rotten to the core?""""Yeah, that CEO seemed so refined, but he's been taking advantage of the artists at his company!""""The company mistreats its employees and withholds their pay. They deserve to go bankrupt.""""Scum like that should get the death penalty!""Their words made Felicia tremble with anger.She turned toward them, her eyes wide with fury, and shouted, ""That's a lie! My parents wouldn't do that!""One of the women spat on the ground and sneered, ""Yeah, right! That celebrity risked her reputation to expose your dad. You think she'd make that up?""""If your parents were innocent, why'd they get taken in for questioning?""Felicia was speechless. She tried to argue, but her soft voice was drowned out by the angry crowd.People grew more worked up. In the chaos, Felicia was nearly hit several times before law enforcement stepped in to shield her.After the crowd dispersed, Felicia stood lost and heartbroken outside the house. Then she spotted Willard and Alicia approaching in the distance.Suddenly alert, she ran over, grabbed Willard's sleeve, and pleaded, ""Willard, my father..",2,1758611038.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
1noakw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1noakw2/the_great_coffee_conspiracy_of_elm_street/,The Great Coffee Conspiracy of Elm Street,"I was ready to highkey lose my mind over the coffee machine. Every single morning, without fail, I’d stumble into the kitchen, groggy and desperate for caffeine, only to find the filter full of yesterday’s grounds and the carafe crusted with dried coffee. It wasn’t just the coffee; the counter was perpetually crumb-strewn, and the sink always seemed to be hosting a convention of dirty mugs. Honestly, it was sending me. Three months into living in this urban apartment with Liam, Maya, and Sam, and I felt like I was running a hostel for exceptionally messy adults.

I tried the passive-aggressive route first, which, let’s be real, never actually works. Little notes like ""Kindly rinse your mug, thanks!"" or ""Coffee grounds appreciate the trash can!"" appeared on the fridge, only to be ignored. I'd clean it up myself, muttering under my breath, watching Liam float in, pour the last drop of milk, and just… leave the empty carton. Maya was always rushing off to some event, her whirlwind energy leaving a trail of half-eaten snacks. Sam, bless his introverted heart, was usually holed up in his room, emerging only for quiet meals and avoiding eye eye contact. I was lowkey starting to resent them, even though I knew they weren't doing it maliciously. They were just… oblivious.

One Tuesday morning, staring at a particularly egregious coffee machine situation, I just… stopped. I didn't clean it. I poured myself a sad glass of water and went back to my room, fuming. Later that day, I found a half-written note from Maya on the counter: ""Hey guys, anyone seen the coffee? And who used all the milk?"" I realized then that my silent suffering wasn't actually communicating anything. We needed to talk, for real.

That evening, I called an impromptu house meeting, which sounded way more formal than it was. We just sat on the mismatched living room furniture, and I, trying to keep my voice even, laid it all out. ""Look,"" I started, ""I love living with you guys, no cap. But the kitchen situation is kinda getting to me. Specifically, the coffee machine and the general counter chaos."" Liam looked genuinely surprised, Maya sheepish, and Sam just nodded, probably relieved I was saying something. We talked about how we were all busy, how sometimes we just forgot, and how maybe we needed a better system than hoping someone else would notice. We decided to create a simple rotating chore chart, just for kitchen basics, and pledged to actually use the shared grocery list on our phones. It sounds so basic, right? But the immediate relief in the room was palpable.

The change wasn't overnight, but it was significant. The coffee machine started getting cleaned more regularly, and the counters stayed tidier. We even started leaving each other little ""thank you"" notes when someone went above and beyond. We still had our moments, because we’re human, but that conversation shifted something. It felt like we moved from just coexisting to actually living together, learning to communicate and support each other. We love to see it.",1,1758610866.0,HouseSharingStories,0,1.0,False

Last night we talked about us for a bit. You said this is trouble because we can't just be friends and we had sex. I thought we were going back to how we were before

You know the one—wide-eyed, mouth slithtly open, but no one said anything directly. Evenntually, someonne finally chimed in politely, reminding him of the line. 

It made me wonder if this is an example of social norm conformity or something. We're basically playiing this silent game of queue etiquuette. Is it fear of confrontation or just a desire to maintain harmony? Maybe it's like social proof, where we go along with the group to avoid standing out. 

I'm curious if there’s a broader psycchological thing going on here. Why does a breaxh in the 'queuing contract' feel so awkward?

1noacji,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1noacji/severe_relapse_7_weeks_after_stopping_ofloxacin/,Severe relapse 7 weeks after stopping Ofloxacin - triggered by Doxycilin or Ibuprofen?,"**TL;DR:**

* Prescribed Ofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) for suspected prostatitis. Felt unwell (headache, dizziness, tingling feeling in hands and feet, sleep problems) from day 2 but continued for 9 days after consulting doctor.
* First 10 days post-withdrawal: Symptoms continued, even worse, after that gradual and strong improvement within days.
* About 2 or 3 weeks later: second wave of side effects lasting \~4 days, then again \~90–95% recovery, only had additional muscle pain in my legs for a few days.
* Now, 7 weeks after stopping, a significant relapse of neuropathy-like symptoms after taking Doxycycline for 9 days and a single 400 mg Ibuprofen. Current flare lasting 9+ days, symptoms worse than before, even small efforts like a short car ride or walk exhaust me completely.

**Full Story:**

I (m,30) was prescribed Ofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) for suspected prostatitis. From day 2 of treatment, I already felt unwell (headache, dizziness, tingling feeling in hands and feet, sleep problems), but after consulting my doctor I pushed through and completed 9 days.

About 10 days after stopping, I started to improve significantly. Over the following weeks I felt almost normal again — I’d say 90–95% back to baseline. During this period, I rarely even thought about the side effects anymore, except for occasional setbacks once a week lasting 1–3 hours, sometimes triggered by coffee. Only set back was, roughly two weeks after stopping, I had a second wave of side effects lasting around 4 days (neuropathy-like symptoms, circulation issues, brain fog). After that, I recovered again to near-normal, with the short fluctuations as described. I even took another round of antibiotics (12 days of Amoxicillin) without any side effects.

Now, about 7 weeks after cessation, I’ve hit a much more severe relapse. Around this time, I took Doxycycline for 9 days and once 400 mg Ibuprofen. Since then, I’ve had neuropathy-like symptoms all over the body, muscle weakness, waves of psychological distress, headaches, and vision/focusing problems — very similar to my initial reaction during Ofloxacin. The intensity is higher than before, and the flare has already lasted more than 9 days. Even small activities like a short car ride or walk push me to my limits.

While some improvement has occurred compared to the very first days of this setback, the persistence and severity are unsettling. It feels as though my nervous system has been more than “reset” back to the early days after Ofloxacin, despite the fact that I was functioning almost normally in the weeks before.

Supportive measures so far: vitamin B-complex, magnesium citrate, and more recently fish oil. I’ve also ordered ALA, CoQ10, and vitamin D3/K2, but I’m hesitant about starting the first two due to concerns about tolerance.

1noac9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1noac9a/unsure_how_to_deal_with_this/,Unsure how to deal with this,"I’m currently dating someone poly for the first time and developing really strong feelings for them. It was very clear from the beginning that being poly is rather non-negotiable for them and honestly i also felt like I didn’t want to date monogamously any more after my last monogamous relationship and was open to trying it. 

That person (let’s call them A) lives in another city and is also about to move even further away (currently it’s a two hour train ride but about to become an 8 hour one) which makes me a bit nervous but we both are open to figuring out what mode will work for us over the distance. I’m also currently dating someone who lives in the same city as I do but it’s a lot more casual. 

Since I’m new to poly, A and I had some conflicts about communication, for example because I announced that I was going on a date the same day or the day before even though it was longer. In general I still have this internalised feeling of guilt from being monogamous, which makes it harder for me to share things and in the past has made me omit things, like planned dates, hoping to avoid conflict but thereby making it worse because they feel like I’m being dishonest (which I think is really fair and I’m trying to be more transparent in the future). 

They aren’t seing anyone regularly at the moment but did when I started and they did have some hookups with a close friend of theirs and a fwb situation and a kind of romantic holiday fling. Some of these situations made me jealous briefly but I didn’t mind them a lot. A also has a person they used to date who lives in the same city as me. A thought they had ghosted them until they slid back into their life by liking an insta story and starting a conversation where they realised that that person moved to my city now. They met up for coffee while A was visiting me and ended up hooking up, which I also didn’t particularly mind in the moment. 

But somehow, when A announced that they wanna see them again something in me really resisted to that. I said it’s okay but I’m not feeling great about it (also bcs it doesnt really feel like we have veto rights for each other at the moment) but now that their next meet-up is planned I do realise that it makes me feel really anxious and shitty. I also kind of snapped at them when we talked about it and they asked me why I’m so bothered by it and I said it’s a mixture of just not liking the way that person came back into their life snd the feeling like I’m facilitating a thing I’m not part of (the other person would never visit A in their city, for example) but also I’m afraid that it’s gonna take away from the time we can see each other that is already limited. They reassured me that it won’t take away from our time and that they would only meet the other person for the extra day that they wouldn’t stay with me anyways. 

They also said that they feel like I have a double standard since I’m also seeing other people and they are more transparent about it and I don’t see how I hurt their feelings by not being transparent. 

I still feel really shitty about the prospect of them seeing the other person right after staying with me the next time they visit, but I feel like bringing it up again will make them feel like I’m being controlling and enhance the feeling of double standards. I’ve also been wondering if it would help me to meet that other person, which A has already expressed they would like, but I feel like it could also have the opposite effect. 

I really don’t know how to bring it up again, but I’ve had really bad anxiety around this and don’t want to be feeling this way. I’m also questioning if this kind of poly dating is right for me. I’d be really greatly for any thoughts, advice or sharing of similar experiences. Thank you 💕

I've had a leather briefcase for 7 years from a Swedish brand called Saddler (pretty much an older version of this one: https://www.saddler.se/p/gustav-computer-bag-brown )

Unfortunately the briefcase doesn't really have all the space I need anymore since getting a dog.

It has held up beautifully over the years. It almost looks brand new, I've also had a Herschel backpack for almost 10 years, it still works but it understandably has some wear and tear, and doesn't look very professional. 

I'm currently overwhelmed by all of the backpack options so I was hoping for some kind people to give me a few pointers on which brands to look out for (available in the EU), or even better send some specific suggestions of models my way. 

What I am looking to store for an everyday cary is:
• 15"" laptop
• Headphones including their hard case
• A pair of notebooks and some pens
• Some general stuff for my dog
- Dog food/treats which is stored in a container that you would typically store grounded coffee in.
- A roll of Plastic bags for the walks.
- An activation toy

Some general preferences I have:
• If leather, not synthetic or fake leather.
• Not ""too small"" or ""too bulky"" (I get that this could mean anything and is subjective, but preferably it should be able to store the items listed above, with a little margin, without it looking like I'm going to go hiking after work)

I started smoking weed long before we ever met, and she knew i liked to smoke before we got married. I have a full time job as a software engineer, i went to school and got a bachelors degree in Applied Math, I’m a loyal family man and I’ve always been there for her. I stay active and play basketball at least twice per week. I lift weights and try to stay physically fit. I eat healthy and maintain a good body weight. I have been playing guitar for 20 years and it is one of My biggest passions. I also happen to like to smoke a little bit of pot at the end of the night to wind down. It’s something I’ve done since i was a teenager. 

She is now seeing it as a big problem and saying that because she is pregnant, i have to stop for good. I told her i don’t see the need for that, and i can still be a good father even if i smoke weed every now and then. 

I’m not a big drinker and prefer weed. I don’t smoke at home anymore, usually roll a joint and go for a walk now because she is pregnant. I just don’t see what the big deal is. I’m not smoking a lot of pot, maybe half a joint per day. I’m on top of all of my responsibilities, and leave her wanting for absolutely nothing. I feel that i can still be a good father and smoke a joint every now and then. 

Many men like to drink beers, gamble, etc. This just happens to be my vice that takes the edge off after a long day of getting stuff done. She began to say some very insulting things to me, such as I’m not a good husband and not willing to sacrifice “anything” for the family, which i think is just straight up not true. I have always been there for her, i have been loyal for 9 years, i take her out on dates very often, and make sure her every needs are met. I make her breakfast and coffee every day, clean the house, cook dinner, idk what else I could give. 

I think her forcing me to quit this one thing that makes me happy is too controlling and it’s getting to me. I just don’t see what the big deal is if I’m excelling in every category and it isn’t having any negative impact in our lives. I think most people have vices or things they do that aren’t particularly “healthy”. Mine just happens to be smoking a little bit of pot at the end of the day. Am i wrong for not wanting to give that up?

Yes! And comfort is everything with **luxury bar chairs** - you'll be sitting longer than you think. I made the mistake of prioritizing looks over ergonomics initially.

For **high bar stool chairs**, back support is non-negotiable if you plan to actually use them for meals or work. The backless ones photograph beautifully but aren't practical for extended sitting.

Swivel function is surprisingly useful too - makes conversation and getting up/down much easier. And if you have kids, choose something sturdy with a wide base. I learned this after my nephew nearly toppled a wobbly designer stool!

Material-wise, I love the look of leather but fabric is more practical for everyday use. **Luxury furniture** brands often offer both options for the same frame design.

Height adjustability is worth the extra cost if your island is custom or unusually tall. Standard counter height is 36 inches, bar height is 42 inches - measure your setup first!

I ended up with brass and leather ones that have that **designer furniture** look but are actually comfortable for morning coffee and evening conversation.

1noa8gv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1noa8gv,Mikael’s Path is Heartbreaking (HS3 and ABH),"I know a lot of people think our angel, Mikael’s path is dull or he lacks emotions. He’s too stoic. Whatever. But the thing is, his quiet love is so profound. I cried so much on his ABH Finale and HS3 episodes. First of all, can I just say how refreshing it was to have an LI explain their issues and why they’re behaving oddly. That was refreshing. Now onto the part that may be a spoiler if you’re not caught up (Pics too).    
      
In response to that notion, I realized reading his HS3 and ABH scenes in reverse will better illustrate how strongly Mikael feels for Audrey. I think it’s just how he expresses it that throws some people off. This below is something I’ve said before, but  I think it’s worth repeating. He shows love in ways even Audrey can’t see. Read these slides in this order, see if you still feel he’s too cold or stoic. And read below for more on why I genuinely believe his love is far more intense than many realize. His route is well worth it. 

In ABH the love interests are more loud with their love and it’s what we’re accustomed to in many of the RC books. But reality is some people love deeply, profoundly, but the way they show it is simply very different.

When I think of how Mikael reacts to Audrey in harm, or simply trying to make her happy as such an introverted and reserved and honestly, not old fashioned, but more distinguished and gentlemanly type of man, he’s basically setting fires everywhere. Oh wait, he did that in the kitchen cooking Audrey dinner.

That’s the thing about Mikael. He’s not the guy to do something loud and impulsive. Like David/Cassiel after her attack in ABH 1.10. They both react in these big ways, and he just holds her and then later tries to keep his head on right.     
   
So no. Mikael is not everyone’s cup of tea (oh yeah, this man for sure drinks tea over coffee with lemon and honey.), but he’s still deeply and soul shattering in love with Audrey. Maybe that ocean storm in his eyes will finally explode in HS3, but I for one, love him just like this.",29,1758609552.0,RomanceClub,11,0.97,False

===============================================================================

**To learn more, go to [Affordable AI](https://affordableai.net)**

Running a small business today means juggling everything—managing staff, inventory, finances—and still somehow being expected to master marketing. But what if AI could take the pressure off and actually deliver results?

In this video, we're diving deep into **10 engineered ChatGPT-5 prompts** built specifically for local business owners. These aren’t random prompts pulled from a blog; they're battle-tested, ready-to-use, and most importantly—they work. Whether you're in retail, food, fitness, beauty, or services, these prompts will help you stop wasting time on generic content and finally create online marketing that drives real customers to your door.

You’ll discover how AI can become your personal marketing assistant, helping you with everything from content creation to email campaigns, review responses, event planning, and more—all without writing a single line of code.

What’s Inside This Video:
-------------------------

### 🧠 Why AI Isn’t Working for You Yet

Most business owners try ChatGPT once, get a list of bland suggestions, and never touch it again. We explain why that happens—and how a small change in your approach can flip the script entirely.

### 📋 What Is an Engineered Prompt

Learn how engineered prompts act like mini blueprints for your business goals. Instead of vague instructions, you’ll see how these prompts transform ChatGPT into a hyperspecific marketing expert that understands your niche.

### ☕ Meet Sarah: A Real Small Business Turnaround Story

Then she discovered these 10 prompts—and used them to completely revamp her customer engagement strategy. Within 48 hours, she had a sold-out event, returning customers, and a real plan for growth.

### 📆 Get a 30-Day Social Media Calendar in Seconds

### 🛍️ Works for Any Local Business

From gyms to salons, cafes to repair shops—these prompts adapt to your business. The language, tone, and strategy shift depending on your inputs, giving you hyper-personalized results every time.

1noa58i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshavers_India/comments/1noa58i/tried_gave_up_on_straight_edge_should_i_try_de/,"Tried, gave up on straight edge. Should I try DE?","Some 5-6 years ago I decided to try the straight edge razors (the kind barbers use where half a blade is loaded into the razor). I got cleaner shaves than the typical Mach 3, and felt better about the lower environmental impact. The first time around I got a lot of cuts, with practice I was able to reduce the chances of cuts. But the cuts never really stopped. I do get pimples on my skin occasionally and I also need to shave only about once a week.

Last year when I visited the US I bought a Mach 3 from a shop and I found it to be quite good. The blades lasted longer than the gillettes here and the shave was better too. Since I came back I've been using these. 

Recently I came across this sub and I've been wondering if I should try double edged. It would be cheaper, have less environmental impact and reduce my dependence on friends bringing replacement blades from the states. I don't want to geek out about blades and razors, I obsess over coffee already. Should I even bother experimenting with a DE? Can I just pick one set of razor, blade, soap and use it for the rest of my life?",3,1758609202.0,Wetshavers_India,4,1.0,False

I’ll be commuting since I feel like driving all the way up might be a bit of a challenge. Just staying for one night, so I’m looking for a hotel that’s good for solo travelers and ideally located near SM Baguio.

Also, any nearby attractions you’d recommend around SM? I’m really just going there to unwind and move on (lol). Planning to keep it chill.. coffee, a good book, and quiet moments. That kind of vibe.",0,1758609142.0,phtravel,9,0.43,False

I met a guy at my first store who immaculately cleaned the parking lot and asked for a free coffee in exchange. The second store had a guy who took it upon himself to buy his own supplies to clean the bathroom. 3rd store had a lady who emptied all the trash cans and then asked us for replacement bags.

This new lady is a different beast. I was able to explain to the other 3 why they absolutely could not be doing that. This woman is going to town on Fizz City and I cannot get her to stop. I’ve even been out there cleaning on it myself, yet still she goes.",3,1758609007.0,sheetz,3,1.0,False

I (F34) am seeing a guy (34M) for about a month, met on the app, he was looking for a relationship I am also looking for a relationship.

I pretty much told him my dating goals and made clear what are my intensions and he told me he is also looking for a partner. We went on several dates, we pretty much met every past weekend and saw each other both on saturday and sundays because he wanted to see me even for a short walk or coffee and usually one big dinner date per each of the past few weekends. When we meet he is funny, talkative, caring, we have things in common etc.

Last saturday we met, went to a concert and an art show, then to a dinner and the whole evening was so good I decided to go to sleep with him. We had sex for a couple of times during that night, it wasn’t amazing but it wasn’t terrible either, I felt like it was mostly about his pleasure and he came fast, I don’t know, maybe he was nervous, we didn’t talk about it, kissed and cuddled. In the morning we went for a breakfast together and for a walk and I came back to my house.

He send me a text and I responded to him about my day and meeting with my parents and asked him about his afternoon and he left me on read for about 35h - I was really pissed and felt used but then I saw he texted me with very dry and weird „wyd?:p”

And I don’t know how to handle this? It’s very low effort for me, I don’t know what to Think about it, but maybe im overreacting? Should I adress it? Ask him about it?

I don’t want to come as needy, pls help",0,1758608456.0,dating_advice,9,0.5,False

We've got some interest from a dive through coffee shop to either purchase or sign a ground lease however they only require a half-acre. For the remaining 1Acre we have been considering a car wash.
