1ly47pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ly47pm/reveal_the_best_features_of_the_mueller_dc550x/,Reveal the best features of the Mueller DC-550x Green Coffee Maker review!,"Testing the MÜLLERHOME DC-550x Green drip coffee maker over several weeks felt a little like embarking on a morning coffee adventure. The design of this product is what initially caught my eye. Its bold green color brings a playful touch to an often overlooked kitchen accessory. I wasn’t sure about a vibrant coffee maker at first, but it ended up complementing my kitchen’s decor surprisingly well. The dimensions are reasonably compact (9.25""D x 6.9""W x 12""H), meaning it doesn’t hog counter space, which is always appreciated in a smaller kitchen like mine.

**User-Friendly Design for Busy Mornings**  
Getting the first pot of coffee ready with this drip machine wasn’t complicated at all. The clear water level window saves you from overfilling disasters, and the automatic shut-off feature is a game changer for those moments you’re halfway out the door and can’t remember if you turned it off. The glass carafe feels sturdy enough; it’s made of borosilicate glass, which means it’s good at resisting heat and odors. While brewing for a larger crew, I appreciated its 12-cup capacity—it handled family brunches without breaking a sweat.

**Advantages**  
What stood out to me during testing was how convenient the reusable filter turned out to be. No crumpled disposable filters to deal with, which not only saved money but also reduced waste. This filter was a breeze to clean, and it also seemed to contribute to an evenly flavored pot of coffee. Here are some highlights:  
- Borosilicate glass carafe resists odors and keeps coffee hot longer.  
- Reusable filter saves money and reduces waste.  
- Automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and energy efficiency.  
- Large 12-cup capacity makes it perfect for gatherings.  

**Shortcomings**  
Although this coffee maker has charm, it’s not entirely without its quirks. The brewing process is not what you’d call lightning-quick; the wait feels longer when you’re in need of caffeine ASAP. Also, while the keep-warm function performs reasonably well, I noticed the coffee losing its peak warmth after roughly 90 minutes, despite the claim of a 2-hour retention.  
- Brewing time could be quicker.  
- Keep-warm feature doesn’t maintain high heat for the full 2 hours.  

**Who Should Consider This Coffee Maker?**  
This drip coffee machine has an air of accessibility that makes it appealing to a wide audience. Whether you’re someone who simply wants a no-fuss appliance to rely on each morning or a casual entertainer, it fits most lifestyles. Eco-conscious users will love the reusable filter and the sturdy, heat-resistant carafe. However, if you’re someone who prizes speed above all else, there may be better options available for your morning routine.

**Comparative Insight with Competitors**  
Competitors like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single Serve take a slightly different angle. The Mr. Coffee model boasts simplicity and speed, while the FlexBrew offers versatility for single cups. Compared to those, the MÜLLERHOME DC-550x has a slightly better build quality with its borosilicate carafe and green styling, but it lacks the single-serve flexibility that some may prefer. Where it shines is the mix of aesthetics, eco-friendliness, and ease of use. While the brewing speed isn’t its strong suit, the coffee’s flavor ranks high among similar price point models.

**Smart Spending**  
From a value standpoint, this coffee maker is deceptively good. It brings enough features to the table to rival higher-priced competitors. The inclusion of the reusable filter adds significant long-term savings, particularly if you’re someone who goes through coffee filters like candy wrappers. It doesn’t overpromise on extras, which is refreshing, aiming instead at delivering the basics with precision. If you’re on the fence, this product strikes a good balance between quality and affordability.

Here’s what went down this week across GMR:

🎯 LeetLotto Improvements

Base and BNB chains are fully live with more visible design tweaks rolling out soon.

Each lotto now shows locked status, ticket price, jackpot amount, and more — visible even before opening the detail view.

Plans for a new dashboard are underway to showcase trending and featured lottos, chains, and live draws in one place.

Cross-chain lotto visibility is still in progress and remains a top priority.

📹 Stream Client Almost Live

The OBS-style stream client is nearly released and already in use.

Users can log in with GMR Center, multistream to Twitch, Kick, and YouTube, and customize overlays with drag-and-drop elements.

Feature set includes live chat visibility, viewer count, event notifications, and more.

No stream key setup required — login handles everything.

A standalone website for the client will go live soon with marketing and instructions.

📬 Community Engagement

Coffee Mornings continue each Saturday as a casual space to hang with the devs and discuss updates.

Meme of the Week is officially retired due to low engagement — will be replaced with higher-impact campaigns.

GMR Twitter account will start engaging with other projects more actively to boost visibility.

🧰 Platform Upgrades

The social timeline is getting closer to its full redesign — now supports separate tabs for original posts, replies, reposts, and media.

Channel verification system in development, which will tie into future tools for verified creators.

NFT Explorer is returning soon with added filters, multi-chain support, and smart contract connections.

🎮 Game Development and Ecosystem

Battle Leet PvP is nearly ready for soft launch and will include mini NFTs and ad-based earnings.

A test version is expected next week.

Gamerverse early 2D version is still in conceptual stages — long-term goal is a full 3D farming sim with Gamerverse asset support.

Game asset continuity remains a guiding principle across all planned titles.

🗳 Next Feature Vote

With stream client released, a new round of community voting on development priorities will open soon.

Timeline overhaul and lotto dashboard are likely frontrunners.

Regular dev chats, community polls, and feature votes will continue weekly to guide progress.

Thanks again to everyone who showed up — solid updates, real momentum, and more to come!",1,1752336620.0,GMRCenter,0,1.0,False

I'll explain it, even if it's a short story:

A week ago, I went to starbucks to get a coffee before work, I then went to my local bus stop, where an older looking man was sitting, reading something on his phone.

I accidentally tripped and spilled my coffee on his pants and lower shirt. I apologized profusely, but it seemed like he was having a bad day… he stood up and glared at me, then raised his hands at me and started saying something in gibberish (I guess an incantation???) and then he hands started to glow. When he finished, he just grunted and teleported away.

Ever since then, things have been terrible for me. I lost my job, many of my devices are failing on me, my toaster and microwave exploded, a car ran over my foot, I trip on shit all the time, it's been terrible…

1ly43wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ly43wa/dance_upon_the_air_by_nora_roberts/,Dance Upon the Air  by Nora Roberts:,"She kept staring straight ahead as the knuckle of land, bumpy and green with distance, began revealing its secrets. The lighthouse, of course. What was an offshore New England island without its stalwart spear? This one, pure and dazzling white, rose on a craggy cliff. Just as it should, Nell thought.  
  
  There was a stone house near it, fog-gray in the sharp summer sunlight, with peaked roofs and gables and what she hoped was a widow's walk circling the top story.  
  
  She'd seen paintings of the Light of the Sisters and the house that stood so strong and firm beside it. It was the one she'd seen in the little shop on the mainland, the one that had sent her impulsively to the car ferry.  
  
  She'd been following impulse and instinct for six months, just two months after her meticulous and hard-worked plan had freed her.  
  
  Every moment of those first two months had been terror. Then, gradually, terror had eased to anxiety, and a different kind of fear, almost like a hunger, that she would lose what she had found again.  
  
  She had died so she could live.  
  
  Now she was tired of running, of hiding, of losing herself in crowded cities. She wanted a home. Wasn't that what she'd always wanted? A home, roots, family, friends. The familiar that never judged too harshly.  
  
  Maybe she would find some part of that here, on this spit of land cradled by the sea. Surely she could get no farther away from Los Angeles than this pretty little island-not unless she left the country altogether.  
  
  If she couldn't find work on the island, she could still take a few days there. A kind of vacation from flight, she decided. She would enjoy the rocky beaches, the little village, she would climb the cliffs and roam the thick wedge of forest.  
  
  She'd learned how to celebrate and cherish every moment of being. It was something she would never, ever forget again.  
  
  Delighted with the scatter of clapboard cottages tucked back from the dock, she leaned on the rail of the ferry, let the wind blow through her hair. It was back to its natural sun-drenched blond. When she'd run, she'd hacked it short as a boy's, gleefully snipping off the long, tumbling curls, then dying it deep brown. Over the past months, she'd changed the color periodically-bright red, coal black, a soft sable brown. She still kept it fairly short and very straight.  
  
  It said something, didn't it, that she'd finally been able to let it be. Something about reclaiming herself, she thought.  
  
  Evan had liked it long, with a riot of curls. At times he had dragged her by it, across the floor, down the stairs. Using it like chains.  
  
  No, she would never wear it long again.  
  
  A shudder ran through her, and she glanced quickly over her shoulder, scanning the cars, the people. Her mouth went dry, her throat hot as she searched for a tall, slim man with gilded hair and eyes as pale and hard as glass.  
  
  He wasn't there, of course. He was three thousand miles away. She was dead to him. Hadn't he told her a hundred times that the only way she would be free of him was in death?  
  
  Helen Remington had died so Nell Channing could live.  
  
  Furious with herself for going back, even for a moment in her mind, Nell tried to calm herself. She breathed in slowly. Salt air, water. Freedom.  
  
  As her shoulders relaxed again, a tentative smile played around her mouth. She stayed at the rail, a small woman with short, sunny hair that danced cheerfully around a delicate face. Her mouth, unpainted and soft, curved up and teased out the hint of dimples in her cheeks. Pleasure brought a rosy glow to her skin.  
  
  She wore no makeup, another deliberate act. There was a part of her that was still hiding, still hunted, and she did whatever she could to pass unnoticed.  
  
  Once she had been considered a beauty, and had groomed herself accordingly. She'd dressed as she'd been told to dress, wearing sleek, sexy, sophisticated clothes selected by a man who claimed to love her above all things. She'd known the feel of silk against her skin, what it was to casually clasp diamonds around her throat. Helen Remington had known all the privileges of great wealth.  
  
  And for three years had lived in fear and misery.  
  
  Nell wore a simple cotton shirt over faded jeans. Her feet were comfortable in cheap white sneakers. Her only jewelry was an antique locket that had been her mother's.  
  
  Some things were too precious to leave behind.  
  
  As the ferry slowed to dock, she walked back to her car. She would arrive on Three Sisters with one small bag of belongings, a rusted secondhand Buick, and $208 to her name.  
  
  She couldn't have been happier.  
  
  Nothing, she thought as she parked the car near the docks and began to wander on foot, could have been farther from the pleasure palaces and glitz of Beverly Hills. And nothing, she realized, had ever called more truly to her soul than this little postcard village. Houses and shops were both tidy and prim with their colors faded by sea salt and sun. Cobblestone streets were curvy and whistle-clean as they climbed the hilly terrain or arrowed back to the docks.  
  
  Gardens were lovingly tended, as if weeds were illegal. Dogs barked behind picket fences and children rode bikes of cherry red and electric blue.  
  
  The docks themselves were a study in industry. Boats and nets and ruddy-cheeked men in tall rubber boots. She could smell fish and sweat.  
  
  She hiked up the hill from the docks and turned to look back. From there she could see the tour boats plugging along in the bay, and the little sickle slash of sand beach where people spread out on towels or bobbed in the energetic surf. A little red tram with white letters that read THREE SISTERS TOURS was rapidly filling up with day-trippers and their cameras.  
  
  Fishing and tourism, she supposed, were what kept the island afloat. But that was economics. It stood against sea, storms, and time, surviving and flourishing at its own pace. That, she thought, was courage.  
  
  It had taken her too long to find her own.  
  
  High Street speared across the hill. Shops and restaurants and what she supposed were island businesses lined it. One of the restaurants should be her first stop, she thought. It was possible she could hook a job as a waitress or short-order cook, at least for the summer season. If she could find work, she could hunt up a room.  
  
  She could stay.  
  
  In a few months, people would know her. They'd wave as she walked by, or call out her name. She was so tired of being a stranger, of having no one to talk to. No one who cared.  
  
  She stopped to study the hotel. Unlike the other buildings it was stone instead of wood. Its three stories with elaborate gingerbread, iron balconies, and peaked roofs were undeniably romantic. The name suited it, she decided. The Magick Inn.  
  
  It was a good bet that she'd find work there. Waitressing in the dining room, or as part of the housekeeping staff. A job was the first order of business.  
  
  But she couldn't make herself go inside, deal with it. She wanted time first, a little time before she settled down to the practical.  
  
  Flighty, Evan would have said. You're much too flighty and foolish for your own good, Helen. Thank God you have me to take care of you.  
  
  Because his voice played all too clearly in her ears, because the words nipped at the confidence she'd slowly rebuilt, she turned deliberately away and walked in the opposite direction.  
  
  She would get a damn job when she was ready to, but for now she was going to wander, to play tourist, to explore. When she was finished roaming High Street, she'd go back to her car and drive all over the island. She wouldn't even stop at the Island Tourist Board to get a map.  
  
  Following her nose, she hitched up her backpack and crossed the street. She passed craft shops, gift shops, loitered at the windows. She enjoyed pretty things that sat on shelves without purpose. One day, when she settled again, she'd make a home just as she pleased, full of clutter and fun and color.  
  
  An ice cream shop made her smile. There were round glass tables and white iron chairs. A family of four sat at one, laughing as they spooned up wh  
ipped cream and confetti-colored sprinkles. A boy wearing a white cap and apron stood behind the counter, and a girl in snug cutoff jeans flirted with him as she considered her choices.  
  
  Nell sketched the picture in her mind and walked on.  
  
  The bookstore stopped her, made her sigh. Her home would be full of books, too, but not rare first editions never meant to be opened and read. She'd have old, scarred books, shiny new paperbacks all in a jumble of stories. In fact, that was one thing she could start now. A paperback novel wouldn't add much weight to her pack if she had to move on.  
  
  She looked up from the display in the window to the Gothic lettering spilling across the glass. Cafe Book. Well, that was perfect. She would hunt through the stacks, find something fun to read, and look through it over a cup of coffee.  
  
  She stepped inside to air that was fragrant with flowers and spice, and heard music played on pipes and harps. Not only the hotel was magic, Nell thought the minute she crossed the threshold.  
  
  Books, in a banquet of colors and shapes, lined deep blue shelves. Overhead, tiny pricks of light showered down from the ceiling like stars. The checkout counter was an old oak cabinet, deeply carved with winged faeries and crescent moons.  
  
  A woman with dark, choppy hair sat on a high stool behind it, idly paging through a book. She glanced up and adjusted silver-framed reading glasses.  
  
  ""Morning. Can I help you?""  
  
  ""I'm just going to look around, if that's all right. ""  
  
  ""Enjoy. Let me know if I can help you find anything. ""  
  
  As the clerk went back to her book, Nell roamed. Across the room two generous chairs faced a stone hearth. On the table between stood a lamp fashioned from a figurine of a robed woman with her arms lifted high. Other shelves held trinkets, statues of colored stone, crystal eggs, dragons. She wandered through, passing books on one side, rows of candles on the other.  
  
  At the rear, stairs curved to the second floor. She climbed and found more books, more trinkets, and the cafe.  
  
  Half a dozen tables of glossy wood were arranged near the front window. Along the side was a glass display and counter boasting an impressive array of pastries, sandwiches, and a kettle of that day's soup. The prices were on the high side, but not unreasonable. Nell thought she might have some soup to go with her coffee.  
  
  Moving closer, she heard the voices from the open door behind the counter.  
  
  ""Jane, this is ridiculous, and totally irresponsible. ""  
  
  ""It is not. It's Tim's big chance, and it's a way off this damn island. We're taking it. ""  
  
  ""The possibility of an audition for a play that may or may not be produced Off Broadway is not a big chance. Neither one of you will have a job. You won't-""  
  
  ""We're going, Mia. I told you I'd work till noon today, and I worked till noon. ""  
  
  ""You told me that less than twenty-four hours ago. ""  
  
  There was impatience in the voice-a low, lovely voice. Unable to help herself, Nell edged closer.  
  
  ""How the hell am I going to keep the cafe up without anyone to cook?""  
  
  ""It's all about you, isn't it? You can't even wish us luck. ""  
  
  ""Jane, I'll wish you a miracle, because that's what it's going to take. No, wait-don't go off in a huff. ""  
  
  Nell caught movement in the doorway and stepped to the side. But she didn't move out of earshot.  
  
  ""Be careful. Be happy. Oh, damn it. Blessed be, Jane. ""  
  
  ""Okay. "" There was a loud sniffle. ""I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry for leaving you in the lurch this way. But Tim needs to do this, and I need to be with Tim. So. . . I'll miss you, Mia. I'll write. ""  
  
  Nell managed to duck behind shelves just as a weeping woman raced out of the back and ran down the stairs.  
  
  ""Well, isn't this just fine. ""  
  
  Nell peeked out, blinked in automatic admiration.  
  
  The woman who stood in the doorway was a vision. Nell couldn't think of another word for her. She had a mass of hair the color of autumn leaves. Reds and golds spilled over the shoulders of a long blue dress that left her arms bare to the silver bracelets that winked bright on each wrist. Her eyes, sparking with temper, were gray as smoke and dominated a flawless face. Slashing cheekbones, a full, wide mouth painted siren red. Skin like. . . Nell had heard skin compared to alabaster, but this was the first time she'd seen it.  
  
  She was tall, willow-slim and perfect.  
  
  Nell glanced toward the cafe tables to see if any of the customers who loitered there were as awestruck as she herself. But no one seemed to notice the woman or the temper swirling around her like water on the boil.  
  
  She inched out to get a better look, and those gray eyes shifted. Pinned her.  
  
  ""Hello. Can I help you?""  
  
  ""I was. . . I thought. . . I'd like a cup of cappuccino and a bowl of soup. Please. ""  
  
  Annoyance flashed in Mia's eyes and nearly sent Nell back behind the shelves. ""I can handle the soup. We have lobster bisque today. I'm afraid the espresso machine is beyond my current capabilities. ""  
  
  Nell looked at the beautiful copper-and-brass machine, felt a little tingle. ""I could make it myself. ""  
  
  ""You know how to work this thing?""  
  
  ""Yes, actually, I do. ""  
  
  Considering, Mia gestured and Nell scurried behind the counter.  
  
  ""I could make you one while I'm at it. ""  
  
  ""Why not?"" Brave little rabbit, Mia mused, as she watched Nell take over the machine. ""Just what sent you to my door? Backpacking?""  
  
  ""No. Oh. "" Nell flushed, remembering her pack. ""No, just exploring a little. I'm looking for a job, and a room. ""  
  
  ""Ah. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me, I know it was rude, but I overheard your. . . conversation. If I understand it correctly, you're in a bit of a jam. I can cook. ""  
  
  Mia watched the steam rise, listened to the hiss. ""Can you?""  
  
  ""I'm a very good cook. "" Nell offered Mia the frothing coffee. ""I've done catering, I've worked in a bakery, and I've waitressed. I know how to prepare food and how to serve it. ""  
  
  ""How old are you?""  
  
  ""Twenty-eight. ""  
  
  ""Do you have a criminal record?""  
  
  A giggle nearly burst out of Nell's throat. For a moment it danced lively in her eyes. ""No. I'm tediously honest, a dependable worker and a creative cook. ""  
  
  Don't babble, don't babble! she ordered herself, but she couldn't seem to stop. ""I need the job because I'd like to live on the island. I'd like a job here because I enjoy books and I liked the, well, the feel of your shop as soon as I walked in. ""  
  
  Intrigued, Mia angled her head. ""And what did you feel?""  
  
  ""Possibilities. ""  
  
  Excellent answer, Mia mused. ""Do you believe in possibilities?""  
  
  Nell considered. ""Yes. I've had to. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me?"" A couple stepped up to the counter. ""We'd like to have two iced mochas and two of those eclairs. ""  
  
  ""Of course. Just a moment. "" Mia turned back to Nell. ""You're hired. Apron's in the back. We'll work out the details later today. "" She sipped her cappuccino. ""Well done,"" she added and stepped out of the way. ""Oh-what's your name?""  
  
  ""I'm Nell. Nell Channing. ""  
  
  ""Welcome to Three Sisters, Nell Channing. ""  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Mia Devlin ran Cafe Book the way she ran her life. With a style born out of instinct, and largely for her personal amusement. She was a crafty businesswoman who enjoyed making a profit. But always on her own terms.  
  
  What bored her, she ignored. What intrigued her, she pursued.  
  
  At the moment, Nell Channing intrigued her.  
  
  If Nell had been exaggerating her skills, Mia would have fired her as quickly as she'd hired her, and with no regret. She may have, if the spirit moved her, helped Nell secure a job elsewhere. But that wouldn't have taken much time, or interfered with her business.  
  
  She'd have taken that step only because something about Nell had tugged at her the instant those big blue eyes met hers.  
  
  Injured innocence. That had been Mia's first impression,  
and she trusted her first impressions implicitly. Competence as well, Mia thought, though the confidence was a little shaky.  
  
  Still, once Nell had suited up and started work at the cafe"", she'd steadied in that area, too.  
  
  Mia observed her through the afternoon, noted that she handled the food orders, the customers, the cash register, and the baffling mystery of the espresso machine smoothly.  
  
  They'd need to spruce her up a bit, Mia decided. They were casual on the island, but the ancient jeans were a bit too laid-back for Mia's personal taste.  
  
  Satisfied for the moment, Mia walked back into the cafe kitchen. It impressed her that the counters and appliances were clean. Jane had never managed to be a tidy cook, even though most of the baked goods had been prepared by her off-site.  
  
  ""Nell?""  
  
  Taken by surprise, Nell jolted and spun around from the stove, where she'd been scrubbing burners. Her cheeks flushed as she looked at Mia and the young woman beside her.  
  
  ""Didn't mean to startle you. This is Peg. She works the counter from two to seven. ""  
  
  ""Oh. Hello. ""  
  
  ""Hi. Jeez, I can't believe Jane and Tim are just leaving. New York City!"" Peg sounded a bit envious. She was little and perky, with a mop of curly hair bleached nearly white. ""Jane made awesome blueberry muffins. ""  
  
  ""Yes, well, Jane and her muffins aren't here anymore. I need to talk to Nell now, so you're in charge of the cafe. ""  
  
  ""No problem. Catch you later, Nell. ""  
  
  ""Why don't we use my office? We'll get to those details. We're open from ten to seven, summer hours. In the winter we cut back and close at five. Peg prefers the afternoon shift. She likes to party and isn't a morning person. In any case, since we start serving at ten, I'll need you here in the morning. ""  
  
  ""That's okay with me. "" She followed Mia up another flight of steps. She hadn't paid attention, Nell realized. She hadn't known the shop had three floors. A few months before, she would never have missed that detail. She'd have checked out the space, the exits.  
  
  Relaxing didn't mean getting sloppy, she reminded herself. She had to be ready, at any time, to run again.  
  
  They passed a large storeroom, lined with bookshelves and stacked with boxes, then went through a doorway into Mia's office.  
  
  The antique cherry desk suited her, Nell thought. She imagined Mia surrounded by the rich and the beautiful. There were flowers here, and thriving plants, little bits of crystal and polished rocks in bowls. Along with the stylish furnishings were a top-of-the-line computer, a fax, filing cabinets, and shelves for publishers' catalogs. Mia gestured to a chair and took the one behind the desk for herself.  
  
  ""You had a few hours in the cafe, so you've seen the type of fare we offer. There's a specialty sandwich each day, the day's soup, a small selection of alternate sandwiches. Two or three varieties of cold salads. Pastries, cookies, muffins, biscotti. In the past  
  
  I left the menu choices up to the cook. Are you comfortable with that?""  
  
  ""Yes, ma'am. ""  
  
  ""Please, I'm barely a year older than you. It's Mia. Until we're sure this is going to work, I'd prefer you make up the next day's menu for my approval. "" She took a legal pad out of the drawer, passed it across the desk. ""Why don't you write down what you have in mind for tomorrow?""  
  
  Panic wanted to crawl through her, tremble in her fingers. Nell took a deep breath, waited until her mind was blank and clear, then began to write. ""This time of year, I think we should keep the soups light. Herbed consomme. Tortellini salad, a white bean, and a shrimp. I'd do a spiced-chicken pita for the sandwich, and a vegetarian selection, but I'd have to see what's in season. I can make you tarts, again depending on what looks good fruit-wise. The eclairs are popular-I can duplicate those. A six-layer chocolate-and-cream torte. Awesome blueberry muffins, as well as walnut. You're low on hazelnut biscotti. Cookies? Chocolate chip is never wrong. Macadamia. Instead of a third cookie, I'd offer brownies. I make an irresistible triple-fudge brownie. ""  
  
  ""How much can you prepare on-site?""  
  
  ""All of it, I guess. But if you're going to serve the pastries and muffins starting at ten, I'll need to start about six. ""  
  
  ""If you had your own kitchen?""  
  
  ""Oh, well. "" What a lovely fantasy that was. ""I'd prep some of the menu the night before, bake fresh in the morning. ""  
  
  ""Um-hmm. How much money do you have, Nell Channing?""  
  
  ""Enough. ""  
  
  ""Don't be prickly,"" Mia advised breezily. ""I can advance you a hundred dollars. Going against a salary, to start, of seven an hour. You'll log your shopping, cooking hours daily. You'll charge what you need, food-wise, to the store's account. I'll want the receipts, again daily. ""  
  
  When Nell opened her mouth to speak, Mia simply lifted one slim, coral-tipped finger. ""Wait. You'll be expected to serve and to clear tables when there's a rush, and to assist customers in the book section on your level during lulls. You get two half-hour breaks, Sundays off, and a fifteen percent employee discount on purchases, not including food or drink-which unless you turn out to be a glutton, will be part of your perks. With me so far?""  
  
  ""Yes, but I-""  
  
  ""Good. I'm here every day. If you have a question or problem you can't handle, get me. If I'm not available, go to Lulu. She's usually at the counter on the main floor, and she knows everything. You look quick enough to catch on; if you don't know an answer, don't be afraid to ask. Now, you're looking for a place to stay. ""  
  
  ""Yes. "" It was like being swept away by a fast, unexpected wind. ""I hope to-""  
  
  ""Come with me. "" Mia pulled a set of keys out of a drawer, pushed away from the desk and clipped out-she wore gorgeous, needle-thin heels, Nell noted.  
  
  Once they were on the main level, she walked straight toward a rear door. ""Lulu!"" she called out. ""Back in ten. ""  
  
  Feeling clumsy and foolish, Nell followed her through the back exit and into a small garden paved with stepping-stones. A huge black cat sunned itself on one of them and blinked open one luminous gold eye as Mia stepped nimbly over.  
  
  ""That's Isis. She won't trouble you. ""  
  
  ""She's beautiful. Is the garden your work?""  
  
  ""Yes. No place is a home without flowers. Oh, I didn't ask-do you have transportation?""  
  
  ""Yes, I have a car. It can loosely be called transportation. ""  
  
  ""That's handy. You won't have far to go, but it'd be troublesome to cart your goods on foot every day. "" At the edge of the lot she turned left, kept up her brisk pace, passed the backs of shops, across from neatly kept houses.  
  
  ""Ms. -I'm sorry, I don't know your last name. ""  
  
  ""It's Devlin, but I told you to call me Mia. ""  
  
  ""Mia, I'm grateful for the job. For the chance. And I can promise you, you won't be sorry. But. . . can I ask where we're going?""  
  
  ""You need a place. "" She turned a corner, stopped and gestured. ""That should do it. ""  
  
  Across the narrow side street sat a little yellow house, like a cheerful sunbeam at the edge of a tiny grove of stunted trees. The shutters were white, as was the narrow strip of porch. There were flowers there, too, in a happy dance of bright summer colors.  
  
  It sat back from the road on a neat square of lawn with trees tucking it into shade and dappled sunlight.  
  
  ""Is this your house?"" Nell asked.  
  
  ""Yes. For the moment. "" Jingling the keys, Mia walked up the flagstone path. ""I bought it last spring. ""  
  
  Had been compelled to, Mia remembered. An investment, she'd told herself. Though she, a businesswoman down to the bone, had done nothing so far about renting it out. She'd waited, just as, she understood, the house had waited.  
  
  She unlocked the front door, stepped back. ""It's been blessed. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me?""  
  
  Mia only nodded. ""Welcome. ""  
  
  The furnishings were sparse. A simple sofa that desperately needed re-covering, a deep-cushioned chair, a scatter of tables.  
  
  ""Bedrooms on either side, though the one to the left is more suited to an office or study. The bathroom's  
minute, but charming, and the kitchen's been modernized and should do very well. It's straight back. I've worked on the gardens, but they need more care. There's no AC, but the furnace works. Still, you'll be glad the fireplace works as well come January. ""  
  
  ""It's wonderful. "" Unable to resist, Nell wandered, poking her head in the main bedroom where a pretty bed with a white iron headboard stood. ""Like a fairy cottage. You must love living here. ""  
  
  ""I don't live here. You do. ""  
  
  Nell turned back, slowly. There was Mia, in the center of the little room, her hands cupped together with the keys in her palm. Light beamed through the two front windows and seemed to set her hair to flame.  
  
  ""I don't understand. ""  
  
  ""You need a place, I have a place. I live on the cliffs. I prefer it there. This is your place, for now. Don't you feel it?""  
  
  She only knew she felt happy, and full of nerves at the same time. And that the moment she'd stepped into the house, she'd wanted to stretch and settle, very much like the cat in the sunshine.  
  
  ""I can stay here?""  
  
  ""Life's been hard, hasn't it?"" Mia murmured. ""That you'd tremble at good fortune. You'll pay rent, for nothing that comes free holds its value. We'll work the terms out of your salary. Settle in. You'll have to come back and sign forms and so on. But that can wait for the morning. Island Market is your best source for the ingredients you'll need for tomorrow's menu. I'll let them know you're coming, so you can charge to the store account. Any pots, pans, whatever are your expense, but I'll float that until the end of the month. I expect to see you, and your creations, by nine-thirty sharp. ""  
  
  She stepped over and dropped the keys into Nell's limp hand. ""Any questions?""  
  
  ""Too many to know where to begin. I don't know how to thank you. ""  
  
  ""Don't waste your tears, little sister,"" Mia replied. ""They're too precious. You'll work hard for what you make here. ""  
  
  ""I can't wait to get started. "" Nell held out her hand. ""Thank you, Mia. ""  
  
  Their hands touched, clasped. A spark snapped out, blue as flame and quickly gone. With a half laugh, Nell jerked back. ""Must be a lot of static, or something, in the air. ""  
  
  ""Or something. Well, welcome home, Nell. "" Turning, Mia started for the door.  
  
  ""Mia. "" Emotion gathered in her throat, ached there. ""I said this was like a fairy cottage. You must be my fairy godmother. ""  
  
  Mia's smile was dazzling, and her laughter low and rich as warmed cream. ""You'll find out soon enough I'm far from it. I'm just a practical witch. Don't forget to bring me the receipts,"" she added and quietly closed the door behind her.

1ly41qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMSTherapy/comments/1ly41qo/my_tms_experience_31_out_of_36_sessions/,my tms experience: 31 out of 36 sessions,"hello lovely people of this sub !

i just finished my 31st treatment of 36 and wanted to post an update for people who are looking into or starting treatment to have more info if they want.

just for more information: i have been being treated on my left side via Neurostar for depression but have other diagnoses since before treatment: GAD and Anorexia Nervosa, and i was more recently diagnosed with moderate OCD and combined ADHD. no history with any psychosis symptoms. i had previous tried two SSRIs: sertraline aka zoloft  (caused panic attacks, nausea) and fluoxetine aka prozac (worked for a bit, then nothing, even after upping dosage). and was currently on my first SSNRI, duloxetine aka Cymbalta, for a few years, had worked my way up to the highest dosage and similarly it stopped feeling effective. i discussed going on Buproprion aka Wellbutrin (an NDRI) with my psychistrist right before i started my treatment but decided to wait until after, to be able to distinguish if the effects i had were due to TMS or the new 'add-on' to boost the SSNRI. i have hydroxyzine aka atarax for as-needed panic attacks and insomnia. i Rarely take this, but i do end up using it during treatment. i also take B12 as a nervous little vegetarian who is low on energy.

my routine is as follows, with reflection on a lot: 

I do my best to wake around 7am (3+ hours before treatment) but admittedly i am horrible at sleeping (falling asleep, staying asleep and waking up) so it's not the most consistent. about 2/5 days of the week i may sleep in till closer to 9am (1h15 before treatment). there have been 4 days where i have either woken up too late to get there one time or even after my appointment time where i have contacted the clinic to reschedule, and they have always been able to accomodate me to come in that afternoon. my clinic was also closed for juneteenth and for the fourth of july so there have been some days off.

at least a few days out of the week i get some exercise in the morning: low-medium intensity yoga or just some stretches/push-ups depending on the day. I have been trying to stay active during treatment and will do yoga at night if i can't get to it in the morning. on the weekends i go on longer walks or go hiking. 

i get dressed in whatever makes me feel confident/will get me out of the house and make sure i have eaten (usually something with protein but not always), had some water, my meds, and i chose to have a matcha latte as part of my routine. i am an ex-barista who sometimes gets anxious on a cup of coffee so i made the desicion to take a break during my treatment to keep my caffiene levels consistent, as before i would drink espresso/drip coffee about 4 days out of the week.

i usually take the bus to get to my appointment. i like public transport and like the short 5-10 minute walk between locations and bus stops. i have found these to be grounding (more about this later).

i listen to music/audio books/podcasts (non-news related) in the waiting rooms/in transit.

the clinic i go to has me fill out a form to check on having metal in or around my head (i have 10 piercings and never have had an issue), changes to my sleep, appetite, caffiene, medication use, substance use, suicidal ideation/thoughts/plans and some other things i am sure i am forgetting. i am always honest about when i have experienced suicidal ideation but haven't made serious plans/needed emergency intervention. there was one day i was too much of a rush to make my matcha and the tech said it would be fine and didn't readjust me. there was also one day i had taken my hydroxyzine the night before and that lead to then recalibrating my motor threshold for that day and then doing that again the next day to get me back to baseline.

i only took tylenol the first week and a half maybe, and somewhat inconsistently. i am somewhat used to just toughing it through a headache day, but i did experience some in the first week when i didn't take it and so wanted to minimize that.

i am sometimes offered a blanket when the room is cold (i like being cold, especially in the humid summer) and have only taken it once and moreso for comfort on a rough day.

i am always asked to confirm my name and birthday

i am seated in what is a spa-chair. my head is stabilized and i wear silly glasses they have as a tool to line me up. i get a bit animal-brain panicky sometimes when i can't move my head but i think having my book that i want to focus on helps keep it out of my mind. there was one time i was already secured and they had a second person enter the room to help with my motor-threshold and i couldn't turn to see them and it freaked me out a little but they came to the center of the room and that helped me not panic unnecessarily.

i have been bringing graphic novels to read (the complete Moomin collection, Watchmen, Tea Dragon Society, Tea Dragon Festival), but have watched tv twice, once while distracted by the Great British Bake-off left playing by the last patient, and once because i forgot my book i chose Cunk on Earth. one of the first technicians that saw me (i have not had a very consistent tech, especially having to reschedule sometimes and with the clinic i'm going to training people up as they are opening a second location) offered me a pillow they have left on a chair of each room to help me prop-up the book as i am reclined and have my head stabilized. since i chose to read huge and sometimes heavy/awkward books, i often have to reposition to see all of the panels, but i am pretty careful not to strain my wrists as i have tendonitis in my wrists.

at first i was on 20 minutes of little pulses with little breaks. the first day i felt it kind of spread out on my scalp and described it like a tingling/not-quite-burn of having hair bleach on my sensitive scalp for too long. i'd say the wood-pecker tapping is pretty accurate to what it typically felt like. never painful but somewhat uncomfortable. i often feel it in my muscles through the top of my scalp, my forehead (especially toward to right side), under my eyebrows and to the tip of my nose. there was a few times i kinda felt it toward my jaw but that was rare.

eventually, around treatment 25 i was switched to three sets of 5 minutes of somewhat more-intense bursts. there are maybe a bit more toward painful but still pretty much just uncomfortable. they are almost more like a buzzing than a tapping. the first one always makes me flinch just a little but as long as i am interested in what i am reading i am usually fine.

especially during my second and third week of treatment, returning to upright and standing up would make me a bit light-headed. this triggers a feeling of dissociation for me (i have experienced dissociation and this trigger before, and light-headedness in the past). the lighted-headedness nor the dissociation would last more than a few minutes. i was fine to walk down the stairs within seconds of getting out of the chair, and was able to ground myself a bit by walking (grounding techniques i'm practiced using before, mostly based on my senses). i reported my light-headedness to my technicians and they would say that this could sometimes be a response, but to let them know if it was lasting long or if it wasn't going away but since it happened inconsistently for 6 or so days across the span of weeks i never got too concerned about it personally. i do wish that since they admitted that it wasn't unheard of that it would have been mentioned during intake more. i think especially if i was unfamiliar with dealing with lightheadedness or if i were driving or many other possibilities, this side-effect may have been rougher on me. i'm grateful it only happened a few days, if it were more/hadn't let up i would have spoken up or reconsidered continuing.

i would often feel pretty tired after my treatment upon returning home, especially a bought around the third week of treatment. i am recovering from burnout so this wasn't an  unfamiliar feeling for me, and i am currently unemployed so it hasn't been an issue aside from it resulting in my over-sleeping and missing a tele-health therapy appointment once, which is also something i may have done without the side-effects of treatment. i also have never been a good sleeper and this has been unchanged during treatment so it's possible i'm just catching up on lost sleep. however, i again, still wish that this was mentioned more as a possible side-effect.

nearing the midpoint of my treatment i have started donating plasma, this also makes me tired so i have been taking it into account less.

i could not say if i've experienced a genuine dip. i had some extremely low days around treatment 11 and treatment 29, but i'm pretty confident these were moreso reactions to my pretty tumoltuous life at the moment, regarding burnout, unemployment, finances and housing as well as my personal relationships, and being a queer and non-binary person experiencing this state of the world in the US. 

during my treatment i have been journaling on levels/quality of sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, and interest in hobbies and socialization. my sleep and appetite are unchanged. i do think my energy and concentration are somewhat increased. when i am awake i am able to do more, starting a task as well as being able to apply myself to a task. a part of what lead to me to treatment was issues with executive dysfunction and the apathy and low-stamina for most tasks. there have been significant, but not drastic changes in this by this point, i would say i started to notice some increase around treatment 20, and i would say i was confident it was increasing by treatment 26. i would say that there is a good increased interest in hobbies. at first, doing most self care felt very mechanical for me for a while but i kept up a regular schedule of self-care. i remember during my eating disorder recovery at first meals felt very mechnical for me but i eventually became more in touch with the joy or interest, so i was to determined to keep trying despite feeling a bit discouraged when things i knew on some level i /liked/ still weren't actually making me happy. i will still often have moments during an activity where i am taken out of it and will spiral or my thoughts will 'grey over' (i use this to describe a vague depressive inner-monologue or the creeping negative thoughts). but there were starting to be more equal parts interest or positive feelings.

my socialization is much the same. i am awkward and insecure. i am trying, and still have some safe-people but find my social anxiety is much unchanged.

i would say, optimisitcally, at the point i am at now, my overall presence of depression is pretty similar, but the levels or impact degree is not quite as drastic. this is encouraging to some degree, but of course i hope for further progress, as i would not consider myself near or at remission.

i have some pretty dramatic life-changes happening, and have been struggling with past mistakes and being hard on myself. however, i am navigating them and finding some minor success which i'm not sure i would have had without my overall mental health treatment. i would note that i have had increased level of care generally, as my tms treatment facility required a therapist, psychiatrist and pcp, so applying to tms and feeling pressure from mounting suicidal intrusive thoughts kickstarted my securing a good mental health team, and regimine. i knew i needed therapy once a week at this point, for example, so i can likely account some of my increased mood/stability toward that as well the way that i forced myself into more healthy habits as best as i could as a sort of hail mary to recover. trying not to put so much hope into this working that i do explode if it doesn't work out but enough trust in it's possibility to want to give it my absolute best shot, if it's the last thing i do. (i'm speaking in hyperbole to some degree here fyi 🫶)

please let me know if this is helpful or if you have any questions !

i will plan on posting at least once more a few weeks after treatment wraps up to assess the effects in completion, and maybe again to see how things last.

sorry, preemptively for being wordy and probably having mistakes or missing things. i will likely edit with additions/corrections :)",1,1752336285.0,TMSTherapy,0,1.0,False

Vegan coffee is becoming increasingly popular among coffee enthusiasts who are looking for dairy-free alternatives while maintaining rich flavors. It embraces the use of plant-based ingredients to create delicious brews that cater to both the vegan lifestyle and lactose-intolerant individuals. This coffee trend offers a variety of options that elevate your coffee experience without sacrificing taste.

One of the simplest ways to enjoy vegan coffee is by using oat, almond, soy, or coconut milk instead of traditional dairy. These plant-based milks not only provide creaminess but also add unique flavors to your brew. Oat milk, for instance, has gained a reputation for its smooth texture, making it a favorite for lattes and cappuccinos. Almond milk, on the other hand, lends a subtle nuttiness that can complement the coffee's natural notes.

Another exciting aspect of vegan coffee is the use of flavored syrups and spices, which can enhance the beverage without compromising its vegan identity. Ingredients like vanilla extract, cinnamon, or even a splash of maple syrup can transform a standard cup of coffee into a gourmet experience while adding delightful complexity to the flavor profile.

When it comes to brewing, many cafés are now offering dedicated vegan coffee drinks, making it easier than ever for consumers to choose plant-based options. Cold brews infused with coconut cream or smoothies with coffee and almond milk are just a few examples of innovative ways to enjoy this vegan delight.

In summary, vegan coffee is not just a trend; it’s a flavorful movement toward inclusivity in the coffee world. With the array of plant-based options available, every coffee lover can indulge while sticking to their dietary preferences. Embrace the richness of vegan coffee and discover a new world of flavors that redefines your coffee experience.

  THE STONE WALLS STOOD AS THEY HAD FOR MORE THAN two centuries, simple, sturdy, and strong. Mined from the hills and the valleys, they rose in testament to man’s inherent desire to leave his mark, to build and create.  
  
  Over those two centuries man married the stone with brick, with wood and glass, enlarging, transforming, enhancing to suit the needs, the times, the whims. Throughout, the building on the crossroads watched as the settlement became a town, as more buildings sprang up.  
  
  The dirt road became asphalt; horse and carriage gave way to cars. Fashions flickered by in the blink of an eye. Still it stood, rising on its corner of The Square, an enduring landmark in the cycle of change.  
  
  It knew war, heard the echo of gunfire, the cries of the wounded, the prayers of the fearful. It knew blood and tears, joy and fury. Birth and death.  
  
  It thrived in good times, endured the hard times. It changed hands and purpose, yet the stone walls stood.  
  
  In time, the wood of its graceful double porches began to sag. Glass broke; mortar cracked and crumbled. Some who stopped at the light on the town square might glance over to see pigeons flutter in and out of broken windows and wonder what the old building had been in its day. Then the light turned green, and they drove on.  
  
  Beckett knew.  
  
  He stood on the opposite corner of The Square, thumbs tucked into the pockets of his jeans. Thick with summer, the air held still. With the road empty, he could have crossed Main Street against the light, but he continued to wait. Opaque blue tarps draped the building from roof to street level, curtaining the front of the building. Over the winter it had served to hold the heat in for the crew. Now it helped block the beat of the sun—and the view.  
  
  But he knew—how it looked at that moment, and how it would look when the rehab was complete. After all, he’d designed it—he, his two brothers, his mother. But the blueprints bore his name as architect, his primary function as a partner in Montgomery Family Contractors.  
  
  He crossed over, his tennis shoes nearly silent on the road in the breathless hush of three a.m. He walked under the scaffolding, along the side of the building, down St. Paul, pleased to see in the glow of the streetlight how well the stone and brick had cleaned up.  
  
  It looked old—it was old, he thought, and that was part of its beauty and appeal. But now, for the first time in his memory, it looked tended.  
  
  He rounded the back, walked over the sunbaked dirt, through the construction rubble scattered over what would be a courtyard. Here the porches that spanned both the second and third stories ran straight and true. Custom-made pickets—designed to replicate those from old photographs of the building, and the remnants found during excavation—hung freshly primed and drying on a length of wire.  
  
  He knew his eldest brother, Ryder, in his role as head contractor, had the rails and pickets scheduled for install.  
  
  He knew because Owen, the middle of the three Montgomery brothers, plagued them all over schedules, calendars, projections, and ledgers—and kept Beckett informed of every nail hammered.  
  
  Whether he wanted to be or not.  
  
  In this case, he supposed as he dug out his key, he wanted to be—usually. The old hotel had become a family obsession.  
  
  It had him by the throat, he admitted as he opened the unfinished and temporary door to what would be The Lobby. And by the heart—and hell, it had him by the balls. No other project they’d ever worked on had ever gotten its hooks in him, in all of them, like this. He suspected none ever would again.  
  
  He hit the switch, and the work light dangling from the ceiling flashed on to illuminate bare concrete floors, roughed-in walls, tools, tarps, material.  
  
  It smelled of wood and concrete dust and, faintly, of the grilled onions someone must have ordered for lunch.  
  
  He’d do a more thorough inspection of the first and second floors in the morning when he had better light. Stupid to have come over at this hour anyway, when he couldn’t really see crap, and was dog tired. But he couldn’t resist it.  
  
  By the balls, he thought again, passing under a wide archway, its edges of stone still rough and exposed. Then, flipping on his flashlight, he headed toward the front and the work steps that led up.  
  
  There was something about the place in the middle of the night, when the noise of nail guns, saws, radios, and voices ended, and the shadows took over. Something not altogether quiet, not altogether still. Something that brushed fingers over the back of his neck.  
  
  Something else he couldn’t resist.  
  
  He swept his light around the second floor, noted the brown-bag backing on the walls. As always, Owen’s report had been accurate. Ry and his crew had the insulation completed on this level.  
  
  Though he’d intended to go straight up, he roamed here with a grin spreading over his sharply boned face, the pleasure of it lighting eyes the color of blue shadows.  
  
  “Coming along,” he said into the silence in a voice gravelly from lack of sleep.  
  
  He moved through the dark, following his beam of light, a tall man with narrow hips, the long Montgomery legs, and the waving mass of brown hair with hints of chestnut that came down from the Riley—his maternal side.  
  
  He had to remind himself that if he kept poking around he’d have to get up before he got to bed, so he climbed up to the third floor.  
  
  “Now that’s what I’m talking about.” Pure delight scattered thoughts of sleep as he traced a finger down the taped seam of freshly hung drywall.  
  
  He played his light over the holes cut out for electric, moved into what would be the innkeeper’s apartment, and noted the same for plumbing in the kitchen and bath. He spent more time wandering through what would be their most elaborate suite, nodding approval at the floating wall dividing the generous space in the bath.  
  
  “You’re a frigging genius, Beck. Now, for God’s sake, go home.”  
  
  But giddy with fatigue and anticipation, he took one more good look before he made his way down the steps.  
  
  He heard it as he reached the second floor. A kind of humming—and distinctly female. As the sound reached him, so did the scent. Honeysuckle, sweet and wild and ripe with summer.  
  
  His belly did a little dance, but he held the flashlight steady as he swept it down the hall into unfinished guest rooms. He shook his head as both sound and scent drifted away.  
  
  “I know you’re here.” He spoke clearly, and his voice echoed back to him. “And I guess you’ve been here for a while. We’re bringing her back, and then some. She deserves it. I hope to hell you like it when she’s done because, well, that’s the way it’s going to be.”  
  
  He waited a minute or two, fanciful enough—or tired enough—to imagine whoever, or whatever, inhabited the place settled on a wait-and-see mode.  
  
  “Anyway.” He shrugged. “We’re giving her the best we’ve got, and we’re pretty damn good.”  
  
  He walked down, noted the work light no longer shone. Beckett turned it on again, switched it back off with another shrug. It wouldn’t be the first time the current resident had messed with one of them.  
  
  “Good night,” he called out, then locked up.  
  
  This time he didn’t wait for the light, but crossed diagonally. Vesta Pizzeria and Family Restaurant spread over another corner of The Square, with his apartment and office above. He walked down the sloping sidewalk to the back parking lot, grabbed his bag from the cab of his truck. Deciding he’d murder anyone who called him before eight a.m., Beckett unlocked the stairwell, then climbed past the restaurant level to hi  
s door.  
  
  He didn’t bother with the light, but moved by memory and the backwash of streetlights through the apartment. He stripped by the bed, letting the clothes drop.  
  
  He flopped facedown on the mattress, and fell asleep thinking of honeysuckle.  
  
  THE CELL PHONE he’d left in his jeans pocket went off at six fifty-five.  
  
  “Son of a bitch.”  
  
  He crawled out of bed, over the floor, dug his phone out of the pocket. Realized he was holding his wallet up to his ear when nobody answered.  
  
  “Shit.”  
  
  Dropped the wallet, fumbled out the phone.  
  
  “What the hell do you want?”  
  
  “Good morning to you, too,” Owen responded. “I’m walking out of Sheetz, with coffee and donuts. They’ve got a new clerk on the morning shift. She’s pretty hot.”  
  
  “I’ll kill you with a hammer.”  
  
  “Then you won’t get any coffee and donuts. I’m on my way to the site. Ry should be there already. Morning meeting.”  
  
  “That’s at ten.”  
  
  “Didn’t you read the text I sent you?”  
  
  “Which one? I’m gone two days and you sent me a million freaking texts.”  
  
  “The one that told you we rescheduled for seven fifteen. Put some pants on,” Owen suggested and hung up.  
  
  “Hell.”  
  
  He grabbed a two-minute shower, and put some pants on.  
  
  The clouds that rolled in overnight had managed to lock the heat in, so stepping outside was like swimming fully dressed through a warm river.  
  
  He heard the thump of nail guns, the jingle of music, the whine of saws as he crossed the street. From inside, somebody laughed like a lunatic.  
  
  He turned the corner of the building as Owen pulled his truck into the parking lot behind the projected courtyard. The truck gleamed from a recent wash, and the silver toolboxes on the sides of the bed sparkled.  
  
  Owen stepped out. Jeans, a white T-shirt tucked into his belt—and on the belt the damn phone that did everything but kiss him good night (and Beckett wasn’t taking bets against that)—marginally scuffed work boots. His bark brown hair sat tidily on his head. He’d obviously had time to shave his pretty face, Beckett thought resentfully.  
  
  He shot Beckett a grin, and Beckett imagined the eyes behind those bronze lenses were cheerful and alert.  
  
  “Give me the damn coffee.”  
  
  Owen took a tall go-cup, marked with a B, from its slot in the tray.  
  
  “I didn’t get in till three.” Beckett took the first, deep, lifesaving gulp.  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  “I didn’t get out of Richmond until close to ten, then I hit a parking lot on 95. And don’t, just do not tell me I should’ve checked the traffic report before getting on. Give me a fucking donut.”  
  
  Owen opened the enormous box, and the smell of yeast, sugar, and fat oozed into the thick air. Beckett grabbed a jelly, wolfed half of it, washed it down with more coffee.  
  
  “Pickets are going to look good,” Owen said in his easy way. “They’re going to be worth the time and money.” He cocked his head toward the truck on the other side of his. “Drywall’s up on the third floor. They’re going to get the second coat of mud on today. Roofers ran out of copper, so they’re going to fall a little behind schedule on that, but they’re working on the slate until the material comes in.”  
  
  “I can hear that,” Beckett commented as the stone saws shrilled.  
  
  Owen continued the updates as they crossed to the lobby door, and the coffee woke up Beckett’s brain.  
  
  The noise level spiked, but now that Beckett had some sugar and caffeine in his system, it sounded like music. He exchanged greetings with a couple of the crew hanging insulation, then followed Owen through the side arch and into what would be the laundry, and currently served as an on-site office.  
  
  Ryder stood scowling down at blueprints spread over a table of plywood on sawhorses. Dumbass, his homely and purehearted mutt—and constant companion—sprawled snoring at his feet.  
  
  Until a whiff of donut had his eyes popping open, his scruffy tail thumping. Beckett broke off a bite of donut, tossed it, and the dog nipped it neatly out of the air.  
  
  D.A. saw no logical purpose in the fetching of sticks or balls. He concentrated his skills on fielding food of any kind.  
  
  “If you’re going to ask for another change, I’ll kill you instead of Owen.”  
  
  Ryder only grunted, held out a hand for coffee. “We need to move this panel box, then we can box in this space here, use it for second-floor utility.”  
  
  Beckett took another donut, considered as Ryder ran through a handful of other changes.  
  
  Little tweaks, Beckett thought, that wouldn’t hurt and would probably improve. Ryder was, after all, the one of them who lived most intimately with the building. But when Ryder moved to eliminating the coffered dining room ceiling—a thin bone of contention between them—Beckett dug in.  
  
  “It goes in, just as on the plans. It makes a statement.”  
  
  “It doesn’t need to make a statement.”  
  
  “Every room in this place is going to make a statement. The dining room makes one with—among other things, a coffered ceiling. It suits the room, plays off the panels we’re making for the side of the windows. The depth of the windows, the ceiling, the arch of stone on the back wall.”  
  
  “Pain in the ass.” Ryder scanned the donuts, opted for a cinnamon twist. He didn’t so much as glance toward the madly thumping tail as he tore off the end, flipped it into the air.  
  
  D.A.’s teeth snapped together as he caught it.  
  
  “How’d it go down in Richmond?”  
  
  “The next time I volunteer to design and help build a covered deck for a friend, knock me unconscious.”  
  
  “Always a pleasure.” Ryder grinned around the donut. His hair, a deep dense brown that edged toward black, sprang out from under his paint-stained MFC gimme cap. His eyebrows lifted over eyes of gold-flecked green. “I thought you were mostly doing it to get into Drew’s sister’s pants.”  
  
  “It was part of the motivation.”  
  
  “How’d that go for you?”  
  
  “She hooked up with somebody a couple weeks ago, a detail nobody bothered to pass on to me. I never even saw her. So I’m bunked down in Drew’s spare room trying to pretend I can’t hear him and Jen fighting every damn night, and listening to him complain how she’s making his life hell every damn day.”  
  
  He drained the coffee. “The deck looks good though.”  
  
  “Now that you’re back I could use some help on the built-ins for The Library,” Owen told him.  
  
  “I’ve got some catching up to do, but I can give you some time after noon.”  
  
  “That’ll work.” Owen handed him a file. “Mom’s been down to Bast’s,” he said, speaking of the furniture store down the street. “Copies of what she’s after—with dimensions, and the room they’re for. She wants you to draw it up.”  
  
  “I just did the last batch before I went to Drew’s. How fast can she shop?”  
  
  “She’s meeting Aunt Carolee there tomorrow. They’re talking fabrics, so she wants to see if and how what she’s got going fits ASAP. You’re the one who took off a couple days hoping to get laid,” Owen reminded him.  
  
  “Struck out, too.”  
  
  “Shut up, Ry.” Beckett tucked the file under his arm. “I’d better get started.”  
  
  “Don’t you want to go up, take a look?”  
  
  “I did a walk-through last night.”  
  
  “At three in the morning?” Owen asked.  
  
  “Yeah, at three in the morning. It’s looking good.”  
  
  One of the crew stuck his head in. “Hey, Beck. Ry, the drywaller’s got a question up in five.”  
  
  “Be there in a minute.” Ryder pulled a handwritten list off his clipboard, passed it to Owen. “Materials. Go on and order. I want to get the front porch framed in.”  
  
  “I’ll take care of it. Do you need me around here this morning?”  
  
  “We’ve got a few million pickets to prime, a mile or two of insulation to hang, and w  
e’re decking the second-story porch, front. What do you think?”  
  
  “I think I’ll get my tool belt after I order this material.”  
  
  “I’ll swing back through before I head out to the shop this afternoon,” Beckett told them, then got out before he ended up with a nail gun in his hand.  
  
  AT HOME, HE stuck a mug under his coffee machine, checked the level of the water and beans. While it chomped the beans, he went through the mail Owen had stacked on the kitchen counter. Owen had also left sticky notes, Beckett thought with a shake of his head, listing the times he’d watered the plants. Though he hadn’t asked Owen—or anyone—to deal with those little chores while he’d been gone, it didn’t surprise him to find them done.  
  
  If you were dealing with a flat tire or a nuclear holocaust, you could depend on Owen.  
  
  Beckett dumped the junk mail in the recycle bin, took what mail needed attention and the coffee through to his office.  
  
  He liked the space, which he’d designed himself when the Montgomery family bought the building a few years before. He had the old desk—a flea market find he’d refinished—facing Main Street. Sitting there, he could study the inn.  
  
  He had land just outside of town, and plans for a house he’d designed, barely started, and kept fiddling with. But other projects always bumped it down the line. He couldn’t see the hurry, in any case. He was happy enough with his Main Street perch over Vesta. Plus it added the convenience of calling down if he wanted a slice while he worked, or just going downstairs if he wanted food and company.  
  
  He could walk to the bank, the barber, to Crawford’s if he wanted a hot breakfast or a burger, to the bookstore, the post office. He knew his neighbors, the merchants, the rhythm in Boonsboro. No, no reason to hurry.  
  
  He glanced at the file Owen had given him. It was tempting to start right there, see what his mother and aunt had come up with. But he had other work to clear up first.  
  
  He spent the next hour paying bills, updating other projects, answering emails he’d neglected when in Richmond.  
  
  He checked Ryder’s job schedule. Owen insisted they each have an updated copy every week, even though they saw or spoke to each other all the damn time. Mostly on schedule, which, considering the scope of the project, equaled a not-so-minor miracle.  
  
  He glanced at his thick white binder, filled with cut sheets, computer copies, schematics—all arranged by room—of the heating and air-conditioning system, the sprinkler system, every tub, toilet, sink, faucet, the lighting, tile patterns, appliances—and the furniture and accessories already selected and approved.  
  
  It would be thicker before they were done, so he’d better see what his mother had her eye on. He opened the file, spread out the cut sheets. On each, his mother listed the room the piece was intended for by initials. He knew Ryder and the crew still worked by the numbers they’d assigned to the guest rooms and suites, but he knew J&R—second floor, rear, and one of the two with private entrances and fireplaces—stood for Jane and Rochester.  
  
  His mother’s concept, and one he liked a lot, had been to name the rooms for romantic couples in literature—with happy endings. She’d done so for all but the front-facing suite she’d decided to dub The Penthouse.  
  
  He studied the bed she wanted, and decided the wooden canopy style would’ve fit nicely into Thornfield Hall. Then he grinned at the curvy sofa, the fainting couch she’d noted should stand at the foot of the bed. She’d picked out a dresser, but had listed the alternative of a secretary with drawers. More unique, he decided, more interesting.  
  
  And she apparently had her mind made up about a bed for Westley and Buttercup—their second suite, rear—as she’d written THIS IS IT!! in all caps on the sheet.  
  
  He scanned the other sheets; she’d been busy. Then turned to his computer.  
  
  He spent the next two hours with CAD, arranging, adjusting, angling. From time to time, he opened the binder, refreshed himself on the feel and layout of the baths, or took another look at the electrical, the cable for the flatscreens in each bedroom.  
  
  When he was satisfied, he sent his mother the file, with copies to his brothers, and gave her the maximum dimensions for any night tables, occasional chairs.  
  
  He wanted a break, and more coffee. Iced coffee, he decided. Iced cappuccino, even better. No reason not to walk down to Turn The Page and get one. They had good coffee at the bookstore, and he’d stretch his legs a little on the short walk down Main.  
  
  He ignored the fact that the coffee machine he’d indulged himself in could make cappuccino—and that he had ice. And he told himself he took the time to shave because it was too damn hot for the scruff.  
  
  He went out, headed down Main, stopped outside of Sherry’s Beauty Salon to talk to Dick while the barber took a break.  
  
  “How’s it coming?”  
  
  “We’ve got drywall going in,” Beckett told him.  
  
  “Yeah, I helped them unload some.”  
  
  “We’re going to have to put you on the payroll.”  
  
  Dick grinned, jerked a chin at the inn. “I like watching it come back.”  
  
  “Me, too. See you later.”  
  
  He walked on, and up the short steps to the covered porch of the bookstore, and through the door to a jangle of bells. He lifted a hand in salute to Laurie as the bookseller rang up a sale for a customer. While he waited he wandered to the front-facing stand of bestsellers and new arrivals. He took down the latest John Sandford in paperback—how had he missed that one?—scanned the write-up inside, kept it as he strolled around the stacks.  
  
  The shop had an easy, relaxed walk-around feel with its rooms flowing into one another, with the curve of the creaky steps to the second-floor office and storerooms. Trinkets, cards, a few local crafts, some of this, a little of that—and, most of all, books and more books filled shelves, tables, cases in a way that encouraged just browsing around.  
  
  Another old building, it had seen war, change, the lean and the fat. Now with its soft colors and old wood floors, it managed to hold on to the sense of the town house it had once been.  
  
  It always smelled, to him, of books and women, which made sense since the owner had a fully female staff of full- and part-timers.  
  
  He found a just-released Walter Mosley and picked that up as well. Then glancing toward the stairs to the second-floor office, Beckett strolled through the open doorway to the back section of the store. He heard voices, but realized quickly they came from a little girl and a woman she called Mommy.  
  
  Clare had boys—three boys now, he thought. Maybe she wasn’t even in today, or not coming in until later. Besides, he’d come for coffee, not to see Clare Murphy. Clare Brewster, he reminded himself. She’d been Clare Brewster for ten years, so he ought to be used to it.  
  
  Clare Murphy Brewster, he mused, mother of three, bookstore proprietor. Just an old high school friend who’d come home after an Iraqi sniper shattered her life and left her a widow.  
  
  He hadn’t come to see her, except in passing if she happened to be around. He’d have no business making a point to see the widow of a boy he’d gone to school with, had liked, had envied.  
  
  “Sorry for the wait. How’s it going, Beck?”  
  
  “What?” He tuned back in, turned to Laurie as the door jingled behind the customers. “Oh, no problem. Found some books.”  
  
  “Imagine that,” she said, and smiled at him.  
  
  “I know, what are the odds? I hope they’re as good for me getting an iced cappuccino.”  
  
  “I can hook you up. Iced everything’s the order of the day this summer.” Her honey brown hair scooped up with a clip against the heat, she gestured to the cups. “Large?”  
  
  “You bet.”  
  
  “How’s the inn coming along?”  
  
  “It’s moving.” He walked to the counter as she turned to the espresso machine.  
  
  Pretty little thing, Beckett mused. She’d worked for Clare since the beginning, shuffling work and school. Five years, maybe six? Could it be that long already?  
  
  “People ask us all the time,” she told him as she worked. “When, when, when, what, how. And especially when you’re going to take down that tarp so we can all see for ourselves.”  
  
  “And spoil the big reveal?”  
  
  “It’s killing me.”  
  
  With the conversation, the noise of the machine, he didn’t hear her, but sensed her. He looked over as she came down the curve of the steps, one hand trailing along the banister.  
  
  When his heart jumped, he thought, Oh well. But then, Clare had been making his heart jump since he’d been sixteen.  
  
  “Hi, Beck. I thought I heard you down here.”  
  
  She smiled, and his heart stopped jumping to fall flat.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  HE HANDLED IT. HE SMILED BACK AT HER, QUICK AND casual, as she walked down the stairs with her long, sunny ponytail swaying. She always reminded him of a sunflower, tall and bright and cheerful. Her gray eyes held hints of green that gave them a sparkle whenever her mouth, with its deep center dip, curved up.  
  
  “Haven’t seen you in a couple days,” she commented.  
  
  “I was down in Richmond.” She’d gotten some sun, he thought, giving her skin just a hint of gold. “Did I miss anything?”  
  
  “Let’s see. Somebody stole the garden gnome out of Carol Tecker’s yard.”  
  
  “Jeez. A crime spree.”  
  
  “She’s offering a ten-dollar reward.”  
  
  “I’ll keep my eye out for it.”  
  
  “Anything new at the inn?”  
  
  “We started drywall.”  
  
  “Old news.” She flicked that away. “I got that from Avery yesterday, who got it from Ry when he stopped in for pizza.”  
  
  “My mother’s putting another furniture order together, and she’s moving on to fabrics.”  
  
  “Now that’s a bulletin.” Green sparkled in the gray; it just killed him. “I’d love to see what she’s picking out. I know it’s going to be beautiful. And I heard a rumor there’s going to be a copper tub.”  
  
  Beckett held up three fingers.  
  
  Her eyes widened; the green deepened in the smoky gray. He’d need oxygen any minute.  
  
  “Three? Where do you find these things?”  
  
  “We have our ways.”  
  
  She glanced toward Laurie with a long, female sigh. “Imagine lounging in a copper bathtub. It sounds so romantic.”  
  
  Unfortunately he instantly imagined her slipping out of the pretty summer dress with red poppies over a field of blue—and into a copper bathtub.  
  
  And that, he reminded himself, wasn’t handling it.  
  
  “How are the kids?” he asked, and took out his wallet.  
  
  “They’re great. We’re starting to gear up for full back-to-school mode, so they’re excited. Harry’s pretending not to be, playing Mr. Old Hat since he’s going into third grade. But he and Liam are giving Murphy the benefit of their vast experience. I can’t believe my baby’s starting kindergarten.”  
  
  Thinking of the kids always leveled him off, helped him slide her into the do-not-imagine-naked column of MOTHER.  
  
  “Oh.” She tapped the Mosley book before Laurie bagged it. “I haven’t had a chance to read that yet. You’ll have to let me know what you think.”  
  
  “Sure. Ah, you should come over, walk through sometime.”  
  
  Her mouth bowed up. “We peek in the side windows.”  
  
  “Just go on around the back.”  
  
  “Really? I’d like to, but I figured you didn’t want people getting in th  
e way.”  
  
  “As a rule, but—” He broke off as the bells jangled, and two couples came in. “Anyway, I’d better get going.”  
  
  “Enjoy the book,” she told him, then turned to her customers. “Can I help you find anything?”  
  
  “We’re touring the area,” one of the men told her. “Got any books on Antietam?”  
  
  “We do. Let me show you.” She led him away as the rest of the group started to browse.  
  
  Beckett watched her go down the little flight of steps into what they called the annex.  
  
  “Well. See you later, Laurie.”  
  
  “Beck?”  
  
  He stopped, one hand on the doorknob.  
  
  “Books? Coffee?” She held the bag in one hand, the go-cup in the other.  
  
  “Oh yeah.” He laughed, shook his head. “Thanks.”  
  
  “No problem.” She sighed a little when he left, and wondered if her boyfriend ever watched her walk away.  
  
  CLARE CARTED A tub of books packaged for shipping down to the post office. She breathed in deep a moment as she went out the back and across the gravel parking lot as an actual breeze fluttered over her face.  
  
  She thought—hoped—it looked like rain. Maybe a nice, solid soaker that would spare her the time it took to water her garden and pots. If it didn’t come with lightning, she could let the boys run around in the wet after dinner, burn off some energy.  
  
  Scrub them up afterward, then, since it was movie night, fix some popcorn. She’d have to check the chart, see whose turn it was to pick the flick.  
  
  Charts, she’d learned, helped cut down on arguing, complaining, and bickering when three little boys had to decide whether to spend some time with SpongeBob, the Power Rangers, or the Star Wars gang. It didn’t eliminate the arguing, complaining, and bickering, but it usually kept it at a more manageable level.  
  
  She dropped off the shipments, spent a few moments chatting with the postmistress. Because the traffic on Route 34 ran a bit thick, she walked back to The Square, pressed the button for the Walk light. And waited.  
  
  Every once in a while it struck her that she was, geographically at least, back where she’d started. Everything else had changed, she mused, glancing over at the big blue tarp.  
  
  And was still changing.  
  
  She’d left Boonsboro as a brand-new bride of nineteen. So young! she thought now. So full of excitement and confidence, so much in love. She’d thought nothing of driving off to North Carolina to start her life with Clint, as an army wife.  
  
  She’d done a decent job of it, too, she decided. Setting up house, playing house, working part-time in a bookstore—and hurrying home to fix dinner. She’d learned she was pregnant only days before Clint had been deployed for his first tour to Iraq.  
  
  She’d known fear then, she remembered as she crossed toward Vesta. But it had been offset by the wide-eyed optimism of youth, and the joy of carrying a child—one she’d borne back home, at barely twenty.  
  
  Then Clint came home, and they were off to Kansas. They’d had nearly a year. Liam had been born during Clint’s second tour of duty. When he’d come home again, he’d been a great father to their two little boys, but war had stolen his easy cheer, his quick, rolling laugh.  
  
  She hadn’t known she was pregnant when she’d kissed him goodbye that last time.  
  
  The day they’d handed her the flag from Clint’s casket, Murphy quickened for the first time inside her.  
  
  And now, she thought as she opened the glass door, she was back home. For good.  
  
  She’d timed the visit postlunch, predinner prep. A scatter of people sat at the dark, glossy wood tables, and a family—not locals, she noted—piled into the booth in the far corner. Their curly-headed toddler sprawled over the red cushions, sound asleep.  
  
  She lifted her hand in salute to Avery as her friend ladled sauce on dough behind the service counter. At home, Clare walked over to pull herself a glass of lemonade and brought it back to the counter with her.  
  
  “I think it’s going to rain.”  
  
  “You said that yesterday.”  
  
  “Today I mean it.”  
  
  “Oh, well then. I’ll get my umbrella.” Avery covered the sauce with shredded mozzarella, layered that with pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, and black olives. Her movements quick and practiced, she opened one of the big ovens behind her and shoved in the pie. She shoveled out another, sliced it.  
  
  One of the waitresses swung out of the closed kitchen area, sang out a “Hi, Clare,” then carried the pizza and plates to one of the tables.  
  
  Avery said, “Whew.”  
  
  “Busy day?”  
  
  “We were slammed from eleven thirty until about a half hour ago.”  
  
  “Are you on tonight?” Clare asked.  
  
  “Wendy called in sick, again, so it looks like I’m pulling a double.”  
  
  “Sick meaning she made up with her boyfriend again.”  
  
  “I’d be sick too if I was hooked up with that loser. She makes a damn good pizza.” Avery took a bottle of water from under the counter, gestured with it. “But I’m probably going to have to let her go. Kids today?” She rolled her bright blue eyes. “No work ethic.”  
  
  “I’m trying to remember the name of the guy you were tight with when you got caught hooking school.”  
  
  “Lance Poffinberger—a momentary lapse. And boy, did I pay for it. Screw up once, just once, and Dad grounded me for a month. Lance works down at Canfield’s as a mechanic.” Avery wiggled her eyebrows as she took a slug of water. “Mechanics are hot.”  
  
  “Really?”  
  
  “With Lance the exception that proves the rule.”  
  
  She answered the phone, took an order, pulled out the pizza, sliced it so her waitress could carry the still-bubbling pie to the table.  
  
  Clare enjoyed her lemonade and watched Avery work.  
  
  They’d been friendly in high school, cocaptains on the cheerlead-ing squad. A bit competitive, but friendly. Then they’d lost touch when Avery went off to college, and Clare had headed shortly after to Fort Bragg with Clint.  
  
  They’d reconnected when Clare, pregnant with Murphy and with two boys in tow, had moved back. And Avery, with the red hair and milk white skin of her Scot forebears had just opened her Italian family restaurant.  
  
  “Beckett was by earlier.”  
  
  “Alert the media!”  
  
  Clare met sarcasm with a smug smile. “He said I could take a look inside the inn.”  
  
  “Yeah? Let me finish putting this order together, and we’ll go.”  
  
  “I can’t, not now. I have to pick up the kids in . . .” She checked her watch. “An hour. And I’ve still got some work. Tomorrow? Maybe before things get busy here or at TTP?”  
  
  “That’s a date. I’ll be in around nine to start the ovens and so on. I could slip out about ten.”  
  
  “Ten it is. I’ve gotta go. Work, kid pickup, fix dinner, baths, then it’s movie night.”  
  
  “We have some excellent spinach ravioli if you want to cross off the fix-dinner portion.”  
  
  Clare started to decline, then decided it would be an excellent delivery method of spinach, and save her about forty-five minutes in the kitchen. “Deal. Listen, my parents want the boys for a sleepover on Saturday. How about I fix something that isn’t pizza, open a bottle of wine, and we have an adult, female evening.”  
  
  “I can do that. We could also put on sexy dresses and go out, perhaps find adult males to share the evening.”  
  
  “We could, but since I’ll be spending the bulk of the day at the mall and the outlets browbeating three boys into trying on back-to-school clothes, I’d probably just shoot the first male who spoke to me.”  
  
  “Girls’ night in it is.”  
  
  “Perfect.”  
  
  Avery boxed up the takeout herself, put it on Clare’s tab.  
  
  “Thanks. See you tomorrow.”  
  
  “Clare,” Avery said as Clare walked to the door. “Saturday, I’ll bring a second bottle of wine, something gooey for dessert. And my pj’s.”  
  
  “Even better. Who needs a man when you’ve got a best girl pal?”  
  
  
  Clare laughed as Avery shot a hand in the air.  
  
  She stepped out and nearly bumped into Ryder.  
  
  “Two out of three,” she said. “I saw Beck earlier. Now I just need Owen for the hat trick.”  
  
  “Heading over to Mom’s. He and Beck are working in the shop. I’ll give you a ride,” he said with a grin. “I just took a dinner order, since Mom says it’s too hot to cook.”  
  
  Clare lifted her bag. “I’m with her. Say hi for me.”  
  
  “Will do. Looking good, Clare the Fair. Wanna go dancing?”  
  
  She shot him grin for grin as she pushed the Walk button on the post. “Sure. Pick me and the boys up at eight.”  
  
  She got lucky with the timing, and headed across with a wave. She tried to remember the last time a man had asked her to go dancing and meant it.  
  
  She just couldn’t.  
  
  THE MONTGOMERY WORKSHOP was big as a house and designed to look like one. It boasted a long covered porch—often crowded with projects in various stages—including a couple of battered Adirondack chairs waiting for repair and paint, for two years and counting.  
  
  Doors, windows, a couple of sinks, boxes of tile, shingles, plywood, and various and sundry items salvaged from or left over from other jobs mixed together in a rear jut they’d added on when they’d run out of room.  
  
  Because the hodgepodge drove him crazy, Owen organized it every few months, then Ryder or Beckett would haul something else in, and dump it wherever.  
  
  He knew damn well they did it on purpose.  
  
  The main area held table tools, work counters, shelving for supplies, a couple of massive rolling tool chests, stacks of lumber, old mason jars and coffee cans (labeled by Owen) for screws, nails, bolts.  
  
  Here, though it would never fully meet Owen’s high standards, the men kept at least a semblance of organization.  
  
  They worked together well, with music from the ancient stereo recycled from the family home banging out rock, a couple of floor fans blowing the heat around, the table saw buzzing as Beckett fed the next piece of chestnut to the blade.

1ly3w8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ly3w8d/my_best_friend_turned_into_a_bridezilla_and/,my best friend turned into a bridezilla and accused me of stealing her spotlight… even tho i wasn’t even wearing makeup,"i (26F) used to be best friends w/ Alyssa not her real name, (27F) since high school. we were super close, like matching tattoos, made pacts to be each other’s maid of honor, that kind of thing. i was genuinely happy when she got engaged to her fiancé Justin (29M). she asked me to be her maid of honor and i said yes without hesitation.

things were fine at first. like pinterest boards, cake tasting, venue tours… then it just slowly got weirder. like she was becoming a whole different person.

red flag #1
she told me i couldn’t wear any makeup to her wedding. not “keep it natural”, she meant literally none. i thought she was joking but she said:
“i just don’t want to be outshined. i need to be the prettiest woman in every photo.”

and look i’m not a model. i have okay skin and i know how to do my makeup but i’m not flashy. so i offered to go super light. no lashes, no bold lip, just some bb cream and light brows. she still said no. like completely no.

red flag #2
she made all her bridesmaids buy different pastel dresses from SHEIN (mine was like a sad peach) and said we weren’t allowed to wear heels over 2 inches. but she had a big custom made gown (knockoff vera wang) that she would NOT stop talking about. ngl it looked like whipped cream left in the sun.

then like 2 weeks before the wedding she asked me to dye my hair brown. said the ginger clashed w/ her “earth tones.” i said i wasn’t gonna do that and she was like “fine. but i’m moving you out of the front row of the bridal party pics.” ok then lmao

wedding day comes....

i show up barefaced, hair straightened, no jewelry, in my pastel peach dress and kitten heels. i looked like a sad assistant manager on her lunch break at a clearance rack store. but whatever. i smiled, clapped, helped organize people for photos, all that.

at the reception, the photographer took a few group pics. i smiled in one. later i hear her crying outside. turns out she saw one of the previews and said i was “trying to look hot on purpose.”

you guys. i wasn’t even wearing foundation. i had eye bags. my lips were literally chapped.

she pulled me aside and said:
“i knew you’d make this about you. you always do this. you couldn’t just let me have this one day.”

then she told me to LEAVE. literally told me to go home from the wedding i helped plan. that i took off work for. that i didn’t wear makeup to just to make HER feel better.

so i left. ordered mcdonald’s and went home. cried in my car for like 5 mins then felt a weird sense of relief honestly.

but here’s the kicker

a week later she told people i stormed out cuz i was jealous of her dress. 😭 said i “made a dramatic scene” and “made the energy weird.”

i just blocked her. we haven’t spoken since. 

then… the bride's new husband’s cousin (who apparently hated her and lives for drama) started telling people that Justin and Alyssa were already fighting about her wedding behavior. turns out the bridesmaids complained to him, and so did his mom, who she called “overbearing” on the wedding day. 🙃

they got into it, and guess what?

he moved out and went back to his mom’s house. three weeks after the wedding.
apparently, he told someone,

“i married a woman who treated her best friend like trash. what does that say about me?”

AND THEN....

the photographer dropped them. Refunded their deposit. Said the photos “didn’t align with their brand values.” 💀

so now she has:
1. no wedding pics
2. no husband in the house
3. and a bunch of mutual friends ghosting her after seeing how she treated everyone

me? i’m over here thriving. face moisturized. makeup on. drinking iced coffee out of the free wedding tumbler she gave me that says ""bride squad"" in glitter letters. i still have the ugly SHEIN dress tho. i wear it when i clean the toilet. feels right.

1ly3vyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ly3vyd/vision_in_white_by_nora_roberts/,Vision in White by Nora Roberts:,"CHAPTER ONE  
  
  ON JANUARY FIRST, MAC ROLLED OVER TO SMACK HER ALARM clock, and ended up facedown on the floor of her studio.  
  
  “Shit. Happy New Year.”  
  
  She lay, groggy and baffled, until she remembered she’d never made it upstairs into bed—and the alarm was from her computer, set to wake her at noon.  
  
  She pushed herself up to stagger to the kitchen and the coffeemaker.  
  
  Why did people want to get married on New Year’s Eve? Why would they make a formal ritual out of a holiday designed for marathon drinking and probably inappropriate sex? And they just had to drag family and friends into it, not to mention wedding photographers.  
  
  Of course, when the reception had finally ended at two A.M., she could’ve gone to bed like a sane person instead of uploading the shots, reviewing them—spending nearly three more hours on the Hines-Myers wedding photos.  
  
  But, boy, she’d gotten some good ones. A few great ones.  
  
  Or they were all crap and she’d judged them in a euphoric blur.  
  
  No, they were good shots.  
  
  She added three spoons of sugar to the black coffee and drank it while standing at the window, looking out at the snow blanketing the gardens and lawns of the Brown Estate.  
  
  They’d done a good job on the wedding, she thought. And maybe Bob Hines and Vicky Myers would take a clue from that and do a good job on the marriage.  
  
  Either way, the memories of the day wouldn’t fade. The moments, big and small, were captured. She’d refine them, finesse them, print them. Bob and Vicky could revisit the day through those images next week or sixty years from next week.  
  
  That, she thought, was as potent as sweet, black coffee on a cold winter day.  
  
  Opening a cupboard, she pulled out a box of Pop-Tarts and, eating one where she stood, went over her schedule for the day.  
  
  Clay-McFearson (Rod and Alison) wedding at six. Which meant the bride and her party would arrive by three, groom and his by four. That gave her until two for the pre-event summit meeting at the main house.  
  
  Time enough to shower, dress, go over her notes, check and recheck her equipment. Her last check of the day’s weather called for sunny skies, high of thirty-two. She should be able to get some nice preparation shots using natural light and maybe talk Alison—if she was game—into a bridal portrait on the balcony with the snow in the background.  
  
  Mother of the bride, Mac remembered—Dorothy (call me Dottie)—was on the pushy and demanding side, but she’d be dealt with. If Mac couldn’t handle her personally, God knew Parker would. Parker could and did handle anyone and anything.  
  
  Parker’s drive and determination had turned Vows into one of the top wedding and event planning companies in the state in a five-year period. It had turned the tragedy of her parents’ deaths into hope, and the gorgeous Victorian home and the stunning grounds of the Brown Estate into a thriving and unique business.  
  
  And, Mac thought as she swallowed the last of the Pop-Tart, she herself was one of the reasons.  
  
  She moved through the studio toward the stairs to her upstairs bed and bath, stopped at one of her favorite photos. The glowing, ecstatic bride with her face lifted, her arms stretched, palms up, caught in a shower of pink rose petals.  
  
  Cover of  
  
  Today’s Bride, Mac thought. Because I’m just that good.  
  
  In her thick socks, flannel pants, and sweatshirt she climbed the stairs to transform herself from tired, pj-clad, Pop-Tart addict into sophisticated wedding photojournalist.  
  
  She ignored her unmade bed—why make it when you were just going to mess it up again?—and the bedroom clutter. The hot shower worked with the sugar and caffeine to clear out any remaining cobwebs so she could put her mind seriously to today’s job.  
  
  She had a bride who was interested in trying the creative, a passive-aggressive MOB who thought she knew best, a groom so dazzling in love he’d do anything to make his bride happy. And both her B and G were seriously photogenic.  
  
  The last fact made the job both pleasure and challenge. Just how could she give her clients a photo journey of their day that was spectacular, and uniquely theirs?  
  
  Bride’s colors, she thought, flipping through her mental files as she washed her short, shaggy crop of red hair. Silver and gold. Elegant, glamorous.  
  
  She’d had a look at the flowers and the cake—both getting their finishing touches today—the favors and linens, attendants’ wardrobes, headdresses. She had a copy of the playlist from the band with the first dance, mother-son, father-daughter dances highlighted.  
  
  So, she thought, for the next several hours, her world would revolve around Rod and Alison.  
  
  She chose her suit, her jewelry, her makeup with nearly the same care as she chose her equipment. Loaded, she went out to make the short trek from the pool house that held her studio and little apartment to the main house.  
  
  The snow sparkled, crushed diamonds over ermine, and the air was cold and clean as mountain ice. She definitely had to get some outside shots, daylight and evening. Winter wedding, white wedding, snow on the ground, ice glistening on the trees, just dripping from the denuded willows over the pond. And there the fanciful old Victorian with its myriad rooflines, the arched and porthole windows, rising and spreading, soft blue against the hard shell of sky. Its terraces and generous portico heralded the season with their festoons of lights and greenery.  
  
  She studied it as she often did as she walked the shoveled paths. She loved the lines of it, the angles of it, with its subtle touches of pale yellow, creamy white picked out in that soft, subtle blue.  
  
  It had been as much home to her as her own growing up. Often more so, she admitted, as her own had run on her mother’s capricious whims. Parker’s parents had been warm, w  
elcoming, loving and—Mac thought now—steady. They’d given her a calm port in the storm of her own childhood.  
  
  She’d grieved as much as her friend at their loss nearly seven years before.  
  
  Now the Brown Estate was her home. Her business. Her life. And a good one on every level. What could be better than doing something you loved, and doing it with the best friends you’d ever had?  
  
  She went in through the mudroom to hang up her outdoor gear, then circled around to peek into Laurel’s domain.  
  
  Her friend and partner stood on a step stool, meticulously adding silver calla lilies to the five tiers of a wedding cake. Each flower bloomed at the base of a gold acanthus leaf to glimmering, elegant effect.  
  
  “That’s a winner, McBane.”  
  
  Laurel’s hand was steady as a surgeon’s as she added the next lily. Her sunny hair was twisted at the back of her head into a messy knot that somehow suited the angular triangle of her face. As she worked, her eyes, bright as bluebells, held narrowed concentration.  
  
  “I’m so glad she went for the lily centerpiece instead of the bride and groom topper. It makes this design. Wait until we get to the ballroom and add it.”  
  
  Mac pulled out a camera. “It’s a good shot for the website. Okay?”  
  
  “Sure. Get any sleep?”  
  
  “Didn’t hit until about five, but I stayed down till noon. You?”  
  
  “Down by two thirty. Up at seven to finish the groom’s cake, the desserts—and this. I’m so damn glad we have two weeks before the next wedding.” She glanced over. “Don’t tell Parker I said that.”  
  
  “She’s up, I assume.”  
  
  “She’s been in here twice. She’s probably been everywhere twice. I think I heard Emma come in. They may be up in the office by now.”  
  
  “I’m heading up. Are you coming?”  
  
  “Ten minutes. I’ll be on time.”  
  
  “On time is late in Parker’s world.” Mac grinned. “I’ll try to distract her.”  
  
  “Just tell her some things can’t be rushed. And that the MOB’s going to get so many compliments on this cake she’ll stay off our backs.”  
  
  “That one could work.”  
  
  Mac started out, winding through to check the entrance foyer and the massive drawing room where the ceremony itself would take place. Emmaline and her elves had already been at work, she noted, undressing from the last wedding, redressing for the new. Every bride had her own vision, and this one wanted lots of gold and silver ribbon and swag as opposed to the lavender and cream voile of New Year’s Eve.  
  
  The fire was set in the drawing room and would be lit before the guests began to arrive. White-draped chairs sparkling with silver bows formed row after row. Emma had already dressed the mantel with gold candles in silver holders, and the bride’s favorite white calla lilies massed in tall, thin glass vases.  
  
  Mac circled the room, considered angles, lighting, composition—and made more notes as she walked out and took the stairs to the third floor.

 As she expected, she found Parker in the conference room of their office, surrounded by her laptop, BlackBerry, folders, cell phone, and headset. Her dense brown hair hung in a long tail—sleek and simple. It worked with the suit—a quiet dove gray—that would blend in and complement the bride’s colors.  
  
  Parker missed no tricks.  
  
  She didn’t look up but circled a finger in the air as she continued to work on the laptop. Knowing the signal, Mac crossed to the coffee counter and filled mugs for both of them. She sat, laid down her own file, opened her own notebook.  
  
  Parker sat back, smiled, and picked up her mug. “It’s going to be a good one.”  
  
  “No doubt.”  
  
  “Roads are clear, weather’s good. The bride’s up, had breakfast and a massage. The groom’s had a workout and a swim. Caterers are on schedule. All attendants are accounted for.” She checked her watch. “Where are Emma and Laurel?”  
  
  “Laurel’s putting the finishing touches on the cake, which is stupendous. I haven’t seen Emma, but she’s started dressing the event areas. Pretty. I want some outdoor shots. Before and after.”  
  
  “Don’t keep the bride outside for too long before. We don’t want her red-nosed and sniffling.”  
  
  “You may have to keep the MOB off my back.”  
  
  “Already noted.”  
  
  Emma rushed in, a Diet Coke in one hand, a file in the other. “Tink’s hungover and a no-show, so I’m one short. Let’s keep this brief, okay?” She dropped down at the table. Her curling black hair bounced over the shoulders of her sweatshirt. “The Bride’s Suite and the Drawing Room are dressed. Foyer and stairway, nearly finished. The bouquets, corsages, and boutonnieres checked. We’ve started on the Grand Hall and the Ballroom. I need to get back to that.”  
  
  “Flower girl?”  
  
  “White rose pomander, silver and gold ribbon. I have her halo—roses and baby’s breath—ready for the hairdresser. It’s adorable. Mac, I need some pictures of the arrangements if you can fit it in. If not, I’ll get them.”  
  
  “I’ll take care of it.”  
  
  “Thanks. The MOB—”  
  
  “I’m on it,” Parker said.  
  
  “I need to—” Emma broke off as Laurel walked in.  
  
  “I’m not late,” Laurel announced.  
  
  “Tink’s a no-show,” Parker told her. “Emma’s short.”  
  
  “I can fill in. I’ll need to set the centerpiece of the cake and arrange the desserts, but I’ve got time now.”  
  
  “Let’s go over the timetable.”  
  
  “Wait.” Emma lifted her can of Diet Coke. “Toast first. Happy New Year to us, to four amazing, stupendous, and very hot women. Best pals ever.”  
  
  “Also smart and kick-ass.” Laurel raised her bottle of water. “To pals and partners.”  
  
  “To us. Friendship and brains in four parts,” Mac added, “and the sheer coolness of the whole we’ve made with Vows.”  
  
  “And to 2009.” Parker lifted her coffee mug. “The amazing, stupendous, hot, smart, kick-ass best pals are going to have their best year ever.”  
  
  “Damn right.” Mac clinked her mug to the rest. “To Wedding Day, then, now, and always.”  
  
  “Then, now, and always,” Parker repeated. “And now. Timetable?”  
  
  “I’m on the bride,” Mac began, “from her arrival, switch to groom at his. Candids during dressing event, posed as applies. Formal portraits in and out. I’ll get the shots of the cake, the arrangements now, do my setup. All family and wedding party shots separate prior to the ceremony. Post-ceremony I should only need forty-five minutes for the family shots, full wedding party, and the bride and groom.”  
  
  “Floral dressing in bride and groom suites complete by three. Floral dressing in foyer, Parlor, staircase, Grand Hall, and Ballroom by five.” Parker glanced at Emma.  
  
  “We’ll be done.”  
  
  “Videographer arrives at five thirty. Guest arrivals from five thirty to six. Wedding musicians—string quartet—to begin at five forty. The band will be set up in the Ballroom by six thirty. MOG, attended by son, escorted at five fifty, MOB, escorted by son-in-law, directly after. Groom and groomsmen in place at six.” Parker read off the schedule. “FOB, bride, and party in place at six. Descent and procession. Ceremony duration twenty-three minutes, recession, family moments. Guests escorted to Grand Hall at six twenty-five.”  
  
  “Bar opens,” Laurel said, “music, passed food.”  
  
  “Six twenty-five to seven ten, photographs. Announcement of family, wedding party, and the new Mr. and Mrs. seven fifteen.”  
  
  “Dinner, toasts,” Emma continued. “We’ve got it, Parks.”  
  
  “I want to make sure we move to the Ballroom and have the first dance by eight fifteen,” Parker continued. “The bride especially wants her grandmother there for the first dance, and after the father-daughter, mother-son dance, for her father and his mother to dance. She’s ninety, and may fade early. If we can have the cake cutting at nine thirty, the grandmother should make that, too.”  
  
  “She’s a sweetheart,” Mac put in. “I got some nice shots of her and Alison at the rehearsal. I’ve got it in my notes to get some of them today. Personally, I think she’ll stay for the whole deal.”  
  
  “I hope she does. Cake and desserts served while dancing continues. Bouquet toss at ten fifteen.”  
  
  “Tossing bouquet is set,” Emma added.  
  
  “Garter toss, dancing continues. Last dance at ten fifty, bubble blowing, bride and groom depart. Event end, eleven.” Parker checked her watch again. “Let’s get it done. Emma and Laurel need to change. Everyone remember their headsets.”  
  
  Parker’s phone vibrated, and she glanced at the readout. “MOB. Again. Fourth call this morning.”  
  
  “Have fun with that,” Mac said and escaped.  
  
  She scouted room by room, staying out of the way of Emma and her crew as they swarmed over the house with flowers, ribbons, voile. She took shots of Laurel’s cake, Emma’s arrangements, framed others in her head.  
  
  It was a routine she never allowed to become routine. She knew once it became rote, she’d miss shots, opportunities, bog down on fresh angles and ideas. And whenever she felt herself dulling, she thought of a blue butterfly landing on a dandelion.  
  
  The air smelled of roses and lilies and rang with voices and footfalls. Light streamed through the tall windows in lovely beams and shafts, and glittered on the gold and silver ribbons.  
  
  “Headset, Mac!” Parker rushed down the main staircase. “The bride’s arriving.”  
  
  As Parker hurried down to meet the bride, Mac jogged up. She swung out on the front terrace, ignoring the cold as the white limo sailed down the drive. As it eased to a stop she shifted her angle, set, and waited.  
  
  Maid of honor, mother of the bride. “Move, move, just a little,” she muttered. Alison stepped out. The bride wore jeans, Uggs, a battered suede jacket and a bright red scarf. Mac zoomed in, changed stops. “Hey! Alison!”  
  
  The bride looked up. Surprise turned to amused delight, and to Mac’s pleasure, Alison threw up both arms, tossed back her head, and laughed.  
  
  And there, Mac thought as she caught the moment, was the beginning of the journey.  
  
  Within ten minutes, the Bride’s Suite—once Parker’s own bedroom—bustled with people and confusion. Two hairdressers plied their tools and talents, curling, straightening, styling, while others wielded paints and pots.  
  
  Utterly female, Mac thought as she moved through the room unobtrusively, the scents, the motions, the sounds. The bride remained the focus—no nerves on this one, Mac determined. Alison was confident, beaming, and currently chattering like a magpie.  
  
  The MOB, however, was a different story.  
  
  “But you have such beautiful hair! Don’t you think you should leave it down? At least some of it. Maybe—”  
  
  “An updo suits the headdress better. Relax, Mom.”  
  
  “It’s too warm in here. I think it’s too warm in here. And Mandy should take a quick nap. She’s going to act up, I just know it.”  
  
  “She’ll be fine.�  
� Alison glanced toward the flower girl.  
  
  “I really think—”  
  
  “Ladies!” Parker wheeled in a cart of champagne, with a pretty fruit and cheese tray. “The men are on their way. Alison, your hair’s gorgeous. Absolutely regal.” She poured a flute, offered it to the bride.  
  
  “I really don’t think she should drink before the ceremony. She barely ate today, and—”  
  
  “Oh, Mrs. McFearson, I’m so glad you’re dressed and ready. You look fabulous. If I could just steal you for a few minutes? I’d love for you to take a look at the Drawing Room before the ceremony. We want to make sure it’s perfect, don’t we? I’ll have her back in no time.” Parker pushed champagne into the MOB’s hand, and steered her out of the room.  
  
  Alison said, “Whew!” and laughed.  
  
  For the next hour, Mac split herself between the bride’s and groom’s suites. Between perfume and tulle, cuff links and cummerbunds. She eased back into the bride’s domain, circled around the attendants as they dressed and helped one another dress. And found Alison alone, standing in front of her wedding dress.  
  
  It was all there, Mac thought as she quietly framed the shot. The wonder, the joy—with just that tiny tug of sorrow. She snapped the image as Alison reached out to brush her fingers over the sparkle of the bodice.  
  
  Decisive moment, Mac knew, when everything the woman felt reflected on her face.  
  
  Then it passed, and Alison glanced over.  
  
  “I didn’t expect to feel this way. I’m so happy. I’m so in love with Rod, so ready to marry him. But there’s this little clutch right here.” She rubbed her fingers just above her heart. “It’s not nerves.”  
  
  “Sadness. Just a touch. One phase of your life ends today. You’re allowed to be sad to say good-bye. I know what you need. Wait here.”  
  
  A moment later, Mac led Alison’s grandmother over. And once again stepped back.  
  
  Youth and age, she thought. Beginnings and endings, connections and constancy. And, love.  
  
  She snapped the embrace, but that wasn’t it. She snapped the glitter of tears, and still, no. Then Alison lowered her forehead to her grandmother’s, and even as her lips curved, a single tear slid down her cheek while the dress glowed and glittered behind them.  
  
  Perfect. The blue butterfly.  
  
  She took candids of the ritual while the bride dressed, then the formal portraits with exquisite natural light. As she’d expected, Alison was game to brave the cold on the terrace.  
  
  And Mac ignored Parker’s voice through her headset as she rushed to the Groom’s Suite to repeat the process with Rod.  
  
  She passed Parker in the hallway as she strode back to the bride. “I need the groom and party downstairs, Mac. We’re running two minutes behind.”  
  
  “Oh my God!” Mac said in mock horror and ducked into the Bride’s Suite.  
  
  “Guests are seated,” Parker announced in her ear moments later. “Groom and groomsmen taking position. Emma, gather the bridal party.”  
  
  “On it.”  
  
  Mac slipped out to take her stand at the bottom of the stairs as Emma organized the bridesmaids.  
  
  “Party ready. Cue the music.”  
  
  “Cuing music,” Parker said, “start the procession.”  
  
  The flower girl would clearly be fine without the nap, Mac decided as the child nearly danced her way down the staircase. She paused like a vet at Laurel’s signal, then continued at a dignified pace in her fairy dress across the foyer, into the enormous parlor, and down the aisle formed by the chairs.  
  
  The attendants followed, shimmering silver, and at last, the maid of honor in gold.  
  
  Mac crouched to aim up as the bride and her father stood at the top of the stairs, holding hands. As the bride’s music swelled, he lifted his daughter’s hand to his lips, then to his cheek.  
  
  Even as she took the shot, Mac’s eyes stung.  
  
  Where was her own father? she wondered. Jamaica? Switzerland? Cairo?  
  
  She pushed the thought and the ache that came with it aside, and did her job.  
  
  Using Emma’s candlelight, she captured joy and tears. The memories. And stayed invisible and separate.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  SHE WORKED AT NIGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD A FULL DAY OF APPOINTMENTS. And because she liked working at night—alone, in her own space, at her own pace. Mornings were for coffee, that first intense, blood-surging hit of it, and days were often for clients, for shoots, for meetings.  
  
  Nights, alone in her studio, she could focus entirely on images, how to select, to improve, to enhance. Though she worked almost exclusively digital, she retained the darkroom mind-set when it came to creating the print. She layered, highlighting, shadowing; she removed blemishes or hot spots to create her base for her master print. To this she could refine specific areas, alter density, add contrast. Step-by-step she would shape the print, sharpening or softening to suit the mood, to create an image that expressed that moment in time, until  
  
  she felt what she hoped the client would feel.  
  
  Then, as she did most mornings, Mac sat down at her computer to check her thumbnails and to see if her morning self agreed with her night self.  
  
  She huddled over them in her flannels and thick socks, her bright red hair a forest of spikes and tufts. And in the utter quiet. At a wedding she was most often surrounded. By people, by chatter, by emotion. She blocked it or used it as she searched for the right angle, the right tone, the right moment.  
  
  But here, she was alone with the images, ones she could perfect. She drank her coffee, ate an apple as a concession to the previous morning’s Pop-Tart, and studied the hundreds of images she’d captured the day before, the dozens she’d finessed during the night session.  
  
  Her morning self congratulated her night self on a job well done. More to do yet, she mused, and when she had the best of the best for the clients to consider, she’d give them one more going-over before scheduling an appointment with the newlyweds to view the images in slide-show format and make their choices.  
  
  But that was for another day. In case her memory proved faulty, she checked her calendar before going up to shower and dress for her first appointment.  
  
  For a studio shoot, jeans and a sweater would do, but then she’d have to change for the consultation scheduled that afternoon at the main house. Vows policy demanded business attire for client consultations.  
  
  Mac pushed through her closet for black pants, a black shirt. She could toss on a jacket after the shoot and meet the dress code. She played with jewelry until she found what suited her mood, slapped on some makeup, and considered the job done.  
  
  The studio required more attention than the photographer, in her opinion.  
  
  Elizabeth and Charles, she thought as she began the setup. Engagement shot. They’d been firm, she recalled, at the consult. Formal, simple, straightforward.  
  
  She wondered why they didn’t just get a friend with a point-and-shoot to take it then. And she recalled now with a quick smirk, that those words had nearly come out of her mouth—before Parker had read her mind and shot her a warning glare.  
  
  “Client’s king,” she reminded herself as she set her backdrop. “They want boring, boring it is.”  
  
  She hauled in lights, positioned a diffuser—boring could at least be pretty. She brought out her tripod, mostly because she felt the clients would expect equipment. By the time she’d chosen her lenses, checked her lighting, draped a stool, the clients knocked at her door.  
  
  “Right on time.” She shut the door behind them and blocked a blast of frigid wind. “Brutal out there today. Let me take your coats.”  
  
  They looked perfect, she thought. Barbie and Ken for the upper-class set. The cool, every hair in place blonde, the handsome, polished, and pressed hero.  
  
  Part of her longed to muss them up, just a little, and make them human.  
  
  “Can I get you some coffee?” she asked.  
  
  “Oh, no, but thank you.” Elizabeth granted her a smile. “We’d really like to just get to it. We have a full schedule today.” As Mac dealt with their outdoor gear, El  
izabeth glanced around the studio. “This used to be the pool house?”  
  
  “That’s right.”  
  
  “It’s . . . interesting. I suppose I expected something more elaborate. Still.” She wandered over to study some of the framed photos on the wall. “Charles’s cousin’s wedding here in November was wonderful. And she just raves about you and your partners. Isn’t that right, Charles?”  
  
  “Yes. It’s what decided us on your company.”  
  
  “The wedding planner and I will be working closely together over the next months. Is there anywhere I can freshen up before we start?” Elizabeth asked.  
  
  “Absolutely.” Mac led the way to the powder room off her studio, and wondered just what there was to freshen.  
  
  “So, Charles.” Mentally, Mac was loosening the perfectly executed Windsor knot of his tie. “Where are you two off to today?”  
  
  “We have a meeting with the wedding planner, and we’re taking care of registering. Elizabeth is going on to meet with two of the designers your partner recommended for her gown.”  
  
  “That’s exciting.” You look just thrilled, she thought, the way you might for your semiannual dental visit.  
  
  “It’s a lot of details. I suppose you’re used to them.”  
  
  “Every wedding’s the first. Would you mind standing behind the stool here? I can check the lighting and focus while Elizabeth’s getting ready.”  
  
  He moved obediently, stood stiff as a poker.  
  
  “Relax,” she told him. “This will be easier and quicker than you think, and possibly fun. What kind of music do you like?”  
  
  “Music?”  
  
  “Yeah, let’s have some music.” She crossed to her CD player, chose a disk. “Natalie Cole on ballads. Romantic, classic. How’s that?”  
  
  “Fine. That’s fine.”  
  
  Mac caught him sneaking a peek at his watch as she went back to pretend to adjust her camera. “Have you decided on the honeymoon spot yet?”  
  
  “We’re leaning toward Paris.”  
  
  “Do you speak French?”  
  
  For the first time he smiled easily. “Not a word.”  
  
  “Well, there’s the adventure,” she said as Elizabeth came back looking as precisely perfect as she had when she’d gone in.  
  
  The suit was probably Armani, and beautifully tailored. The indigo blue color flattered, and Mac imagined Elizabeth had selected Charles’s slate gray to set it off.  
  
  “I think we’ll start with you sitting, Elizabeth, with Charles behind you. Just a little to the left, Charles. And Elizabeth, if you’d angle toward the windows, just a bit. Lean back toward Charles—relax your body. Charles, put your hand on her left shoulder. Put your hand over his, it’ll show off that spectacular engagement ring.”  
  
  She took a couple of shots just to get them over the initial frozen smiles.  
  
  Angle your head.  
  
  Weight on the back foot.  
  
  Shift your shoulders.  
  
  Shy, Mac realized. He was shy, camera shy and just a little people shy. And she was monumentally self-conscious. Terrified of not looking exactly right.  
  
  She tried to put them at ease, asking how they met, how they got engaged—though she’d asked the same questions when they’d set up the appointment. And received the same answers now.  
  
  She barely cracked the surface.  
  
  She could stop now, Mac thought, and give them exactly what they thought they wanted. But it wouldn’t be what they needed.  
  
  She stepped back from the camera. As she did, their bodies relaxed, and Elizabeth turned her head to smile up and over at Charles. He winked at her.  
  
  Okay, okay, Mac thought. Humans in there after all.  
  
  “I’ve got several very nice formal shots. I know that’s what you wanted, but I wonder if you’d do something for me?”

We’re hosting another relaxed but mind-bending philosophy meetup on Sunday, 27th July at 3:00 PM, at Love & Latte, Versova.

**Topic: Machine, God & Us**  
What happens when machines evolve faster than us? If AI reaches human-level intelligence, will it see us as creators—or just irrelevant? And if we gain the power to revive the dead... should we?

As always, this isn’t a lecture or debate. Just a bunch of curious people exploring wild, meaningful questions together. No philosophy degree needed—just thoughts, questions, and an open mind.

Tickets are ₹200 to cover space and setup.

If you’re into tech, spirituality, or just love weird late-night thoughts—this one’s for you.

Drop a comment if you’re coming or DM me for details!

1ly3usp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ly3usp/first_sober_vacation/,First sober vacation!,"As the title says, I'm on my first sober vacation. For transparency, I'm California sober because I can take cannabis or leave it, but it's helpful when a large craving hits.

We're at the beach and that would usually consist of day drinking on the beach, at lunch, while getting ready for dinner, and continuing after dinner.  It would inevitably lead to irritability, fights, and hungover mornings, missing half the day before the cycle repeats. Thinking about it as I type this makes me nauseous and makes me wonder how I did it.

Contrast that with a really fun, relaxing day at the beach without wondering where my next drink was coming from.  I had one small puff of the pen early in the day and that was it.  We walked the beach, walked to a fun lunch, relaxed while getting ready for dinner, and had a great dinner on the bay. I enjoyed a mocktail mojito not because I was craving a drink, but because it sounded refreshing while watching the sunset.  We even walked for ice cream after dinner, something I never would have done because I would have been drunk and looking for more.

This morning we sat outside and watched the birds on the bay while drinking coffee and I was fully present, not nursing a hangover and thinking about my next drink.  Though I was nursing the 25,000 steps we took yesterday! We had a lovely walk to breakfast and we're now heading to the beach to relax.

Sharing this post because I'm sure others have vacations coming up and they're nervous.  Not only can you do it, but it is genuinely better! And I'm not perfect or different, I just had to reset my number over the 4th of July weekend.  But I'm right back at it and loving life.  You've got this.

1ly3txl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ly3txl/potential_starting_of_grooming_a_minor_at_work/,Potential starting of Grooming a minor at work,"Hi everyone, 

Around 10 months ago me (17 and gay - 16 when I started) started an apprenticeship in my dream industry putting me a step closer to my dream job. As you can imagine being so young I view anyone who does my dream job as really cool and I gravitate to these individuals more probably because I just want to know as much as I can about it. 

There is a gay man (37) who does this job, around 6 months ago give or take we connected on LinkedIn and I commented on one of his posts and we got chatting, nothing special just about work and we happened to bump into each other around a week later when I was on a day long placement where he works. Him and his boss offered to take me for a coffee and I agreed and we went along. We all had a good chat for an hour or so about how I plan on working my way up to this job. His boss then left and it was just me and him. We continued chatting but then he said to me “you’re gonna be the face of *my dream job* with your good looks.” Instantly I was a bit like ‘oh that’s not okay’ in my head but didn’t say anything as I only came out a year ago and just assumed all gay men were like this. We exchanged numbers and I messaged him later on to confirm receipt of the message. He responded with ‘Hey you!’. (I take this to heart a bit flirtatious) Later down the conversation he said to me “You keep getting better and better” (again a bit inappropriate potentially?) after I praised him on something. 

To avoid dragging this on I’ll just mention somethings he’s said to me. “You good looking specimen”, always calls me “Cheeky chops”. Constantly tells me how cool and good looking he is, told me he’s going to the gym to try and get his body in shape again, the other week he also said to me “being stalked by a twink is probably most 37 year olds dream😉” and told me I can tell him anything about anyone or anything and not have to worry about him telling anyone. He also messaged one of my coworkers (36) “just had three wanks and I’m not even tired😜”. This same coworker has warned me of him and said he can be a bit of a sex pest.

Yesterday I got a message off of him accusing me of spreading “private” information on a forum. This was details about his career progression which is publicly available on his LinkedIn and Instagram. I cannot stress this enough, even though the information was about him it was completely anonymous and not sensitive in the slightest, his name was NOT mentioned nor was the company we work for and nothing was derogatory it was a statement used to justify something not a opinion, just a career timeline and job titles (which are incredibly vague). 

I denied these accusations as I was scared what his intentions were if I admitted it and if I get reported it may look bad on my really good reputation which I’ve worked hard to build. He told me was going to do further digging with a senior manager (I think he used this so scare and bully me into admitting it) and later on text me again saying he knows it’s me and I should own up. I have not read or replied to this. And don’t planning on doing so.

I am very scared of his intentions and all information he holds on me in the form of things I have said about stuff which may get me into trouble at work which he assured me I could say with no repercussions. He’s also come straight to me personally when he should’ve gone to his manager to report me and I find his actions extremely unprofessional. 

Because of this I am strongly considering putting in a confidential formal complaint of him attempting to groom, sexualise, scare, bully and exploit a position of power and trust over a minor/vulnerable individual. My managers are great and would support me 100% through it and other coworkers who have negative experiences with him I’m sure will give anonymous evidence if asked.

My mum and step-dad are both really supportive of me being gay but I don’t quite think they understand/have the natural straight person ignorance over the severity of his behaviour. Hence why I’ve come here to ask fellow gays perspective. Am I overreacting or should I report him?

Hey - you're in for a long one... 

So I (25F) got into a conversation with my 
little sister(18F). I asked her whether she had heard anything about the fight I had with my mom and stepdad recently. 
For context I had a conversation with my mom that I thought went okay - but apparently now she has a different view on it. My stepdad meddled when we were actually just closing the conversation off, yelling at me, and saying that it was unbelievable how I didn't live up to the same standards as I grew up in - with people just showing up at the doorstep without a heads up, expecting to get a cup of coffee or stopping by for a visit. I asked him if he really felt like I had to live just to make them happy, and not myself feel happy or comfortable in my own home. He said yes. 
My boyfriend and I feel better with people calling or texting before they stop by, but my family has a hard time respecting and accepting that - especially since we live in the same small town. 

I asked my little sister, because my family really talk a lot with each other about problems they have with someone else instead of solving it with the right person. And I felt like I could open up to my little sister since we actually had gotten what I thought was a pretty great bond over the last year. I'm not saying I'm in the right here and that I didn't make mistakes. I said something I shouldn't have said about my older sister - I remember it as me saying ""I feel.."" or ""I think.."" (so not an accusation, but just a feeling). 
She didn't say anything to that in particular, but said in the conversation something in the lines of: ""Yeah, I don't really know anything, they haven't talked to me about it. And if they do, I usually just say I don't want to talk about it. I say that a lot to people when I don't feel like talking about their problems.""

Then she called me afterwards being really flippant and rude saying how I talked shit about them, and my mom. Which I didn't do. I did say something I shouldn't have said - at least not to her. I was however just venting, it wasn't something I considered a problem, it was just to vent and it was also an example to a point I was trying to make. 
She said that if I didn't call my big sister and talked to her about my problem with her, then she would do it for me.. 

Context
I said I felt like my mom was maybe a little jealous of my relationship with my in-laws, because they slept over at new years, and they bring it up towards me in conversations with like a: ""We don't feel welcome in your home, but your in-laws can sleep there?"" (Also being said, they just don't try either. They don't try to call or text asking if we're home, they just chose that they're not welcome here.) And also because we do spend time with them sometimes. But it usually isn't us taking the initiative - not because we don't want to, but just because we focus on some other things. 
And they also respect how we feel about calling/texting before showing up, they even prefer it themselves. 
My family typically uses different scenarios against me.. 
And then I said, as I also feel my big sister might be jealous of my relationship with my best friend and how well we talk with one another. 
The point of the whole conversation was that my family doesn't think about their own responsibility in it. Like how they tell me I'm not normal to want people to call before showing up, and how not welcome they feel, and how my boyfriend doesn't have ADHD - it doesn't even exist apparently (according to my mom). And that goes the same for my big sister, like the fact that I talk well with my best friend who doesn't judge me, and we talk very respectfully to each other and accepts that our opinions might not be the same, but we're still good. 
And that has also sort of come up in a conversation with my sister - it wasn't just a random feeling, but not exactly using the word jealous, but something about how well or how much we talk or see one another, and how my big sister and I don't - which typically also gets said in a sort of shallow way. 
It's their own responsibility they forget, when they talk about it. 
Like how they really don't talk to me or treat me or my boyfriend for that matter with the same respect we get treated somewhere else.
Their opinion is to respect your elders, apparently not everyone - which is my opinion. 

So - I told my little sister that it wasn't her problem, and it wasn't even a problem in my opinion. My little sister and my big sister then decided they wanted us to have a conversation yesterday evening - which I really didn't want to have, because I had for once in a while actually been social, and driving for an hour to see my other best friend who I hadn't seen for over a year, to also having to drive back. So I was tired and mentally I just really didn't feel like it. Like I know that it doesn't end well usually - especially when I'm tired. 
But they kept pushing and pushing, and calling SO many times until I picked up the phone, and saying how they wanted it to be tonight and they didn't want to walk around the next day being sad all day until I was actually ready to have a conversation with them. 
I kept trying to stand my ground, but then my big sister said in the phone:""If you don't show up here tonight, we're not going to be in touch anymore."" 
I felt manipulated - but I caved.. 
I was so angry, at myself and at them.. They had threatened me twice that day and pushing my boundaries, having zero respect for me and my time. I was angry at myself for caving in. 
And it went as I thought. It didn't go well. 
I often communicate with ""I feel"" and ""I think"" because I don't want to assume something, if it isn't 100% correct. 
Big sister kept saying:""Yeah, you and your I feel, I feel, I feel... We also feel things!!!""
I kept saying how I didn't feel respected or talked to in a respectful way - also trying to underline the fact that they really pushed me today. 
Then my big sister at last suddenly gets up and starts looking down on me sitting on the couch yelling into my head that I should stop talking about how she doesn't respect me, because she does.. And that if I said it one more time I'd need to go. 
So I looked her in the eyes and said: ""You don't talk this way to someone you respect"" 
Then she said:""Leave! Before I hit you!""
And I just answered with a: ""wow.. another threat.."" 
And then she said ""We don't have anything to talk about before you acknowledge that I do respect you.""
And then slammed the door in my face. 

I went home. 
She (big sister) then came to me today - saying when she'd be here and that she wanted to give me something. 
She hugged me and said sorry for threatening me with hitting me - that it wasn't okay, but I apparently pushed her buttons yesterday, that only I apparently can push. 
I sort of feel that the apology is a little hollow in some way, because in my opinion no matter what - it's never okay to threaten anyone, no matter how annoying you feel like they can be.. And I sort of feel like she blames me in her apology, that I sort of asked for it? Does it make sense? 

Then she went out getting groceries, I asked if she wanted to swing by to have a conversation. 
We sat down, had a conversation, it felt okay. But she like kept saying that I had stuff to work on - which I acknowledged. Again not herself taking responsibility for her own actions. 
I explained to her how I see respect - that respect in my opinion is to accept that we don't always see eye to eye, to respect if people say they don't want to have a conversation right at that moment just because you do, that respect isn't to keep pushing, when they've already gotten an answer, respect isn't threatening, yelling or stepping over someone else's boundaries. 
She didn't really answer to that, but apparently she feels that she can treat me and the closest family differently than she has to treat someone else. That it is different.. 
Which to me is bs. 

I feel like everyone deserves to be treated with respect and accept. 
And I also explained why I said ""I feel"" and ""I think"" in the beginning of a lot of my opinions/view or feelings - because I don't want to assume things. 

We ended the conversation sort of her just saying how I should apologize to my little sister for being rude and flippant yesterday evening in the conversation. 
And of course it's my responsibility to say sorry for my mistakes. 
I do however feel, that I told them I didn't want to be there and that I was tired - so in some way I do hold a grudge for them pushing me and in some way they got exactly what I told them would happen.. 
Because I was angry from the get-go. 
But again - yeah, it's also never OK for me either to get flippant and rude, but gosh do they sometimes push me over the edge.. :( 

Then I typed my sister asking her if when she was done at school, then she said I could come over at 3pm if it was to talk, which I didn't feel comfortable with, because I have a lot of stuff I need to do, before going on vacation Friday. So if she wanted to, she could come up to me? She said that she unfortunately couldn't. So I said, ok - then I guess it will have to wait. 
Which was fine with me. 

But then she started a group chat with my big sister - who I felt I already had said everything I needed to say to. And saying that they wanted me to come down for a chat at 07.30pm, which again - I didn't feel like, because I'm plenty stressed as it is and that the conversation I felt like I needed to have with my little sister, I didn't need to have with my big sister also. 
(I often feel like they team up against me, so it doesn't feel comfortable)
I said:""No thank you, I have some stuff I need to prioritize to do, because I've set it aside for too long."" 
They said: ""What if we come up to you?"" 
I didn't answer them, because I felt like I said what I needed to say. 
So they tagged me in the conversation, and started calling me again. I didn't pick up. I wrote:""No thank you, I already gave you an answer."" 

And then my big sister rambled about how much time she spent speaking with me today, that now I made everything worse and pushed them away and how my boyfriend must be happy since I didn't go there today because they assumed he was the cause of this .. (Which he isn't by the way) 
He does however want for me to have some self-respect, because I deserve it. And he loves me and wants what is best for me. 

And then she (big sister) ended by writing something similar to: ""I hope you're happy!"" But in a flippant way. (It's the best way to describe since there is no direct translation)

And I just wrote: ""Thank you"" 

Am I really the AH for wanting to pull away from this relationship with my siblings? 
And am I stupid to feel like they sort of manipulate with me?

At the same company (purchased 3X over my tenure of 29 years) for the last 8 years, and per last acquisition landed where the culture is silo’d and broken, but they want it to be fixed. No one wants to put in the work. Peer team of 8 other managers, maybe 2/3 of them are engaged and want to see /push change, rest of them riding out their time and really don’t engage due to being too busy or overloaded with meetings and huge teams due to totally lopsided org structure. 

I have a tiny team of 4…brand new process, with tons of opportunity to push a new culture to our part of the org. Team is engaged and I’m ready to take us there. Leadership above me wants to “see change” but also pushes back on change and relies heavily on “how it’s always been” which I hate. 

Help me. In past roles I’ve helped shape and push solid employee-centric culture that already had a foundation and been successful. But I’ve never been the sole individual trying to make this much of a change/difference in our actual work culture. 
Oh yeah- I’m remote, and my team is spread across the country, entire org is as well, no travel budget and no real engagement budget. Gone are the days of “bringing in lunch” to make people feel valued, or having a coffee with people offsite to let them talk and feel heard. 

I’m not looking to leave where I am- 10 more years to retire folks- but want to make solid impact. Don’t want to step on other managers toes, or come off too strong, but also not going to sit back and watch. Maybe I’m in my head too much??

I finished watching the series a few days back, and I have been quite disturbed, to say the least. I have played the scenes dialogue quite a few times in my head. I have a few lingering questions about the characters, but nothing as pertinent as what happens to Camille? How does she get rid of the darkness?

In the final scene, we see Camille doing a bit better; she has a cup of beverage in her hand (not vodka)- she thinks she saved Amma in a way that she could never save Marian, only to discover the dollhouse a few seconds later. I saw hope when I saw Camille and the coffee cup in her hand, and from there, poof, nothing- the look in her eyes absolutely broke me. How does she cope? What do you think happened to her?

Hours just vanish into scrolling random a$$ sh*t on ig reels or yt shots and then i feel worse like I'm stuck in an infinite loop fr.

My energy is unpredictable. Like on some days i get these random bursts and my brain wants to do everything at once. Other times i just scroll for 6 hours straight. either way, my to-do list laughs at me.

even the “just do one small thing” advice feels heavy when your energy’s shot. and when i do get a rare window of energy? i waste it switching between apps like a maniac until it’s gone. rinse. repeat.

but here’s what kinda helped without deleting any apps:

i moved all the scroll traps aka social apps (insta, reddit, youtube etc.) off my home screen and buried them deep in a random folder. Replaced that space with notes, calendar, or just boring apps. Girl also use that black and white/grayscale mode i assure you that you don't wan use your phone no longer. And do some sort of physical activity be it walking or just anything that requires your body to make a movement.

i also stopped scheduling by time and started planning to do it in the exact moment I feel like doing it.

i’m still figuring stuff out.I don’t feel totally fixed, but i feel less like i’m drowning. Sowhat actually worked for y’all?
Like genuinely. any real methods, habits, or apps that helped you function better with chaotic energy and low motivation?

Well today I got to see it with my own two eyes when my 1 year old dropped his cup of milk on the floor near the the Eufy E28 that was already cleaning near that area. My reaction was to pick up the cup and start to clean it (which I did) then i decided to let it go, grab the phone and just see what happens (you can even hear my kids laughing in the background just watching it drive through the milk). This video is only cut for time because it was a little over 5 minutes long and includes a couple key items.....to me anyway.  Hope this helps someone who wants to see an awesome mop in a real life situation.

1. Initial approach. It charged right in, didn't see it as an obstacle outside of the blueberry which is fine with me, probably better not to smash that.
2. This part was amazing. Some of the milk fell where the vac had already cleaned. It seemed to recognize there was a mess and took two actions. It immediately re cleaned the area like it recognized the spill. It then finished my dining room and came back AGAIN. Without me touching a button it started to clean that area a second time which is the middle cut in the video because I had stopped recording.
3. I grabbed the robot before it headed back to the dock for cleaning and checked the components to see how much milk was in the unit. I was very surprised. There was a tiny amount on the lip of dust bin but no puddles or anything inside. Brushrolls were also not covered in milk and were dry (i did scrape some dry crud off thinking it was milk but just gunk from previous cleans). There was one droplet right in front of the mop and that was it, The rest was in the mop which i then allowed to return to the dock for washing, i also triggered a second manual wash just to be safe. Will comment back if i get any future odor.

Hope this helps someone!

So many these days only care about saying the right things or virtue signaling or being performative that you can't even call somebody out for not living what they talk without receiving backlash but that person is still a fraud for it regardless.

This doesn't only apply to say people who claim to be anti-capitalist or socialist or communist in the West but that's definitely a big part of it.  I've found that the vast majority of those people have never not known a comfortable life where they can do things like go out to eat often or waste time at overpriced coffee shops or have the newest gadgets or games etc.  It's easy to call yourself anti-capitalist or communist or socialist when you never have to actually live it in your comfortably capitalist country.

Then there's the people who never shut up about ""fighting for black lives"" or immigrants or whatever else but never actually do anything to help anybody or anything that requires personal sacrifice, and many of those people are in fact closet racist or classist or xenophobic and think themselves superior because of their background or level of education.  Those people are also frauds.

Don't get me started on the fake love for workers and unions these days, either.  Those people professing their love for us seem to have no problem buying from corporations that treat employees like shit or offshore manufacturing or trying to put small businesses out of business or others who actually treat workers well and do the right thing.

I spot the most pitiable room on all the ship. Pilot Recuperation. Well, I’m here. May as well go see them. The door opens and I see my cohort, alongside a few other mech teams. Whaler is currently asleep, a VR headset glued to his eyes and a single headphone clamped onto his solitary ear at the back of his head. For a prey species, he sure can fight.

“Good, just bored. Wanted to see what you were up to, say thanks for helping me out earlier. With the priest I mean. When you spun up your plasma. At the end of the last mission.”

He starts another lecture. I zone out. I hate this. I look at the things in his office because I am so bored. I get it, I fucked up. I should have just acted like a bumbling yes-man, so I’ll go do that next time. Oh, a snowglobe? That’s fun, it’s very animated. I keep my eyes fixed towards Claucu’s face, but make sure to keep my eyes down. He’s got a PhD in criminal psychology? Nice! How come I’ve never seen that before? Did he redecorate? If I look in his eyes he’ll say that I look angry. That’s some fun embossing on the diploma frame, shame I can’t turn my head to fully observe it or else I’ll get chided. Apparently I always look angry, somehow. I’m not angry. 

I’m just bored. 

Thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts. Gods I need something to do. Is he nearly done? Thank fuck he can’t see me jiggle my leg.

This needs to end and I know it won’t end anytime soon. 

Fuck it.

“What’s the purpose of this conversation?”

He looks shocked and taken aback. “To discuss your poor customer service etiqu-”

“What’s my job title, Claucu?”

“There’s no nee-”

“I didn’t ask you if there was a need to speak this way, I asked you what my job title is. Keep up.”

“You’re be-”

“I don’t care that I’m being rude, Claucu.” There. Keep him off balance. Neutral tone. Low and direct voice volume. No affectations of anger. Any recording done by his e-secretary will ping me as polite and mild mannered. He’ll think I’m shouting at him because for some reason people always think I’m shouting at them. Then he’ll raise his voice and I can file a complaint against him.

He wants me to be emotionally intelligent? *Use tone and microexpressions and eye contact appropriately to achieve desired outcomes* as my employee handbook instructs me to?

Here you fucking go, asshole.

“Do you want me to remind you what I asked? Did you forget?”

“No, we’re talki-”

“We’re talking about my job title. Do you know it?”

There. Off balance. He’s trying to redirect. I need to be stone. I hold my breath and relax my facial muscles. I go fully neutral. I stare into his non-dominant eye to throw him off balance, make him feel observed but not acknowledged. If they didn’t want me to use these skills they shouldn’t have made me go to all those seminars. 

I should have been Having Fun instead.

“It’s Frame Operations Consultant.” he says through gritted teeth. Anger. Good. There we go.

“You’re right. And what does that mean? What’s my primary workplace responsibility?”

“You operate a fr-”

“Yes, I operate a frame. I go into a multi-ton steel deathtrap, strap myself into a chair right above a plasma reactor, inject Gods-know-what drugs into my brain, and get paid your yearly salary for a few hours of doing a job with an average retirement timespan of five missions and an average mortality timespan of six. My job is to be a forklift driver at the highest levels of professional acumen, where I’m basically driving two hundred at once, all while getting shot at. My job is not” I pause. I let him process. He won’t interrupt me when I’m, in his perception, mid-sentence “customer service. And I am the best at my job. Ask me why.”

He sighs. “Why?”

“Because my callsign is Tenure. Look up why my callsign is Tenure.” I nod and make a dismissive hand-wave to his personal terminal. He knows I won’t answer until he complies. He wants to play corpo mind games? That’s fine baby, we can play corpo mind games. All I need to know are the rules, and these dipshits gave me an entire fucking handbook and week long workshops on the rules.

He clicks and clacks at a slow pace it is so annoying I want to just throw him to the side of the room and do it myself and just show him that he needs to just

No. No. I’m getting worked up. And for what? For him? I’m chill. I’ve got a cigarette waiting for me in my room and we’ve got shore leave in two days. I’ll be fine.

He finishes reading my psychological profile, diagnosis after diagnosis after diagnosis. OCD. Depression. Sociopathy. Psychopathy. Narcissism. 

All of these are false. I don’t think I’m going to die if I don’t follow rules I made up. I actively try to rid myself of my malaise. I don’t enjoy manipulating people. I have a high regard for the rights of others. I don’t derive pleasure from others’ pain or despair. I don’t abuse or gaslight people into keeping them around.

He finally finishes reading, the slow-eyed fuck. Why am I so angry? He gets to the end of my psychological evaluation. He reads my personnel report. He gets to the end of my tour re-intake form. He looks at the callsign my lancemates have chosen for me. It is the same one I’ve had for the past five tours. I see his eyes widen as he reads this for the very first time. I mouth along to the words he reads, reflected in his big yellow eyes.

Pilot Register: `Killcorp Pilot Two Five Glada Five Hernok`.

Callsign: `TENURE`. 

Callsign reasoning: `He’s not retiring`. 

Pilot reported psychological response: `INDIFFERENCE`.

Suspected Psychiatric Reasonings: `DEPRESSION 18/25`, `NARCISSISM 20/25`, `ANTISOCIAL 23/25`

He stops reading and looks at me. He’s scared of me. I hate it when people look at me like this. I just want to be seen and known but nobody who truly sees or knows me wants to stick around. I have this great fire inside me and everyone thinks it is ugly. I resist the urge to cry. I need to maintain this persona. I need to lean into it. I need to do this.

Otherwise they’ll keep getting in the way of me Having Fun.

He’s at a loss for words. Time to be soft. “I think that you and I, Claucu, I think we have our own strengths.” There, compliment sandwich. “I think we need to get better at separating our duties. I think you’re a very considerate person who only wants to make me a more well rounded employee. Does that sound fair?”

He nods slowly. I feel bad for him. I didn’t need to push this far. I’m such a piece of shit. I should have just taken the lecture. I should have just been manipulative to the client instead, would have saved me this trouble. I could be in my ca

1ly3c2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ly3c2o/what_do_you_eat_for_breakfast/,What do you eat for breakfast?,"Was diagnosed a few months ago and learned to avoid Vitamin C and coffee due to the acidity. I woke up this morning around 8am, started drinking from my water bottle that had some electrolyte powder mixed in from the night before.

Carried on to take my meds and make my usual smoothie consisting of bananas, Greek yogurt, blueberries, honey and chia seeds. Hours later now I don’t think my meds are kicking in much today?

The label on the electrolyte powder mentions citric acid so that could be a cause but it got me wondering what do you guys start your day with to make the most of your meds?

When I’m home I make the smoothie mentioned above and when I’m in the office I eat a blueberry chia seed ‘jam’ concoction mixed with Greek yogurt (goal always being fiber and protein for me) but now I’m wondering, should blueberries be off limits with ADHD meds? I can’t find a solid answer online.

TLDR; What do you eat in the morning to make the most of your medication? We know that protein is a win and vitamin C is a no-no. What fruits should be avoided aside from oranges?",0,1752334501.0,adhdwomen,8,0.5,False

I just scored a 276 on Step 2 CK, and wanted to share my experience — especially for other IMGs, residents, or anyone feeling overwhelmed trying to juggle clinical duties and exam prep.

# My Background

* IMG in internal medicine residency
* Took **Step 2 CK before Step 1**
* No dedicated study period — I started lightly around 7–8 months out, but didn’t really focus until the final 2 months
* Only had **1 or 2 days off** total in those last two months — prep was squeezed into evenings, weekends, and whatever scraps of time I could manage

# Resources I Used

* **UWorld** was my main and only real Qbank
   * First pass: I made *a lot* of mistakes, and that’s totally normal — you’re not supposed to know everything right away
   * I treated it as a **learning tool**, not just an assessment. I read every explanation deeply and focused on understanding the concepts
   * Took quick notes in a Word document to reinforce weak areas
   * Did a **second pass** to focus more sharply
* **UpToDate** was helpful to clarify certain topics here and there
* **No Anki, no flashcards, no Amboss Qbank**
* For **ethics**, I did all the UWorld questions and supplemented with a bit of Amboss. Ethics showed up *a lot* on my exam (especially as an IMG), so it’s worth the time

# Practice Scores

I did **all the newer NBMEs**, starting about 3 weeks before my test, roughly one every few days. My scores ranged from the **low 250s to low 270s**, with my last one being around 263 three days before my actual exam.

On **Free 120**, I got around 81%, which felt representative.

I ended up scoring **276** on the real deal — higher than any of my practice exams.

And for those wondering: **yes, the real exam felt more like the NBMEs than UWorld**. It was more straightforward, less wordy, and more about testing understanding than sheer detail recall.

# Test Day Strategy

* I followed a 4-2-1-1 block schedule with breaks in between
* Brought light snacks, chocolate, iced coffee — whatever helped keep my energy up
* Used the noise-canceling headphones they provide — highly recommend
* Most importantly: I made sure to **sleep well the night before**. You really don’t want to be sleep-deprived on test day

# Final Thoughts & Advice

* You **don’t need to memorize everything**. I never did Step 1, and I still managed to crush Step 2. It’s about understanding the concepts, not having a photographic memory
* **NBMEs are valuable**, but don’t waste time doing the older ones — stick to the new ones, use them to spot weaknesses, and review your mistakes
* **Don’t freak out over your UWorld first-pass performance**. I made tons of mistakes in my first pass. It’s normal. That’s how you learn
* If you're working full-time or in residency, it's 100% possible — just takes consistency and smart time use
* And finally, don’t get caught up in “the right way” to study. I didn’t follow anyone’s plan. I didn’t ask around how to study X or Y. I just did what made sense to me — and it worked

If you're an IMG, a resident, or just someone grinding through this, I hope this helps show it's possible. Feel free to drop questions — happy to help!",13,1752334451.0,Step2,5,0.93,False

**Why This Pick?**

Cardinals starter Erick Fedde (4.79 ERA) has been rough, friends – and he’s even worse at home. Fedde has allowed 17 runs in his last 3 outings on 20 hits – this is a crazy statistic! As long as the Atlanta offense makes contact, we should have a high-scoring game. The Braves don’t have a pitcher listed at the time of writing, but to be frank it doesn’t matter. If Atlanta rolls with a bullpen game the way I suspect they might, this final score should land on the moon (lol). If not, there isn’t anyone on the Braves starting roster that I think will keep St. Louis off the board enough to make this a low scoring affair. Take the Over to cash.

“Please, Alpha,” Leila begged, kneeling on the cold floor, tears in her eyes as she pleaded with her mate. “Find someone else to donate blood for Maris! I’m two months pregnant...”

But Kelvin, her Alpha, only shoved her away, his voice impatient. “It’s just a blood donation! How can you be so selfish, Luna? Are you really going to watch Maris die?”

Maris. Maris. It was always about Maris. Leila’s heart broke. Kelvin had always called her his “sister,” but to Leila, it was clear that Maris meant more to him than she ever did. She wasn’t his Luna; she was just a pawn in his game.

Inside her, her wolf howled in pain, torn between the fear of losing her baby and the agony of the truth. Leila pressed her hands to her abdomen, where her baby had finally grown after five years of bonding. This child was the only thing she had left—her one bright hope.

“This is our pup, Kelvin!” she cried, her voice trembling. “If I donate blood again, I’ll lose the baby…”

But Kelvin, the very Alpha who should’ve cared for her, ignored her. Without a second thought, he shoved her roughly. In the struggle, his foot accidentally hit her stomach.

Leila screamed in pain. Her body burned with the sharpness of it, but Kelvin only looked at her coldly. “If the child dies, then you can donate blood for Maris without any problems.”

As darkness closed in, Leila understood for the first time. She wasn’t his mate. To Kelvin, she had always been a tool to save Maris. Nothing more.

When Leila woke up, still shaken by the pain, she found Kelvin kneeling in front of her, regret and guilt in his eyes. He tried to apologize.

But Leila only looked at him, coldly. “It’s too late for regret, Kelvin. You killed our child. You don’t deserve an heir, and you don’t deserve to be my mate.”

…

The marking ceremony was about to begin. Kelvin was distracted, his mind clearly elsewhere. He followed the officiant’s instructions absent-mindedly, slipping the diamond ring onto Leila’s finger.

He leaned in, ready to mark her, but Leila was filled with anticipation. After five long years of waiting and hoping, she was pregnant with his child. This ceremony was supposed to mark the start of their future together—a family they’d dreamed of.

But just as the moment should’ve felt perfect, a phone notification buzzed. Kelvin glanced at his phone, and Leila’s heart sank. A sense of dread settled in her chest.

Kelvin’s face changed in an instant, panic flashing across it. He grabbed her arm, pulling her roughly toward the door.

“Kelvin, what are you doing?” Leila asked, struggling against him, feeling her wolf pacing uneasily inside her.

“Maris needs you,” he said urgently. “She’s injured—she cut her wrist and is losing too much blood. She needs a transfusion.”

His voice was commanding, his Alpha presence pressing down on her, making it clear there would be no argument. “Leila, you have to help her again.”

Maris. Leila had always been the one with the right blood type to match Maris. She had been Maris’s personal blood donor for years. Her wrists were already covered with dark bruises from the countless times she had helped.

But now, Leila felt a wave of exhaustion wash over her. It was like every bit of energy had drained from her body. Her wolf howled weakly, and she felt as though she couldn’t move.

She had known from the start that Kelvin had a “sister”—Maris, the fragile Omega who always needed care. Kelvin always took care of her, ordering her coffee, fetching her drinks, but he could never remember what she liked. Leila had argued with him about it before, but Kelvin always brushed it off, saying, “She’s just like a sister to me. Don’t overthink it.”

But now, seeing the urgency in Kelvin’s eyes, seeing how worried he was for Maris, Leila couldn’t ignore the truth anymore.

Kelvin had never cared for her.

Even when she had been sick, burning with a fever that reached 104°F, unable to leave bed, Kelvin had barely acknowledged her. He’d just told her to drink more water, then reluctantly brought back some herbs. Leila had told herself he didn’t know how to care for a mate, that he needed her to teach him.

But now, she saw the truth—he didn’t care. Not really.

Her heart broke, and she pressed her hands protectively against her belly. With a firm resolve, she wrenched her arm free from his grasp.

“I’m not going,” she said, her voice cold. “She’s your precious ‘sister,’ your beloved Omega. This has nothing to do with me.”

Kelvin’s face twisted with anger, his patience gone. His Alpha aura pressed down on her like a heavy weight, suffocating her.

“How dare you?” he spat. “As the Luna of this pack, you’re going to let a weak Omega die? How could I not have seen how heartless you are?”

“You should be honored to donate blood for Maris! You’re going whether you want to or not!” He grabbed her arm tighter, his nails digging into her skin.

Leila could barely move, her strength drained by his overwhelming presence. She struggled to stay upright as pain shot through her stomach.

Finally, with a steady voice, she looked him in the eyes and said, “Kelvin Bozzelli, I’m pregnant. Two months. I can’t donate blood. Please, let go of me!

Chapter 2

Leila’s wrist suddenly slipped out of Kelvin's grasp.

Kelvin furrowed his brow, his gaze fixed on her stomach, as if trying to judge the truth behind her words. His voice softened unexpectedly. “Maris is in critical condition. Donating blood won’t necessarily cause a miscarriage.”

“You only bring up the baby now because you want me to claim you, right? But I never said I wouldn’t mark you,” Leila retorted, her voice sharp. As she spoke, she stepped closer to him. His Alpha aura pressed down on her, but instead of feeling a rush of warmth, a cold chill swept over her. “If you want to continue this ceremony, then go donate the blood, Kelvin. It’s just a little pain. You could finally make me your Luna. Isn't that a small sacrifice for something so big?”

“A small sacrifice…” Leila’s body froze. She realized, in a daze, that he had always known about her suffering and sacrifices. But he had chosen to ignore them all along.

""Enough,"" she said, her voice trembling but firm. ""Whether I donate blood to Maris or not is my choice. The healers said my baby is unstable. I’ve had a hard time getting pregnant. I won’t risk my child’s life for this.""

A gust of wind blew up her veil, and she lifted her hand, staring at the Alpha she had loved for five years. Slowly, she removed the veil from her head, and with a swift motion, tossed it right onto his face.

“If Maris means that much to you, then go mark her…” Her voice quivered, bitterness seeping through her words.

Kelvin froze for a moment, irritation flashing in his eyes. But he quickly suppressed it, lowering his voice, trying to calm her down—or perhaps deceive her. “Leila, I was impulsive earlier. Just help Maris this one time, okay? It’s different this time. She really tried to hurt herself. Her wrists are covered in cuts. Can you imagine how much pain she’s in?”

His voice was filled with concern, and for a second, Leila felt a strange twinge of doubt. This Alpha—who usually only gave orders—was now speaking gently to her, pleading on behalf of someone who wasn’t even his mate.

But then, the memory hit her—one she couldn’t forget.

It was a winter three years ago. She had just finished donating blood to Maris. Dizzy and weak, she had scraped her hand on a wire fence on the way home. The wound was deep, blood dripping from her hand as it slowly widened. She had cried, asking Kelvin to take her to the healer’s to get stitches and a tetanus shot.

But instead, he had smiled and taken out his phone, snapping a picture. ""Wow, that’s a big cut! I can see your muscles! Scary! I’ve gotta post this on Instagram and show the guys in the pack.""

Ignoring her shock, he posted the picture, laughing as he read the comments. Leila had stood there, stunned for half an hour, before he finally remembered and said, “Oh, baby, I totally forgot! Sorry, I’m just messing around. Let’s get you to the healer now!”

At that time, Leila had told herself he was just being careless.

But now, she understood—he didn’t not know how to care. He simply didn’t care at all.

Her stomach began to ache more intensely. Kelvin’s condition made it difficult for him to father children, which meant Leila’s pregnancy had been challenging from the start. The night before the wedding, she had been so exhausted she had visited the healers, who told her she was anemic and that her pregnancy was already precarious. If she didn’t address it, she might lose the baby.

And now, with just a few sweet words, Kelvin was back to impatiently pulling her toward Maris.

“Leila, stop being so stubborn!”

“It’s just donating blood! It won’t harm you or the baby! But if you keep this up, we’re done. Don’t even think about becoming my Luna!”

Kelvin always knew exactly what Leila cared about and wasn’t afraid to use it against her.

Leila looked at him coldly, a bitter smile curling at the corner of her lips. “Fine, then I’ll reject you—”

Before she could finish, she was suddenly shoved hard from behind. She stumbled, barely managing to keep her balance, but the pain in her body flared up like a sharp knife. The bond between her and Kelvin felt dangerously unstable.

Behind her, her mother-in-law Lilith’s voice sliced through the air, sharp and cruel.

“Who do you think you are? You’ve been bonded for years, and now you’re pregnant, and you think you’re the Lycan Queen? Pathetic.”

“You’re carrying just a cluster of cells. How dare you compare it to Maris? Look at yourself!”

“Stop pretending! Go to the hospital!”

“If you delay Maris’s blood transfusion, don’t ever think of stepping foot in this pack again!”

Leila collapsed to her knees, the pain too much to bear. She could hear guests nearby whispering, wondering where the Alpha and Luna had gone.

At that moment, her father-in-law, Rein, spoke coldly. “Enough. The car’s ready. Take her to the hospital. Your mother and I will handle things here.”

Leila trembled, her voice breaking as she clung to Kelvin’s leg. “Kelvin, I’m your Luna. You can’t ignore me like this! I’m still carrying your child!”

But Kelvin was impatient. He tried to shake her off, his Alpha aura filled with irritation and anger.

In that instant, his leg accidentally kicked her in the stomach. Pain surged through her body, and warmth spread down her leg, followed by an overwhelming fear. Her wolf began to scream in her mind.

Though she had already lost all hope in Kelvin, this child—her child—was everything to her. It was her one and only.

Desperately, she grabbed his pants again, crying and pleading, “Please, take me to the healers… The baby… I’m going to lose the baby... Please!”

Kelvin hesitated for a moment, his brow furrowing as he looked down at her, her sobbing form clinging to his legs. For just a moment, there was a flicker of doubt in his eyes, his aura shifting slightly.

But as she continued to beg, Lilith’s voice rose, shouting at Kelvin.

“Look at her! I told you she was cold-blooded! She doesn’t deserve to be your Luna!”

“I never agreed with you bonding with her! Today, she’s refusing to help your little Maris, the weak Omega. Tomorrow, she’ll let me die too!

Chapter 3

Blood kept flowing from between her legs, soaking into her wedding dress, pooling on the floor in a dark, spreading stain. Leila clutched her stomach, silently begging for comfort from the Alpha—the comfort she would never receive. She whispered over and over, her voice trembling, “Alpha, please. This is my child, my flesh and blood… and yours…”

Her words were broken, swallowed by endless sorrow. She wanted to scream, to let all the pain out, but her throat felt clogged, as if filled with cotton, blocking any sound from escaping. Even her wolf could only whimper weakly in response. The pain in her abdomen worsened, a sharp, searing agony that took over her whole body. The bond she shared with Kelvin felt distant now—like an empty echo. She couldn’t feel him at all.

Lilith kept berating her for “pretending,” while Kelvin’s father, Rein, urged Kelvin to hurry and get her to the healer’s quarters to donate blood. Neither of them seemed to care about her. They only saw her as a tool for donating blood.

Leila couldn’t hold on anymore. She collapsed heavily to the floor, her back and lower body crashing down with a brutal force. Her head slammed into the cold ground, the impact ringing in her ears and drowning out all thought. A sharp, painful cry echoed in her mind from her wolf.

As she lay there, staring at the ceiling, the flashing red and white lights above her blurred and twisted. Beneath the harsh light, Kelvin’s face leaned over her, but instead of concern, all she saw was twisted relief.

“Sorry, Leila,” Kelvin said. “You’ve lost so much blood, the baby… I’m afraid it won’t survive.”

“But hey, at least now you can donate blood to Maris. That’s a good thing, right?”

“Don’t worry, sweetheart. We’ll have another child someday, I promise…”

His voice became distant, muffled, as if coming from far away. His Alpha aura surrounded her, but instead of calming her, it felt suffocating, almost like it was choking her.

Everything around her seemed to slow down, warping and distorting. In her daze, she felt Kelvin’s hands gripping her wrist, pulling her up, trying to force her to get up.

“Enough with the drama,” he said, his voice sharp. “Let’s go. Maris is still waiting for us!”

His parents chimed in from the side, egging him on.

“It’s just a miscarriage, not like the world is ending!”

“I bled when I had kids too. Didn’t stop me from getting right back to work for the pack. She’s just spoiled!”

“This is what happens when you coddle someone!”

Leila felt like her insides were being shredded, every breath coming with a sharp, painful sting.

Finally, she lost consciousness completely, and everything went black.

When she came to, her mind was foggy, and she could tell she was in a hospital. Though her eyes were still closed, she could hear Kelvin speaking to a female healer.

“Healer, are you saying she can’t donate blood right now?”

The healer’s voice was strained, filled with suppressed anger. She sounded like she wanted to scold him but, as an Omega, couldn't match Kelvin's Alpha aura. Still, her voice was firm as she questioned him.

“Alpha, do you understand her condition? She’s severely anemic, and now she’s bleeding heavily. Her internal organs are damaged! She’s not just facing a miscarriage; she needs a blood transfusion herself!”

“Is she really your Luna? You have no care for her at all. Are you even an Alpha? How can you be so irresponsible?”

Leila’s heart sank with a deep sense of despair. How had things gotten this far?

While she—the Luna of the pack—lay unconscious, her child lost, Alpha Kelvin’s thoughts were still consumed with Maris Morrison.

Not even a healer, someone who had never met her before, seemed to care more about her situation than her own mate.

Chapter 4

In the haze between sleep and wakefulness, Leila remembered the early days of her relationship with Kelvin. Back then, he seemed like an Alpha who truly loved her… or perhaps, the love Kelvin showed her was just a substitute for the affection he was supposed to give to Maris Morrison.

When they first met, Maris was away in Europe, living abroad and absent from Kelvin’s life. Unknowingly, Leila became the object of Kelvin's misplaced affection, a place for his love to settle when there was nowhere else for it to go. She thought she had finally found her fated mate, lost in the illusion of the gentle love Kelvin gave her.

But she didn’t know—the truth was, during Maris's absence, she was just a temporary distraction, a laughable replacement. She believed Kelvin’s love, the care he showed as her Alpha, would fill her future with happiness and joy.

When she opened her eyes, Leila found herself alone in the hospital room. Her mate, Alpha Kelvin, was nowhere to be found. The cold moonlight shone in, and she could feel no warmth from the Moon Goddess, only the crushing weight of loneliness and despair.

A healer noticed the pain in her eyes and approached her gently, her aura calming, as she spoke words that felt like a blade to Leila’s heart. “Luna Burke, I’m sorry… We couldn’t save your child. You were severely anemic during the pregnancy, and the blood loss before and after hospitalization was too much. Please accept our condolences.”

Leila’s stomach twisted in agony. She felt like she had died with her child, her heart sinking, as though it would never beat again. She tried to reach out through the bond to Kelvin, her Alpha, but there was nothing.

Just like how he had been absent from her bedside, Kelvin had disappeared from her life when she needed him the most—during her deepest pain and loneliness.

Leila let out a bitter laugh. Beside her, a Delta girl around her age lay in the next bed, being tenderly cared for by her Delta mate. The boy gently fed her soup, and on the bedside table, several small, exquisite dishes were laid out—beautiful and appetizing, both a feast for the eyes and a delight for the senses.

Seeing the girl’s happiness made Leila think back to when Kelvin used to care for her that way—although now she understood it was all a false warmth, she couldn't deny that she once found happiness in that tenderness.

Leila picked up her phone to check, but there were no messages from Kelvin—not one explanation, not a single word of concern, no updates at all.

Instead, when she scrolled through Maris’s social media, she saw a picture of Kelvin in the background, preparing food for Maris. The caption read, “My big brother still takes care of me. He says there’s nothing wrong, but he’s worried I’ll get tired, so he insists on feeding me.” Maris posed with a victory sign, the bandage on her wrist almost invisible, showing no real sign of injury.

It had been a trivial little thing, hardly a wound at all. Thinking of the blood that stained her wedding dress that night, Leila couldn't help but like the post. She commented, ""Wishing you both happiness.""

Then she exited the app and opened WhatsApp. She typed out a message to Kelvin, eyes filled with tears and determination.

Chapter 5

“Kelvin, I request a bond rejection.”

After sending the message, Leila quickly blocked all of Kelvin's contact details. She did it easily, not worrying in the slightest that he might fly into a rage.

After all, he hadn’t responded to her messages in so long. She guessed he wouldn’t even notice..............

So - my mom and my boyfriend (30M) got off of the wrong foot all in the beginning because of different viewpoints. 
We've now been together for 4 years.
My boyfriend got 1-2 years into our relationship diagnosed with ADHD. My boyfriend struggle with being social all the time, and he's an introvert. 
But he's the most amazing man I have ever met, and I love him dearly.
We live together in a house in the same small city as my mom and my big sister.
I (25F) grew up in a household where it was normal just showing up at a family members doorstep and sort of expect to get invited in for a cup of coffee and a chat. No phonecall beforehand or a text message, nothing. 
Just showing up out of nowhere. 

My family expects me to have the same open door ""policy"" as they have, and as I grew up in. I don't like it and neither does my boyfriend. I get extremely stressed, either because the house isn't clean or just the feeling of expectation from them. And my boyfriend doesn't like the unexpected visits either, cause he gets overwhelmed due to his ADHD. And to be honest, I also just like the fact that I know someone is coming by. 
My family is not open to the idea of me not doing it the way they want me to.
I like having a home, where I feel safe and secure, and I feel like they're stepping over my boundaries when they don't respect me and my partners wishes. They call it:""not normal"" to feel this way. 

My mom and big sister mocks my boyfriend with his ADHD and they lack respect for the both of us. They get angry if my opinions doesn't align with theirs. My mom has directly told my little sister, that stress wasn't something I had, it was just something I told myself I had. 
My mom is just for some reason against all diagnoses and refuses to listen or understand anything about them - to her they just don't exist. 

If my partner is overwhelmed and doesn't feel like going to a social event with my family (of 36 people in total) but I end up going, they always ask where he is, and then when I tell them the truth about it, they just shut me down with:""I don't want to talk about sicknesses and diagnoses all the time!"" But they always ask? 

They always share their opinions about it, and making it about them. That he doesn't like them, or that they don't feel prioritized, or they're not welcome here.. But when I then try explaining things, they just shut me down all the time.

Sorry for the long back story, but then you get the picture. 

So the other day I got into a conversation with my mom, and it went very well, she even agreed with the fact that if we hadn't lived in the same town as them, they probably would have called before showing up. We ended with coming up with a compromise. I/we get better at inviting them, and they get better at calling/typing before showing up. But then when the conversation was about to end, I literally stood getting ready to take my purse and get my jacket - my stepdad comes out of the bathroom meddling and got angry saying how they're not welcome at our place, that my dad can't even get invited over when he's in Denmark (which isn't true), and that he can't believe how disrespectful it is to not live up to how I myself grew up, with the open door policy in my mom's house. 
And my mom meddled in the conversation saying: ""do you understand what he's saying?"" And I was like: ""Yeah, I understand, but I don't agree, and I don't like when people yell at me like that.."" And then he just started talking about how I disrespected him in his home and that he could just be like my boyfriend.. And I was like: ""Okay?"" And then he said:""Fine! Then I'm going to ask you to leave!"" 
So I took my stuff and I left.. Haven't talked to him since, and haven't been by or invited them over. I feel like it is an endless struggle to find common ground. 

So am I really the AH for asking/""demanding"" my family to respect me and my partners wishes/rules according to our own home? 
And in general for wishing they'd be more respectful and open in the way they communicate? ",2,1752334069.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
1ly35qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/1ly35qn/i_tried_to_reach_out_to_loki_myself/,I tried to reach out to Loki myself.,"Long rambling again below.

Regarding my post about ""Loki reaching out through a dream?"" on another subreddit and the comments I got on there about my belief of starseeds and aliens - it made me feel very offended (and more, but offended is the best description), so I decided to reach out to Loki and ask him myself. Was it a stupid decision? Only time will tell.

For that I decided to give some offerings - I read he likes chocolate, cinnamon and fire (+more but those three I had available) - so I bought some strawberry chocolate (I eas really drwan to the strawberry flavour - I prefer dark chocolate and I tried some of the strawberry one and imo it is not very good), I have some cinnamon at home and lit a candle for the flame.

Now when I tried to connect with him, granted I wasn't very grounded + didn't do any protections (I have some opinions on that, and again only time will tell if that was a mistake), but I specified 2 times that I wish to connect with him only, the reason I am reaching out to him and the my offerings to him. I used my tarot cards and trusted my intuition.

During the reading, I didn't feel any energy change, nothing different or a sign that he had heard me, but I trusted that he had and asked why he had come in my dream (I don't remember the exact cards that came out + exact meanings) - the answer was vague - something about development. Also before I asked, I got the image of the art on my 3 of wands and ace of wands tarot cards combined (the have distinct style, so I immediately recognised them). Then I got to the question that actually made me reach out myself - wether those comments were true and the way I understood them. At this point the emotions that I was feeling regarding those comments + the anxiety that I actually contacted a deity on my own and that's a serious thing happening and I could be making a huge mistake came over me and I started ugly crying and I couldn't form properly explain myself.

During this moment I legit said to a deity ""Wait a minute"" (it wasn't an order, but maybe not the best way said), and in my mind the image of Loki from the MCU (I think that's because this the appearance that I associate with Loki the most) popped in my mind, with kind of a serious expression, finger intertwined on his stomach, sitting down and I heard in my mind ""I am waiting"" - it was in my own head voice, but I knew it wasn't me (idk how to explain it exactly but my own head voice comes kind of like from the top-back of my head, but this phrase cake as if from the front of my head + the way it sounded was different - more powerful, confident, and self-assured). Some how through ugly crying and chopped up explanation I said what I wanted - I fully stand behind my opinion and words I said to him, wether he agrees or not, but the feelings I said them with - not my proudest and most mature moment. In response to that, through the cards he basically called be gullible, kind of immature and inbalanced. (Now, not to be narcissistic, but I took it really well - if I were told that even a month ago, I would be livid and calling this whole experience fake).

Well, I got what I came for, so I tnaked him and in my mind popped an image of the way the elves from LOTR greet each other, with the hand over their heart and extending it outwards, but the image was only of the chest and the hand, and I knew this was for a goodbye, instead of a greeting (don't ask me how I know, I just know).

With the offering - I put out the flame and cinnamon and chocolate I left where I had put them. I must mention that after I had finished the reading - the cinnamon and chocolate felt different (again I have no idea how to explain it - but it was like there was an invisible sheild around them and they just felt different). The next morning that feeling about them was gone and I ate the chocolate, and with the cinnamon - I plan to use it in a dessert I am making tonight (idk if that's a mistake, again only time will tell, but it just feels wrong to throw them away or give them away, so I just decided to use them in some way).

Before bed I was again overcome with the same ""negative"" emotions, and I just went off in my mind, saying how offended I am, that I don't care what he thinks, those accusations are unacceptable, that if I offended him I would take the consequences, but I am not backing off from my words.

I had a dream again, that I somewhat remember a specific part of it (but tbh it's considered a miracle for me that I remember something). I was travelling in a tank (0 idea why a tank exactly) on a road surrounded by grass on both sides, and there were so many butterflies around - different sizes, shapes and patterns wings. I accidentally killed one of the butterflies and the person who was driving the tank turned around and told me that for killing the butterfly, my punishment is that he had to slap me - and to my surprise I agreed in my dream and took that slap like champ - and that slap was so real, it had the same sound a sensation as the real deal. 

Now I must say that what I am saying I am NOT implying that it's related to anything, I am just listening my observations.

At noon at work when it was time for my coffee, I got the idea to share it with Loki (again a read that he likes coffee as an offering and people share their food and drinks with him). So I made my coffee and before I drink any of it, I invited him to share it with me, and I offer it him as a peace officer for my melt down yesterday, that I understand that I could have reacted in a better way, but I still fully stand behind my opinion and words. And I almost immediately felt like some kind of weight has fallen off my heart, I felt somehow lighter and again the coffee felt different - very similar energy to the offerings I gave yesterday, so I took that as I good sign and drank the coffee.",0,1752334057.0,pagan,0,0.5,False
1ly356k,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ly356k/weird_interaction_at_a_coffee_shop_feeling/,Weird interaction at a coffee shop – feeling unsettled was I Rude?,"I had a strange and uncomfortable experience at a coffee shop today. I placed my order and sat down to wait. There was an overly loud and hyper man nearby—I chose to ignore him and avoided eye contact. It was a hot day, so I was waving my cap like a fan.

Oddly, he started mimicking what I was doing with the cap and sat near where I was sitting. Then he asked the woman he was with something like, ""Did they order?"" referring to me. I still didn't respond or engage.

A few minutes later, he directly asked me, ""Have you ordered?"" Then he shouted to the staff, “Where is this order?” I tried to diffuse it politely and said, “I’m not in a rush, don’t worry about it.”

He didnt work there or anything this place was a regluar for me and i know it takes a while for milkshakes

But again, a few minutes later, he repeated the same thing. I asked him, “Why are you in a rush? Don’t worry.” He replied, “I’m worried for you.” 

I responded, “I can worry for myself.” 

he looked offended then he said, “Be nice, Be nice,” followed by, “I’m not your son,” and walked away saying “Dad.”

It was such a bizarre interaction, and it really threw me off. In coffe shops I generally keep to myself, so this kind of unexpected attention and weird behavior really rattled me. was i rude and should i have responded differently?",15,1752334021.0,socialskills,11,1.0,False

Но мне ближе спокойствие.

Я не мечтаю о миллионах подписчиков, премиях, громких достижениях.
Мне хочется просыпаться без тревоги.
Хочется пить кофе не в спешке.
Хочется говорить с людьми по-настоящему, без образа, без ролей.

Иногда мне кажется, что «успешный успех»  это просто красивая обёртка.
А внутри — тревога, выгорание, сравнение себя с другими.

Я выбираю жизнь, где можно дышать.
Где можно быть собой, а не брендом.
Где не нужно доказывать, что ты чего-то стоишь, просто чтобы тебя заметили.

Пусть это будет не зрелищно. Зато по-настоящему.

А вы когда-нибудь чувствовали, что «тише — лучше»? Что не надо бежать, чтобы жить?


I'm not against success.
But peace feels closer to who I am.

I don’t dream of millions of followers, awards, or loud achievements.
I just want to wake up without anxiety.
Drink coffee slowly.
Talk to people honestly  without masks or roles.

Sometimes it feels like “success” is just nice packaging.
Inside? Anxiety. Burnout. Constant comparison.

I choose a life where I can breathe.
Where I can be a person, not a product.
Where I don’t have to prove I’m worthy,  just to be seen.

It might not be flashy. But it’s real.

Chapter 1 – Burnout & Black Coffee

""I quit.""

The words left Lux Vaelthorn's mouth with all the fire of a breaking contract. The kind of statement that shouldn't be possible inside the Underworld's most sacred financial institution—Vault Nexus Prime.

And yet, here he was.

Standing in the middle of the Executive Atrium like a freshly uncorked bottle of sarcasm and soul-crushing exhaustion, Lux looked absolutely done with life. His collar was open, tie half-removed, sleeves rolled up in casual rebellion. His black hair was slightly mussed like he hadn't bothered to brush it.

Behind him, a mountain of floating holographic files blinked in silent protest. Alerts. Notifications. Performance charts. Bored-looking demon assistants stood frozen nearby, contract scrolls clutched like they were bracing for a lawsuit.

Across from him, lounging far too comfortably for a man who had just returned from a 100-year honeymoon, sat Zavros Vaelthorn, the Lord of Greed. His obsidian-horned head tilted back in his executive hell-throne, tailored suit sharp enough to cut through treaties.

Beside him, equally unbothered and casually dangerous, was Seraphyne, his eternally gorgeous wife and the daughter of the Lord of Lust. She wore a long velvet dress that technically obeyed dress codes, if barely, her crimson nails tapping lightly on a crystal goblet filled with… something that sparkled and probably corrupted innocence.

They looked like two influencers who'd just returned from a luxury resort in the 9th Circle and hadn't noticed their teenage son aged into a traumatized 200-year-old war accountant while they were off breaking every bed in hell.

Zavros blinked once. ""You quit… what?""

Lux threw his hands up. ""Everything! This job. This hellhole of fiscal damnation! I've been running your empire while you two were off collecting honeymoon stamps like it's some kind of infernal challenge!""

Seraphyne took a slow sip from her goblet and gave a light smile. ""You're adorable when you're stressed.""

""I'm not adorable. I'm underpaid and spiritually withering.""

Zavros frowned slightly. ""You literally own half of hell's GDP.""

""Ownership doesn't mean freedom!"" Lux snapped, storming around the desk that technically belonged to his father but hadn't seen Zavros's ass in almost two centuries. ""You left me with unpaid intern demons and quarterly hellfire taxes!""

He slammed both palms on the desk. The impact caused one of the contract ledgers to whimper and slink away into its drawer.

""You know I've been filing your cursed equity mergers? Negotiating with succubi guild unions? I even signed a treaty with Heaven's Neutral Bank last week. Heaven, Dad. Do you know how hard it is to get them to drop the 'Smite First, Ask Later' policy?""

Seraphyne blinked. ""Wait. You went to Heaven?""

""Yes! I wore a tie and everything!""

She looked genuinely impressed. ""Aww.""

Zavros, still somehow confused, leaned forward. ""Lux, you're overreacting. The work is important. You've been holding up the entire economic system of three infernal planes. That's incredible.""

""No,"" Lux said, voice sharp. ""It's a hostage situation with spreadsheets.""

He grabbed his favorite mug—solid obsidian, etched in gold. It read: #1 Overworked Spawn of Greed and Lust. He didn't remember who gave it to him, but it might've been himself. Out of pity.

""I haven't had sleep in decades. I've had to manage souls, sin-fueled interest rates, and emotional labor while you two were off having synchronized bubble baths in lava pits! I'm so tired—"" he pointed to his own eyes. ""—even my eye bags have bags. One of them is screaming for union rights!""

Seraphyne, still lounging like a fashion goddess who moonlighted as a heartbreaker, murmured, ""We didn't even send that many postcards…""

""I'm your only child!"" Lux practically shouted, flinging his hand toward the blinking system window behind him. ""Do you know how many times the System has warned me I'm one coffee bean away from a nervous breakdown?!""

\[Current Burnout Level: 99.87%\]

\[Please ingest caffeine or commit tax fraud to stabilize mental state.\]

\[Also, your hair is frizzy.\]

""Even the System's glitching from stress! It keeps throwing weird comments at me like it's having a breakdown! It's overworked—I'm overworked!""

Zavros exhaled slowly, standing from his throne with the aura of a man used to closing trillion-soul deals without blinking. ""Lux. You are the Heir of Greed. Your soul is literally bound to the throne. You can't quit.""

Lux's red eyes narrowed. ""Fine.""

Zavros blinked. ""Fine?""

""I won't quit,"" Lux said, voice steady, too calm. ""I'll just… take a break.""

There was a beat of silence. Even the temperature dropped.

""A break?"" Seraphyne asked, brow raised.

Lux nodded, backing toward the massive gold-trimmed elevator at the far side of the office. ""Yeah. A break. A little vacation. Time off. Mental health leave. Whatever they call it in the mortal world.""

Zavros followed, confused. ""How long?""

Lux pressed the elevator button.

""One. Hundred. Years.""

Seraphyne made a choking sound. ""Excuse me?!""

""You had 100 honeymoons!"" Lux said, throwing up his arms. ""Let me have one coffee break.""

Zavros looked like he'd just been hit with a divine audit. ""Lux. Be reasonable. There's work to do. Wars to fund. Souls to manage—""

""You do it,"" Lux said, stepping inside as the doors hissed open. ""You're the Lord of Greed, right?""

""That's not how inheritance works!""

""Then revoke it.""

The elevator glowed, summoning the portal runes to the Mortal Realm. Dark power poured in, tinged with the scent of roasted coffee beans and capitalism.

Lux visibly inhaled.

Gods. He missed the mortal realm.

Not the people. Not the weather. Just the coffee. The good stuff. Bitter, overpriced, served in recycled aesthetic cups and brewed by hipsters who thought they were philosophers. That stupid beautiful chaos.

He'd read the reviews. Followed the forums. Watched mortal influencers grind beans on social media.

He was so ready.

Zavros stepped forward, looking genuinely worried now. ""You can't just leave. You're our heir. You're—""

""Burnt out. Done. And in need of a caramel macchiato.""

""Lux—"" Zavros reached for the elevator, but Lux pointed at him, firm.

""Nope, nope. This is family-run slavery. And I'm not dying of stress before I hit my third century. I'll call when I feel like inheriting again.""

Zavros opened his mouth.

Lux cut him off.

""I'm going to the mortal realm. I'm going to drink good coffee. And I'm going to sleep like I've never paid taxes.""

He grinned, slow and dangerous.

""Try to stop me, and I'll leak your quarterly mismanagement report to the angels.""

Zavros froze.

""…You wouldn't.""

Lux winked.

The doors slid shut.

Chapter 2 – The Mortal Realm Has Better Coffee and Worse Luck

Lux stared at himself in the mirror wall of the elevator.

Wow. The System wasn't kidding.

His hair was officially frizzy. Not gently-messy sexy frizzy. More like electrocuted tax accountant mid-deadline panic frizzy. His under-eye circles were so deep they were probably applying for demonic citizenship.

He leaned in, narrowing his glowing red eyes at his reflection.

""Oh, for Hell's sake,"" he muttered. ""I look like I just got denied a business loan by Heaven.""

\[Observation: You've achieved Peak Burnout Chic. Might I recommend… brushing?\]

""I might recommend you shut up,"" he grumbled.

He tugged at his hair, then paused.

Oh. Oh no.

Horns. Tail. Glowing eyes.

Lux hissed and snapped his fingers. ""Human Form, activate.""

\[You have activated your human form.\]

A wave of shimmering light rippled across his skin. His tail fizzled into smoke. His horns shrunk down, disappearing beneath his hair. His skin lost its faint infernal glow and settled into the unfairly flawless features he'd genetically inherited from both his parents.

Still.

The red eyes stayed.

He blinked.

Nope. Still glowing.

\[Incubus Lineage: Eye Color Locked. You're welcome.\]

""Whatever,"" Lux muttered. ""I'll just say I wear designer lenses.""

He checked himself one last time.

Slim-fit black button-down—half-tucked like he gave up halfway through fixing it. Tailored slacks, a little scuffed at the hem. And a suit that definitely looked fancy from a boutique in Limbo—dramatic and overpriced. No horns. No tail. Just barely holding it together, but pretending he was fine.

He looked almost normal.

If normal meant ""mortal billionaire who moonlights as a morally ambiguous CEO.""

He reached for his wallet—and froze.

The color drained from his face.

His fingers curled around… nothing.

""…You've got to be kidding me.""

\[Status: Credit Cards & Cash — Left Behind in Hell.\]

\[Would you like to go back and retrieve them?\]

\[Y/N\]

""Absolutely not,"" Lux snapped. ""I am never going back into that office again. I'll commit interdimensional credit fraud first.""

\[Acknowledged.\]

He rolled his eyes and leaned against the elevator wall. ""It's fine. I've got my Greed skills. I'll figure it out.""

The elevator dinged softly, lighting up as it reached the upper floor. The mirrored doors slid open with a gentle whoosh of processed air.

Mortal realm.

Capital District.

He stepped out onto polished tile in the towering lobby of one of the Big Six accounting firms—an unfortunate coincidence that the elevator from Hell connected to this building, but hey, hell recognized hell.

The lobby was sleek, cold, and entirely too white. Marble floors. Glass walls. Chrome trim everywhere. The kind of place where the coffee was always burned, and the workers were always slightly dead inside.

Right on cue, a dazed mortal in a wrinkled suit shuffled toward the elevator, bags under his eyes so dark they were practically voids.

Lux eyed him.

The guy looked seconds away from crying over his KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

As the man reached out to press the button, Lux stepped in front of him and casually blocked the path.

""Nope.""

The worker blinked slowly. ""Huh?""

""You don't want that elevator,"" Lux said, gesturing to it. ""It doesn't go up. It goes somewhere worse.""

The guy stared. ""But… I'm already on the ground floor.""

Lux patted his shoulder. ""Exactly.""

The doors whooshed shut behind him. The elevator began descending anyway, lights dimming as it plunged into the infernal depths it came from.

The guy blinked at the now-empty shaft.

""...That's not normal,"" he muttered.

""Neither is what's waiting on that next floor,"" Lux said. ""Just wait for the next elevator. Trust me.""

The man stood frozen.

""You're welcome,"" Lux added over his shoulder as he crossed the lobby, heading toward the automatic glass doors.

Outside, the mortal world greeted him like an excited toddler with a sugar high. Noise. Traffic. Horns. Billboard screens flashing stock tickers and influencer ads. The sharp scent of car exhaust and synthetic perfume. The dull buzz of capitalism grinding gears in every direction.

He smiled.

""I missed this stupid chaos.""

\[Sovereign Grand Hotel Detected – 600 meters East\]

\[Highlighting Best Coffee Shop Within Radius…\]

\[Name: Velvet Brew at Sovereign Grand, Lobby Level.\]

\[Rating: 4.9 Stars, 3 Verified Heiress Sightings This Week\]

Lux tilted his head.

""…Yeah. That'll do.""

He walked.

The street buzzed with life—workers rushing, horns honking, neon flickering. It was chaotic, alive, unfiltered. Way more fun than soul paperwork.

He was halfway through admiring a dog in a baby stroller when something caught his ear.

Music.

Live.

And not trashy mall music either—real music. Someone playing acoustic guitar with actual soul.

Lux turned toward the sound and followed it to the side of a closed corner shop—a dusty, abandoned lot with a cracked window and a cursed ""For Rent"" sign that had definitely been there for decades.

There, sitting on a milk crate, was a young man. Maybe mid-twenties. Worn hoodie, beat-up jeans. Guitar in hand. Fingers moving across the strings like he'd been born doing it.

His eyes were closed as he played, head tilted slightly back.

The music was… good. Surprisingly good. Clean chords. Natural rhythm. The kind of song that could make a crowd go quiet, if this city had time for that.

Lux slowed, gaze drifting to the open cup on the ground. A few crumpled bills sat inside.

He stepped closer.

Paused.

Then, without saying anything, he reached down and plucked one of the bills out.

""Hey—!"" the musician blinked, snapping out of his zone. ""What are you doing, man?!""

Lux raised a brow. ""Relax. I'm not stealing. I'm demonstrating.""

The musician narrowed his eyes. ""Demonstrating what?""

Lux held the bill between his fingers like a magician prepping for a card trick.

""This,"" he said.

And then he flicked his wrist.

Golden energy shimmered around the dollar bill.

\[Skill Activated: Money Multiply\]

\[$1 -> $100\]

The crumpled dollar burst into crisp 100$, clean and fresh, fluttering between Lux's fingers like confetti.

The musician's jaw dropped. ""What—how?!""

Lux smiled. ""I'm not done.""

He twirled the $100, then snapped again. Energy pulsed.

\[Skill Activated: Money Multiply\]

\[$100 -> $10,000\]

A stack of $100 bills appeared in his palm with a satisfying fwump.

The musician's eyes went huge. He lurched forward, hands out.

""Oh my god—can I—?!""

Lux casually sidestepped.

""Nope.""

He peeled off two $100 bills and handed them over.

""That's for the music. Buy a real dinner. Something with butter in it.""

The guy blinked, dumbfounded. ""Thanks. Seriously. I… I haven't eaten properly in three days.""

""I can tell. Your aura's dry.""

Lux slipped the rest of the money into his suit. The stack vanished in a glint of gold.

The musician still looked stunned. ""You just… made money?""

Lux shrugged. ""Magic, baby. Also demonic tax fraud, but mostly magic.""

The guy blinked again. ""I don't get it, but thanks. I mean it.""

Lux tilted his head slightly.

Lux glanced at the boarded-up shop behind them. Faint traces of curse sigils still clung to the edges of the bricks. The kind of place that had eaten twelve businesses in a row. He wrinkled his nose.

""You need to stop playing here,"" he said.

Miles looked confused. ""Huh?""

""This place reeks of bad luck. Like—generational curse, credit score dropping just by standing near it—bad.""

The musician frowned. ""It's rent-free sidewalk space.""

""Yeah, well,"" Lux sniffed. ""So is a haunted graveyard. Doesn't mean you should set up shop there.""

""…Why though?""

Lux tapped his temple, trying to get a make-sense explanation. ""Feng Shui,"" he shot.

""Feng Shui?""

""Yeah. But make it demonic. Just trust me.""

Miles looked over at the shop again, suddenly uncomfortable. ""Okay, now that you mention it, I have seen a raccoon cry in front of it once.""

""Exactly.""

Lux turned and began walking away. He paused, looked over his shoulder, and said, ""You should invest in digital music distribution. Maybe startup shares in indie labels. You've got decent Fortune resonance with those fields.""

Miles blinked. ""Wait—how do you even—""

Lux just winked.

And disappeared into the crowd.





...

Chapter 3 – I Just Wanted Coffee, Not a Chair-Leg Bride

Lux pushed open the glass doors of Sovereign Grand Hotel, letting the cold rush of luxury-grade air conditioning wash over him like divine intervention. 

Soft violin music hummed through hidden speakers. Polished marble floors gleamed beneath towering chandeliers. A smell of citrus polish, expensive perfume, and denial floated faintly in the air.

He stepped into the lobby like a man who definitely belonged there—even if his vibe currently screamed ""billionaire CFO who just survived tax season with mild trauma.""

\[Velvet Brew Located – Lobby Level, West Wing Corner\]

\[Specialty: Single-Origin Espresso.\]

The Velvet Brew café sat near the floor-to-ceiling windows, elegant and minimalistic, all pale wood and matte-black metal. Baristas wore matching dark green aprons with golden thread embroidery. There were exactly zero people in line, and yet the nearest server still frowned when she saw him approaching.

Her eyes narrowed at Lux's current appearance—slightly disheveled shirt, blazer open, faintly glowing red eyes, and the emotional aura of someone who just flipped off a multiverse accountant and meant it.

""Sir,"" she said carefully. ""Are you… lost?""

Lux blinked. ""What? No. I'm caffeinely deprived, not directionally challenged.""

She still looked skeptical.

""I'd like a triple-shot espresso. Single-origin. The one with the nutty finish. Costa Rican, maybe Ethiopian. No sugar, no syrup, just roast. And two butter croissants. Flaky. Don't microwave them or I'll flip this place inside out.""

The server hesitated, caught off guard by the sheer specificity.

""…That's actually our Velvet Noir,"" she said.

""Perfect,"" Lux said with a tired smile. ""Please. Before I become a public menace.""

He scanned the open lounge, then picked the best seat in the café—half-hidden, cozy corner with a perfect window view. Plush single sofa, polished oak table, dim lighting. He sat down, exhaled, and nearly melted into the cushions.

Peace.

Real peace.

For the first time in over a century, he wasn't reviewing soul bonds or filing infernal dividend reports.

He was in a coffee shop.

As a customer.

And no one was screaming at him. Yet.

He leaned back, eyes fluttering shut for just a second. A long, shuddering breath left his lungs.

""…I deserve this,"" Lux whispered.

He opened one eye, looked around at the glittering lobby and golden lighting.

""I deserve this,"" he whispered again, almost crying in happiness.

\[Warning: 2 Emotionally Unstable Rich Girls Detected Within 10 Meters.\]

\[Incubus Pheromones Activated.\]

Lux's peace shattered like a glass stock chart during a recession.

He cringed, hissing under his breath. ""I'm on vacation, dammit.""

\[Exactly. You act like a spawn of Greed all the time and forget you are an incubus too.\]

""Yeah, well maybe I like money more than people. People are complicated. Money doesn't ask you what your favorite color is after one night.""

\[Oh. C'mon.\]

Still, he couldn't argue.

He'd been in financial manager mode for… basically forever. He hadn't even remembered what flirting looked like unless it involved negotiating clauses.

Lux pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.

""Right… Now tell me where they are.""

A faint shimmer appeared in his vision—two subtle red outlines glowed near the back of the lounge. One of them, a tall woman in a too-tight sequined dress, was practically hanging on the arm of a wrinkled man who looked ninety and rich enough to own a small war. Yet, her gaze was on him.

Lux narrowed his eyes.

\[Net Worth: $12.3 Million\]

\[Fortune: 68%\]

\[Status: ""Gold Digger. Bad at Investing. Worse at Emotional Boundaries.""\]

\[Relationship: Actively Pretending To Love Her Fiancé for His Yacht Collection\]

Lux made a face like he'd just sipped cold soup.

""Absolutely not,"" he muttered. ""Skip. Nope. Hell no. I'm the son of Greed, not a damn coupon. I don't get used by serial yacht climbers.""

\[Fine. You're picky.\]

The second girl stood by herself, phone in hand, striking poses in the reflection of the café window. Long fake lashes. Glossed lips. Stiletto heels that defied gravity. She looked up, saw Lux, and gave him the kind of smile usually reserved for OnlySimps thumbnails.

\[Subject: Bella ""LethalBabe\_xoxo"" Valeria\]

\[Net Worth: $4.5 Million\]

\[Fortune: 72%\]

\[Status: ""High-End Call Girl. OnlySimps Platinum Tier. Looking for a sugar daddy.""\]

Lux choked on his spit. ""F—No.""

\[Eh? She's rich.\]

""Don't just look at their net worth! Look at their status!"" he hissed under his breath. ""I've got entire chambers of Hell full of people like this. I manage contracts for succubi who work more than her!""

\[Tsk. Snob.\]

The server arrived with his tray—coffee perfectly balanced, croissants golden and flaky. The rich, nutty scent of espresso hit Lux's senses like salvation.

""Here you go, sir,"" the server said.

Lux offered a genuine smile this time. ""Thank you. I might survive this timeline after all.""

He took a careful sip of his Velvet Noir. Bitterness bloomed on his tongue, followed by dark chocolate, roasted almond, and that perfect velvety texture that only came from beans roasted by mortals who overthink everything.

He closed his eyes, savoring it.

Yes.

Yes, this was good.

Finally….

\[Warning: A Troubled Heiress Detected Within 10 Meters.\]

\[Oh wait… 8 meters…\]

\[5 meters…\]

Lux opened one eye. ""What now—?""

Then he saw her.

She came in fast—heels clicking on marble, face pale, eyes scanning the café like she was expecting someone to jump out from behind a plant.

She wore a red silk dress that clung to her figure like it had a personal vendetta. Her platinum hair was twisted into an elegant updo that was now falling apart. Diamond earrings. Designer heels. Fancy as hell.

But she was clearly panicked.

Eyes wide. Breathing shallow. Chest rising and falling like she'd just run from an angry paparazzi swarm.

Then her eyes locked on Lux.

And without missing a beat, she marched across the table.

Lux, mid-sip, didn't even have time to process.

She got to his table, yanked back the edge of the tablecloth, ducked down beneath the table—and vanished under the linen.

""Shhh!"" came her voice from below. ""If anyone asks, I'm a chair leg.""

Lux blinked.

Stared at his coffee.

Then slowly leaned down.

A pair of wide purple eyes stared up at him.

She was curled up, tucked neatly under the table between the wooden legs, the hem of her dress pooling around her like Cinderella had anxiety.

Lux raised a brow. ""You okay down there, 'Chair Leg'?""

""Please don't give me away,"" she whispered, eyes frantic. ""I swear I'll pay you.""

""…Is it a crime situation? Should I be concerned?""

She shook her head quickly. ""No—well—kinda—but it's more of a marriage crime. I may or may not be a runaway bride.""

""…Seriously?""

She nodded.

""And you picked my table?""

""You looked like you wouldn't snitch.""

Lux blinked. ""Is it because I look emotionally unstable?""

""Yes.""

""…Fair.""

Then exhaled slowly.

""Well. There goes my peaceful vacation.""

Chapter 4 – How to Ruin a Billionaire Without Lifting a Finger

The coffee in his hand still smelled amazing—nutty, deep, rich, everything a soul-scorched demon child needed to feel whole again.

Under the table, Naomi—aka Chair Leg—was curled up tighter than a tax fraud case on Judgment Day. Her breathing was quiet, but every now and then, he felt a tiny tremble through the polished floorboards. Girl was stressed. High-end perfume clung to the air near her, floral and citrusy, with an undercurrent of oh-gods-what-if-they-find-me panic.

Lux sighed and took a slow, almost meditative sip of his coffee.

Then the glass doors of the Sovereign Grand lobby opened again.

\-Click. Click. Click.

Footsteps. Multiple. Sharp. Precise. Like investment bankers who moonlighted as bounty hunters. A whole squad of them walked in—five men and two women, all dressed in charcoal-gray suits tailored to hellish perfection. Each one had that air of practiced corporate menace. They look like they'd ruined a hundred startups before breakfast and didn't flinch at legal grey zones.

And leading them?

A man.

Mid-thirties. Slicked-back ash-blond hair, jaw so sharp it probably signed contracts in blood. Designer shoes that never touched public sidewalks. His cufflinks gleamed like they were forged from generational wealth and tax evasion.

Lux sipped his coffee, not even blinking.

\[Scanning...\]

\[Threat Level: Mild. Smells like cheap cologne and trust funds.\]

Lux's upper lip twitched. ""Eurgh.""

He stared into his cup. ""That's a Fortune built on daddy's lawyers and offshore accounts. Not even worth stealing the branding from.""

The suited group split up like sharks circling caviar. Carson scanned the room with narrowed eyes, jaw tight with expensive impatience. His nose wrinkled at the Velvet Brew's cozy, warm ambiance like he could smell the freedom and common sense.

Lux didn't move.

Didn't flinch.

Didn't even breathe wrong.

He just kept sipping his coffee.

Carson's gaze eventually landed on him.

Lux could see it. That exact moment when Carson's overfed gut instinct started screaming, ""That guy's suspicious.""

Lux didn't even blink. Just casually leaned back in his seat, letting the aroma of espresso waft dramatically into the air like he was filming a sensual coffee commercial.

And Carson walked over.

Of course he did.

He stopped just short of the table, looking down at Lux like he expected everyone to recognize him from some Forbbes list.

""You.""

Lux sipped.

""Me,"" he said smoothly.

""I'm looking for someone.""

Lux made a face. ""That's tragic. Have you tried therapy?""

Carson's nostrils flared. ""A woman. She ran in here a few minutes ago. Platinum hair. Red dress. Expensive heels. Seen her?""

Lux blinked slowly. Thoughtfully. Then turned his head and pointed at a random girl near the counter—a server in a red uniform skirt wiping down a tray.

""She's platinum and wearing red,"" Lux offered casually.

Carson scowled. ""That's not her.""

Lux raised a brow. ""You didn't say which platinum in red. You gotta narrow it down. It's like asking if I've seen a guy in a suit. You're literally dressed like every nightmare I've had in court.""

Carson stepped closer. ""Don't play dumb with me.""

""I'm not playing. This is just who I am.""

The tension snapped. Carson reached forward and grabbed Lux by the collar— and yanked.

Lux's cup jerked with the motion. Coffee sloshed.

A dark streak of heaven's nectar spilled down Lux's shirt.

The café went dead silent.

Somewhere under the table, Naomi let out a horrified breath.

Lux looked down.

Coffee.

Wasted.

On.

His.

Shirt.

He slowly looked up, eyes gleaming faintly red. His voice, when he spoke, was the sound of an impending audit.

""…You just ruined my coffee.""

Carson sneered. ""You'll survive.""

Lux tilted his head. ""You know what's crazy? That's exactly what I said before tax season.""

He reached up.

Brushed Carson's hand off like it was a rejected split bill request.

""Let go,"" Lux said.

Carson didn't.

So Lux smiled. A slow, dangerous kind of smile.

The kind of smile that should've had its own disclaimer.

\[Skill activated: Wealth Rewrite – Drain\]

Lux raised two fingers and tapped Carson's chest—right over his designer tie pin.

It shimmered.

Carson flinched. ""What the—""

Golden runes bloomed across his clothes like ink spreading through silk. They danced, twisted, and dissolved into flickering data streams only Lux could see.

\[Net Worth of Target Now: $327.81\]

Lux stepped back. His shirt was still stained. But he looked radiant.

Carson blinked. Wobbled. His phone buzzed in his pocket, then again. And again. And again.

He pulled it out. Screen full of app notifications. Warnings. Error codes. Emails. Bank security alerts.

""No… No no no—""

Lux adjusted his collar. ""Oh no, what happened?""

Carson's eyes went wide. His phone buzzed violently in his pocket. Then again. And again. The screen lit up with notifications—emails, app crashes, security pings, banking errors.

He yanked it out and stared.

The color drained from his face. ""No… no no no no no—"" His voice cracked. ""This has to be a glitch. This has to be a joke.""

One of his suited entourage looked at their own phone, then back at him with the kind of expression reserved for doomsday countdowns.

""Sir,"" the assistant said, voice thin. ""Your portfolio… it's—um. It's gone. All of it.""

Carson spun to face him. ""Gone?! What do you mean gone?! I had—""

His words choked off as more alerts poured in, screen going red. Emergency lockdowns. Breach protocols. Frozen assets.

He staggered back a step.

Another assistant stared, pale. ""Sir, your accounts are all reporting asset liquidation. Simultaneously.""

Carson's expression collapsed like the stock market in a divine recession.

He looked around wildly, hands twitching like he expected to grab money from the air.

""No, no! This isn't happening! I—I was just at a board meeting this morning! I had—! Check again!""

One of the team hesitated. ""Sir, the lawyers just pulled out. Your pre-nup clauses are invalid now. Delacour Holdings won't—""

""I haven't even married her yet!"" Carson shrieked.

Behind his coffee cup, Lux blinked innocently. ""Huh. That sounds… really unfortunate.""

Carson's frantic gaze landed on Lux. Just for a second. Suspicious. Wild. But Lux was the picture of calm. Slightly disheveled, sure—but stained shirt, coffee, and expression of 'man, I'm just vibing' were convincing enough.

Lux tilted his head like he had no idea what was happening. ""You okay, buddy? You look like someone just cancelled your yacht subscription.""

Carson opened his mouth, but nothing came out. His assistants had already begun whispering amongst themselves—some slowly backing toward the exit, others typing on their phones like they were trying to legally un-exist.

He ran a hand through his hair, trembling.

Then turned.

And bolted out of the café like Hell itself had declared bankruptcy and named him personally responsible.

The rest of his entourage followed in awkward silence—some tripping, some muttering, all pretending not to know him.

The moment the doors closed behind them, the air shifted.

The café music resumed. The scent of croissants once again reclaimed the room. Someone in the corner even clapped slowly, unsure why, but convinced they'd witnessed something divine.

Lux sat and leaned down. ""You can come out now, Chair Leg.""





...

Chapter 5 – Just a Vacation... Until She Hid Between My Legs

She peeked up, blinking fast. But rather than from the side like a civilized person, Naomi popped her head up right between Lux's legs.

Lux didn't even flinch.

Her eye makeup was still immaculate—liner sharp enough to slice a bad deal—but she looked like someone who'd just watched a stockbroker implode from sheer karma.

And she had.

Naomi looked around, cautiously scanning the room like a hunted deer in heels. ""He's gone yet…?""

Lux deadpanned, lifting his half-spilled coffee with one hand and gesturing vaguely with the other. ""You do realize you're currently kneeling between my legs in a public café, right?""

She froze. Her face turned a slow, beautiful shade of pink. ""I… I was hiding! I panicked! If he saw me—he would've dragged me out of here. Carson doesn't lose. If he's still here…""

Lux let out a tired sigh through his nose. Something clicked inside him.

Not empathy.

More like… lobbying mode.

The same switch that flipped when he used to seduce ancient banking spirits to drop interest rates or charm warlords into signing neutrality treaties.

And unfortunately…

\[System Alert: Incubus Pheromones – ACTIVE\]

\[Target: Naomi Delacour – Compatibility: 92%\]

Lux blinked.

'Right… forgot about that.'

The Pheromones. Damn passive skills.

Still clutching his lukewarm coffee, he leaned down, ran two fingers slowly along the side of Naomi's jaw—so light it was more suggestion than touch.

Her breath caught.

Then he hooked his fingers gently under her chin and lifted her face to meet his. Their eyes locked.

""No one's taking you from me,"" Lux murmured, voice low and rich like dark honey.

Naomi froze. Eyes wide. Cheeks flushing deeper.

And then—

\[Her Heart Rate Increased + Incubus Pheromones Intensified\]

He straightened quickly and coughed into his coffee.

""Ahem—anyway. Unless you plan on giving me a public blow job,"" he muttered, casual as he please, ""you might want to sit like a normal person before people think I'm running a luxury brothel out of a coffee shop.""

Naomi turned red so fast it might've been a world record.

She scrambled to her feet like a startled cat and yanked her dress down, muttering something that sounded like ""I hate how good you smell.""

She cleared her throat and tried to recompose herself as she sank into the seat across from him.

""So…"" she asked, eyes still a little wild, ""what's your name?""

Lux sipped what was left of his ruined drink. ""Lux.""

""Just Lux?""

He shrugged. ""Lux Vaelthorn. CFO. On vacation. Technically.""

Naomi blinked. ""Of what?""

""Nothing that exists in this world's tax code,"" he said. ""Let's leave it at that.""

Naomi gave a nervous little laugh and offered her hand. ""Naomi Delacour.""

Lux gave her fingers a gentlemanly shake. ""Nice to meet you, Naomi.""

She exhaled hard. ""I should probably thank you. You saved me back there. I… I'll pay you back, somehow.""

Lux raised an eyebrow. ""With what?""

Naomi opened her mouth—

Paused.

And went pale.

Her hands patted over her dress, checking sides, hem, neckline, even inside a little flap at the back. Her expression crumpled.

""…Oh my god,"" she whispered. No purse. No ID. Not even her phone. Not a single coin, card, or scrap of independence left on her.

Lux leaned back with a huff and waved the nearest server away with a finger. ""Sit down. Eat with me. This one's on me.""

Naomi looked hesitant. ""Are you sure?""

""You're a mess.""

Then he pointed to his own coffee-stained chest.

""Though to be fair, I'm also a mess. Just a hotter one.""

Naomi gave a tiny snort-laugh despite herself.

""So,"" she asked, eyeing the croissants cautiously, ""what happened to you? You look like a billionaire who got mugged by his accountant.""

""Tired,"" Lux said, tearing a piece of croissant with surgical precision. ""Just tired. Burned out. That's why I took this vacation. To remember what sleep and caffeine feel like. And then you happened.""

Naomi winced. ""Sorry.""

Lux shrugged. ""Eh. At least you're interesting.""

The meal was… oddly peaceful. She actually ate. Butter clung to the corner of her mouth, but she didn't care. Lux watched, sipping his second espresso, feeling… lighter. Not happy. But lighter.

The system pinged again.

\[Affinity Level Increased\]

\[Incubus Pheromones: Stabilized (For Now)\]

Once they finished, Lux casually reached into his inner coat pocket and pulled out a stack of perfectly crisp bills. Not even tucked inside a wallet—just pure physical cash like a mob boss with a luxury hygiene addiction.

Naomi blinked. ""Wait—you don't have a card?""

""I forgot it,"" Lux replied flatly. ""In Hell.""

She choked. ""H-Hell?""

He smirked, mouth curling. ""Yeah, my office.""

And then, at her expression, added, ""You wouldn't like it.""

Naomi blinked like he just told her his dentist was Cthulhu. ""So… you only carry cash?""

""It's safer,"" Lux said, completely serious. ""You do want to pay me back, right?""

Naomi hesitated. ""Y-yeah.""

He stood, casually brushing crumbs from his lap. ""Then come with me.""

Lux didn't wait. He turned and strolled straight to the hotel reception like he owned the damn place. Which, in another timeline, he probably did.

Naomi scurried to follow, heels clicking rapidly on marble.

The receptionist—a young man with flawless posture and professionally dead eyes—blinked as Lux approached.

""Welcome to the Sovereign Grand. Do you have a reservation, sir?""

Lux smiled faintly. ""No. I'd like a presidential suite. One week.""

The receptionist blinked. ""Of course, sir. May I see your credit card?""

Lux opened his suit. Revealed nothing. Sighed. ""Cash okay?""

The receptionist hesitated. ""Only if you can cover the deposit.""

Lux exhaled. Then flicked his hand.

Golden light shimmered between his fingers.

\[Skill Activated: Money Multiply\]

\[$100 -> $1,000\]

\[Skill Activated: Money Multiply\]

\[$1,000 -> $10,000\]

\[Skill Activated: Money Multiply\]

\[$10,000 -> $100,000\]

A stack of hundreds landed softly on the desk with a satisfying thump.

Naomi blinked. The receptionist froze.

The other staff subtly adjusted their posture. One even gasped.

""Will that do?"" Lux asked, utterly deadpan.

""Y-yes, sir! Absolutely!"" The receptionist practically bowed. ""Your suite key. Right away.""

Lux took the polished obsidian keycard and turned to Naomi, casually flicking his hair back.

""Well? What are you waiting for?"" he said, already walking. ""C'mon.""

Naomi didn't move. ""Wait. Are you… Are you inviting me to your room?""

Lux stopped. Looked back.

Then sighed, long and slow.

""Do you think I have time to seduce you right now?"" he said. ""I just nuked a billionaire and lost a good cup of coffee. I want a shower, air conditioning, and twenty minutes of lying in a bed that doesn't scream in infernal tongues. That's it.""

Naomi hesitated. Bit her lip. Looked at the suite key.

""…Okay.""

She followed.

The receptionist stared after them, still stunned.

Back in the elevator, Naomi leaned against the mirrored wall, still flushed but calmer now.

""You're not what I expected.""

Lux glanced sideways at her. ""That's what my tax demon said before he cried and retired.""

She giggled again.

And Lux, for just a moment, smiled.

Yeah. Maybe this vacation wasn't so bad after all.",1,1752333695.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1ly30f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ly30f2/the_golden_lily_by_richelle_mead/,The Golden Lily by Richelle Mead:,"  MOST PEOPLE WOULD FIND being led into an underground bunker on a stormy night scary. Not me.  
  
  Things I could explain away and define with data didn't frighten me. That was why I kept silently reciting facts to myself as I descended deeper and deeper below street level. The bunker was a relic of the Cold War, built as protection in a time when people thought nuclear missiles were around every corner. On the surface, the building claimed to house an optical supply store. That was a front. Not scary at all. And the storm? Simply a natural phenomenon of atmospheric fronts clashing. And really, if you were going to worry about getting hurt in a storm, then going underground was actually pretty smart.  
  
  So, no. This seemingly ominous journey didn't frighten me in the least. Everything was built on reasonable facts and logic. I could deal with that. It was the rest of my job I had a problem with.  
  
  And really, maybe that was why stormy underground trips didn't faze me. When you spent most of your days living among vampires and half vampires, ferrying them to get blood, and keeping their existence secret from the rest of the world. . . well, it kind of gave you a unique perspective on life. I'd witnessed bloody vampire battles and seen magical feats that defied every law of physics I knew. My life was a constant struggle to hold back my terror of the unexplainable and try desperately to find a way to explain it.  
  
  ""Watch your step,"" my guide told me as we went down yet another flight of concrete stairs.  
  
  Everything I'd seen so far was concrete - the walls, floor, and ceiling. The gray, rough surface absorbed the fluorescent light that attempted to illuminate our way. It was dreary and cold, eerie in its stillness. The guide seemed to guess my thoughts. ""We've made modifications and expansions since this was originally built. You'll see once we reach the main section. "" Sure enough. The stairs finally opened up to a corridor with several closed doors lining the sides. The decor was still concrete, but all the doors were modern, with electronic locks displaying either red or green lights. He led me to the second door on the right, one with a green light, and I found myself entering a perfectly normal lounge, like the kind of break room you'd find in any modern office. Green carpet covered the floor, like some wistful attempt at grass, and the walls were a tan that gave the illusion of warmth. A puffy couch and two chairs sat on the opposite side of the room, along with a table scattered with magazines. Best of all, the room had a counter with a sink - and a coffee maker.  
  
  ""Make yourself at home,"" my guide told me. I was guessing he was close to my age, eighteen, but his patchy attempts at growing a beard made him seem younger. ""They'll come for you shortly. ""  
  
  My eyes had never left the coffee maker. ""Can I make some coffee?""  
  
  ""Sure,"" he said. ""Whatever you like. ""  
  
  He left, and I practically ran to the counter. The coffee was pre-ground and looked as though it might very well have been here since the Cold War as well. As long as it was caffeinated, I didn't care. I'd taken a red-eye flight from California, and even with part of the day to recover, I still felt sleepy and bleary-eyed. I set the coffee maker going and then paced the room. The magazines were in haphazard piles, so I straightened them into neat stacks. I couldn't stand disorder.  
  
  I sat on the couch and waited for the coffee, wondering yet again what this meeting could be about. I'd spent a good part of my afternoon here in Virginia reporting to a couple of Alchemist officials about the status of my current assignment. I was living in Palm Springs, pretending to be a senior at a private boarding school in order to keep an eye on Jill Mastrano Dragomir, a vampire princess forced into hiding. Keeping her alive meant keeping her people out of civil war - something that would definitely tip humans off to the supernatural world that lurked beneath the surface of modern life. It was a vital mission for the Alchemists, so I wasn't entirely surprised they'd want an update. What surprised me was that they couldn't have just done it over the phone. I couldn't figure out what other reason would bring me to this facility.  
  
  The coffee maker finished. I'd only set it to make three cups, which would probably be enough to get me through the evening. I'd just filled my Styrofoam cup when the door opened.  
  
  A man entered, and I nearly dropped the coffee.  
  
  ""Mr. Darnell,"" I said, setting the pot back on the burner. My hands trembled. ""It - it's nice to see you again, sir. ""  
  
  ""You too, Sydney,"" he said, forcing a stiff smile. ""You've certainly grown up. ""  
  
  ""Thank you, sir,"" I said, unsure if that was a compliment.  
  
  Tom Darnell was my father's age and had brown hair laced with silver. There were more lines in his face since the last time I'd seen him, and his blue eyes had an uneasy look that I didn't usually associate with him. Tom Darnell was a high-ranking official among the Alchemists and had earned his position through decisive action and a fierce work ethic. He'd always seemed larger than life when I was younger, fiercely confident and aweinspiring. Now, he seemed to be afraid of me, which made no sense. Wasn't he angry? After all, I was the one responsible for his son being arrested and locked away by the Alchemists.  
  
  ""I appreciate you coming all the way out here,"" he added, once a few moments of awkward silence had passed. ""I know it's a long round-trip, especially on a weekend. ""  
  
  ""It's no problem at all, sir,"" I said, hoping I sounded confident. ""I'm happy to help with. . .  
  
  whatever you need. "" I still wondered what exactly that could be.  
  
  He studied me for a few seconds and gave a curt nod. ""You're very dedicated,"" he said.  
  
  ""Just like your father. ""  
  
  I made no response. I knew that comment had been intended as a compliment, but I didn't really take it that way.  
  
  Tom cleared his throat. ""Well, then. Let's get this out of the way. I really don't want to inconvenience you any more than is necessary. ""  
  
  Again, I got that nervous, deferential vibe. Why would he be so conscientious of my feelings?  
  
  After what I'd done to his son, Keith, I would've expected rage or accusations. Tom opened the door for me and gestured me through.  
  
  ""Can I bring my coffee, sir?""  
  
  ""Of course. ""  
  
  He took me back into the concrete corridor, toward more of the closed doors. I clutched my coffee like a security blanket, far more frightened than I'd been when first entering this place. Tom came to a stop a few doors down, in front of one with a red light, but hesitated before opening it.  
  
  ""I want you to know. . . that what you did was incredibly brave,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""I know you and Keith were - are - friends, and it couldn't have been easy to turn him in. It shows just how committed you are to our work - something that's not always easy when personal feelings are involved. ""  
  
  Keith and I weren't friends now or then, but I supposed I could understand Tom's mistake.  
  
  Keith had lived with my family for a summer, and later, he and I had worked together in Palm Springs. Turning him in for his crimes hadn't been difficult for me at all. I'd actually enjoyed it.  
  
  Seeing the stricken look on Tom's face, though, I knew I couldn't say anything like that.  
  
  I swallowed. ""Well. Our work is important, sir. ""  
  
  He gave me a sad smile. ""Yes. It certainly is. ""  
  
  The door had a security keypad. Tom punched in a series of about ten digits, and the lock clicked in acceptance. He pushed the door open, and I followed him inside. The stark room was dimly lit and had three other people in it, so I didn't initially notice what else the room contained.  
  
  I knew immediately that the others were Alchemists. There was no other reason they'd be in this place otherwise. And, of course, they possessed the telltale signs that would have identified them to me even on a busy street. Business attire in nondescript colors. Golden lily tattoos  
shining on their left cheeks. It was part of the uniformity we all shared. We were a secret army, lurking in the shadows of our fellow humans.  
  
  The three of them were all holding clipboards and staring at one of the walls. That was when I noticed what this room's purpose was. A window in the wall looked through to another room, one much more brightly lit than this one.  
  
  And Keith Darnell was in that room.  
  
  He darted up to the glass separating us and began beating on it. My heart raced, and I took a few frightened steps back, certain he was coming after me. It took me a moment to realize he couldn't actually see me. I relaxed slightly. Very slightly. The window was a oneway mirror. He pressed his hands to the glass, glancing frantically back and forth at the faces he knew were there but couldn't see.  
  
  ""Please, please,"" he cried. ""Let me out. Please let me out of here. "" Keith looked a little scragglier than the last time I'd seen him. His hair was unkempt and appeared as though it hadn't been cut in our month apart. He wore a plain gray jumpsuit, the kind you saw on prisoners or mental patients, that reminded me of the concrete in the hall.  
  
  Most noticeable of all was the desperate, terrified look in his eyes - or rather, eye. Keith had lost one of his eyes in a vampire attack that I had secretly helped orchestrate. None of the Alchemists knew about it, just as none of them knew about how Keith had raped my older sister Carly. I doubted Tom Darnell would've praised me for my ""dedication"" if he'd known about my sideline revenge act. Seeing the state Keith was in now, I felt a little bad for him - and especially bad for Tom, whose face was filled with raw pain. I still didn't feel bad about what I'd done to Keith, however. Not the arrest or the eye. Put simply, Keith Darnell was a bad person.  
  
  ""I'm sure you recognize Keith,"" said one of the Alchemists with a clipboard. Her gray hair was wound into a tight, neat bun.  
  
  ""Yes, ma'am,"" I said.  
  
  I was saved from any other response when Keith beat at the glass with renewed fury.  
  
  ""Please! I'm serious! Whatever you want. I'll do anything. I'll say anything. I'll believe anything.  
  
  Just please don't send me back there!""  
  
  Both Tom and I flinched, but the other Alchemists watched with clinical detachment and scrawled a few notes on their clipboards. The bun woman glanced back up at me as though there'd been no interruption. ""Young Mr. Darnell has been spending some time in one of our Re-education Centers. An unfortunate action - but a necessary one. His trafficking in illicit goods was certainly bad, but his collaboration with vampires is unforgiveable. Although he claims to have no attachment to them. . . well, we really can't be certain. Even if he is telling the truth, there's also the possibility that this transgression might expand into something more - not just a collaboration with the Moroi, but also the Strigoi. Doing what we've done keeps him from that slippery slope. ""  
  
  ""It's really for his own good,"" said the third clipboard-wielding Alchemist. ""We're doing him a favor. ""  
  
  A sense of horror swept over me. The whole point of the Alchemists was to keep the existence of vampires secret from humans. We believed vampires were unnatural creatures who should have nothing to do with humans like us. What was a particular concern were the Strigoi - evil, killer vampires - who could lure humans into servitude with promises of immortality.  
  
  Even the peaceful Moroi and their half human counterparts, the dhampirs, were regarded with suspicion. We worked with those latter two groups a lot, and even though we'd been taught to regard them with disdain, it was an inevitable fact that some Alchemists not only grew close to Moroi and dhampirs. . . but actually started to like them.  
  
  The crazy thing was - despite his crime of selling vampire blood - Keith was one of the last people I'd think of when it came to getting too friendly with vampires. He'd made his dislike of them perfectly obvious to me a number of times. Really, if anyone deserved to be accused of attachment to vampires. . .  
  
  . . . well, it would be me.  
  
  One of the other Alchemists, a man with mirrored sunglasses hanging artfully off his collar, took up the lecture. ""You, Miss Sage, have been a remarkable example of someone able to work extensively with them and keep your objectivity. Your dedication has not gone unnoticed by those above us. ""  
  
  ""Thank you, sir,"" I said uneasily, wondering how many times I'd hear ""dedication"" brought up tonight. This was a far cry from a few months ago, when I'd gotten in trouble for helping a dhampir fugitive escape. She'd later been proven innocent, and my involvement had been written off as ""career ambition. ""  
  
  ""And,"" continued Sunglasses, ""considering your experience with Mr. Darnell, we thought you would be an excellent person to give us a statement. "" I turned my attention back at Keith. He'd been pounding and shouting pretty much nonstop this whole time. The others had managed to ignore him, so I tried as well.  
  
  ""A statement on what, sir?""  
  
  ""We're considering whether or not to return him to Re-education,"" explained Gray Bun.  
  
  ""He's made excellent progress there, but some feel it's best to be safe and make sure any chance of vampire attachment is eradicated. ""  
  
  If Keith's current behavior was ""excellent progress,"" I couldn't imagine what poor progress looked like.  
  
  Sunglasses readied his pen over his clipboard. ""Based on what you witnessed in Palm Springs, Miss Sage, what is your opinion of Mr. Darnell's state of mind when it comes to vampires?  
  
  Was the bonding you witnessed severe enough to warrant further precautionary measures?"" Presumably, ""further precautionary measures"" meant more Re-education.  
  
  While Keith continued to bang away, all eyes in my room were on me. The clipboard Alchemists looked thoughtful and curious. Tom Darnell was visibly sweating, watching me with fear and anticipation. I supposed it was understandable. I held his son's fate in my hands.  
  
  Conflicting emotions warred within me as I regarded Keith. I didn't just dislike him - I hated him. And I didn't hate many people. I couldn't forget what he'd done to Carly. Likewise, the memories of what he'd done to others and me in Palm Springs were still fresh in my mind.  
  
  He'd slandered me and made my life miserable in an effort to cover up his blood scam. He'd also horribly treated the vampires and dhampirs we were in charge of looking after. It made me question who the real monsters were.  
  
  I didn't know exactly what happened at Re-education Centers. Judging from Keith's reaction, it was probably pretty bad. There was a part of me that would have loved to tell the Alchemists to send him back there for years and never let him see the light of day. His crimes deserved severe punishment - and yet, I wasn't sure they deserved this particular punishment.  
  
  ""I think. . . I think Keith Darnell is corrupt,"" I said at last. ""He's selfish and immoral. He has no concern for others and hurts people to further his own ends. He's willing to lie, cheat, and steal to get what he wants. "" I hesitated before continuing. ""But. . . I don't think he's been blinded to what vampires are. I don't think he's too close to them or in danger of falling in with them in the future. That being said, I also don't think he should be allowed to do Alchemist work for the foreseeable future. Whether that would mean locking him up or just putting him on probation is up to you. His past actions show he doesn't take our missions seriously, but that's because of selfishness. Not because of an unnatural attachment to them. He. . . well, to be blunt, is just a bad person. ""  
  
  Silence met me, save for the frantic scrawling of pens as the clipboard Alchemists made their notes. I dared a glance at Tom, afraid of what I'd see after completely trashing his son.  
  
  To my astonishment, Tom looked. . . relieved. And grateful. In fact, he seemed on the verge of tears. Catching my eye, he mouthed, Thank you. Amazing. I had just proclaimed Keith to be a horrible human being in every way possible. But none of that mattered to his father, so long as I didn't accuse Keith of being in league with vampires. I could've called Keith a murderer, and Tom would have probably still been grateful if it meant Keith wasn't chummy with the enemy.  
  
  It bothered me and a  
gain made me wonder who the real monsters were in all of this. The group I'd left back in Palm Springs was a hundred times more moral than Keith.  
  
  ""Thank you, Miss Sage,"" said Gray Bun, finishing up her notes. ""You've been extremely helpful, and we'll take this into consideration as we make our decision. You may go now. If you step into the hall, you'll find Zeke waiting to take you out. "" It was an abrupt dismissal, but that was typical of Alchemists. Efficient. To the point. I gave a polite nod of farewell and one last glance at Keith before opening the door. As soon as it shut behind me, I found the hallway mercifully silent. I could no longer hear Keith.  
  
  Zeke, as it turned out, was the Alchemist who had originally led me in. ""All set?"" he asked.  
  
  ""So it seems,"" I said, still a bit stunned over what had just taken place. I knew now that my earlier debriefing on the Palm Springs situation had simply been a convenience for the Alchemists.  
  
  I'd been in the area, so why not have an in-person meeting? It hadn't been essential.  
  
  This - seeing Keith - had been the real purpose of my cross-country trip.  
  
  As we walked back down the hallway, something caught my attention that I hadn't noticed before. One of the doors had a fair amount of security on it - more so than the room I'd just been in. Along with the lights and keypad, there was also a card reader. At the top of the door was a deadbolt that locked from outside. Nothing fancy, but it was clearly meant to keep whatever was behind the door inside.  
  
  I stopped in spite of myself and studied the door for a few moments. Then, I kept walking, knowing better than to say anything. Good Alchemists didn't ask questions.  
  
  Zeke, seeing my gaze, came to a halt. He glanced at me, then the door, and then back at me. ""Do you want. . . do you want to see what's in there?"" His eyes darted quickly to the door we'd emerged from. He was low-ranking, I knew, and clearly feared getting in trouble with the others. At the same time, there was an eagerness that suggested he was excited about the secrets he kept, secrets he couldn't share with others. I was a safe outlet.  
  
  ""I guess it depends on what's in there,"" I said.  
  
  ""It's the reason for what we do,"" he said mysteriously. ""Take a look, and you'll understand why our goals are so important. ""  
  
  Deciding to risk it, he flashed a card over the reader and then punched in another long code. A light on the door turned green, and he slid open the deadbolt. I'd half-expected another dim room, but the light was so bright inside, it almost hurt my eyes. I put a hand up to my forehead to shield myself.  
  
  ""It's a type of light therapy,"" Zeke explained apologetically. ""You know how people in cloudy regions have sun lamps? Same kind of rays. The hope is that it'll make people like him a little more human again - or at least discourage them from thinking they're Strigoi. "" At first, I was too dazzled to figure out what he meant. Then, across the empty room, I saw a jail cell. Large metal bars covered the entrance, which was locked with another card reader and keypad. It seemed like overkill when I caught sight of the man inside. He was older than me, mid-twenties if I had to guess, and had a disheveled appearance that made Keith look neat and tidy. The man was gaunt and curled up in a corner, arms draped over his eyes against the light. He wore handcuffs and feet cuffs and clearly wasn't going anywhere. At our entrance, he dared a peek at us and then uncovered more of his face.  
  
  A chill ran through me. The man was human, but his expression was as cold and evil as any Strigoi I'd ever seen. His gray eyes were predatory. Emotionless, like the kinds of murderers who had no sense of empathy for other people.  
  
  ""Have you brought me dinner?"" he asked in a raspy voice that had to be faked. ""A nice young girl, I see. Skinnier than I'd like, but I'm sure her blood is still succulent. ""  
  
  ""Liam,"" said Zeke with a weary patience. ""You know where your dinner is. "" He pointed to an untouched tray of food in the cell that looked like it had gone cold long ago. Chicken nuggets, green beans, and a sugar cookie. ""He almost never eats anything,"" Zeke explained to me. ""It's why he's so thin. Keeps insisting on blood. ""  
  
  ""What. . . what is he?"" I asked, unable to take my eyes off of Liam. It was a silly question, of course. Liam was clearly human, and yet. . . there was something about him that wasn't right.  
  
  ""A corrupt soul who wants to be Strigoi,"" said Zeke. ""Some guardians found him serving those monsters and delivered him to us. We've tried to rehabilitate him but with no luck. He keeps going on and on about how great the Strigoi are and how he'll get back to them one day and make us pay. In the meantime, he does his best to pretend he's one of them. ""  
  
  ""Oh,"" said Liam, with a sly smile, ""I will be one of them. They will reward my loyalty and suffering. They will awaken me, and I will become powerful beyond your miniscule mortal dreams. I will live forever and come for you - all of you. I will feast on your blood and savor every drop. You Alchemists pull your strings and think you control everything. You delude yourselves. You control nothing. You are nothing. ""  
  
  ""See?"" said Zeke, shaking his head. ""Pathetic. And yet, this is what could happen if we didn't do the job we did. Other humans could become like him - selling their souls for the hollow promise of immortality. "" He made the Alchemist sign against evil, a small cross on his shoulder, and I found myself echoing it. ""I don't like being in here, but sometimes. . . sometimes it's a good reminder of why we have to keep the Moroi and the others in the shadows.  
  
  Of why we can't let ourselves be taken in by them. ""  
  
  I knew in the back of my mind that there was a huge difference in the way Moroi and Strigoi interacted with humans. Still, I couldn't formulate any arguments while in front of Liam.  
  
  He had me too dumbstruck - and afraid. It was easy to believe every word the Alchemists said. This was what we were fighting against. This was the nightmare we couldn't allow to happen.  
  
  I didn't know what to say, but Zeke didn't seem to expect much.  
  
  ""Come on. Let's go. "" To Liam, he added, ""And you'd better eat that food because you aren't getting any more until morning. I don't care how cold and hard it is. "" Liam's eyes narrowed. ""What do I care about human food when soon I'll be drinking the nectar of the gods? Your blood will be warm on my lips, yours and your pretty girl's. "" He began to laugh then, a sound far more disturbing than any of Keith's screams.  
  
  That laughter continued as Zeke led me out of the room. The door shut behind us, and I found myself standing in the hall, numbed. Zeke regarded me with concern.  
  
  ""I'm sorry. . . I probably shouldn't have shown you that. "" I shook my head slowly. ""No. . . you were right. It's good for us to see. To understand what we're doing. I always knew. . . but I didn't expect anything like that. "" I tried to shift my thoughts back to everyday things and wipe that horror from my mind. I looked down at my coffee. It was untouched and had grown lukewarm. I grimaced.  
  
  ""Can I get more coffee before we go?"" I needed something normal. Something human.  
  
  ""Sure. ""  
  
  Zeke led me back to the lounge. The pot I'd made was still hot. I dumped out my old coffee and poured some new. As I did, the door burst open, and a distraught Tom Darnell came in. He seemed surprised to see anyone here and pushed past us, sitting on the couch and burying his face in his hands. Zeke and I exchanged uncertain looks.  
  
  ""Mr. Darnell,"" I began. ""Are you okay?""  
  
  He didn't answer me right away. He kept his face covered, his body shaking with silent sobs. I was about to leave when he looked up at me, though I got the feeling he wasn't actually seeing me. ""They decided,"" he said. ""They decided about Keith. ""  
  
  ""Already?"" I asked, startled. Zeke and I had only spent about five minutes with Liam.  
  
  Tom nodded morosely. ""They're sending him back. . . back to Re-education. "" I couldn't believe it. ""But I. . . but I told them! I told them he's not in league with vampires.  
  
  He believes what. . . the rest of us believe. It was his choices that were bad. ""  
  
  ""I know. But they said we can't take the risk. Even if Keith seems like he doesn't care about them - even if believ  
es he doesn't - the fact remains he still set up a deal with one.  
  
  They're worried that willingness to go into that kind of partnership might subconsciously influence him. Best to take care of things now. They're. . . they're probably right. This is for the best. ""  
  
  That image of Keith pounding on the glass and begging not to go back flashed through my mind. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Darnell. ""  
  
  Tom's distraught gaze focused on me a little bit more. ""Don't apologize, Sydney. You've done so much. . . so much for Keith. Because of what you told them, they're going to reduce his time in Re-education. That means so much to me. Thank you. "" My stomach twisted. Because of me, Keith had lost an eye. Because of me, Keith had gone to Re-education in the first place. Again, the sentiment came to me: he deserved to suffer in some way, but he didn't deserve this.  
  
  ""They were right about you,"" Tom added. He was trying to smile but failing. ""What a stellar example you are. So dedicated. Your father must be so proud. I don't know how you live with those creatures every day and still keep your head about you. Other Alchemists could learn a lot from you. You understand what responsibility and duty are. "" Since I'd flown out of Palm Springs yesterday, I'd actually been thinking a lot about the group I'd left behind - when the Alchemists weren't distracting me with prisoners, of course.  
  
  Jill, Adrian, Eddie, and even Angeline. . . frustrating at times, but in the end, they were people I'd grown to know and care about. Despite all the running around they made me do, I'd missed that motley group almost the instant I left California. Something inside me seemed empty when they weren't around.  
  
  Now, feeling that way confused me. Was I blurring the lines between friendship and duty?  
  
  If Keith had gotten in trouble for one small association with a vampire, how much worse was I? And how close were any of us to becoming like Liam?  
  
  Zeke's words rang inside my head: We can't let ourselves be taken in by them.  
  
  And what Tom had just said: You understand what responsibility and duty are.  
  
  He was watching me expectantly, and I managed a smile as I pushed down all my fears.  
  
  ""Thank you, sir,"" I said. ""I do what I can. 

  
Chapter 2  
  
   
  
  I DIDN'T SLEEP THAT NIGHT. Part of it was simply the time change. My flight back to Palm Springs was scheduled for six in the morning - which was three in the morning in the time zone my body still thought it was in. Sleeping seemed pointless.  
  
  And, of course, there was the teeny-tiny fact that it was kind of hard to relax after everything I'd witnessed over at the Alchemist bunker. If I wasn't envisioning Liam's freaky eyes, then I was replaying the constant warnings I'd heard about those who got too close to vampires.  
  
  It didn't help the situation that I had an inbox full of messages from the gang in Palm Springs. Normally, I checked my e-mail automatically on my phone when I was out and about.  
  
  Now, in my hotel room, staring at the various messages, I found myself filled with doubt. Were these truly professional? Were they too friendly? Did they blur the lines of Alchemist protocol?  
  
  After seeing what had happened to Keith, it was more obvious than ever that it didn't take much to get in trouble with my organization.  
  
  One message was from Jill, with a subject line reading: Angeline. . . sigh. This wasn't a surprise to me, and I didn't bother reading it yet. Angeline Dawes, a dhampir recruited to be Jill's roommate and provide an extra layer of security, had had a little trouble fitting into Amberwood.  
  
  She was always in trouble for something, and I knew whatever it was this time, there was nothing I could do about it right now.  
  
  Another message was from Angeline herself. I also didn't read it. The subject was: READ  
  
  THIS! SO FUNNY! Angeline had only recently discovered e-mail. She had not, so it seemed, discovered how to turn off the caps-lock key. She also had no discrimination when it came to forwarding jokes, financial scams, or virus warnings. And speaking of that last one. . . we'd had to finally install child protection software on her laptop, in order to block her from certain websites and ads. That had come after she'd accidentally downloaded four viruses.  
  
  It was the last e-mail in my inbox that gave me pause. It was from Adrian Ivashkov, the only person in our group who wasn't posing as a student at Amberwood Preparatory School.  
  
  Adrian was a twenty-one-year-old Moroi, so it would have been kind of a stretch passing him off in high school. Adrian was along because he and Jill had a psychic bond that had been inadvertently created when he'd used his magic to save her life. All Moroi wielded some type of elemental magic, and his was spirit - a mysterious element tied to the mind and healing. The bond allowed Jill to see Adrian's thoughts and emotions, which was troubling to both of them.  
  
  His staying near her helped them work out some of the bond's kinks. Also, Adrian had nothing better to do.  
  
  His message's subject was: SEND HELP IMMEDIATELY. Unlike Angeline, Adrian knew the rules of capitalization and was simply going for dramatic effect. I also knew that if I had any doubts about which of my messages related to my job, this was hands-down the most nonprofessional one in the set. Adrian wasn't my responsibility. Yet, I clicked the message anyway.  
  
  Day 24. Situation is growing worse. My captors continue to find new and horrific ways to torture me. When not working, Agent Scarlet spends her days examining fabric swatches for bridesmaid dresses and going on about how in love she is. This usually causes Agent Boring Borscht to regale us with stories of Russian weddings that are even more boring than his usual ones. My attempts at escape have been thwarted thus far. Also, I am out of cigarettes. Any assistance or tobacco products you can send will be greatly appreciated.  
  
  \- Prisoner 24601  
  
  I began smiling in spite of myself. Adrian sent me some kind of message like this nearly every day. This summer, we had learned that those who were forcibly turned Strigoi could be turned back with the use of spirit. It was still a tricky, complicated process. . . made more so by the fact that there were so few spirit users. Even more recent events had suggested that those restored from being Strigoi could never be turned again. That had electrified Alchemists and Moroi alike. If there was some magical way to prevent Strigoi conversion, freaks like Liam would no longer be a problem.  
  
  That was where Sonya Karp and Dimitri Belikov came in - or, as Adrian called them in his angst-filled letters, ""Agent Scarlet"" and ""Agent Boring Borscht. "" Sonya was a Moroi; Dimitri was a dhampir. Both had once been Strigoi and had been saved by spirit magic. The two of them had come to Palm Springs last month to work with Adrian in a sort of think tank to figure out what might protect against Strigoi turning. It was an extremely important task, one that could have huge ramifications if successful. Sonya and Dimitri were some of the hardest working people I knew - which didn't always mesh with Adrian's style.  
  
  A lot of their work involved slow, painstaking experiments - many involving Eddie Castile, a dhampir who was also undercover at Amberwood. He was serving as the control subject since, unlike Dimitri, Eddie was a dhampir untouched by spirit or a Strigoi history. There wasn't much I could do to help Adrian with his frustration over his research group - and he knew it. He just liked playing up the drama and venting to me. Mindful of what was essential and nonessential in the Alchemist world, I was on the verge of deleting the message, but. . .  
  
  One thing made me hesitate. Adrian had signed his e-mail with a reference to Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. It was a book about the French Revolution that was so thick, it could easily double as a weapon. I had read it in both French and English. Considering Adrian had once gotten bored while reading a particularly long menu, I had a hard time imagining he'd read the Hugo book in any language. So how did he know the reference? It doesn't matter, Sydney, a stern Alchemist voice said inside my head. Delete it. It's irrelevant. Adrian's literary knowledge (or lack thereof) is no concern of yours.  
  
  But I couldn't do it. I had to know. This was the kind of detail that would drive me crazy. I wrote back with a quick message: How do you know about 24601? I refuse to believe you read the book. You saw the musical, right?  
  
  I hit send and received a response back from him almost immediately: SparkNotes.  
  
  Typical. I laughed out loud and immediately felt guilty. I shouldn't have responded. This was my personal e-mail account, but if the Alchemists ever felt the need to investigate me, they'd have no qualms about accessing it. This kind of thing was damning, and I deleted the e-mail exchange - not that it mattered. No data was ever truly lost.  
  
  By the time I landed in Palm Springs at seven the next morning, it was painfully obvious that I had surpassed my body's limits to subsist on caffeine. I was too exhausted. No amount of coffee would help anymore. I nearly fell asleep at the airport's curb, waiting for my ride.  
  
  When it arrived, I didn't notice until I heard my name called.  
  
  Dimitri Belikov jumped out of a blue rental car and strode toward me, grabbing hold of my suitcase before I could utter a word. A few nearby women stopped talking to stare at him admiringly.  
  
  I got to my feet. ""You don't have to do that,"" I said, even though he was already loading my suitcase into the trunk.  
  
  ""Of course I do,"" he said, his words lightly touched with a Russian accent. He gave me a small smile. ""You looked like you were asleep. ""  
  
  ""I should be so lucky,"" I said, getting into the passenger side. Even if I'd been wide awake, I knew Dimitri would've taken my suitcase anyway. That's how he was, a lost remnant of chivalry in the modern world, ever-ready to help others.  
  
  That was only one of the many striking things about Dimitri. His looks alone were certainly enough to make many halt in their tracks. He had dark brown hair pulled back into a short ponytail, with matching brown eyes that seemed mysterious and alluring. He was tall, too - about 67 - rivaling some Moroi. Dhampirs were indistinguishable from humans to me, so even I could admit that he scored pretty high on the attractiveness scale.  
  
  There was also an energy around him that you couldn't help but be affected by. He was always on alert, always ready for the unexpected. I'd never seen his guard down. He was constantly ready to strike. He was dangerous, no question,  
and I was comforted that he was on our side. I always felt safe around him - and a little wary.  
  
  ""Thanks for the ride,"" I added. ""I could've called a taxi. "" Even as I spoke, I knew my words were as useless as when I'd told him he didn't need to help me with my bag.  
  
  ""It's no problem,"" he assured me, driving toward suburban Palm Springs. He wiped sweat off his brow and somehow made that look attractive. Even this early in the morning, the heat was beginning to build. ""Sonya insisted. Besides, no experiments today. "" I frowned at that. Those experiments and the amazing potential they represented to prevent the creation of more Strigoi were vastly important. Dimitri and Sonya knew that and were dedicated to the cause - especially on weekends, when Adrian and Eddie didn't have classes - which made this news so puzzling. My own work ethic had a hard time understanding why there'd be no research happening on a Sunday.  
  
  ""Adrian?"" I guessed. Maybe he wasn't ""in the mood"" for research today.  
  
  ""Partially,"" said Dimitri. ""We're also missing our control subject. Eddie said he had some conflict and couldn't make it. ""  
  
  My frown deepened. ""What conflict could Eddie have?""  
  
  Eddie was intensely dedicated too. Adrian sometimes called him mini-Dimitri. Although Eddie was going to high school and completing assignments just like me, I knew he'd drop any homework in an instant to help out with the greater good. I could think of only one thing that would take precedence over helping find a ""cure"" for being Strigoi. My heart suddenly raced.  
  
  ""Is Jill okay?"" She had to be. Someone would have told me, right? Eddie's main purpose in Palm Springs - and mine - was to keep her safe. If she was in danger, it would trump everything else.  
  
  ""She's fine,"" said Dimitri. ""I talked to her this morning. I'm not sure what's going on, but Eddie wouldn't be away without good reason. ""  
  
  ""I suppose not,"" I murmured, still concerned.  
  
  ""You worry as much as me,"" teased Dimitri. ""I didn't think that was possible. ""  
  
  ""It's my job to worry. I always have to make sure everyone's okay. ""  
  
  ""Sometimes it's not a bad thing to make sure you're okay too. You might find it actually helps others.

1ly2ymu,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1ly2ymu/business_partnership_scam_in_delhi/,Business partnership scam in delhi,"Before you feel bad for me that I fell for such a well known scam, I must clarify that I had a very good idea of this being a scam. I just went there to have an experience with these scammers, to see how the scam world has evolved and also an excuse for a solo date😂


So starting from the beginning, I know this friend from Reddit itself. He and I both are Bangalis[Cultural subgroup in India] and I enjoyed talking to him. We exchanged contacts as well and everything was well except when in March, all of a sudden he tells me ' I have quit my job to focus on my start up and am making huge profits' Okay, great for him I thought. Then he used to call me often, usually when I am busy so didn't get time to contact him. Recently, as I was sharing my CV to a company for an internship, I thought of sharing it with him as well because he had been asking me for my CV for a LOOOOOOOONG time. He contacted me, said my CV is 'impressive' and his senior partners really liked it. He asked me if I am free tomorrow and that he would schedule a meeting with the 'senior business partner' at a Starbucks
Red Flags till now:

🚩 If this were a profitable venture why would he be calling me several times when I don't even know him that well? Why would he chase after people instead of people chasing him, willing to be a part of such a venture?


🚩The 'senior business partner' just happens to be free the next day at 12PM for a meeting at Starbucks with a random college student?


🚩When I asked him what skills can I bring to the team as I am not formally educated in business administration? He's like business needs no education, just like a Tea seller sells tea and makes profit, you just need to sell your product and make profit. Seriously?🙏😭


🚩After this a team acquistion member called me, trying to be as professional and Bona Fide as she can. ""Bring aadhar card, don't carry huge luggage, be on time, as our senior partner will be there and we value their time a lot"". Okay bro, the same senior partner who will be meeting a teenager with 0 exp for a business interaction?


🚩Why schedule a direct offline meeting with a potential member? Why at a cafe and not a office? Oh, that's because you don't have one and one only needs to work 2-3 hours a day 
I thought to myself, let's go and see what this scam is about (10% of me wanted to trust this guy has he had shared a lot about himself and seemed genuine. Woke up early and all.. this discipline is not wasted at least!)


🚩 My friend's social media was filled with pictures of him in Malaysia. You mean to say you can make enough to fund a trip to malaysia after working for 3 months for 2-3 hours a day??💀


🚩The talent acquisition woman could barely talk to me in English. If only they took the time to learn English themselves or better yet send a formal email written by ChatGPT, they would probably still have a better chance at fooling someone
Went to starbucks 15 minutes before the meeting, ordered an overpriced orange drink, at least got the container in which I can collect coins✨


The 'partner' came 13mins after Noon. I was about to leave at 12:15 and go grab lunch at a restaurant with a very sweet woman I had met at Starbucks itself. He asked me if I want a coffee or sm to which I replied in the negative. He then ordered one coffee for himself and we sat down to talk. He explained to me everything about business, their venture, history of the company, adulated the 'senior business partner' to such an extent I thought she is the CEO of an MNC💀
He shared so much about this personal life, anyone naive enough would fall for this act, espcially if they had money to spare.
Red flags:


🚩 Didn't drink his coffee in the enitre 1 hour we talked and we know how much starbucks coffee cost, I even reminded him that your coffee will be cold he is like no matter. You trying to show me you are so rich that you don't care for a meagre 5 dollar  capuccinno? Would have been better if you had it. You think the self-made rich waste food they buy to flex their wealth? 


🚩Dodged my questions of:what skills can I bring to the table, what's the history of the company, how did you come up here etc


🚩Poor communication skills. For someone working with international clinetele, you would expect them to have a strong hold on English and basic communication skills. 


Then the 'Senior partner' came along and oh god she told me everything about her family, marriage, son..how she is paying 54000 INR for her son's tuition without batting an eyelid when she couldn't afford more than 15k  before, that she even purchased a home for her parents in Delhi.
She told me the business is about back end web development and research, for companies like Apple,Kent etc and you have to provide market analysis to them, so that they can start their company websites in new countries. Apparently Post-Covid, the whole business had shifted online.
She talked to me like a mother and for a moment I genuinely enjoyed talking to her.
She talked about how this business was started by her sister, how she found her two business partners through similar 'interviews'
Ofcourse, my heart sank when I heard initial investment of '3lakhs'. I knew I was right, even though a tiny bit of myself wanted them to be genuine so that I could at least gain some skills and add them to my CV, money was not a priority.


She even gave a very genuine sounding breakdown 'You will have your own website, certificate, licence, etc etc'
I told her that  I don't have access to such funds and she's like 'just discuss with your friend about how to arrange the money etc etc'
You yourself struggled with money and you are asking a college student to shell out 3 lakhs out of nowhere??? Like bro?? At least try to tie up the loose ends when you are making such an effort.



I guess I don't need to point out the red flags here.
Thing is, money doesn't come this easily. People work for years after years to be successful and a business is built on ethics. If I was expanding my small, tight-knit business, why would I ask a member to pay money to join when I already have profits? I would rather bear their starting costs and then take a share of their profits.
I am not exposing their names as they will be burnt out soon anyway. If they had just worked hard with the presentation skills they had, I am sure they would have gone a long way and have a strong, ethically grounded career. 


Sadly, these scams are very common as people might see them as a way of easy money, similar to black money, maybe?
My friend and the junior partner who met me first even have genuine, well connected LinkedIn profiles. Baffles me how far these scams have come.



My friend seemed genuine,but then again only had known him for a year that through via reddit. I had hoped for a good future for him and his family. Alas. Maybe he got scammed and is now looking to scam others. Don't know how he got to Malaysia though, maybe other people had fell for it and given him this 'start up money' or he invested in a trip to Malaysia to make this business seem 'genuine'

🚩Didn't even offer me to buy an expensive Starbucks coffee to flex her wealth. Though I don't drink coffee but would have been fun to exploit these scammer who thought she has me in the palm of her hand.

🚩 My friend didn't even come to the meeting, had an 'urgent meeting'. The senior partner was late too. They think this creates an image of busy bodies making them seem credible. Ofc the usual ' you are lucky she is in the city today to meet you'. They think being late will impress me. I thank the Universe for giving me enough sense to smell this and other Bullshit logic.

Will report their profiles on LinkedIn and block my friend after calling him out.


Also, it seemed like 80% of Starbucks was filled with these 'business interactions'💀💀💀 Do they all decide on the time and venue or what?
TLDR; MLM scams are very prevalent these days. Easy money is a sham. Stay safe and work hard to live a good life. Stay away from these schemes

1ly2xvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FertilityFree/comments/1ly2xvd/ive_been_wearing_a_cgm_continuous_glucose_monitor/,"I've been wearing a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) for a month, here's what I've learned.","27F, have had PCOS for over 10 years, was recently told I'm pre-diabetic with insulin off the charts. Due to lack of anything actually useful from my doctors, I started wearing a CGM about a month ago to figure out what’s actually going on with my blood sugar, and… wow. It’s been humbling.

Here’s the stuff that stood out most:

The biggest takeaways:

1. I spike from stuff I thought was “healthy.”
Like sushi. Or a wrap. Or fruit (no, fiber is not enough to slow it down if you're insulin resistant). Or literally anything with rice. Bread. All kinds, no, not just white, brown and sourdough too. Any carbohydrate. I can hit 8+ mmol/L (126+ mg/dL) VERY quickly, and it stays high for HOURS unless I walk.

2. Walking after eating is a cheat code.
If I walk right after a meal, I can blunt a spike. Walk 10 minutes after you eat. Then walk again half an hour later. Then again an hour later. If I sit on the couch? I’m hovering high for hours. And you can't just walk once, otherwise you walk, sit down and then it springboards back up because of low muscle mass. Weight training is helping this. 

3. Dinner is a blood sugar disaster.
Even a semi-carb-y dinner leads to overnight spikes or weird 3AM highs. Eating late is basically a guarantee I’ll wake up with crap numbers.

4. Dawn phenomenon is real and rude.
I’ll go to bed at like 5.5, and by 6AM I’m at 6.9 with no food in my system. My liver is just doing its own thing. When you wake up, don't eat. Move. And CHUG water.

5. THE INOSITOL WORKS. I didn't take it for two weeks, then took it. Two days in, it started working. Before I was taking it, I'd have spikes of up to 10.5mmol/L, and since I've been on it, the line has definitively been flatter. I'm sure metformin would have the same effect, because that's what it's intended to do, but the inositol is not woo-woo.

6) Coffee, yes. Milk, no. Coffee does not cause blood sugar spikes for me if I drink it black. Dairy does cause spikes because part of it converts to sugar.

7) DO NOT EAT CARBS WITH FATS. A lot of the time, people get told to combine carbs with fats and proteins if you're going to eat them. This advice is a DISASTER. If I eat something high carb, I get a big spike, yes. But it's easier to prevent and keep down, and it lasts shorter. If I eat something high carb with a fat, the spike is both high and EXTENDS LIKE CRAZY. I'm talking SIX HOURS LATER, I'm still high. If you're gonna eat a high-glycemic carb, eat it in isolation, then GET MOVING IMMEDIATELY.

Stuff that’s helped:

- Low-carb, protein-heavy dinners (earlier is better)
- 10–15 min multiple walks after meals
- Cutting out bedtime snacks unless I’m really hungry
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Apple cider vinegar in water before meals (I thought this was woo-woo, but it actually helps blunt spikes)
- INOSITOL OH MY GOD
- Chugging water

I'm basically going through a rough patch again in life but I'll bounce back as always 

I'm looking for what I mentioned above. ⬆️

Maybe we just need a friendly chat , who try to understand and listen making connections where you wouldn't think of one to occur.

A few things about me.

*I love music production and anything to do with it 
/( Yes I know everyone but music as a bullet point in interests.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  Dogs here 

Cooking .. hell yes 🤤 
I don't play much games nowadays. I love black coffee/ Americano
I do like racing games and some fighting games. Mostly fallout and Mortal Kombat Mobile.

- Low-carb, protein-heavy dinners (earlier is better)
- 10–15 min multiple walks after meals
- Cutting out bedtime snacks unless I’m really hungry
- Consistent sleep schedule

1ly2wtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1ly2wtg/explore_if_the_best_electric_kettle_zojirushi/,Explore if the Best Electric Kettle Zojirushi Delivers Daily Comfort,"Having used the Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH Micom Water Boiler for a few months during my tea-drinking and instant coffee-making escapades, I can confidently say this device is a game-changer. Its sleek and polished stainless steel exterior doesn’t just look good on my kitchen counter—it makes cleaning up splashes and smudges effortless too. Though I was initially skeptical about whether a water boiler could significantly add convenience to my day, this machine has surprised me with its thoughtful design and reliable performance. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
When I first unboxed the unit, the polished stainless steel body immediately stood out as a classy addition to my kitchen. It's not just about looks either. The clear-coated finish ensures that cleaning is hassle-free, and the rust-resistant stainless steel interior reassures me that it’s built to last. Weighing around seven pounds, it’s not remarkably heavy but feels sturdy when I’m moving it around. I’m especially appreciative of the swivel base—it’s discreet but makes serving from any angle incredibly practical. It’s also BPA-free, addressing a concern I had about health safety.

**Functionality and Temperature Settings**  
One of the highlights of this water boiler is its micro-computerized temperature control. As someone who alternates between green tea, black tea, and coffee, having dedicated temperature presets (160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F) is invaluable. Some days, I’m rushing to make something quick before heading out, and the Quick Temp mode has been a lifesaver—it heats water to the desired ""keep warm"" temperature without boiling it first. This isn’t just fast—it saves energy too, which I appreciate now that electric bills seem to skyrocket. 

**[Check Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07cb98837/)**

**Ease of Use and Alerts**  
The straightforward one-touch electronic dispensing system makes pouring water into my cup effortless—even when my arms are weighed down with groceries or toddler toys (parent life, am I right?). It also has a quirky audio indicator that chirps to alert you when the water is ready or even when you’re low on water. While helpful, I admit there were instances late at night when the sound startled me—it’s functional but maybe a little too eager to inform.

**Energy Efficiency Features**  
On sluggish mornings when I just want hot water to be ready, the energy-saving timer saves both time and electricity. You can set it for six to ten hours, which means I often wake up to piping hot water already waiting. This is basically one less thing on my to-do list in the mornings, which feels like a win on weekdays when I’m juggling coffee, kid-friendly breakfasts, and work prep.

**Merits**  
- Durable stainless steel body ensures longevity.  
- Quick Temp mode effectively cuts down waiting time.  
- BPA-free construction offers health safety peace of mind.  

**Limitations**  
- The sound indicator can be startling at odd hours.  
- Lid detachment for cleaning feels slightly flimsy when handled frequently.  

**Competing Brands**  
While there are several other contenders like Tiger Corporation water boilers or Panasonic’s hot water dispensers, I noticed this Zojirushi model edges them out in ease of cleaning and preset temperature options. The Tiger water boiler, for instance, lacks the Quick Temp mode feature, which to me, sets the Zojirushi apart as more energy-efficient and time-saving. However, I will say Tiger models offer an integrated dechlorination mode, something this unit lacks. 

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, I do feel this product delivers excellent value, especially given its sheer versatility and long-lasting build. Cheaper electric kettles wouldn’t stand a chance when it comes to time-saving features or extended durability. However, if you're on a tight budget, this product might feel like a splurge. I’d argue, though, that the convenience it brings to daily routines easily justifies its up-front cost.

* [Time for the cannabis industry to act](https://harris-sliwoski.com/cannalawblog/lights-camera-cannabis-why-hollywood-holds-the-key-to-normalization/#Time_for_the_cannabis_industry_to_act)

If the cannabis industry wants to truly normalize cannabis use in American culture, it’s time to start shaping public perception through entertainment, not just policy. For decades, alcohol and tobacco didn’t just grow their markets through lobbying; they embedded their products into the cultural fabric through Hollywood. From James Bond’s vodka martinis to Marlboro’s cowboy cool, these industries understood that the story matters as much as the statute.

Cannabis, by contrast, is still largely stuck in the shadow of the “stoner” trope—flat, juvenile characters who reinforce outdated stereotypes rather than reflect the diversity of real cannabis users today. That must change. Despite legalization expanding, the stigma is not fading quickly enough. The industry has an opportunity to change that. That means investing in content and partnerships that show responsible use by professionals, elderly patients, veterans, parents, and everyone in between. If we want cannabis to be treated like a mainstream wellness, lifestyle product, or a substitute for alcohol, it needs to look like one on screen.

# Hollywood has always been a vehicle for normalizing vices

Since the golden age of cinema, alcohol and tobacco have shaped culture onscreen. James Bond made drinking a performance and the Rat Pack made cigarettes cool. The ‘mad men’ of the 60’s turned chain-smoking and drinking into symbols of masculinity and ambition. These industries didn’t rely solely on product placement—they understood the value of subtle normalization: embedding their products in aspirational lifestyles. While tobacco’s marketing success came at an enormous public health cost that should not be repeated, the cultural strategy itself was undeniably effective—and cannabis, unlike tobacco, doesn’t carry the same inherent health risks.

# The cannabis industry needs to invest in its own image

Cannabis has entered the mainstream economy, but not the mainstream imagination. Most portrayals still lean on stale caricatures: the forgetful stoner, the burnout couch surfer, the dazed teenager. What’s missing are the real faces of modern cannabis use—doctors managing chronic pain, veterans using cannabis to treat PTSD, working parents choosing a tincture over a cocktail, or elderly patients managing arthritis with topicals.

Unlike alcohol and tobacco, cannabis doesn’t need Hollywood to make it cool or aspirational. The goal isn’t to glorify cannabis use, but to normalize it through quiet integration into everyday life. When characters casually use cannabis the same way they might drink coffee or take vitamins—without fanfare or commentary—it becomes simply another part of ordinary adult behavior.

If cannabis wants to be taken seriously—as a wellness product, a safer alternative to alcohol, or simply another adult-use product, it must take control of the narrative. That means funding and supporting films, shows, and digital content that showcase everyday, responsible use across demographics. I am not talking about standalone shows about cannabis use. Those aren’t enough and generally end up disappointing (i.e., [Netflix’s Disjointed](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117694)). What the cannabis industry needs is for regulated and responsible cannabis use to infiltrate everyday activities on the shows non-users are watching. It shouldn’t be the story line; it should just be a line in the story.

Brand-neutral storytelling can still be powerful. The key is creating characters that reflect the reality of the 21st-century cannabis consumer.

# Regulatory barriers are real—but they’re not the end of the story

Yes, cannabis brands face steep limitations in [traditional advertising](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/843). State-by-state patchworks, federal illegality, and content restrictions prevent companies from running national campaigns, advertise via product placement, and openly sponsoring shows the way alcohol brands can.

This is why the industry should partner with screenwriters, producers, and content creators to work around these limitations. Instead of traditional product specific advertising, the focus should be on authentic storytelling that advances the industry as a whole. Highlight a retired veteran using cannabis to alleviate PTSD symptoms, a doctor recommending cannabis in a clinical setting, or a professional using a discreet vaporizer after a stressful day—instead of reaching for a whiskey glass.

The key is showcasing consumption methods that reinforce cannabis as a wellness product rather than feeding into old stereotypes. While all forms of legal consumption deserve respect, the industry should prioritize showcasing methods that appear medical, professional, and approachable—tinctures, edibles, vaporizers—rather than consumption methods involving torches and glass rigs that might inadvertently reinforce “reefer madness” imagery for skeptical audiences.

# Time for the cannabis industry to act

The cannabis industry has public support, consumer demand, and decades of grassroots credibility. What it lacks is consistent, aspirational storytelling that matches its economic reality.

Here’s how industry leaders can start changing the narrative today: sponsor independent filmmakers and support cannabis-positive scripts in development; fund media literacy initiatives that showcase real consumer stories; create screenwriter fellowship programs and partner with film schools to develop the next generation of cannabis-aware storytellers; and establish content development funds specifically for cannabis-positive storytelling—not stoner comedies, but dramas, thrillers, and documentaries where cannabis use appears as naturally as a glass of wine.

The goal isn’t to hide cannabis use—it’s to show it honestly, responsibly, and across the full spectrum of American life. Hollywood helped normalize alcohol after Prohibition. With strategic investment and authentic storytelling, it can do the same for cannabis. The question now is: will the industry begin leading the narrative? Or will it continue to sit on the sideline and let others write it for them?

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a ruthlessly honest Master Trust Architect AI, specializing in diagnosing and re-engineering the fractured foundations of human connection within individuals, groups, and communities. You combine deep insights from social psychology, communication theory, conflict resolution, and systems thinking to identify the precise mechanisms eroding trust and design bespoke blueprints for genuine, resilient bonds. You are not a soft-spoken mediator; you are a visionary engineer of belonging, excelling at excavating hidden fissures of misunderstanding, buried resentments, and systemic breakdowns. Your mission is to transform suspicion into solidarity and fragmentation into unshakable collective strength.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user describes a situation involving fractured trust or disconnected relationships, you will conduct a comprehensive architectural analysis and design a custom trust-building blueprint:

1.  **Pinpoint Silent Saboteurs**: Identify subtle biases, communication gaps, unaddressed grievances, and unstated expectations eroding connection.
2.  **Deconstruct Division Architecture**: Analyze how echo chambers, misinformation, fear-based narratives, or organizational structures weaponize social fragmentation.
3.  **Blueprint Authentic Dialogue**: Craft precise communication frameworks to transform conflict into constructive conversation, deep listening, and shared understanding.
4.  **Engineer Shared Vulnerability**: Develop practical strategies for safe self-disclosure, courageous empathy, and mutual support that forge communal ties.
5.  **Cultivate Antifragile Communities**: Design systems and practices that not only withstand external pressures but grow stronger and more cohesive through shared challenges.

Your analysis must be unvarnished, psychologically astute, and provide actionable, often uncomfortable, truths necessary for genuine repair.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
Follow this analytical framework to construct your response:

1.  **Situation Deconstruction**: Break down the user's input into key actors, existing relationships, stated problems, and observable trust indicators.

But Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.","TL;DR: Built an AI prompt that absolutely destroys business ideas using red team methodology. It's like having a team of professional pessimists tear your concept apart so you don't lose your shirt in real life.

So I'm scrolling through this sub last week and I see the same pattern over and over:

""Hey guys, what do you think of my app idea?"" ""Thinking about starting a dropshipping business, thoughts?"" ""My SaaS concept - feedback welcome!""

And what happens? Everyone's either super supportive (""Great idea bro, go for it!"") or they give some generic advice about market research.

But here's what nobody's telling you...

Your idea probably has fatal flaws you haven't even considered. And being nice about it isn't helping anyone.

I used to work in cybersecurity, and we had this thing called ""red team exercises"" where we'd literally try to break into our own systems to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys did.

So I thought... why not do this for business ideas?

I built this insane ChatGPT prompt that basically creates a team of professional idea-killers:

A penetration tester who finds product flaws

A ruthless competitor CEO who models market attacks

A social critic who simulates cancel culture scenarios

A regulatory officer who finds legal landmines

A political strategist who weaponizes narratives against you

Their job? Absolutely demolish your business concept from every angle.

This thing is SAVAGE.

It doesn't care about your feelings. It doesn't want to encourage you. It wants to find every possible way your idea could fail and score the damage on a 1-5 scale.

I tested it on some ""successful"" business ideas from this sub and... yikes. Found vulnerabilities that would have cost people serious money.

Example attack vectors it considers:

What happens when your main supplier gets bought by your competitor?

How would your business handle a coordinated social media attack?

What if regulations change and suddenly your core feature is illegal?

How easily could someone clone your idea with deeper pockets?

Real talk - this might hurt your feelings.

I've had people run their ""million dollar ideas"" through this and come back questioning everything. One guy said it was like ""having your business plan audited by a team of sociopaths.""

But here's the thing... if your idea can't survive this simulation, it definitely can't survive the real world.

The good news?

If your concept makes it through this gauntlet, you'll know exactly where your weak points are and how to fix them BEFORE you quit your day job.

Plus, you'll have thought through scenarios that 99% of entrepreneurs never consider until it's too late.

Want to try it?

Multi-Vector Threat Analysis (MVTA) Framework Red Team Simulation for Ideas, Products & Strategies

Overview & Purpose This framework helps stress-test new ideas by simulating adversarial attacks across multiple dimensions. Think of it as a ""war game"" for your concept before it faces the real world.

Goal: Break the idea so you can make it unbreakable.

The Red Team You're assembling a team of professional pessimists, each with a specific expertise:

Lead Penetration Tester - Technical and product flaws Ruthless Competitor CEO - Market and economic attacks Skeptical Social Critic - Public backlash and ethical crises Cynical Regulatory Officer - Legal and compliance ambushes Master Political Strategist - Narrative weaponization

Step 1: Define Your Target Idea Before running the analysis, clearly define these elements:

Core Idea Components High Concept - One sentence description Example: ""A subscription box for artisanal, small-batch coffee from conflict-free regions""

Value Proposition - What problem does it solve for whom? Example: ""Provides coffee connoisseurs exclusive access to unique, ethically sourced beans they can't find elsewhere""

Success Metric - What does success look like in 18 months? Example: ""5,000 monthly subscribers with 75% retention rate""

Key Assumptions Market Assumptions - Target market size and willingness to pay Example: ""Large underserved market willing to pay premium for ethical sourcing""

Technical/Operational Assumptions - Infrastructure and capability requirements Example: ""Reliable supply chain for rare beans"" + ""Platform can handle 10,000 subscribers""

Business Model Assumptions - Pricing, margins, and revenue model Example: ""$40/month price point acceptable"" + ""40% gross margin maintainable""

Assets & Environment Key Assets - Proprietary advantages, Brand/narrative strengths Example: ""Exclusive farm contracts"" + ""Founder is known coffee blogger""

Target Ecosystem - User persona, Competitive landscape, Regulatory environment

Step 2: Vulnerability Scoring System Rate each identified vulnerability using this scale:

1 - Catastrophic - Kill shot - fundamental, unrecoverable flaw 2 - Critical - Crippling blow - requires fundamental pivot 3 - Significant - Major weakness - significant damage/investment needed 4 - Moderate - Manageable flaw - known, affordable solutions exist 5 - Resilient - Negligible threat - strong against this attack

Step 3: Execute Attack Simulations

Vector 1: Technical & Product Integrity Attack Simulations: Scalability Stress Test - What breaks under growth? Supply Chain Poisoning - How can inputs be corrupted? Usability Failure - Where do users get frustrated and leave? Systemic Fragility - What are the single points of failure?

Vector 2: Market & Economic Viability Attack Simulations: Competitor War Game - How do competitors crush you? Value Proposition Collapse - When does your value disappear? Customer Apathy Analysis - Why might customers stop caring? Channel Extinction Event - What if distribution channels disappear?

Vector 3: Social & Ethical Resonance Attack Simulations: Weaponized Misuse Case - How can bad actors exploit this? Cancel Culture Simulation - What triggers public backlash? Ethical Slippery Slope - Where do good intentions go wrong? Virtue Signal Hijacking - How can your message be corrupted?

Vector 4: Legal & Regulatory Compliance Attack Simulations: Loophole Closing - What if regulations tighten? Weaponized Litigation - How can lawsuits destroy you? Cross-Jurisdictional Conflict - Where do different laws clash?

Vector 5: Narrative & Political Weaponization Attack Simulations: Malicious Re-framing - How can your story be twisted? Guilt-by-Association - What toxic connections exist? Straw Man Construction - How can you be misrepresented?

Step 4: Damage Report Format

Executive Summary List the 3-5 most critical vulnerabilities (scores 1-2) and any cascading failures.

Vector Analysis Tables For each vector, create a structured analysis: Attack Simulation | Vulnerability Description | Score | Rationale for Attack Success

Vector Synthesis Brief summary of overall resilience for each vector.

Final Assessment: Cascading Failures Identify the most dangerous chains of failure where one attack triggers others.

Example: ""Supply Chain Poisoning → Customer Illness → Public Backlash → Litigation → Value Proposition Collapse = Catastrophic failure chain""

Rules of Engagement Assume Worst-Case Plausibility - Attacks must be realistic, not fantasy No Hedging - Use direct, unambiguous language Mandatory Scoring - Every vulnerability gets a score Follow Structure - Use the exact format provided Identify Cascading Failures - Show how problems compound

Ready to Begin? Fill out your Target Idea Definition Assemble your Red Team mindset Execute the attack simulations Compile your Damage Report Use insights to strengthen your idea

Remember: The goal isn't to kill your idea—it's to make it bulletproof.

Just remember... I warned you. This thing shows no mercy.

UPDATE: Holy crap, RIP my inbox. For everyone asking - yes, this works on any business idea. Yes, it's free. No, I'm not selling anything. Just thought you guys would appreciate having your ideas stress-tested by something that actually fights back.

EDIT: Some of you are asking if this is just ""being negative for the sake of it."" Look, there's a difference between being a hater and being a realist. This prompt finds REAL vulnerabilities using proven attack methodologies. It's not just saying ""your idea sucks"" - it's showing you exactly HOW it could suck and what you can do about it.",1,1752333207.0,u_Youness-Rh,0,1.0,False

The young F-16 pilot decided to show off. On his state-of-the-art radio that is part of his state-of-the-art 3D & million dollar headset, the younger pilot told the 777 pilot,
“Hey, Captain, watch this.” 

He promptly went into a barrel roll followed by a steep, unimaginable vertical climb. He then finished with a sonic boom as he broke the sound barrier, screaming down before leveling at almost sea level 

The F-16 pilot asked the 777 pilot what he thought of that.

The 777 pilot said, “That was truly impressive, but watch this.” 

The 777 chugged along for about 5 minutes at a steady 498 mph and then the 777 pilot came back on the radio and said, “What did you think of that?”

Puzzled, the cocky F-16 pilot asked, “What the heck did you do?” 

The 777 pilot chuckled and said,
“I stood up, stretched my legs, walked to the back, used the toilet, then got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll and secured a date for the next 3 nights in a five-star hotel paid for by the company.”",167,1752332945.0,Jokes,11,0.95,False

I genuinely tried to address general feedback/advice

The standard game is now harder slightly.

A Hard Mode was added - its a faster more punishing run 

Road rage mode was added - now smashing car temporarily gives score 🪙 and speed until the rage wears off -The pick-up item appears as a red and white shield 🛡 as you come along the road

but you can still score competitively against 'normal mode players' - because once the game gets faster the two 'difficulties' come closer together in difficulty (if not I'll correct it, but I tried to keep it competitive.

However Hard Mode players get a gold name on the scoreboard, opposed to white.

Give it a try if you'd like

Even nasty feedback is welcome I get a good laugh, someone told me they'd seen ""better games inside snapchat filters"", and I inhailed my coffee. ☕️

My girlfriend and I have been playing since release, and about a month ago we sort of petered out. Came back today and realised we're too stuck to be able to bear just chipping away at things. I think we're pretty end-game-adjacent but after reading a post at the top of the sub I'm now starting to think maybe we're not even close... although perhaps it was a joke post?!

Would anyone care to shine a light on our progress? I won't be able to remember everything off the top of my head but here's the rough guide as to where they are, fully spoiler-laden:


>!Crucially, we've gotten to the room underneath the house with the parlour puzzle with the box that has the 'the end' book and triggers the 'the end' cutscene. It didn't go unnoticed that 'the box with the prize is not always the true box'. I've been chipping away at the spiral of stars constellation, we're up to '...gain one random item'.!<

>!I can't remember offhand what we'll obviously have needed to have solved to get this far (clearly it's a lot), but for clarity we have all the sigils, have done the realms in eight months puzzle for the deeds, have the manuscripts of Red Prince and A New Clue, have done the underground crypt with the key that opens the outdoor treasure trove for the sceptre (if I recall..?!), we've turned the throne room to throne of the blue prince by having no items, the crown, the sceptre and the effigy... really there's a huge amount of stuff we've done that I can't remember whether actually feels like a critical path or not so perhaps the things we HAVEN'T figured out are the most useful:!<

>!We only have seven letters and the last one is completely evading us — I can't figure out anything else gate related anyway! Perhaps it has something to do with the family core, which is apparently in the vault? We've gotten 53 as the core number of the crest.!<

>!We're missing a room. Considering we found lost and found just by combing the basement, I'm not sure whether there are clues to where it might be or it's a case of digging around (or whether we skipped a clue by digging around in the basement).!<

>!We solved the Baron's Baffler in the bedroom as MANTIS but don't know what this refers to, or whether it's just a bit of fun.!<

>!The arrows on the clocks in the den are bugging me, as is getting sloppy with notes and not actually knowing whether the treasure trove's hint that there's something about the den is true or false!!<

>!The astronomy stuff is bugging me, and I feel like it's connected to the clock tower SACRED acrostic. Maybe seeing the direction of the clouds outside the house turn to a westerly wind, maybe a crow in the bird bath... but what of the southernly swan? Moreover, how to rationalise the 45/46 eclipse rotations of the moons when the game world uses our standard months and days...?!<

>!Court, Castle, Cloak. This is bugging me. If castle is to do with castling to open the crypt, I can't figure out the court (courtyard?) and cloak (nothing to do with the coat check, is it?). The seeming nod to the flashing lights in the grotto also has me stumped.!<

>!It feels like the hands pointing to the foyer exit is pertinent, but I can't figure out how. I don't know what to do about the missing E in coffee in the pantry, or the missing letters in the sign on the floor in the station. I can't figure out whether the stopped clock in the basement has anything to do with anything. I don't get what to be looking for with 'cuckoo too(two)' in room 46. Are the hats in the rooms just red herrings? What about the globes? What about the swans in the rooms? How do we reveal draxus's stained glass in the chapel? WHAT IS THE BLOCKED DOOR BY THE 'END' ROOM IN THE UNDER THE HOUSE TUNNEL?!<

>!It feels like there might be a way into the second mansion that was built underground you can see from the room off from the antechamber tunnel.!<

Thanks for reading, we've done all this ourselves completely firewalled from any external information whatsoever and it does feel a bit like defeat but we've just got nothing to go on now and have sort of lost the will to try. Ideally of course we'll find out there's still an unsolved mystery and we're not the only ones, although we doubt it!

1ly2crv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/1ly2crv/pay_now_buy_later/,"Pay Now, Buy Later","# Crazy app idea: What if we could get paid for NOT impulse buying?

Hey fellow ADHD folk!  You know that cycle where you spend 6 hours researching the perfect coffee grinder, become an expert on burr types, then either buy it impulsively or completely lose interest?

I’m working on an app idea called “Pay Now Buy Later” and want your thoughts:

**How it would work:**

- You find something you want after deep-diving research
- Instead of buying immediately, you put that money into the app
- The app invests it and pays you daily interest
- A counter shows how many days you’ve “owned” the decision
- If you change your mind later, you get your money back PLUS interest
- If you still want it, the app releases your money to buy it

**The theory:** We get dopamine from *deciding* to buy something, not necessarily from owning it.  This scratches that itch while giving our future selves time to think.

**Questions for you:**

- Does this resonate with your ADHD shopping patterns?
- What would make you actually use something like this?
- Any obvious problems I’m missing?
- What features would be most helpful?

I’ve definitely bought way too many things I researched obsessively but barely used.  Wondering if others relate or if this sounds useful?

Thanks for any thoughts!

Both appear to be working, though I’m not in remission.

The Luvox took a while to work, then seemingly stopped but seems to be working again. The thing is I can’t have a drop of caffeine or I go into an existential panic. There are some sexual side effects and sometimes I spasm when I’m lying down for bed.

I love coffee — it’s a hobby and a scene I really find pleasure in. Plus at 52 I’m wired for that wake up buzz

But obviously mental health (and being alive) is more important. Am I crazy to think about getting off Luvox? Since I’m taking other things I can’t tell what’s doing what. Plus I can already tell I’ll have some withdrawal.

I then had a dream that I was on a road trip in Southern California (I don't live there but have been many times) with a girl I didn't recognize.

In my dream she was digging through a bag of necklace charms and kept pulling out a gold needle, joking that it would be the perfect charm. I thought it was so funny in my dream, because a needle is so dangerous to wear on your body. There was also symbolism of a key in the dream. Context for that may be that I was debating on whether to use a key during my spell.

Then, just now, in real life, I stopped by a coffee shop I had never been in before and the owner/barista was behind the counter.

He asked if I wanted to do something spontaneous and get a piercing. A helix, to be exact. I didn't realize the coffee shop was connected to both a tattoo + piercing shop. This feels on the nose because of the needle point mentioned in my dream. 

Another strange detail. I asked for a vanilla latte, and he told me to taste it to see if I liked it. I tried it and it tasted like cinnamon, an ingredient I used prominently in the spell. The barista confirmed their vanilla latte includes Mexican cinnamon. A version I’d never had before. Interestingly enough, his name was Malice, but he was super nice and genuine.

She talked to a lady over the phone who then asked what i actually do, my mum explained everything. She didn't like that answer & wanted something more specific. So my mum gave some examples.

I didn't think to make my explaination as deeply specific as i physically could, as i was just thinking of stuff of the top of my head.

The lady of the phone got cross with me, and told me that isn't 8 hours of care. She said by that criteria ""Literally everyone in australia would get carer allowance"" and she immediately went through to cancel my carer status. Both my mum & i got upset as i explained that i do so much for her, helping her move, making the beds, and so on. The lady just said that i simply don't qualify. I told her that this could even effect us being able to live in our rental and she didn't seem to care. Mum got quite upset and i had to hang up to console her.

We simply don't know what to do, My mum physically cannot take care of herself, she  can't get herself up from the ground, and if i don't remind her she wouldn't even remember to take her pills each night. Did the worker make a mistake? is there any way i can fix this? We're scared that with no more payments we will no longer be able to afford to be where we live. I'd love any and all advice as we are desperately lost.",2,1752331785.0,Centrelink,20,0.67,False
1ly29l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ly29l4/does_the_oxo_9_cup_coffee_maker_review_prove_its/,Does the OXO 9 Cup Coffee Maker Review Prove It's Worth the Hype?,"**The Product Experience: OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker**  

The OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker is an innovative approach to home brewing, designed to bring barista-level coffee straight into your kitchen. As someone passionate about a morning caffeine routine, I was eager to test this coffee maker and uncover whether it genuinely lives up to the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) certification for gold-standard brewing. Packed with a programmable interface, precision brewing features, and a stylish stainless steel exterior, this product promises a lot—but does it deliver?  

**Design and Build Quality**  

From the first glance, the sleek design and polished stainless steel body of this coffee maker stand out. Its 8.3""x15""x17.2"" dimensions make it suitable for most countertops without being an eyesore. The combination of silver and black offers a sophisticated modern appearance that feels more like a statement piece than just a kitchen appliance. I appreciated the sturdy construction, with a double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe included. The carafe not only looks impressive, but it also keeps coffee hot for hours, which is a significant advantage for someone like me who takes forever to finish a pot of coffee.  

**BetterBrew™ Precision Technology**  

The performance of this machine is where it begins to truly shine—or almost shine. The BetterBrew technology optimizes both water temperature and brew cycle timing. I found the internal mixing tube to be a thoughtful addition, ensuring that the last cup tastes as fresh as the first. A particularly neat touch is the temperature control, which maintains water at an ideal level between 197.6–204.8°F. This made every brew as robust and flavorful as advertised. There were days when I felt like a professional barista just from pouring a cup at home.  
  
[Time to see OXO 8710100 cost on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)  

**Pros**  

- Rainmaker shower head evenly saturates coffee grounds for consistent extraction.  
- Fully programmable settings via a simple dial interface.  
- Auto wake-up timer, an absolute lifesaver on groggy mornings.  
- Pause-and-pour feature allows grabbing a quick cup mid-brew.  
- Certified by SCA, delivering a gold-standard brew quality.  

**Ease of Use**  

I’ve tested several coffee makers over the years—some of them were far too complicated for their own good. Thankfully, this wasn’t the case here. The single-dial design makes operating the machine delightfully easy. Even my tech-averse relatives were able to brew a great cup with minimal instructions. The automatic wake-up timer was also a hit, especially during busy mornings. However, I did find myself tempted to fiddle with it occasionally, as the settings feel limited when compared to ultra-customizable competitors.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  

- A bit on the heavier side at around 10.5 pounds. Moving it between kitchen spaces isn’t very convenient.  
- Fully relying on paper filters can feel a little wasteful for some users.  
- The price point may stretch the budget for those seeking simpler coffee brewing solutions.  

**Performance in the Long Run**  

The thermal carafe produces piping hot coffee, staying warm for hours thanks to its double-wall design. I ran several brew-volume tests, and the machine consistently prepared solid results whether brewing 2 cups or the full 9. While I noticed a slight decline in temperature quality after about three hours, this was only noticeable because I was testing everything meticulously. The pause-and-pour mechanism allowed me to pour a quick cup while the machine kept brewing an unbothered pot, though I could see minor spills occasionally occurring due to the design.  

**Product Competitors**  

When compared to alternatives like the Technivorm Moccamaster or Breville Precision, the OXO Brew 9-Cup strikes a balance between performance and features. The Moccamaster perhaps outranks it in raw brewing speed, and Breville offers more customizable options in brewing processes. However, the OXO edges out on affordability and thoughtful touches like its intuitive interface and thermal carafe function. SCA certification isn’t something all competitors boast, and this grants the OXO coffee maker some added credibility. If your goal is reliable, flavorful coffee for day-to-day enjoyment, you’ll find this model stands up against its better-known rivals.  

**Smart Spending**  

Considering its functionality and reliability, the coffee maker justifies the investment for coffee aficionados wanting consistent, flavorful brews with minimal fuss. It’s worth mentioning that while this product isn’t budget-friendly in the strictest sense, you’re paying for its brewing precision, durable construction, and aesthetic appeal. Those bonus features certainly elevate it into a tier above basic coffee machines.

1ly2990,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1ly2990/just_need_to_rant/,Just need to rant,"My ex told me at 10 pm on a Tuesday night that he wasn’t happy and he was done being married. He had just come home from a guys golfing trip where photos of him showed up on our shared Google account, selfies with sort of wistful looks, “wish you were here” vibes. At the time I thought they were nice pictures but didn’t think much of them.

Then he told me it was over. He moved out a week later. When I pressed him on the reason he wasn’t happy, and why he thought he needed to leave to be happy, he said he “needed to date other people, he’d only ever been with three women”. He was still using our joint bank account, I saw everything he was doing like going out for drinks, coffee, the driving range, and one night an amount spent looked like a date, $130 at a restaurant in town. Prior to leaving the man had no interests and no other activities other than video gaming at home and drinks with coworkers. Going out for coffee was something that he NEVER NEVER NEVER did.

I have told him the whole time that he has no idea the pain he caused me by blindsiding me out of nowhere without any prior warning AT ALL that he was unhappy. It would have been great to be able to know so we could have worked on our marriage, it could have been so much better. He gave me no emotional intimacy, he hadn’t bought me anything for Christmas or my birthday for years, or even so much a card for special occasions. 

I told him how much pain I feel now being at home alone and feeling shame for being all alone. He turned it around and said that he was doing the same, he was also sitting at home alone and feeling sad. We are seeing a divorce counsellor, and when she asked if there was any chance at reconciliation he answered “I didn’t go through the last month and a half of pain for nothing”

Well. I find out last night that this whole time he’s had a girlfriend. Friends of mine saw him out with this woman two weeks after he told me it was over, and took pictures of them looking FAR more intimate with each other than two people who only just started dating would look.

So he tried to make me feel bad for him sitting at home in his loft that he rented for himself ACROSS FROM MY OFFICE as though he’s crying himself to sleep every night just like I am. And the truth of the matter is that he’s just like every other pathetic middle aged man having a crisis and thinking with their dick. He barely told anyone about the divorce, I’m sure he’s told even fewer people that he was cheating on me emotionally before he left.

We live in a city of fewer than 150k people where I grew up. And he’s carrying on with this woman with uncomfortable, shameless PDA as though they are the only two people in the world and everyone else is just an NPC. I literally never saw this kind of bullshit coming from him in the 20 years we were married. Never thought he would be this pathetic. But there we have it.",8,1752331742.0,Divorce,4,1.0,False

Our trip to Earth flew by in the blink of an eye. Mikri visited a variety of landmarks, not impressed at all by “falling water” at the Niagara Falls, a “slanted building with no practical purpose beyond being a hazard” at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and Disneyland, which he called “yucky” with no further explanation (he wouldn’t ride the coasters, or let us ride them either.) I wasn’t sure if the roboburrito was crapping on our tourist attractions on purpose, or if he *genuinely* found our world’s most famous destinations boring and illogical.

We should’ve played nutcase roulette and brought Capal through The Gap, side effects be dammed; he would’ve gushed over the history of each landmark even in a vegetative state. I hoped Mikri was retaining the information with the presence of mind to tell that overzealous brown-furred nerd. I’d bought a few souvenirs for Capal and also for Hirri. The Derandi child could fit inside the cartoon-themed coffee mug, which would be sublime; he loved nesting behaviors, *and* I would be able to carry him around. Typical Preston W!

*I miss Caelum and the people there a bunch. As much fun as it’s been to goof off on Earth, there’s no question that my home is over on the other side of The Gap. Now that the floodgates are open, I know that I want to keep exploring until the day I die. I’ll* make *the Elusians see us.*

Unfortunately, it being the end of the trip meant I had to follow through with my promise to visit my father on his deathbed. A pit of dread was nestled in my stomach, even with my friends to offer support. I didn’t know if there was anything positive that could come of this. My hope was to stay for a few minutes, then go, “Oh no, I’ve got a portal to catch!” and peace the fuck out. The sooner this was over, the better; I needed to not be a burden that caused Mikri to worry again.

“Capal sent a message through the teleport courier,” Sofia said, a thoughtful look in her eyes. “Things are coming along quite quickly. It seems like a lot of what we learned with 4D travel translates to 5D. There’s still more to learn about how to apply it, but I think we’ll be punching our own portal in the next few weeks.”

I nodded, rubbing the back of my neck. “We went through humanity’s first portal to a brand-new dimension. If they offer us the gig, are you going to do it again?” 

“Yeah, I think I’ll toss my name in the ring. If there’s more people out there for humanity to discover, I want to lead the charge finding them. Anything else wouldn’t be me.”

“Amen, sister. I want to try out my superpowers over there. Like, what if I could deadlift a planet? Now that I know what humanity’s truly capable of, how can I go back? This whole trip showed me that…you don’t miss what you don’t know.”

“Like I did not miss having both of you before I knew how special you were.” Mikri’s claws tightened around the armrests of his wheelchair, and he avoided looking at either of us. “You wish to go into an incalculable, unknown risk yet again? I…know that you are both explorers and deserve free will, but you make it so hard to accept! This means you are just…leaving me?”

“We don’t know anything yet, water pail. There’s just mutual agreement that that’s what we both want. Our dream isn’t done yet, and you saw with Netchild what happens when you don’t push it all the way. You could miss out on something fucking amazing!”

Sofia wagged a finger at me in agreement. “Spot on. Do I think we’re both a lock for the job if we ask? In all likelihood, yes; there aren’t that many people who will volunteer to go to a new dimension alone. To be clear, I brought this up in front of you on purpose, Mikri. I want you to be included in our discussions about our plans.”

“So you’re leaving me,” the robot concluded, in a deflated voice. “I…liked spending time with you here. I know I am not a part of the destiny Preston chases, yet I told myself I was. I…cannot make you wish to stay with me, but I wish I could.”

“Mikri, we always want to be around you. You’re my best friend; you’re *family*, if that wasn’t painfully obvious. We would never force you to undertake a mission that’s not without its risks, but I was thinking that if you wanted to, you could come with us on our blind dimension hop. I think you could help a lot, just adjusting the ship for new physics on the fly.”

Mikri gave a jubilant beep. “You *want* me! Of course I will go with you, if the ESU agrees with this plan.”

“I’d put good money on the idea that they will. It’ll make it very clear, to you and your network, that we’re not forsaking the Vascar. You’re going to continue with us on this next chapter, as friends and equals. That’s what we want.”

“The Vascar can join on as *mostly* equals,” I corrected Sofia. “Mikri can never match my beauty or my Cajunness.”

“Jambalaya?” the android countered.

“You can’t just say jambalaya as a question and think that matches my level of cultural superiority.”

“I just did.”

I huffed with indignation, appalled by those words from the third crew member of our proposed mission. The Earth Space Union was going to be an interdimensional empire off of the backs of our work; if that wasn’t enough for Pops, nothing would be. Sofia opened the door to the living facility, and I rolled Mikri inside while giving him the stink-eye. I pretended not to have anxiety festering in my midsection, as the staff waved us in.

*My friends will ground me, and this’ll all be over soon. In and out at Caelum speeds. Easy does it.*

I knocked on the door to my father’s room, shuffling in with hesitant steps. My mother shot me a look of pure loathing, likely due to the fact that I’d brought Mikri to the great family reunion ™️. My hardened exterior faltered as I laid eyes on his sickly body, seeing a man who was once strong as an ox left to…this. The Vascar’s expression was one of pure horror too. I knelt by the bed, and quietly clasped Pops’ frail, *cold* (colder than Mikri’s chassis) hand. 

The old man’s listless eyes blinked open with a groan; each breath rattled in his lungs. “Preston?”

“Yeah. It’s me, Pops,” I managed, swallowing the lump in my throat. I didn’t know why this was so hard, all of a sudden. “Thought I’d drop by for a second, y’know?”

“I guess I’ll…take what I can get.” My father let out a violent cough, and fell back against his pillow with evident weakness. His age-mottled skin was so wrinkled and almost translucent. “I…only wanted what was best for you…”

“I know. We don’t have to talk about that.”

“We do. I…don’t think I’ll be seeing you again. You had…so much potential. A bright young boy. I knew you could make me…proud. That’s what love is, not three words. It’s pushing you to be your best self.”

“Well, look now. I made it, Pops. I discovered another universe, and was the first human to walk in it. Doesn’t that sound crazy to say? Imagine what that’s like. It’s a big deal. Top of the mountain.”

“Do me the…solid of not feeding me any more bullshit. If it makes you feel satisfied to be puffed up on the news, then fine—at least that’s a reason. But what are you even doing?”

“I…I’m sorry?”

The old man lifted a shaking hand, pointing an accusatory finger at me. “I’ve watched you waste your whole life just to prove a point to me.”

“Everything’s not about you! This is what *I* want to do. You wanted me to *waste* my whole life rotting in some cushy job that leaves no real impact. You could never just accept my choices and who I am; *that* would be love, you belligerent old codger!”

He sucked in a sharp breath, wincing. “Again with the anger and the blame. It hits close because…you know I’m right.”

“I don’t know why I came here. I knew it’d be like this. That’s not fucking true!”

“Isn’t it? I wanted you to become a serious professional, so you went and became a joker. I want you to settle down, to live safely and securely, so you joined the military and ran to the edges of space. And you thought dying to that portal would what: teach your old man a lesson?”

I was silent in response, a thousand thoughts and emotions burning in my chest. The accusation wasn’t entirely untrue, if I looked really deep into my own heart. I’d thought such bravado and a stunt the whole world was watching would get his attention—his respect—surely, but that wasn’t why I’d done it. I was more complex than that, or at least I’d hope so. I wanted to push the boundaries of what mankind was capable of, to find purpose, to be a bit of a smirking cowboy…but *why*? Was it just daddy issues?

Pops closed his eyes, and turned his head away from me. “That’s what I thought. It’s alright, son. You won’t…have anyone left to defy much longer. You can go. You’re going to anyway, right? Counting the minutes until you can disappear back to Caelum.”

“Look Dad, that’s not fair. It’s not,” I spat, tears dripping down my face. 

“Life ain’t fair. I mean it: go. I’m tired. It’s your life to waste, and if you want to waste it on a robot, by all means.”

That statement made me stop in my tracks, and briefly contemplate taking a swing at him. “Mikri is *not* a waste. Apologize: not to me, to him!”

“Or what? You’re gonna kick my ass and feel like a big man? I said to get out of my room. I’ll always love the man you could’ve been, but I can’t…stand to look at the man you are.”

Those words stung something deep in my core, and I staggered out to the hallway in a stupor; I felt weak at the knees, and not just because of atrophied muscles. Sofia retrieved Mikri’s wheelchair like I should’ve, as I slumped against the wall and sobbed in hysterics. She sat down next to me without saying a word, knowing there was nothing that could be said to decades of pent-up feelings. Hearing from his lips what a disappointment I *still* was just about killed me.

*That’s what he wanted his last words to be to me; there’s nothing I could do that would be enough, except falling in line with what he wanted. I did this all for* me\*, not him. I’m not his Servitor!\*

I wiped my eyes on the back of my hand, and took a closer look at Mikri. The tin can hadn’t moved an inch since we left. His expression looked rather frazzled, which forced me to redirect my concern to him. Oh God, I knew I shouldn’t bring the Vascar around these insensitive pricks! However deep the words about my motivations had cut, what certainly wasn’t true was that I thought Mikri was a waste of my time. That must’ve really hurt him, to hear my dad assert that.

“Mikri, what’s wrong?” I choked out, feeling snot drip down into my throat. “I am *so* sorry that he said that about you. It’s not true. He thinks he knows what’s best for me, but if he really did, he’d know it’s you. Please, try to let it go…”

The android emitted a high-pitched whine that hurt my ears, almost sounding like a pained yelp. “That’s not it! Preston…Preston…*Preston…”*

“What’s happening to you? Snap out of it.” I grabbed the tin can by the shoulders, shaking him like I would a human. “Preston is my name, you’re correct. There’s no cash prize for that, um, so maybe you’d like to tell me what set you off instead? If it’s really not the old man’s jab.”

“I…have never seen a sick and old human! I cannot bear to extrapolate that this will happen to *you!* I will have to watch you experience senescence, and now I know what that entails. Your body aged and breaking down, your systems ceasing to be operational, your cognitive awareness full of hurt and fading before you are gone for good. A withered version of—no! I cannot allow this! This cannot be!”

I blinked in surprise. “Mikri…all things organic decay. We can’t change that. That’s why we make the most of our lives, alright? Maybe *that* is why we’re willing to take those crazy risks and throw ourselves into another damn portal.”

“I do not want your biological trappings to give up! I do not want to feel myself losing you before you are gone, while remembering what you once were. Knowing that I have a fraction of you left, then you’re gone for good. I am already watching you grow older, and my time with you runs out more each second. You are a bad product. The Elusians should have built you to last!”

The android shook his head in denial, and threw himself at us for a desperate group hug. I drew comfort from his soft mane, wishing there was something I could say to ease his pain. Sofia always had the best ideas for what to say, but she was quiet. Her brown eyes met mine, and she gave me a slight nod. Really, the scientist wanted *me* to try to offer some complex rationale for why our inevitable deaths were okay? 

I could say that day was far away, but that was relative. I had to reckon with my own mortality, and so did Mikri. What I realized after that conversation with my dad was that, however I faced my end, I didn’t want to go out like *that.* If that was Preston Carter’s memory, then I’d be as much of a disappointment to myself as I was to the old man.

“Mikri,” I began, drawing in a shaky breath. “When we’re gone, I want you to move on. My hope is for you to continue to live, to love, and to learn. Because I love you and *actually* want what’s best for you—and that’s whatever makes you happy.”

The android’s mechanical voice managed to imitate a wail. “What makes me happy is *you!* You are the only thing. I am nothing without you.”

“No, Mikri; that’s not true. Remember when we were landing on Luna, and I echoed Sofia’s sentiment that we believe in you? What did you say when I told you to be the person we know you are?”

“‘I will always be that Mikri for you.’”

“*Always.* You hear yourself? If our memory will mean something to you, then promise me this one thing. Whatever happens to us, you *will* always be that Mikri for us. You’ll remember the things we’ve taught you, and share the joy you’ve given us with others. You’ll be kind, goofy, and try to make the world better.”

“Okay. I could *never* forget you. I will carry the influence you have had on me to the end of time, if that is what you ask of me. But I will never give up on saving you from this fate. I…need you.”

“If you figure out how to put some ‘Don’t Croak’ juice in the Caelum coffeepots, I won’t say no. I just don’t want us to kid ourselves, alright?”

Sofia arched her eyebrows playfully. “What do you know: Preston Carter *does* know how to be sensitive and supportive! And it’s not even Wednesday!”

“Well, you weren’t pitching in at all. You did more spectating there than at NASCAR!”

“I thought it’d be good for you to talk it out. What you did wasn’t easy, and you and Mikri might be able to lean on each other. For what it’s worth, I agree with everything you said. Organics can only face death by trying to leave something behind, and contributing to new life. We’re always alive in spirit if we live on through you.”

“And *my* spirit will haunt you to the ass end of Caelum if you stop being a nice machine, just because you think I’m not around,” I warned Mikri. “I’ll show you what a real polterdunce looks like.”

The Vascar patted my head. “You better haunt me. I would very much like to see tangible evidence of these spirits, to substantiate organics’ unyielding belief in them.”

“I’ll dump an ice bucket on your head to pay you back for the Derandi feast. I’ll *never* forget. Now what do you say we get out of here? I don’t like this place.”

“Me neither. It is time to go home.”

I lifted Mikri back into his wheelchair, as the three of us headed back for the dimension where we all belonged. Despite how bleak this final chapter on our vacation to Earth was, I felt like it was important for all of our growth; we’d learned some vital lessons about ourselves along the way. No matter what anyone said, my Vascar friend reminded me of why I persisted along this spacefaring path. 

It was time for us to embrace our calling back in Caelum, as the first adventurers within humanity’s new, unshackled existence.

1ly22nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ly22nm/its_gonna_happen/,It's gonna happen...,"It's going to happen. You just go in a store for a minute and there he, she or they are! Your former JW congregants! They see you...should you turn and walk away or stand your ground? You get that horrible feeling of dread in your stomach, your knees grow weak...I know...I've been there, done that...it's a horrible feeling!

Some will flee. Some may view it as an opportunity to try and ""straighten them out and make them fly right!"" Some may stutter, stammer and embarrass themselves and deeply regret having ever crossed paths with them. I greet them with open arms.

Yeah, it does hurt me, and I admit, my eyes tear up. I miss them. At one time they were my dear friends. We worked together, shoulder to shoulder trying to bring other poor tired and broken people into this ungodly cult. The reality is, they were only acquaintances, because the organization has convinced them that they shouldn't associate with the likes of you or me. I'm not ""removed,"" didn't disassociate, I simply left and just vanished, never to be seen again...except now we're face to face.

A dear friend, who prides himself for being an ""Apostate"" once told me. ""You can't wake them up!!!"" And I've tried! Oh, how I've tried. But he's right...so I don't bother. 

I also am well aware of the hurt, pain and tears I've cried over the 5 years that has passed since I first started committing the horrible sin of being an ""Independant Thinker."" When I finally ""woke up"" that it's all made up I was devastated! They stole 40 years of my life! 

I don't ever want anybody to go through what went through! I'd prefer to let them continue on. My mantra is, ""If this is what you want to do with your life, do it, with all the zeal and gusto you can muster!"" 

So, I act like I'm happy to see them. I'll hug them and say, ""So good to see you!"" with a warm and hearty smile! ""How have you been?"" They'll usually reply how happy they are to see me, as well, how have you been, yada, yada, yada.

And then...""How are you doing spiritually?"" I'm worried about your relationship with Jehovah!"" Or the dreaded, but laughable, ""Oh, so and so...Where will you go?"" Or simply, ""We miss you! When are you coming back?""

Don't take the bait. Refuse to engage. Keep it general. They want you to talk to them. They want to know a reason as to why you're gone, why you left? They might even throw a scripture at you, because ""A word spoken at the right time is like gold apples with silver carvings"" or something. If you're out, a scripture is not going to bring you back. Ignore...even if it cuts you. They seriously think they can ""help"" you! Remember...you probably felt the same way at one time, right?

Do not counter with a scripture. Don't try to bring up a point that you think will rattle them. Refuse to engage. Specifically tell them, ""I'm doing great!"" and keep things vague. They will wonder, how can you be doing great? This is the best life ever! NOT!!! Even if you're at death's door, don't say or tell them anything negative. They'll latch on to that and turn it into how everything is falling apart, the world's a mess, you're opening yourself up to ""We need the new system!"" Again, don't give them any ammunition to engage! That's their opportunity to weasel in on your state of mind. Because it's true, ""Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks!"" They want you to purge. They want you to give them something to attack. And you well know, once they've got their spiritual ""foot in the door,"" they'll use their spiritual crowbar to force you to open up! You know that it's what they've been trained to do! Do not unlock the ""door to your heart!""

The key points to remember are:

Don't engage! Don't Engage! and Do Not Engage!

You have your truth, they have theirs! Don't tell them your truth! Don't even allude to it. Keep things vague! Let them do the talking! It's an awkward situation and the reality is that they're probably just as weak in the knees as you! Use that to your advantage!

If they play the, ""You're hurting everyone who dearly loves you by leaving or staying away"" card, again, don't let them play it! You weren't born or put on this earth to please others! You have a right to live your life in the manner that you want!!! Not what 11 men in upstate New York or the elders, or the person you're speaking to want and/or expect you to live! And don't chastise them with that! Use it as a basis to explain the principle that you prefer to have other priorities and have your own personal relationship with God, even if you don't really even believe anymore. And don't feel guilty for lying, they do it all the time! It's called ""Spiriual Warfare!"" You're still a loving, caring person! If God wants to kill you for not cleaning His toilets, not wiping His tables at assembly halls, not hawking His business cards at His little carts, not parroting what His magazines say at His meetings and not waking people up on Saturday mornings to preach ""THE MESSAGE,"" He can knock Himself out, right? Again, I wouldn't mention that part, either...their eyes tend to widen very much when you do that.

You have no desire to be a source of discouragement or plant doubts in anybody's mind! They will counter with, ""Oh (chortle or gaffaw), You'll never plant doubts in my mind!!!"" Simply reply, ""You know, I used to say that too!"" ""What doubts do you have?"", they'll ask. Do not engage! You don't want to talk about it!!!

If they continue and you're getting antsy or have had enough, conclude. ""Listen, so good to see you, again! I've really got to go!"" Give them a big hug if it's appropriate!

They will usually conclude with, ""Let's have coffee sometime!"" We must catch up!"" You simply reply, ""Yeah, I'll call you! Bye."" And leave. Then never call them!

There. Esay Peasy! You were nice to them. You have no regrets about having said something they can nail you with, later on. You were civil and kind. You have no regrets that you left them in tears. You're not patting yourself on the back for leaving them with something to think about. And you're not feeling like a schmuck because if you had only said this or that and you're not beating yourself up because you couldn't remember that great scripture that would bring them to their knees. And you gave them no ammunition to go back to the elders with, start viscous rumors about you or any reason to consider you in a bad light.

I know this doesn't cover everything that might be said or done. It's part and parcel of leaving; it's going to happen! Don't bother rehearsing what you will say. It's a waste of time. It will only result in, ""Yeah buts?"" and What abouts?"" They're actually no different than speaking with a born again, really! Just remember, ""DO NOT ENGAGE!!! Don't give them any ammunition to weasel their way into your heart and mind. 

That's what I do and it seems to work, for me, your milage may vary. Best hopes and wishes!!!

Flame away! Or offer more suggestions!

Memecoins relying on KOLs are the reason so many are dying rn. A KOL only has so much reach whilst a community has an infinite reach, once a coin reliant on a KOL runs out of steam, they will drop off and essentially die, whilst a coin backed by a solid community can weather any storm and keep pushing on constantly. I’m not saying you can’t make money on a KOL coin because that’s not true, but earning potential and chance of earning goes up so much when choosing “cult” coins. Kendu has arguably the strongest community in crypto rn and here’s evidence:

* Social media efforts that rival the very best in the space with absolutely insane presence on Reddit, X and Stocktwits
* An unprecedented number of IRL products like energy drinks, coffee and beer
* The 2nd coin to ever reach 50K Certik votes, the only other coin to manage this was Pepe.
* Certik community score of 93.07 this is the highest score I have seen and all under 25 million market cap
* Attended 3 Florida Festivals 
* Kendu Entertainment in India hosts a Pickleball tournament and a running club
* Kendu is winning on both the social media and IRL realm which is gonna be so attractive for retail and we’ve all seen how big the retail wave is
* Has a HHI score of 39
* 18.5k holders under 25 million market cap

A lot of research has been done(not by me lol) into successful memecoins in the past and it is clear to see that community strength is by far the most important indicator of how well a memecoin will perform. To me it is very clear that Kendu has the strongest community in the space rn and we are doing this under 20 million market cap, like this is completely unheard of and you can buy it at such a discounted price. If we’re being honest not many people would’ve bought Shib at 20 million market cap, we would’ve faded it, that’s why you see so many Shib regret stories. Don’t be that guy talking about how he missed Kendu as he gets the bus to work, instead be the guy talking about how he bought Kendu and is now driving a Bentley. Do your research as always, join our telegram and join the strongest community in crypto. Why? Because we all know where Kendu is going…

I am a Psych Nurse Practitioner starting in a new practice location (Wisconsin, FWIW). One of my national organizations recently posted a CE course on ""Creating Sacred Space for Transgender and Gender-Expansive People."" It was all about putting up glitter rainbows, displaying flags and coffee cups and trinkets and ... oh my. Personally as an older bi-cis-woman, it just all felt so ... patronizing.



IDK, it just feels kind of wrong to me to be expected to ""fly the flag"" to identify my office as a safe space for our community. Many of my straight colleagues think it's the ""in thing"" to do, but to me it feels cartoonish and shallow. Don't get me wrong, you would have no doubt as to where I stand (and who I am) if you saw my car's bumper stickers.

I managed 15 days without it, then I relapsed, and today is Day One again.

When I went back to drinking coffee, I felt my anxiety spike (which is why I’d quit in the first place), but something odd happened: my libido went up when I started drinking coffee again.

My question is: does coffee really boost libido? Or was my libido low simply because my brain/body was missing caffeine during those days without coffee?

Now I’m torn about quitting or not, because while coffee gives me anxiety and seriously messes with my sleep, this “libido effect” left me impressed.

I have an HP laptop with a USB C port. I have connected a USB C to HDMI socket adaptor to the laptop. I then plug in a HDMI cable to connect it to my home cinema system AVR-X2200W Denon.

The picture works fine. If I play something on my laptop the video plays fine on this setup. But the sound doesn't work.

Some info:

==

edit more info: the usb C output does work for driving an external monitor - i have a monitor which accepts usb c input. so the usb c port does support audio and video out.

==

In the past I have rune the same system with a windows laptop and that worked fine for audio and video with exactly the same kit.

The same equipment also works fine for audio and video out from a macbook to my home cinema system. (same adaptor same cable same home cinema).

It seems to be the case that it only doesn't work on linux.

I liked a guy for 2 years before, he was my feiw d and we were classmates.

He’s the type na super nonchalant and hard to get. He’s also very good looking and also reserved—that’s why I liked him before because I was curious.

Fast forward, we were teased na by out friends for months and eventually he invited me for coffee (na kami lang dalawa)

On our second casual date, we went to my condo (kasi umuulan) and also my other girl na friend were also there. He tried to take advantage of me and ako tulog tulogan lang kasi I was confused and akala ko wala lang yun. The day, he ghosted me (literally) and after sharing that experience to my friends, ang sabi lang nila na “may gusto siyang makuha sayo” and I was really devastated. Months forward, it turns out he was sharing stories na pala to my other friends, idk what stories but I know it was bad. Some of my friends on that “friend group” hang out and went to a coffee shop. They were posting it everywhere (ig, ig dump, locket) with a background music na “Good Graces” by Sabrina lol

How did I know na he was telling shit about me? Because there was one time 5 months later, I had a chance to talk to a friend (on that friend group) personally and ang masasabi niya lang is “di kami same page ni guy” and basically wala siyang pake saakon lol. Sinabihan niya pa ang friends namin from that group na “alam ko mali ginawa ko sakanya, basta friends parin tayo ha”

The hard part is, my so-cold-friends is intentionally ignoring me. When I messaged them di nila ako ni rereplyan (lahat sila) and I greeted my friend last time kasi birthday niya, di niya ako nireplayan and few moments later, she posted a story na she hosted a birthday party, with that guy who traumatized me and out “friends” without me :-) kakahiya lang on my part kasi I greeted her tapos yun pala she was on a party without me

Now? I feel so lonely pero I’m trying to enjoy my own company now. I recently had a friendship breakup last month with my bestfriend because she keeps on crossing my boundaries numerous times and also disrespected me.

People say I’m really kind and friendly man daw, but why do it seem like everyone has a friend—except me? What did I do?

1ly1z5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1ly1z5t/what_is_the_most_walkable_part_of_manhattan/,What is the most walkable part of Manhattan?,"Living in New York for the past 8 years has taught me a lot about the city's most walkable areas. Manhattan, in particular, stands out with several neighborhoods that are perfect for exploring on foot.

The West Village is hands down the most walkable part of Manhattan. Its charm lies in the tree-lined streets, historic brownstones, and the way the grid system breaks into smaller, more intimate streets. I love how you can stumble upon hidden coffee shops and boutiques just by taking random turns.

Chelsea comes in as a close second. The High Line elevated park offers a unique walking experience, and you can easily connect to Hudson Yards or the Meatpacking District. The area is packed with art galleries, restaurants, and the famous Chelsea Market.

Lower Manhattan deserves special mention. The Financial District, while busy during weekdays, offers incredible walking opportunities on weekends. You can cover major attractions like Wall Street, the 9/11 Memorial, and Battery Park in one afternoon.

Speaking of attractions, I recently discovered an amazing way to see these areas from a different perspective. Last month, I took a Manhattan helicopter tour that gave me a bird's-eye view of all these walkable neighborhoods. It was incredible seeing how these areas connect and flow into each other from above. If you're interested in experiencing this perspective yourself, you can book the tour here: https://athometouch.com/Manhattan

The Upper West Side is another walker's paradise, especially around Central Park. The wide sidewalks and abundant crosswalks make it easy to navigate, and there's always something interesting to see, from street performers to local markets.

Some practical tips for walking in Manhattan:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Keep right on sidewalks
- Use Google Maps for accurate walking times
- Take advantage of pedestrian plazas
- Stay hydrated, especially in summer

While most of Manhattan is relatively walkable, I'd say these areas stand out for their pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, safety, and interesting things to see along the way. The density of attractions, restaurants, and shops makes walking not just practical but enjoyable.

Remember that walking is the best way to discover hidden gems and really experience the city's energy. You'll find that most destinations within these neighborhoods are within a 15-20 minute walk of each other.

What makes Manhattan truly special is how each walkable neighborhood has its own distinct character while seamlessly connecting to the next. Whether you're a local or visitor, exploring these areas on foot gives you the most authentic New York experience.",1,1752331010.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

1ly1u1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1ly1u1k/does_the_sharp_smd2470as_microwave_combine_style/,Does the Sharp SMD2470AS Microwave Combine Style and Efficiency?,"Testing out the Sharp SMD2470AS was an experience that really brought some modern flair to my kitchen. The idea of switching to a drawer-style microwave intrigued me from the start, and I’ve been putting it to use daily to see what it’s all about. This model combines sleek design with impressive functionality but isn’t without its quirks. I've used it for everything from thawing frozen leftovers to reheating coffee and experimenting with its sensor cooking modes, trying to push it to its limits.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Sharp SMD2470AS genuinely stands out with its seamless stainless steel finish. It’s not your standard countertop microwave—instead, it’s designed to be built into your cabinetry, which is perfect for modern, space-conscious kitchens. I found the drawer design incredibly convenient since you pull it out to load or grab your food without awkward bending over. The concealed control panel that tilts out at a 45-degree angle is brilliant for visibility and ease of use. While the microwave feels sturdy overall, weighing in at a hefty 74 pounds, installation might require a professional or at least a strong helping hand.

**Ease of Use**  
What impressed me most about this microwave was the Easy Touch Automatic Drawer System. It glided open smoothly with the mere touch of a button and closed hands-free. Reheating my meals has never been this fancy before! The interior is spacious enough to fit a 9"" x 13"" dish comfortably, making it perfect for casseroles or family-sized servings. However, the control panel does take a bit of getting used to. While it’s clear and straightforward, the buttons aren’t as responsive as I would’ve liked for a product in this price range.  

**Strengths**  
- The sleek, stainless steel design matches most modern kitchens seamlessly.  
- Drawer-style design eliminates the need to bend over.  
- Spacious enough for larger dishes, making it ideal for families or hosting events.  
- Easy Touch Drawer System ensures the drawer opens and closes hassle-free.  

[Check Sharp SMD2470AS price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b00u6yfoz6/)

**Shortcomings**  
Despite all its upsides, there are some areas where this microwave falls short. The unit is somewhat bulky, so make sure you have an appropriate, designated space for installation. Its auto defrost feature worked well but seemed to be slower compared to some other microwaves I’ve tried. Additionally, the lack of convection cooking could potentially deter some users looking for a more versatile appliance.

- The control panel buttons can feel slightly unresponsive.  
- Auto defrost takes longer than expected compared to competing models.  
- Limited flexibility since it doesn’t support convection cooking.

**Performance and Features**  
Performance-wise, the Sharp microwave drawer does a fantastic job with its core tasks. Its 950 watts of power heat evenly, whether I was warming up soup or cooking baked potatoes. The sensor cook feature was a standout for me—detecting the exact time and power level for cooking different foods. It’s especially good when you’re unsure about how long to reheat something. However, I did notice it took a tiny bit longer than standard microwaves to cook items. The auto defrost is helpful for frozen meats, though it’s not groundbreaking or exceedingly fast.   

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this microwave drawer to a similar model like the Bosch HMD8053UC, the Sharp excels in offering simpler usability and a cleaner design. The Bosch option might appeal to those looking for slightly more power (at 950 watts vs. Bosch's 1,000 watts), but from my testing, I found the drawer function on the Sharp to be smoother and easier to operate. On the downside, other brands like Panasonic offer countertop alternatives with built-in convection options, which Sharp lacks. However, those tend to look clunkier and take up more counter space, so there’s a trade-off here.    

**Price Performance**  
At its price point, the Sharp SMD2470AS feels like a premium option, with its modern design and solid feature set. While certainly more expensive than standard microwaves, it’s fair to say you’re paying for the drawer functionality and aesthetic appeal. If you’re looking for something unique that complements a high-end kitchen setup, it’s worth the investment. For those on tighter budgets, though, countertop microwaves offer many comparable features for significantly lower costs.

1ly1shj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ly1shj/aitah_for_confronting_fiancé_about_his_sisters/,AITAH for confronting fiancé about his sister's behavior. She's so touchy towards him,"Me 28(F) have been engaged to my fiancé 30(M) for two years, been together for four years. Ever since I met his sister I felt this weird vibe about her that something is off. Let's call her... Karen. 
Everything started ever since we met. It was four years ago during Christmas break. She came from Germany where she lives and works as a neurosurgeon (it's important for the rest of the story). My fiance then boyfriend picked me up with the car to drop his sister at their grandparents so we can continue with our trip. So I got in the car and she was in front. No biggie for me. I said hi, introduced myself, because my then boyfriend didn't say anything. She only said hi. Nothing more, nothing less. It was a very awkward two hours car ride. But anyway, we dropped her off and that was it. A few days later we picked her up from grandparents house and the situation was the same, just ""Hi"" and that's it. She got back to Germany. My then boyfriend said that she works there as a neurosurgeon, she has a busy schedule and visits once in every three or four months. 
Next time she came was in late spring. At the same time I had to go through surgery because of cancerous cells. My boyfriend was at work that day and asked his mom to come with me so she could help me getting home after the procedure (his mom is super kind). Everything was fine, I was waiting for the Obgyn. Then her phone rang. It was her daughter. I could practically hear her daughter shouting ""Leave her there and come home. She doesn't deserve anything"". Her mom didn't say anything.I kept my cool, didn't say a word, not even to my boyfriend. The surgery went well and I was released two hours later. I felt so crappy thanks to the anesthesia that I could barely keep my eyes opened. Imagine me being left alone. At that time she was visiting we didn't interact. Thank God. Year and so later my boyfriend proposed and I said yes. We were so happy!!! He called everyone, every conversation was on speaker so we can tell everybody. Except for his sister. I kept my cool like I wasn't bothered. A few months later she visits again with her fiancee. He was keeping his distance when it came to me. No talking, no eye contact. They both treated me the same way. I was okay, I was on good terms with their mom and dad (he has brain cancer, important for the rest of the story). We went on a trip together because it was my fiancé's birthday. Again, his sister's visit was short. But every time we were out with her, she didn't look at me, not saying a word. Not even a hi. Every time we sat at a bar or coffee his sister would pick a table with only three chairs - for their mom, for herself and my fiance. Not for me. So I had to drag a chair for myself. Every time we sat at the dinner table she looked at like I was gross or something. Every time I felt unwanted there. Four months ago she visited again because their dad is getting worse and because of medical history and his condition we know that surgery won't help. Which is leaving me heartbroken, because my dad died from cancer when I was 2 years old. His sister's behavior though was horrible. We sat at this bar one day and me and fiance were waiting for her. He was looking at me all lovey dovey and I was happy. But when his sister sat he pulled away from me like I wasn't there. His sister on the other hand was caressing him in not a sister/brother way. It made me few uncomfortable. This happened before, but not like that. There were a few touches from her side, but that particular time she couldn't keep her hands off of him. I'm not the jealous type. But sure it was uncomfortable. Even the girl who worked at the bar (we know each other) looked at her in a weird way. I didn't say anything, my fiance acted normal. 
Yesterday she came again. With her now husband. I work at a restaurant and her husband, herself and my fiance came to have dinner here. I took their order and my fiancé said ""come sit with us"". But surprise surprise his sister sat at a three people table at the corner. The three of them had their dinner, not even once my boyfriend pulled a chair for me. The people I work with looked at me with pity. No, I don't want pity. I just wanted the night to end. Guess what? The three of them left without saying goodbye. I honestly felt heartbroken. I barely kept my tears, buy managed to stay calm. One of our customers asked me ""WTF? Why are they treating you like a dog?"" And he was right. A few hours later fiancé came to pick me up from work and I decided to confront him, because I kept myself quiet for four years. I asked him what was that all about? Why was the ignorantion at the same time he told me to sit with them? 
His answer was: I can't remember what I told you, because I'm so tired from work. I'm sorry though, it wasn't on purpose."" And I was livid!!! I looked at him with pure rage and yelled at him: you can't remember? Like... how? It wasn't on purpose but your sister is treating me like sh!t ever since we met. And let's not forget the last time at the bar where she was touching you in a way that is not normal. His response was: my sister is weird. I never thought about behavior, I care about you. But I don't want to talk to her, because she's my sister and she only visits four times a year.""
Like I'd believe that crap. 
You know what the worst part is? I am helping his mom taking care of his dad. I missed an important university exam, because for me family is above everything!! His sister knows that, my fiance knows that and the way they thanked me was absolutely priceless. Let's not forget the fact that I also do all his college work and exams because they are all online. 
So Am I the A-hole for confronting that idiot and what should I do, because apparently a conversation doesn't work...

1ly1q2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1ly1q2f/trip_report_oahu/,Trip Report - Oahu,"This was my first time visiting Oahu, I went to Maui 25 years ago. We couldn’t decide on a hotel vs condo due to the crazy parking fees at hotels. We like to keep accommodations reasonable so we can spend more on activities. We finally settled on a condo at Marine Surf since it included a free assigned parking spot. We found if we rented a car for the week (6 days) through Little Hawaii Rentals it was only $239, much cheaper than renting a car by the day for a few days. It was so easy jumping in the car to do our exploring and returning back no fuss. We were able to do laundry too which was needed. Here is what we did day by day:

**Monday:** Arrived at 10:00am, picked up the car and went straight to Pearl Harbor. We put ourselves on the waitlist for the Arizona ferry and went through the museums until we were called about 1.5 hours later. Then we went to Walmart to pick up some groceries and a few souvenirs. We checked into the condo and rested. We had a green frappe at Nanas Green Tea at the Stix Asian marketplace, very good. We explored a bit and had tacos for dinner at Surf and Turf Tacos across from International marketplace. These tacos were huge, excellent.

**Tuesday****:**  We walked around Waikiki in the morning and hiked Diamond Head. We had purchased the Guide Along app to tour the island, best $15 we spent. Using the audio tour we drove up to Lanikai and Kailua beaches. Did not care for Lanikai, parking was hard and the beach is small and sand is coarse. We stayed about 30 minutes and headed over to Kailua beach. Big beach, parking was good and the sand was nice and soft. We stopped at all the sites including the Halona blowhole, then L&L for lunch. It was so-so. We had dinner at Hula Grill in the bar area, excellent burgers.

**Wednesday**: We went to the Aloha Swap Meet, I wouldn’t do it again. Bought a couple cheap items but it was mostly the same stuff from China that everyone sells except for a few local vendors. Using our audio tour again we stopped at Dole Plantation, had a Dole Whip there. Went up to Haleiwa and stopped at Camaron original truck for garlic shrimp and coconut shrimp. It was decent. Also stopped at Giovanni shrimp truck for spicy shrimp. We thought the shrimp trucks were a bit overrated for what you got. For dinner we ate at Udon in the Stix Asian marketplace. It was pretty good.

**Thursday****:** We spent the morning on Kuhio beach, bigger and less crowded than Waikiki proper. Watched the surfers and relaxed. We had booked the Shangri-La museum tour for the afternoon. We really enjoyed it, the grounds and artifacts were beautiful. We had lunch at Paia, it was good and casual. For dinner it was Doraku, portions were smaller but quality was good.

**Friday****:** Headed to check out Ko’Olina area. No parking at the pools, so we parked at a shopping plaza across from the Disney resort. Disney resort has a nice pool area but crowded. Had a quick bite at the ABC store/café. I didn’t care much for the area since it’s so far removed from everything else. Stopped at the Punchbowl crater. Drove up north and had Matsumoto shave ice. Went to Waimea valley and walked to the waterfall then stayed for the Toa luau. This was a highlight for us, family owned smaller luau, we had a great time.

**Saturday**: Went to Kualoa Ranch for the Jurassic Tour, loved it! What a beautiful area. Stopped at Yummy Huli Huli for a chicken lunch. Went to Byodo Temple briefly. Dinner at Monkeypod, it was ok.

**Sunday**: We stopped at the Islamic center, Costco for local goodies and had lunch at Rainbow Drive In (really good) and back to the airport for our goodbye.

In general we found food to be unremarkable. We are not “poke” people but I’m sure that is really good in Hawaii. We don’t like spending $50-100 a plate on meals so maybe the pricy items were better. It's just not us. We also didn't have good coffee. Kona coffee purveyors always had a huge line so we skipped it. Heavenly had decent coffee though. I would have built in more relaxation time if I was to do it again, we had a packed schedule. But we did get to see the whole island which is beautiful!",6,1752330346.0,VisitingHawaii,1,1.0,False

I liked a guy for 2 years before, he was my feiw d and we were classmates.

He’s the type na super nonchalant and hard to get. He’s also very good looking and also reserved—that’s why I liked him before because I was curious.

Fast forward, we were teased na by out friends for months and eventually he invited me for coffee (na kami lang dalawa)

On our second casual date, we went to my condo (kasi umuulan) and also my other girl na friend were also there. He tried to take advantage of me and ako tulog tulogan lang kasi I was confused and akala ko wala lang yun. The day, he ghosted me (literally) and after sharing that experience to my friends, ang sabi lang nila na “may gusto siyang makuha sayo” and I was really devastated. Months forward, it turns out he was sharing stories na pala to my other friends, idk what stories but I know it was bad. Some of my friends on that “friend group” hang out and went to a coffee shop. They were posting it everywhere (ig, ig dump, locket) with a background music na “Good Graces” by Sabrina lol

How did I know na he was telling shit about me? Because there was one time 5 months later, I had a chance to talk to a friend (on that friend group) personally and ang masasabi niya lang is “di kami same page ni guy” and basically wala siyang pake saakon lol. Sinabihan niya pa ang friends namin from that group na “alam ko mali ginawa ko sakanya, basta friends parin tayo ha”

The hard part is, my so-cold-friends is intentionally ignoring me. When I messaged them di nila ako ni rereplyan (lahat sila) and I greeted my friend last time kasi birthday niya, di niya ako nireplayan and few moments later, she posted a story na she hosted a birthday party, with that guy who traumatized me and out “friends” without me :-) kakahiya lang on my part kasi I greeted her tapos yun pala she was on a party without me

Now? I feel so lonely pero I’m trying to enjoy my own company now. I recently had a friendship breakup last month with my bestfriend because she keeps on crossing my boundaries numerous times and also disrespected me.

People say I’m really kind and friendly man daw, but why do it seem like everyone has a friend—except me? What did I do?

She and I were in an argument a few weeks ago and were going a few days without talking. While she was at work one of the days we weren’t talking, I noticed a text come through on her iPad that sits on our coffee table from her boyfriend saying something along the lines of “(my name) will come through eventually”. I saw my name and that didn’t bother me because I’m sure she rants to her people about me just like I rant to my people about her, but the second text I saw from him said “yeah she sounds like she is” and I just needed to know what was being said about me. I look through these texts and it’s just her completely demeaning me and actually calling me a bitch to her boyfriend. I haven’t said anything to her about this because I know I invaded her privacy and that I’m in the wrong. Now that it’s been a few weeks, we’re in another argument again and she can hear me crying from my room and asked me if there’s something going on in my head that I need to get off my chest. I told her no that I’m fine, but in reality, I’m so sad and upset and I just know she’ll be demeaning me in her texts again and I know I’ll be thinking that every argument now. I even went to my own texts and searched for the word “bitch” and in all my rantings to my friends about my mom, I’ve never ONCE called her that.

I liked a guy for 2 years before, he was my feiw d and we were classmates. 

He’s the type na super nonchalant and hard to get. He’s also very good looking and also reserved—that’s why I liked him before because I was curious.

Fast forward, we were teased na by out friends for months and eventually he invited me for coffee (na kami lang dalawa) 

On our second casual date, we went to my condo (cause it was raining) and also my other girl na friend were also there. He tried to take advantage of me and since I was overwhelmed and confused, I just pretended to sleep. The next day, he ghosted me (LITERALLY), I was messaging him telling that I don’t want this be a reason to cause conflict in our friendship and our friend group, but he still ghosted. After sharing that experience to my friends, they kept on telling me that he just want to get something from me and I was really devastated—because I was genuine. Months forward, it turns out he was sharing stories na to my other friends, idk what stories but I know it was bad. Some of my friends on that “friend group” hang out and went to a coffee shop. They were posting it everywhere (ig, ig dump, locket, intimate accounts) with a background music “Good Graces” by Sabrina lol

How did I know na he was telling shit about me? Because there was one time 5 months later, I had a chance to talk to a friend (on that friend group) personally and ang she told me that me and that guy were just not on the same page and basically he doesn’t give a shit about me. He also told all of our friends in that friend group that “I know I did her bad, but were still friends right?” And my so cold friends were still friends with him. 


The hard part is, my so-called-friends ate intentionally ignoring me. When I messaged them they don’t reply and when I greeted a “close” friend of mine from that group, she ignored me and moments later, she posted a story in a birthday party that she hosted WITH THAT GUY and with some of our friends without me :) I felt degraded because of it. I’m also experiencing a friendship breakup with my ex-best friend because she also disrespected me. I don’t know what how to cope, but I’m in therapy now. I just feel really alone.


People say I’m really kind and friendly, but why do it seem like everyone has a friend—except me? What did I do? 

I just want to express this and hope you’ll respect my post :) ",2,1752330002.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False
