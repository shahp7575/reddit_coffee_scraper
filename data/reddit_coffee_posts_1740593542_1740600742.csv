Very few FB, still early on in finding out what I like. I love clean scents, fig and tea notes, less sweet gourmands. I don't like lavender (usually), coffee, smoky/tobacco or sandalwood (the pickle thing).

Collection l-r : Bianco Latte, Ariana Grande - Lovenotes Pink Woods (love!), Kayali - Yum boujee marshmallow, Ellis Brooklyn - Sunfruit, Kayali - Pistachio Gelato, Sand + Fog - Violet sandalwood, BBW - Guilty as Fig, Sand+ Fog - Jasmine Cedarwood, Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere (love), Chanel - Coco Mademoiselle (sometimes love it but only in cold months), Mugler Alien Goddess (meh), Gucci - Bamboo (love, I should buy a FB because I think it's being discontinued), Dolly Parton - Scent from Above (don't like, but the bottle is so pretty and I adore Dolly), Sand + Fog - Pistachio Dream (really good but too sweet), Sand + Fog - Vanilla Musk, Replica - Beach Walk (I like it but it fades in like 30 minutes), Rare Beauty -Pure Comfort (this is really nice. I layer with Pink Woods to make it last longer), Korres - Bellflower (love, this is a sister to Burberry the Beat which was my absolute favorite but is dc and so is this one üò≠), BDK - Gris Charnel (my favorite of all the fig and tea scents, just perfect but a little too heavy for summer), Burberry - Brit (I love this house, but like the EDT more), Ellis Brooklyn - Myth (nice but becomes a skin scent and disappears almost immediately),  Nest - Indigo (Love, love love it but it's almost too much of something for every day. And it is too much for summer), Nest - Lychee Rose (Rose isn't normally something I look for but this is really well done and not too grandma with the lychee), Lake and Sky 11 11 (really like this as a skin scent, going to try vanilla to see if it brings the screechy opening down a bit). Another one I have not on Fragrantica is Beauty Pie - Brazilian Lime, Green Tea and Fig (amazing but the lime is SO overpowering for the first hour, if the lime were like half the strength and the fig up a notch it would be perfect).

First time making something like this. I learned yesterday that plasticard can be bonded with cement so i got a hunger to try it out.

Up until now I've mainly been a space wolf (and occasionally death guard) player since early 8th, I've always fancied making a speedfreaks force but from my own conversions.

I went to hobby craft today and saw a vw beetle, I checked online and apparently 1:32 scale is good for ork conversions.

Spent the day experimenting with trying to convert this thing and really happy with how it's turned out. Tomorrow I'll start on the paint job :)

Fine, I'll share mine.

I recently moved into a new flat. Not long after, I met one of my neighbors‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Daniel. He‚Äôs one of those people who are complicated and never explain anything simply (I needed his help with electricity), yet he‚Äôs nice enough to have a coffee with. He also has some anger issues, though I‚Äôve only seen them surface during our neighborhood meetings.

We were actually in frequent contact about various things, and he was even kind enough to bring me homemade mulled wine and once even soup when I was sick.

Anyway, a few weeks ago, his messages suddenly became weird and even rude. I won‚Äôt go into detail, but I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at first. After a few days of this, he asked me to go for a walk and talk. That made me a bit nervous, so I asked him why‚Äîwhat did he want to talk about? He didn‚Äôt respond.

I went for a walk anyway and met him at a place a bit far from our flats. The moment he saw me, he got mad and asked, **‚ÄúHow did you feel about all those rude messages?‚Äù** I was speechless, so he repeated himself.

I asked him what this was all about, and he said he knew I had been talking shit about him behind his back. I literally hadn‚Äôt, so I asked, **‚ÄúWhen? To whom?‚Äù**

He replied, **‚ÄúThe neighbor above me. I got into an argument with her because her husband makes noise with his gym equipment, and she said that I fight with everyone here.‚Äù**

So I asked, **‚ÄúWait, she said that I told her that??‚Äù** (I was very confused, trust me.)

And he said, **‚ÄúNo, but you‚Äôre the only one I talk to, so it must have been you!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ so just because you and I talk, you assumed it was me?‚Äù**

And he just said, **‚ÄúWell yeah, nobody else could have said that.‚Äù**

So I told him that I was grateful for his help but that I had never said anything about him to that woman‚Äîor anyone at all. I literally just know her name. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt assume things and attack me without even asking first.

It was all so weird. He was angry, cursing, and accusing me of something completely random, and I genuinely didn‚Äôt know how to react.

1iywtvf,https://i.redd.it/5cldpnpeijle1.jpeg,Ever heard about metaphysical painting ? [DISCUSSION],"
It's a painting movement (pre-surrealism) mixing Renaissance and modernism, roughly. These paintings are from De Chirico, a representative of the movement, born in 1888. Most of them were Italians. Collage became popular with Dadaism, around the same period, in France. So they wanted to create the same kind of thing, mixing past and present day, but the Italians wanted to keep the art true to the end of their paintbrush, and the French thought ""f the rules, let's paste newspapers together, call it a day, and drink coffee and wine"", which was the point of Dadaism: breaking the art rules.

There is none. I‚Äôm not collecting data, running a paid service, or monetizing anything (except for a small Buy Me a Coffee link if people want to support my work). Everything I build is 100% open source and free to use.

I‚Äôm a seasoned engineer who has worked on all kinds of projects, but I‚Äôve never built for marketing before. I see this as a great way to learn, experiment with AI in marketing, and create genuinely useful tools for the community. Plus, I love developing in my spare time!

So, what‚Äôs something in email marketing, growth hacking, analytics, automation, or AI-driven marketing that you wish had a free tool? Any pain points where AI could help? I'd love to hear your ideas and see if I can build something valuable for everyone.

Not to add create job opportunities to whoever studies nutrition to calculate the calories of each restaurant, coffee house, etc. yes more costs to the restaurants but what is a 50-100jd one time pay to nutritionists will harm your business income.

1iywlp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1iywlp4/5_things_i_learned_as_an_xr_dev_20242025_ver/,5 Things I learned as an XR Dev 2024~2025 ver.,"I became a full-time XR dev a few years back, post-COVID and a bit earlier due to the massive tech corporate layoffs. That triggered me into wondering what the hell I was supposed to do...... So began my journey in building my own XR project, got my first AI security guard that would chase me, got my first Mixed Reality furniture virtual placement project, and got my first lots of things (do I cite my own source...?)

Here are 5 tips on how to become a better XR dev (if you're interested). Some of it also applies to other things in life, but I am going to focus on what made me better and the things I'd like to share

¬†

* **You don't need a VR headset to start as an XR dev.** Surprise surprise, as long as you have something to develop on, whether it is a laptop or a desktop, you don't need to have a headset for development. A lot of simulations, software, and engines these days offer extended interaction for these specific limitations. Not every Vision Pro developer has a VP, not all Snappable devs have a snap goggle. Don't corner yourself just yet, start building it and maybe things will magically work out! Disclaimer. It is definitely easier to build with the headset you want to develop on, but it is not a must when you first start. Don't be limited by your own imagination

* **Have a rubber duck.** Here's the lovely link: [the duckling website](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) Talk to your rubber duck, John Cena, your chibi, or your invisible friend Steve. Your rubber duck helps you reflect your current state of mind. Talk to it, no really, physically open your mouth and talk to him. He is your witness for your imposter syndrome too. Let Steve watch you become better

* **It is okay to be imperfect.** Whether it is building a project of your passion, or creating something from work. it is completely normal to feel like you haven't perfected it. If you do manage to make a perfect project, CONGRATS!! I AM PROUD OF YOU TOO!! Don't let me sway you otherwise, you are doing great and keep that up!! But if by any chance you are not feeling the right click, it is completely okay as well!! Talk to your ducklings, let them be the judge and witness

* **Start by writing something.** More often than not the biggest barrier is yourself and your doubts. What should I build? What engine is better? Unity? Unreal? Godot...? (My current favourite engine, but I'm ass at it). What language should I use? How do I write shaders? Find something you like, say driving cars. Okay, how do you make an object? Let's start there. Beautiful, now you are ready to make the next little thing. Move it. Congrats, you wrote something! Take a break from time to time, talk to Steve. There, you are becoming a dev!

* **Be agile.** XR especially is having insane updates as of late. Google/ Samsung is releasing its own headset with Android XR software, Meta is confusing on its Horizon OS, Apple has Vision OS, and then Snapchat, Immersed/ Qualcomm, Magic Leap (yes, this company still exist)...... Don't be afraid to think outside the box, always prepare for a new iteration (unless you are the dude who's building the new version), and most importantly, never never abandon your ducklings

¬†

These are the five pieces of advice I heard from various sources and eventually took to heart as an XR dev. When I first started my XR journey, the shipping for Quest 2 was weeks away (I think the FedEx or Amazon lads were on strike or something), so I built my AI bot in VR without a headset. Subsequently an AI Jarvis that I can trigger voice command, virtual hand grab, controller grab, etc. All in my VR project. I didn't use a headset either. [This is my Notion page to prove that I built what I said I did](https://www.notion.so/jimmyding/Jimmy-s-Portfolio-05157e8290e5447fb4b22b3cae202b0d). Building these things without a headset is far from easy, but I did it and I believe anyone else can as well. Google, YouTube, and even ChatGPT (only use it when you are 1. absolutely clueless on how to make it work and need some guidance 2. too lazy to write all the for loops) will help you start off quite smoothly. Ultimately you will learn enough to start your own logic, math, and pain. But before that, be agile and learn from everyone and everything

  
I don't know how much is considered as ""excessive self promotion"", because I was banned 7 days from r/OculusQuest for offering my discord link in a comment.

*   **Device Compatibility:** Make sure the **mini power‚Äã bank** is compatible with your devices. Most‚Å§ modern ‚Äãpower banks support both iPhones and Android devices, but ‚Å§it‚Äôs‚Å£ always best to double-check.Look‚Å£ for a **mini power bank for iPhone** or a **mini power bank ‚Äãfor Android**, or one that clearly states worldwide compatibility.
*   **Charging ‚ÄåSpeed:**‚Äå Do you need a **fast ‚Äãcharging mini power bank**? Look for power banks that support ‚Å§quick charge technologies like USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) or Quick Charge (QC). These technologies can significantly reduce charging times for compatible devices.
* ‚Å§  **Capacity ‚Å¢(mAh):** ‚Å¢The capacity of a‚Å£ power bank is measured in milliampere-hours ‚Äå(mAh). A higher‚Å¢ mAh ‚Äçrating means more‚Äç charging capacity. Consider how many‚Å£ times you need to ‚Äåcharge your phone on a single charge cycle. A larger‚Å¢ mAh will typically mean a ‚Äãlarger overall size.
*   **Ports:** ‚ÄãHow many devices do‚Å¢ you need to charge concurrently? some **mini portable power banks** have multiple ports, allowing you to ‚Äçcharge your ‚Äçphone, headphones, ‚Äåor other ‚Äãdevices at the same time.‚Å§ Also, consider the type of ports ‚Äì USB-A, USB-C (**USB-C‚Å¢ mini‚Å¢ power bank**), or ‚Å£both.

So I started a new job as a barista in a small family owned coffee shop and just had a first shift. I also had a trial shift the other day for a couple of hours. I am expected to go tomorrow to another coffee shop they own that is completely different and work and close by myself. I will have someone in the morning for around an hour to show me around, but after that I am completely alone. Today was my first close as well and I tried my best to remember everything. The manager just gave me keys for another shop and said to just message if I have some questions. I am very nervous because this is my very first experience working in a coffee shop setting. I worked as a bartender for a long time and I've made coffee before but I feel this is different. I've tried to remember everything today so that I can work tommorow alone. I think it would be so much easier if they just gave me a week to kind of get used to everything and do some closes with another person, so that I feel more confident. Also, the person who was showing my around today wasn't really explaining anything and if I didn't ask how things are supposed to be done, they wouldn't even bother to explain. 
Also, we sell some pastries and toasties so I also need to heat those up when someone asks which will also take time. Manager first told me thaf it shouldn't be busy at this time of week but that it also could be. So I don't even know what to think and expect.
So my question is, is this completely normal for a coffee shop or is this kind of a red flag? I don't know if I am just overreacting because I just started the job but in my past workplaces, I would always have someone on open/close for the first week until I kind of get a hang of everything.

I‚Äôve been away from any system for going on a couple of years now, but thought I‚Äôd move in a new direction with this new acquisition:

McIntosh MC7150. Bought this week at an estate sale for $1100 US. It was hooked up and running. It was the only McIntosh product in the system. It came with no original packaging, cables or ‚Äúcase candy‚Äù.

looks to have been well cared for.

The simplest system I can put together will be the 7150, APT Holman preamplifier, Kenwood tuner. For this, and anything more, I‚Äôll need a rack or shelving unit, something I do not have for the space this will now occupy.

I notice that, as it sits on my coffee table, the 7150 does not sit flat; the faceplate elevates the front of the unit somewhat. As this was quite a splurge for me, I don‚Äôt see acquiring bespoke mounting hardware. I‚Äôm thinking I will rest the unit on ‚Äúfeet‚Äù of some sort, like furniture-leg casters, to level it out.

I‚Äôll be looking for a simple cabinet that works in my living room and handles the above mentioned equipment, with maybe room for modest expansion.

Anything I should be aware of?

I‚Äôm handicapped and can‚Äôt lift anything, so can‚Äôt even check what feet this amplifier has. I had it delivered by the seller who put it on my coffee table, and there it sits, until I can have one of my sons over to at least tip it up so I can see what I‚Äôm working with.

Looks like I‚Äôl need shelving that is at least 16‚Äù deep. Amp on its own shelf, pre and tuner can stack on another shelf.

Anyway, this is just an introduction of sorts. My hobby has been to buy and learn about various vintage audio pieces. I‚Äôm recently more into jazz exclusively, but only listening when in my car. Speakers will be Wharfedale W70‚Äôs or Goodmans Maximus 7‚Äôs.

I have access to a higher end power conditioner, graphic equalizer, but don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre something I‚Äôll use. Sony CD changer. Technics turntable, but will not be getting into vinyl. Local jazz station is KCSM.

I had my last straw when one of his Aunties harassed my grieving family and kicked them out of their seats at an event. I am now his family scapegoat, and even my partner is blaming me for his entire family breaking apart. AITAH for sticking up for myself?

Something I (25F) never thought would happen in my life has happened as an in-law. I've become my fiance's (33M) family scapegoat.

It all started 4 years ago when my partner's cousin's girlfriend, ""Lakeisha"" and I had a falling out. We were both 21 at the time and we had gotten very close and I considered her my best friend. After the fall out, we talked on the phone to resolve the situation. I had her on speaker while my partner ""Vance"" listened in. We mutually agreed to give each other space and move on. I suggested to her that we ""break up"" our friendship silently and not involve anyone in Vance's family, because this could affect my partner Vance and his close brotherhood with his cousin ""Tyler"" (Lakeisha's boyfriend).  We mutually agreed to this and Vance heard everything.

Two months later, my mother in-law visited us and told us that Aunty J (Tyler's mom) paid her a visit and told her that me, my fiance, and our kids are not allowed to go over to the family New Years party. Lakeisha not only broke our agreement of not involving the family, but she had begun spreading rumours about me to Vance's entire family. Lakeisha told the family I was a violent and abusive person and I threatened to beat her up if she told the family ""anything I've done to her."" These rumours were completely false and actually reflected her own violent nature (she became violent with me every time she got drunk and I drew the line when she laid hands on me- this led to us breaking up our friendship).

These rumours caught like wildfire, spreading across his huge intertwined family and eventually got back to me and Vance (we were the last to find out). By the time we found out, majority of his family had deleted me off of every social media platform. I immediately texted Lakeisha and called her a liar and that what she just did by involving the family is going to have serious consequences on the relationships between my partner's Mom and her sister, Aunty J. I got a text back saying: ""This is Aunty J. You are to never text or speak to Lakeisha again. There will never be tension between me and my sister. We don't keep secrets in this family.""

I was in utter shock. I've had rumours spread about me in middle school by 14-year-old girls, but I've never experienced blatant lies from an adult. As badly as I wanted to clear my name, I had hope that the truth would rise (it always does) and people would eventually see my true character. They would see that I am not this violent person that Lakeisha has painted me out to be. My partner told me to not engage with his family and let him handle everything. So I followed his lead, and we took the ""high road"" of ignoring the situation and only speaking when someone asks. Nobody really asked. It was a slow, silent cut-off and the only real noise was the floating rumours about me to family, friends and the small community we live in.

My partner and his cousin Tyler stopped being close. This hurt me a lot, because I adored their close relationship. My partner's mom/dad and his aunty/uncle all stopped talking. Everyone in his big family heard the rumours about me and started distancing themselves and ignoring me.

*Sidenote: Aunty J and Tyler have done a ""silent cut off"" to my partner when he was 15. Tyler said Vance was bullying and throwing rocks at him at the bus stop, so Aunty J thought it was appropriate to corner Vance and tell him he is a violent bully and they didn't speak to him for years and intentionally disinvited him from every family event.*

For the next 3.5 years, all 4 of Vance's aunties let me know they hated my guts every chance they got. For years, I endured the following:

* All 4 Aunties glaring at me and looking at me like I'm dirt in public at events (I can count 10+ times)
* Aunty J gave me the dirtiest look with an eye roll, then whispered over to another Aunty B. When this happened, I had endured 8 months of this from other aunties. This made me break down crying to my mother in law because the bullying felt wrong and I was almost at my breaking point where I was going to tell my truth.
* Continuous rumours being spread about my character. I was painted as a dangerous alcoholic and manipulator, a jealous and insecure and controlling partner to my fiance, and the reason why my fiance has nobody in his life. These rumours got to the point where it got to my potential practicum supervisor, the principle, at the local elementary school which inhibited me from doing my practicum there (small community)
* I had one aunty continuously humiliate me by ignoring me when i spoke to her. I will call her Aunty D. I would say ""Hi Aunty D, how are you?"" with a smile on my face and she wouldn't even look at me. I kept doing this (5 times) and even my partner noticed her ignoring me, it was humiliating. This continued until this year when I was working at a community event in the kitchen with her, I addressed her by her name and asked a question and she wouldn't look at me or speak to me. It was awkward, so her daughter answered the question for her.
* Aunty ""M"" in particular spoke to me when i was pregnant and told his family (in front of me) that she believes Lakeisha and alluded to my ""drama"" ripping apart the family. Later on, she sat beside me and talked for a while. She kept asking ""Where's Tyler?"" and i said ""idk."" then she said ""Wait, are you Lakeisha or \_\_\_\_?"" I told her that I am not Lakeisha, then she said ""Oh my gosh! I thought you were Lakeisha this whole time! You guys look so similar!"" and she laughed obnoxiously in my face. (Note: This is my second time ever meeting Aunty M)
* I borrowed a coffee cup from Aunty M's daughter this same day, and for the entire day, every single time she saw me, she reminded me to give back that cup. (4 times). As if I was going to steal a cup.
* When it came to birthday parties, my partner was invited and I wasn't allowed to go. He only attended one birthday party where I wasn't invited, and this hurt me.

I told my partner about every single glare, humiliation, rumour, word spoken to me (or not spoken). Throughout the 3.5 years, my partner never told his aunties that they're not allowed to treat me this way. He never sat down with his cousin and his aunty/uncle and told them the truth and debunked rumours. He never made a public statement on their family Facebook group page (his entire family is active in) to clear up my name or address the bullying I've endured. Vance never once told his family that he listened into our phone call and even he knew Lakeisha was lying and could vouch for me. I became very depressed, anxious, and felt unwelcome in this community. The bullying from his aunties alone drove me to the point of leaving my relationship a few times.

This is when I finally had enough... June 2024.

* we're at a community event and Aunty M is there. This is my 3rd time ever meeting her.
* 1.5 months before this event I lost my mother suddenly and was grieving hard. My grieving family (little sister, little brother, and aunty S) drove 9 hours to come to this event. It was my first time seeing them since the funeral.
* Aunty M stood behind their seats and began harassing them because they were in her way to get to her seats. she even shook one of the seats my sister was sitting on to get them to move.
* When this was happening, I told my partner to do something. He wouldn't. He told me to just wait for his Mom to come and handle it.
* Aunty M continued harassing my family and my little sister tapped my shoulder and had fear in her eyes because she didn't know what to do. I urged my partner to please do something, he still refused. My own aunty S finally got up and told me they were moving seats because ""apparently we're not allowed to sit here""
* I looked at my partner one last time and told him that Aunty M just kicked my family out of their seats. He said ""just wait for my Mom to come here and handle it"".

By this point, I was so tired of the bullying. I endured at least 20 instances of bullying from his family, expecting to keep quiet and this whole time my partner has never stood up for me. I went up to Aunty M and told her very sternly that she had no right to kick my family out of their seats. There was a huge speaker blaring music right beside us so yes, I yelled this.

After I walked away, a close family friend came up to me and applauded me. She said, ""Stand your ground. Remember that you are a strong Indigenous woman and don't let anyone disrespect you. Aunty M is a bully. She has always been a bully. I have never seen anyone put her in her place before. And what I saw between you and Vance, it reminded me so much of my previous marriages. I don't know what it is about Okanagan men, but they never defend their wives. They're too afraid of confrontation.""

Aunty M made a group chat with me and my partner and messaged me nasty things. She said that she should've punched me in the face when I was speaking to her. She told me that I am the reason her family is broken apart (because of this stupid rumour spread by the cousins girlfriend years prior). She told Vance to not marry me. I never responded.

I realized how much this action hurt my partner. I apologized to him instantly, even though I was extremely frustrated that he never stuck up for me or stuck up for my grieving family when they were being harassed. We set up a healing circle (run by his aunties, of course) and I apologized to Aunty M for speaking to her that way. Aunty M took no accountability. Instead, during the ""healing circle"", she...

* mocked my dead mom.. she said: ""I saw a woman with grey hair sitting near my seat (referring to my aunty S) and thought that must be \_\_\_\_'s Mom. But then I remembered, oh right! Her mom is dead."" nobody stood up for me or told her that was unnecessary
* She said she never harassed my family. She said that my sister, brother, and aunty are all delusional and hearing voices
* She said ""I take no accountability. I did nothing wrong. I said nothing."" and the family accepted this.
* It was only me who apologized

*Sidenote: Aunty M has attacked an outsider/in-law like me in the past. She attacked Aunty D's daughter in-law. When her son and daughter in law got engaged, Aunty M started talking about the daughter in-law's previous DUI decades prior. She suggested this woman not be married into the family. The cousin completely cut Aunty M off and married his wife.*

The hate from his family got worse. More deleting, more rumours. My partner finally made a long post on the family FB group. However, it was only about how this has affected his mental health. When addressing me, my truth in all of this- from debunking the initial ""rumour"" and debunking Aunty M's lies, when addressing all the years I've been bullied and harassed and shunned out from his family, all he said about me was: ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ made mistakes, but I know that forgiveness will never be given.""

I later told him I felt incredibly betrayed because he posted this without my knowledge, without asking me, and was disappointed by his lack of protection on my name.

My partner called our wedding off 4 months ago.

Now, every time my partner and I have a small disagreement, he tells me that I'm the reason his family is broken apart and why he has nobody. When I defend myself and try to tell him that I was bullied for years and remind him that Aunty M mocked my dead mother and harassed my grieving family, and he never once defended me, then he will shut down and deflect and ultimately blame me for everything. He tells me that he's unhappy with me.

I have never tried to ruin this family. For years I showed up with a smile on my face and remained kind and unproblematic. I always thought that one day, his family would treat me good. They would see the real me. They never did. They never stopped bullying me and hating me. They even started harassing my family.

To be blamed for this family breaking up, to be blamed for my partners family wanting nothing to do with him- that is painting me as an individual that I do not recognize. That is not who I am, that is not what I did. It makes me extremely frustrated that he thinks this.

So, I have a few thoughts...

* I am my in-laws family scapegoat
* I was bullied to my limits from his family, I never did anything until they bullied my grieving family and my partner refused to stop it
* His aunties will never take accountability. It is easier to blame me than to admit that they're toxic.
* The gaslighting from his family is so powerful, it has taken over my partners mind and even my own.

We are starting couples therapy this month, but every time I get close to talking about this topic, I feel like I am going to puke and pass out.

Idk. Maybe this will turn into a message into the void. I'm afraid that if my partner never sees the way his family is toxic, enmeshed, and lacks boundaries and respect, then I think I will have no choice but to become a single mom of 2. I love my partner deeply but this has broken my mind.

So, Reddit. My little family that I created is already broken apart and I feel like I truly have nothing left to lose. AITAH for sticking up for myself and my grieving family?",4,1740598790.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

The reason behind this decision is that a space previously used as a common area for university students was taken away from them and repurposed for a franchise caf√©. Additionally, all other businesses on campus were prohibited from selling coffee, effectively creating a monopoly for this occupying caf√©. In response, students protested by bringing their own coffee in thermoses, sitting in this caf√© without making any purchases, and sharing coffee with each other.

As a result of this peaceful protest, the student ID cards of 20 of our friends were temporarily cancelled based on a revoked legal provision, barring them from entering the campus and effectively stripping them of their right to education. Our club, along with 34 others, opposed this decision and issued a statement declaring our support for the resistance.

Citing this statement as justification, we have been informed that, as of today, our club administrations have been unlawfully dismissed by the appointed (trustee) rectorate, and our activities have been suspended. This action is illegitimate because the rectorate is not a court and does not have the authority to determine what constitutes a criminal offense under the Turkish Penal Code (TCK).

1iyw0z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATcruises/comments/1iyw0z7/explora_i_review_great_cruise_with_major_gaps/,Explora I Review - Great Cruise with Major Gaps,"(x posted from /r/chubbytravel, thks alex for the suggestion!) 

For background, we‚Äôre a couple in our early 50s with no kids who love to spend our money (and points) on travel. We cruise as frequently as our full time jobs allow, most often on Seabourn, but we‚Äôve also sailed with Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Regent, Azamara, and SeaDream. This was our first Explora cruise and while we had a fantastic time, there were also some real misses.

- **Ship:** Explora I (MSC)
- **Dates:** 2/14/25 - 2/21/25
- **Itinerary:** Western Caribbean, rt Miami going to Belize, Costa Maya, Cozumel & Key West with 2 days at sea

### The Good

- Explora I is without a doubt the best-designed cruise ship we‚Äôve been on. It was at high capacity, but never felt crowded with plenty of comfortable spaces to relax and grab a snack or drink. The food was the best we‚Äôve ever had on a cruise, the wine and coffee selections were excellent, and the cocktail program was genuinely impressive for an all-inclusive cruise. I even went in the pool multiple times across multiple days, which I rarely do on cruise ships with their typically tiny crowded cruises. 

### The Big Question: Would We Sail Explora Again?

Only if the price was right. Currently, Explora‚Äôs pricing is only a little less than Seabourn and SeaDream, and if that remains the case, we‚Äôre okay paying the small premium for the polish the others have. Explora is definitely an attempt at a luxury experience, but the company doesn‚Äôt yet seem to understand luxury customers or expectations, and that‚Äôs reflected in the details.

### The Nitty Gritty Details

### Embarkation: Messy

- All guests had the same embarcation time, which didn‚Äôt make sense when premium cabins boarded first.
- We were told to wait in some chairs where we got to watch everyone else check in for an hour before being allowed to check in ourselves. Why not just have us show up later?

### Base Level Cabin: Almost Perfect

- The room layout was smart with really nice touches like a Dyson hair dryer including the diffuser attachments, a hot water kettle as well as an illy coffee maker, a nice bookshelf with books that we were actually interested in reading, and a couch out on the balcony that I really enjoyed spending time on.
- Negatives, really not many. There is a smoke detector in the closet, directly outside the shower and behind the vanity. I set off the fire alarm twice‚Äîonce using a flatiron, another time from steam after a shower. I have never done that on a ship before (oops).
- There is no actual power socket next to one side of the bed, but there is a regular USB & USBC port, so I was able to make do.
- Mini fridge was never restocked.

### Dining & Drinks

- **Reservations:** We weren‚Äôt able to book in advance (the website wouldn‚Äôt work, and the app only functions on ship WiFi), so we connected to the wifi and did that while waiting to board.
- Restaurants: The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed our first night in Med Yacht Club. Two dishes had to be sent back because they were cold, and dinner took over 2 hours. We had better experiences there on subsequent nights.
- **Drink service:** If you‚Äôre sitting anywhere‚Äîinside or outside‚Äîyou‚Äôll have to flag someone down for a drink. Yes, you can walk to the bar, but that‚Äôs standard on Royal Caribbean at a fraction of the price.
- **Lobby Bar:** Service was faster here, but my Old Fashioned would arrive watery because they didn‚Äôt use proper whisky ice (only the Malt Whisky Bar had large-format ice, which affected drink quality ship-wide).
- **Marketplace Buffet:** The food was great, but the setup meant waiting at multiple stations to assemble a meal. You wouldn‚Äôt actually eat with the people you sat down with. We stopped going altogether.
- **Afternoon dining options:** Once Marketplace closed at 2:30, the only food available was snacks from the coffee bar. That‚Äôs a huge oversight for guests returning from excursions.
- **Crepe & Ice Cream Stand:** It closed early, and the crepes were pre-made and reheated (resulting in a tough, bready texture). An outdoor ice cream stand after dinner would be a great addition.

### Excursions & Ports

- **Snorkeling in Belize:** Fun, but the boat was overcrowded‚Äîevery available inch was packed. Luxury lines wouldn‚Äôt allow this.
- **Wildlife treatment:** The provider chummed the water and manhandled the stingrays and sharks, which I personally dislike.
- **Port selection:** One of the advantages of smaller luxury ships is visiting better ports, often with alongside docking. That wasn‚Äôt the case here.
- **Port talks:** The presentations were informative about the country‚Äôs history, but they lacked practical details like maps, currency, taxis, tenders, or suggestions for independent exploration.
- **Pier logistics:** Since the ship shares ports with mega-ships, the walk from the dock to land was long, with no assistance from Explora (except in Cozumel, where they allowed third-party vendors to charge for transport).

### Other Odd Choices

- **Outdoor seating:** There‚Äôs very little shaded seating outside, and those spots were all gone before we were even awake. We spent way more time indoors than we would have liked, and far too many venues are entirely indoors without views outside.
- **Next Cruise Program:** You can book a specific cruise onboard for a 5% discount. That‚Äôs underwhelming compared to other lines, and a huge portion of their upcoming schedule is dependent on new ship deliveries. We might have booked a certificate if the discount was better and more ships were in operation.
- **Socializing**: I‚Äôm the introverted nerd, but my husband loves the social aspects of cruising and getting to know people from around the globe. On the positive - the ship was maybe 1/3 American and 2/3 European, which we enjoy. Very few spaces seemed to encourage socialization, with the result being that we didn‚Äôt get to know as many people as we usually do on a cruise.

### Service: The Big Letdown

- The crew wasn‚Äôt rude, but they weren‚Äôt personable either. It was clear they hadn‚Äôt been trained to engage with guests.
- We usually tip generously and get to know staff, but there were multiple days where I didn‚Äôt tip anyone‚Äîbecause I was going up to the bar or buffet and serving myself most of the time. I couldn‚Äôt tell you anyone‚Äôs name, I just didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt get to know them.
- Staff frequently walked past empty glasses, dirty dishes, or guests sitting with nothing in front of them without stopping.

### Final Thoughts

- Explora I is a beautiful ship with fantastic food and drink, but the service and experience don‚Äôt yet match the price point. If rates remain comparable to Seabourn or SeaDream, we‚Äôll stick with those for a truly luxury experience. However, if Explora refines its service and lowers its prices slightly, we‚Äôd absolutely consider sailing with them again.",6,1740598309.0,FATcruises,2,1.0,False

1iyvzxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1iyvzxu/ai_testing_revolution_meet_your_new_brainy_break/,AI Testing Revolution: Meet Your New Brainy Break Room Buddy,"AI just graduated from being a glorified calculator to a role that might rival your nosy coworker‚Äîthinking, creating, and learning all on its own. Welcome to the future of software testing, where AI isn't just a tool, but a colleague you might actually enjoy sharing the break room with. But don‚Äôt update your CV just yet; it‚Äôs a brave new world, and AI, especially the likes of Keysight‚Äôs Eggplant Intelligence, is driving us there at full throttle.

### From Tools to Teammates: The AI Evolution
Forget merely running your scripts‚ÄîAI's in the driver's seat now, deciding where, when, and how the ride should go. Here's the rundown:

**Thinking, Creating, Learning:**
- **Thinking**: It‚Äôs not just your job it has its sights on; AI uses real-time data to make decisions, a hallmark of Agentic AI.
- **Creating**: Generative AI isn't just writing test scripts, it‚Äôs crafting them from scratch, taking software specs and spitting out test cases like a futuristic Pez dispenser.
- **Learning**: Like a true autodidact, AI studies past performance to outdo itself, much like you trying to outsmart your coffee machine.

### A Trip Down Memory Lane
Remember Alan Turing? Back in 1947, he sowed the seeds for machines to 'think'. Fast forward to 2018, and we see Keysight‚Äôs Eggplant weaving Turing‚Äôs dreams into reality with its Digital Automation Intelligence platform‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt want a machine that handles both testing and innovation simultaneously?

### Why You Should Care 
AI in software testing is more than just flashy tech-con jargon. Let's talk impact: it identifies user journeys, prioritizes testing, detects anomalies, and adapts scripts‚Äîall without a single eye roll (unlike your intern). Whether automating payments on a site or ensuring compliance in high-security industries, AI makes sure nothing slips through the cracks.

### Navigating the AI Testing Maze
Face it; cloud-based solutions can be a compliance nightmare. Keysight‚Äôs approach‚Äîkeeping everything secure and offline‚Äîis like sticking to your diet at an all-you-can-eat buffet: sensible and ultimately rewarding.

And just when you think it‚Äôs all nerdy sci-fi talk, remember that AI‚Äôs real magic happens in preventing those dreaded ‚ÄúUh-oh!‚Äù moments that testers share far too often.

### So, Over to You
The AI testing realm isn‚Äôt just retrospective; it‚Äôs a forward-thinking buffet waiting to be devoured. What do you think will be the next big breakout in AI testing, and has Agentic AI made its mark on your turf yet?

As a fifty-nine year old Qui‚Äôztar and in excellent shape, Sub-Admiral Marzima could easily still be considered in the prime of her life. Despite that, she could feel her age catching up and her physicality slowly declining. Morning aches and pains were becoming a more common occurrence. She couldn't handle a night of drinking as well as she used to. And saddest of all, her combat efficiency rating has been slowly declining over the last few years. Even with the biological age equivalent of a human in their mid to late thirties, the life of a soldier had taken its toll on her body. While she undoubtedly remained one of the best of the best, the Sub-Admiral who led the most prestigious honor guard unit in the Third Matriarchy, that position would soon need to be passed on to someone else. After nearly forty years of service to her Matriarch, Marzima was just beginning to imagine what would come next.

Considering all Qui‚Äôztar had a life expectancy ranging from a hundred and thirty all the way to a hundred eighty, it was common for them to divide life into four distinct segments. Their first twenty years would be analogous to human adolescence and pre-adulthood with a very similar process maturation and puberty. Unlike humans, however, the subsequent aging becomes incredibly slow once a Qui‚Äôztar reaches full adulthood. While humans may only have a couple decades of peak physicality, possibly extending into their fifties or sixties, Qui‚Äôztar wouldn‚Äôt enter the final portion of their lives until they were in their eighties to nineties. Because of that gift of nature, it‚Äôs easy for one of the blue-skinned, humanoid beings to fully live out two separate adult lives back to back before they retire. To devote thirty or forty years to a specific career path and then do it all over again a second time was simply seen as the normal thing to do.

Upon waking up alone after a rather vigorous day of combat and night of satisfying fun that resulted in falling asleep next to Mik, Marz momentarily questioned some of her decisions. But when she rolled over to see a sealed cup of hot tea, a sweet morning pastry, and handwritten note on the bedside table, her bioluminescent freckles lit up. Despite the difficult to decipher chicken-scratch indicative of a person just learning to write in galactic common, the message was just as clear as it was promising. So instead of dawdling in bed and actually relaxing on her much earned vacation time, Marzima got ready for the day with a professional haste. Though she had only opened her eyes at 7am, she was showered, dressed, and reaching for the button to unlock the blanket-like door to Mik's temporary quarters aboard the Wango.

‚ÄúMornin‚Äô, sunshine.‚Äù That was first thing Marz heard as she stepped out into the nearly perfectly simulated sunrise being created by holographic projectors along the ceiling far above head. To make it that much better, there was something about Mik's raspy drawl and the way his accent was translated that tickled her ears a bit more than usual. As soon Marzima's eyes adjusted to the light, she saw the man she had just spent the night with seated at the closest bench table with Tensebwse and Menashka-Ngwagen. ‚ÄúI didn't wanna wake yah up but I am glad to see yah before my meetin‚Äô with the Council.‚Äù

‚ÄúMno waben, Marzima!‚Äù The rainbow-eyed Nishnabe warrior blurted out while waving at Marz from behind a huge thermos full of coffee. ‚ÄúI would ask how you slept, but I saw the way Mik was walking earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, everyone. And yes, I had an excellent night, Menashka.‚Äù The massive, muscular, crimson-eyed woman shot Mik a playful wink as she approached the table, causing the Martian to ever so slightly blush and look away. ‚ÄúAnd I quite enjoyed that pastry you left for me on the bedside table. The flavor of chocolate is truly divine.‚Äù

‚ÄúChocolate?!?‚Äù Nashka blurted out while an offended expression formed on her face. ‚ÄúThere's chocolate left? Mik! Have you been hiding chocolate from me?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! Also been hidin‚Äô my Chiapas coffee from yah, too!‚Äù Mik took a swig from his coffee thermos while flaring his eyebrows as the feisty young warrior. However, as soon as a large, blue hand gently stroked his back, a small drop of the bitter, black liquid went down the wrong hole and caused him to cough. ‚ÄúCuh! Huh‚Ä¶ And no, Nashka, I ain‚Äôt tellin‚Äô yah where I‚Äôm hidin‚Äô it, neither! I got no idea when we‚Äôre actually headin‚Äô back to Sol, so I gotta ration my stash. ‚ÄòSpecially the stuff to make the chocolate donuts like the one I left for yah, Marz. I‚Äôm glad yah liked it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it was wonderful. Paired excellently with my morning tea.‚Äù Marz playfully smirked while trying to avoid Nashka's wrathful gaze. ‚ÄúI can certainly see why you would reserve the ingredients for special occasions.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide snacks from me, Mik.‚Äù An ominous pout befell the rainbow-eyed warrior‚Äôs face as she a sip of her coffee

‚ÄúI swear, Nashka‚Ä¶‚Äù Tens finally chimed in with a chuckle, the pipe in his hand emitting a thin stream of smoke. ‚ÄúYou're so close to becoming a full Brave. But you're such a child sometimes!‚Äù

‚ÄúTsss‚Ä¶ It's not like that rank is going to be mean much anymore.‚Äù Nashka scoffed before downing a deep chug of her highly caffeinated bean-water. ‚ÄúI heard we're restructuring our entire rank system. Msko told me in a few months I'll be a Major in the First Rapid Insertion Mechanized Division, whatever that means.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means yah're gonna be lead a team o‚Äô ‚Äòbout thirty mechs.‚Äù Mik's response was immediate and full of laughter. Despite not really participating in the United Human Defense Fleet Council discussions regarding rank structures, he had paid close attention to how the mech units would be structured and dispersed. ‚ÄúYah'll probably be under a guy named Gadzemki. Him an‚Äô a dude called Bize Wankwake ‚Äòre in charge o‚Äô all the mech divisions. They're the Brigadier Generals. But I ain't sure what ship yah'll be on, where yah'll be stationed, ‚Äòr who'll be in yahr unit. All that's still bein‚Äô figured out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds to be roughly equivalent to a Brave in the Nishnabe Militia, if I understand the more decentralized structure correctly.‚Äù Marz shot a quick glance towards the now smiling young woman before rolling her eyes and letting out a scoffing chuckle. ‚ÄúAnd I am sure you will live up to the responsibilities of your new role, Menashka. But if I am being completely honest, I'm still shocked by how effective and capable the Nishnabe Militia is despite being so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say primitive-‚Äù Tens cut in with a sarcastic smirk, giving Marz just a brief moment to find the right word.

‚ÄúNo! I wasn't going to say primitive‚Ä¶ More that it is so‚Ä¶ Spontaneous and designed from a bottom up approach as opposed to the more structured system I am used to.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I couldn't choose who I'd be serving under, I probably wouldn't have joined the militia to begin with.‚Äù Though the pair had debated this topic before when the First of the Third and Nishnabe Militia allied in an anti-Chigagorian campaign that ended a year ago, they had never come to an agreement. ‚ÄúI'd be happy with Gad, or even Biz, as my leader. But I'd rather go make baskets or work in waste recycling than follow some idiot I've never heard of. That's how you end up with your name on the Memorial to Fallen Warriors.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the militaries in Sol ‚Äòre all hella structured.‚Äù Mik spoke up with a bit more of a professional tone as he picked up the tablet resting on the table in front of him. ‚ÄúBut that kind brings up what we were talkin‚Äô ‚Äòbout before yah woke up, Marz. Part o‚Äô what we were doin‚Äô yesterday durin‚Äô that battle ‚Äògainst the Chigagorians was figurin‚Äô out what weapons we should use as the standardized equipment on our mechs. That's what we're talkin‚Äô ‚Äòbout in my meetin‚Äô at nine, anyways.‚Äù

‚ÄúStandard equipment? For a BD?‚Äù Marz asked with a quite puzzled look on her face and unknowingly adding to the verbal accosting Mik had been reviewing before she woke up. ‚ÄúI understand the need for simplified logistics chains. You can trust me in that. However‚Ä¶ Please correct me if I'm wrong, Tensebwse‚Ä¶ BD-series mechanized combat walkers are best utilized with weapons optimized for the particular pilot's skill set. Of the hundred BDs under my command, there are at least fifty different combinations of weapons and attachment systems. While I could see clumping specific loadouts into general categories, the restrictions around the light-weight classification can make the balancing quite difficult.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get it! That‚Äôs what Nashka, I, and every other BD operator have been trying to tell them!‚Äù Tens clapped his hands together then used them to make an overly dramatic gesture towards Marz. ‚ÄúWe could probably take all the operators who have at least ten years experience, take their favorite loadouts, then run them through a million simulations. But we would come out with at least twenty combinations that are all equally optimized for different roles. The only thing I think every BD should have is a backup melee weapon. And even then there's quite a few good choices depending on the operator.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Mik!‚Äù Nashka could stop herself from being a brat and adding on to the dogpile. ‚ÄúYou have your own BDs and got to use one in a real battle! You know what we're talking about!‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I'm on y'all's side! I swear‚Äù Mik threw his hands up in defeat. ‚ÄúAll I'm tryin‚Äô to tell yah is that the Council wants as many cockpits filled as fast as we can. If we used a standardized loadout, at least for trainin‚Äô, it'll make shit like qualifications easier. An‚Äô I tell yah what, we got an absolute shitton o‚Äô people from wantin‚Äô to be mech pilots. The goal‚Äôs to get a thousand new operators trained up an‚Äô deployed within six months. We're gonna need all the shortcuts we can get.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow that is certainly ambitious.‚Äù Marzima couldn't stop herself from scoffing. ‚ÄúMy command started with twenty BDs, including myself but not including Tens. It took us almost a year to get fully activated. Then, after three more years, we added another thirty units which we struggled to find soldiers capable of filling. The acceleration tolerance requirements alone disqualified many of the otherwise superb candidates. And Tensebwse and I were working with a pool of several hundred volunteers.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly several hundred?‚Äù A brash voice with a barely noticeable artificial ting to it interjected into the conversation, drawing all eyes towards a pair of approaching cyborgs. ‚ÄúTry six-goddamn-million! That's how many people put down 'mech operator‚Äô as their first choice when they tried signing up for the UHDF.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô damn it, Tom! Our meetin‚Äô ain't till nine!‚Äù Though Mik had been getting used to the presence of General Ryan, a man he used to consider an enemy, that didn't mean he wanted to see the cyborg before getting properly prepared for the day. ‚ÄúI ain't smoked enough flower ‚Äòr drank enough coffee to deal with yahr shit yet. An‚Äô how the hell‚Äôd yah even get in ‚Äòere? I thought our meetin‚Äô was through the comms.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, good fucking morning to you too, Mik. You do know all the ships are docked together, right?‚Äù Tom laughed while he and Heinger continued slowly approaching the table Mik and his friends were seated at. ‚ÄúAnd I see you‚Äôve already gathered everyone I was hoping to talk to. I appreciate that. Oh, and just in case any of you haven't met her yet, this is Captain Isabelle Randolf, codename Heinger. She leads the Raider's Gold Team.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you're the person from that combat sim Mkso had me join.‚Äù Tens smiled and nodded towards cyborgs who had come to a stop just a pace and a half way, greatly contrasting against Mik's rather rude greeting. ‚ÄúIt's nice to meet you. You and your team seem very capable. I heard you even took over that Chigagorian flagship faster than our breacher teams took the other line ships. Well done.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were just doing our job, but thank you. It's good to finally meet you in person, Tensebwse.‚Äù Heinger reciprocated Tens's smile and nod before directing her mechanical eyes towards the large, blue woman. ‚ÄúAnd you must be Sub-Admiral Marzima of Sengil‚Äôyiosh. I've read some very interesting reports about you. My team almost got deployed when yours hit the UHI HQ. But I am glad we're meeting as allies and not on opposite sides of the battlefield.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe feeling is mutual, Captain.‚Äù While Marz would normally stand and shake hands with a fellow military officer, she was taking her lead from the Martian professor she had become quite close to and chose to simply smile and slightly bow her head. ‚ÄúI am actually quite proud my team was able to handle that particular incident without any bloodshed. I fear that would have strained potential relations between our governments. However‚Ä¶ A government allowing a private corporation to kidnap a disabled mother and son in order to exert political pressure likely wouldn't have been taken well by my Matriarch. It is better for everyone that the situation played out the way it did.‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn't agree more.‚Äù General Ryan announced with a flat, monotone voice while shooting a quick but pointed glance towards Mik. ‚ÄúSomething tells me UHI got off easy compared to what some other people would have done. But that isn't what we were hoping to talk to you all about. Heinger and I were reviewing the combat data from the surface mech teams and discovered something we were quite surprised by. When we checked cross verified against combat data from the Nishnabe breacher teams, we found the same thing. Melee weapons proved to be far more effective against ali- Uh‚Ä¶ Non-human threats than either Heinger or I could believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have arm blades like me!‚Äù Nashka blurted out with a deeply perplexed expression on her face while she extended an arm and triggered her own covert cybernetic weapon to deploy. ‚ÄúHow could you possibly underestimate how effective melee can be?!? Did you get yours just because they look cool?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's hard to get close enough to use melee when so many Martians carry around hand cannons like the one he's got.‚Äù Heinger snapped back while pointing at the massive revolver that Mik always carried on his hip. ‚ÄúIf that thing had a tungsten sabot round chambered, I'd have a hole through my titanium skull before I could get a blade through his neck. Forgive me for presuming species capable of faster than light travel would have weapons even more powerful than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways keep one in the cylinder.‚Äù Mik let out a light, huffing laugh while he drew his high pressure .45-70 revolver from its holster, popped open the cylinder, and proceeded to delicately remove one specific round which he set on the table. ‚ÄúWe call ‚Äòem borg killers. Fuckin‚Äô thang could take out an elephant. Probably punch a hole in three Chigagorians in a row before it stopped. Yah shoulda seen how everybody on The Hammer reacted when I fired it off durin‚Äô a lil weapons demonstration me an‚Äô Sarah put on.‚Äù

‚ÄúAtxika was actually interested in some the‚Ä¶‚Äù Tens cut in while snapping his fingers and looking up towards the holographic sky, his brain straining to remember a specific word. ‚ÄúThe firearms that don‚Äôt drop the brass things. The whatever-those-were-called might actually be a good investment. Specifically the ones with the propellant made from plant material.‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe you two may have overestimated the capabilities of galactic standard handheld weapons.‚Äù Marz eyed the two cyborgs with a slight smirk hiding between her prominent tusks. ‚ÄúWhile our standard energy and projectile weapons are certainly lethal, one must also take into account resource and cost efficiency. Why waste copper and zinc on disposable ammunition when they could be utilized to produce reusable battery packs? A laser or electromagnetic accelerator may only deliver a few hundred to a few thousand joules of energy per shot, but they require far less back-end logistics. There are also a few militaries who will spend exorbitant sums to equip individual soldiers with active energy shielding capable of reflecting or absorbing quite a bit of damage. Of course, there also exist equally expensive weapon systems meant to counter those shields. And I believe that ties into both why you wanted to talk to us this morning and Tensebwse‚Äôs comment about the particular weapon system Fleet Admiral Atxika showed interested in. The projectile weapons technology developed in Sol is just as impressive as it is expensive to utilize. One shot from a gun may have the same destructive power as twenty shots from a weak laser weapon. However, a soldier could fire a hundred, maybe even a thousand, laser shots for the same background costs as that single tungsten projectile with its casing and propellant.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is why I wanted to talk to you specifically, Sub-Admiral.‚Äù The synthetic skin covering Tom‚Äôs mechanical face stretched into a wide smile. ‚ÄúI hate to admit it, but we ran out of ammo right as we completed our final objective yesterday. And we brought twice as much as we thought we‚Äôd need. If it weren‚Äôt for our cybernetics, I don‚Äôt think we would have properly completed our mission. I cannot let that happen again, and I am sure you understand my sentiment.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarines ran out of ammo?!?‚Äù Mik‚Äôs eyes and mouth were wide open, his flabber absolutely gasted. ‚ÄúMother o‚Äô fuckin‚Äô... Sheee-it‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm actually startin‚Äô to feel bad for the fascist crabs.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral Ryan, let me tell you the same thing I've been telling Mik.‚Äù Tens picked up his tablet and began scrolling and typing in commands while he spoke. ‚ÄúEvery warrior should have a back-up melee weapon just like how every BD should have one. I know our militia training probably looks nothing like whatever kind of training your people do, but we spend just as much time with clubs, spears, and knives as we do with mag-slings and lasers. I‚Äôm sending some details on the specific weapons we use and how we train with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do quite a bit of close quarters combat training in the Marine Corps, son.‚Äù Ryan tried to not sound condescending, especially considering he was aware of just how capable Tens was with just his bare hands, but a bit of a laugh did slip out. ‚ÄúI am actually planning on integrating some of it into the standardized training for new UHDF Marines. However, there is still quite a bit of debate on whether or not it‚Äôs really necessary to issue every single Marine a proper melee weapon alongside their rifle. And if so, what that weapon would be.‚Äù",9,1740598021.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I fell in love with him a million times over in that moment, I swear. He was so relaxed, so carefree. He didn't even flinch when I closed the cabinet a bit too loudly. We cuddled on the couch all night, he could barely keep his hands off me, and he slept through the night in my arms like a baby. No nightmares, no paranoia. 

He woke up pretty groggy and a little hungover, but happy. One of his triggers is the smell of black coffee and I have to make it outside on the back porch (it's safe from the rain) and have my morning coffee outside, but that morning he came outside while I was sipping it and talked with me before he left for work. 

He uses it a couple times a week now and that combined with less medication for anxiety/whatnot, he's a completely new man. Our friends keep asking what the night and day difference is about but he doesn't want to tell them for fear of judgement, so I'm telling the internet. He's my husband, he's amazing, and I love him more than life. That's all, folks.",33,1740597568.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

Was This Cheating?,"At the start of the year my(F25) fianc√©e(F25) told me she wanted a break. I was devastated because this came out of the blue. I had some strong weaknesses in the relationship, as did she, but I didn't think they were bad enough to warrant a break (which to me is just soft launching a split). 

I spent a night on the couch and put it together that she had been asked out by a boy at her gym, to which she told me about. She said he had initially asked her out on a date, to which she said she was engaged. I let her grab coffee with him anyways because she promised me he was just one friend of many at the gym. I realized this had to be a big factor. 

I confronted her about it the next morning and she admitted that this boy was a catalyst to us getting here. I was devastated. Never in my life did I feel so humiliated. I had already read the texts and although there was nothing sexual or overtly flirty, we all know when you have a crush on someone you read between the lines even if the topics are purely platonic. 

She agreed we'd try to work this out and she'd ""keep her distance"" from this boy, which did not happen, though she still claims she did everything she could. Although she stopped messaging him, he was a core member of the Volleyball clique at her gym that she was trying to get to know, so a few times a week she was still there around him. She even lied about not playing on the same court with him because ""he was on the other team which isn't 'playing with him.'""

Over all of January I did absolutely everything I could to single handedly save this relationship. I was getting constant whiplash day to day from her leaning towards staying or leaving. The stress, loss of appetite and sleep made me lose 12 pounds in 4 weeks. I was self harming through the form of making myself vomit to cope with the stress, something I've never done before and haven't done since she called things off. 

Within a week of her splitting us up she started pursuing this boy and has since gone on a few official dates and made out with him. This is so fucked up. She still says it wasn't ""cheating"" and honestly I don't care. Being left for someone else is much worse in my opinion and the fact that all her friends are defending her during this makes my stomach turn. So gross. I feel gross, but not as gross as I think she is. 

This was my only relationship and it was of nine years. I feel so broken. I'm moving on, and I don't miss her. But there's a lot of hurt that the person I love most would wait until she had someone lined up to leave. ",9,1740597439.0,Infidelity,8,0.91,False

1iyvm5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1iyvm5p/ultimate_coffee_sorbet_recipe_sorbet_that_tastes/,"Ultimate coffee sorbet recipe, sorbet that tastes like V60/filter coffee","The ultimate is off course a nod to the multiple JH recipes with the same qualifier, it is by no means the be all and end all of coffee sorbet recipes, but it is a very good one IMHO. I had this idea of a coffee sorbet that would taste like a well brewed V60 and preserve the origin characteristics of the coffee used to make it for a while but it was a theory. After seeing James' recipe and purchasing a Ninja Creami, it was time to experiment and iterate. I dare say the result is excellent to my palate, I could taste the flavour notes on the bag and it is distinctive enough that different coffees make different tasting sorbets. 

Without further ado, here's the recipe for one pot (660 g) of sorbet in the Creami Deluxe. 

Ingredients: 

80 g Coffee concentrate 10% TDS

380 g water

30 g cornstarch

60 g inulin

60 g xylitol

20 g sugar

30 g dextrose

1 g salt

2 g ice cream stabilizer mix

Instructions: 

1. In a large bowl, combine all solid ingredients. Whisk everything together. What we want is for the stabilizer to spread in the mix fully. 
2. Add the mix to a saucepan, add the water, gently heat it up on the stovetop until the temperature needed for the ice cream stabilizer to fully activate (it written should be on the box, usually 80-85 C) or for the cornstarch to fully gelatinize (the mixture should get thick).
3. Turn of the heat, transfer what is now the sorbet base into the Creami pot. Refrigerate the pot for 12 h or until it has reached 4 C. 
4. After 12 h, add the coffee concentrate to the sorbet base. Mix with a spatula, be quick and thorough, the coffee concentrate should be cooled by the sorbet base to under 10 C immediately and the temperature should not rise from then on. Once it's combined, put it back in the fridge for 1 h. 
5. Put it in the freezer for 24 h (normal Creami procedure). Churn using the sorbet setting, scrape the sides after the initial churn, re-spin once or twice. Your sorbet should keep in the freezer for one week without significant flavour degradation and two weeks without ice crystal formation. The recipe is formulated so that it doesn't need a re-churn if you don't eat it all at one and put it back in the freezer. 

Instructions for the coffee concentrate:

This is a crucial part of the recipe. It was developed with the idea of preserving all the flavour notes of the coffee concentrate into the sorbet by cooling the coffee concentrate quickly and slowing down and limiting oxydation as much as possible. So the flavour quality of your concentrate will determine the flavour quality of your sorbet. This is the only flavouring agent in the recipe. The first solution is two shots of espresso, it is very straightforward and the sorbet should taste like your shots, but for my recipe I prefer using filter concentrates. 

If you have been reading about Scott Rao's filter 2.0, it's the same concept, I'm making a sub-1 bar extended extraction of very finely ground coffee. Personally, I grind coffee somewhat coarser than for a turbo shot, some would say moka pot size, and I follow that with a 30 s pre-infusion, 30s percolation phase in my Flair 58 with a paper filter at the bottom of the basket. I do two of such shots using a 20:40 ratio. You might want to play a bit/get some experience with dialing in filter concentrates and diluting them (to make filter coffee) or drinking them straight before attempting to make sorbet with them.

You can also try playing with instant specialty coffee. There are also ways to do something similar with an Aeropress and a melodrip. 

I have had very good results with coffees with very distinct and strong flavour characteristics. A washed Kenya is a good idea, so are heavily processed coffees, or varieties with very strong flavours like a natural Bourbon Aji. For example, I was able to taste the berries in the Kenya, and the Aji still had the floweriness and the coca cola note I tasted when I brewed it as filter coffee. 

Notes:

1. All ingredients should be available on Amazon or at gourmet online grocery store. 
2. I use Sapuro's ice cream stabilizer mix, you can use another one, follow the instruction of the box for quantities and heating.
3. Inulin and cornstarch are there to add solids to the mix and improve the resulting texture. Inulin is a digestion resistant starch that behaves like a dietary fiber, it's often considered a health supplement. I'm repeating this, it behaves like a fiber. 
4. The combination of Xylitol, sugar and dextrose was adjusted to get the right mix of sweetness and freezing point. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is often used as a sugar substitute since it doesn't raise the glycemic index, it's commonly found in the sugar substitute section and in sugar free gums and gummy bears. There are no serious health risks associated with it, though excessive consumption isn't recommended. Sugar is unhealthy, obviously. Dextrose is like sugar in all the ways it counts and is similarly unhealthy. 
5. The salt is there to enhance flavour and counteract the bitterness of coffee, you could try 1.5 g if it's bitter, but I would be cautious going above that. 
6. It should be scoopable directly out of the freezer after it's been churned, but if it's a bit too hard, 15 min in the fridge should solve that.

 Is it any issue that I‚Äôm only doing a small batch of 20grams at a time to experiment? The beans were roasted less than 10 days ago and were harvested from june 2023 but I‚Äôve bought it from the shop where I‚Äôve had this coffee and it‚Äôs tasted really nice then.

When I think of coffee in America I think it's mostly associated with more diluted forms of coffee or Starbucks coffee and such.

How common is it to find the ""pure"" espresso in America and how popular is it?

Also it seems coffee sold in America commonly has a very high arabica content which is the more expensive type and makes it more aromatic but also more watery and a ""weaker"" taste.

Storms happen all over the game regardless of if a player is there, so when you leave a structure behind you need to make it tough enough to survive without you being there to repair it.

**-Location Matters**: When selecting a building site, I consider the various means by which I might come under attack and end up frequently building atop waterfalls, cliff edges, and lakes for defense against bears.

**-Stuff I Travel With:** While heavy to travel with, I always keep on my mount a cement bunker kit and use it as a means to create heavy duty weather resistant networks of shelters. Typically, I have 2 cement foundations, 6 walls, 1 door, one crafting/machines bench, 1 bed, and 2 roofs on me for travel. At any time it can be placed to survive major weather events or even be used to create a permanent outpost for me to use as a part of my greater network. In my world, I have 1 major base, 3 large outpost bases, and 3 survival outposts, all of cement.

*Wood structures* rarely survive outside the starting beginner zones. As a minimum, travel with stone if you can't do cement, but get to cement as soon as you can.

*Reinforced glass*, in my experience, holds up well with my cement bunkers and can be a nice way to enjoy a great view in an otherwise dangerous area. I do not recommend normal glass, only reinforced glass if you want scenic vista views without worrying about storm damage ruining the structure while you are away. I use reinforced glass walls, and even roofs in the artic and desert without there being issues.

**-Cement bunker versus arctic zones**: They do great; the slanted roofs hold up well to the snow and don't easily take damage. I do not recommend using flat roofs in the arctic zones due to snow piling up. Fuel for heat in these zones is at a premium, so consider smaller buildings that will be easier to heat. Heating is vital during some of the worst storms, which can deeply chill your character and pose a threat. My cement outposts in the artic areas are also stocked with coffee beans and tea leaves for brewing drinks that help warm your core temperature. I do not recommend these zones for a serious primary base of options due to how resource-poor they are. I recommend solar and wind over biofuel due to the resources in this zone.

**-Cement bunker versus desert zones**: They do great. I recommend finding an oasis and building at it to have a water source on hand. A few desert areas have flowing water good enough for a water wheel to power your base. An air conditioning unit is not required to survive in a desert cement bunker, but it is nice during extreme storms. Storms in the desert range in temperature, those at night get dangerous cold, and those by day are extreme heat. If you don't have flowing water, I recommend solar and wind over biofuel due to resources in this zone.

**-Comfort Matters** \- Something I like to do when permitted is to upgrade the coziness rating of all of my shelters and outposts. Small extra touches that benefit my sleep buff, without taking a lot of effort. Easy add-ons for increasing the coziness in your outposts and such are things like rugs, and mounted taxidermy heads on the wall. Im a fan of the mounted heads and mounted fish because they don't take up space on the floor in what might otherwise be a very small building that has room only for 1 bed and 1 crafting station.

1iyvcai,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iyvcai/aitah_for_confronting_my_coworker_in_public/,AITAH for confronting my coworker in public?,"

I(41F) have a younger coworker, Jamie(23F fake name) that has had bit of a crush on me ever since she started the job. I was personally flattered by it but the girl is young enough to be my daughter and I already have a girlfriend so I wasn‚Äôt and never would be interested but I still offered to be a friend to her. 

She was cool with that and we would have lunch together sometimes and I would give her advice on things like college and the workforce.

So here is when the problem came in. A few hours ago, I came into work and made some coffee when one of my work friends who I‚Äôll call Richard comes in. We talk a bit until he says ‚Äúyou know, I didn‚Äôt know you were into younger women but you learn something new everyday.‚Äù I froze, turned to him, and asked what in the hell is he talking about. He then says ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you and Jamie together now?‚Äù I said no we are not, I already have a girlfriend and me and Jamie are just friends. 

Richard turns to me confused and says, ‚ÄúBut Jamie has been telling everyone that you left your girlfriend and that you two are dating now.‚Äù With that, I left the lounge and went to go look for Jamie. I found her talking to some other coworkers and it was there I heard her telling these people we are in a relationship. I walk over Jamie and the others and ask her what the hell is she doing. She then tries to downplay it but I cut her off and tell her in front of everyone that I am in a happy relationship, she is literally the same age as my nephew, I only saw as her as a friend/little sibling, and I am not and would never be interested in her in that manner. 


Before she could say anything, I stormed out of the building and into my car. I drove down the street to a little coffee shop I frequent where I am writing this right now. I got a few texts from coworkers saying I could have been nicer about it or addressed the matter in private and honestly, I am feeling a little bad about yelling at her in public like that.

So, AITAH?

Hey all! I have worked for a NFP organization as a fundraising assistant for about a year now and I have encountered a challenge.

Our long standing event has traditionally involved providing participants with donated coffee and cups (often from Tim Hortons) to create ""Coffee Kits"" that are then dropped off to host their own fundraising coffee breaks (coffee in exchange for donations). While this has been successful in the past, we're noticing a few obstacles.

Many potential hosts are finding it difficult to participate due to time constraints or a preference for K-Cups over traditional coffee makers. Although we can provide coffee makers, this still adds an extra layer of effort for our hosts. Despite these challenges, we were able to double our profits in 2024, but I‚Äôm concerned that the traditional Coffee Break format may not be as well-received in Fall 2025.

To address this, we‚Äôve been brainstorming new ideas, such as:

- Partnering with local coffee shops to donate a portion of their sales for a day.
- Promoting alternative events like bake sales.
- Hosting ‚ÄúCoffee and Conversation‚Äù sessions where we go out into the community, provide informational talks about dementia, and encourage donations in exchange for coffee.

So the big questions are: 
What type of event would you be willing host? 
Is this event appealing to you? Or too much work, outdated?
Do you have any creative ideas to increase participation or modernize the traditional format?

I am not a chemist, and I couldn't find much about this patent either. But I did find warnings that you should not combine silver and aluminium. Is this moka pot safe to use? What do you think?

A year and a half ago, I bought a 13th-gen Intel i9 13900K, but it died within a few days of use. I RMA'd it and received a refund of 600 euros. During that time, the 14th-gen processors were released, so I used the refund to purchase one.

Now, after using the 14th-gen CPU for about a year, I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs faulty or not. I‚Äôd appreciate some help on how to be sure it‚Äôs not defective.

Here are a few symptoms I noticed before updating the motherboard microcode:

* Blender (a 3D program) constantly crashed when rendering or doing any other moderately heavy modeling work.
* A couple of times, I experienced BSODs while browsing Steam.

Since the update:

* I still occasionally get crashes while doing 3D modeling.
* Today, my PC completely froze while I was making coffee, and I had to hold the power button to turn it off.
* The texturing program Substance Painter sometimes crashes when I‚Äôm working on my models.

Overall, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this might be due to running the CPU without the microcode update for about six months.

Anyway, I still have warranty left on the CPU, and I believe Intel extended the warranty for these faulty models.

How would you guys test the CPU, and what signs should I look for?

Thanks all

1iyuzem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1iyuzem/dreading_upcoming_appointments_and_dreaming_of/,Dreading upcoming appointments and dreaming of abandoning my family.,"That's pretty much it. I have an endscopy tomorrow to try and figure out why I'm still bleeding in my stomach despite months of treating me for a presumed gastric ulcer. Today the inflammation in my wrists and elbows is really bad,  my traps, quads, and shins hurt. I'm trying to work on my dissertation, but I can't focus. Tuesday we drive to another city to the teaching hospital to try and figure things out. My GP has spitballed lupus, my GI is concerned about PBC, and I sincerely doubt these new doctors are going to do anything to help me. I want to go outside, but outside give me rashes. I'm tired, but coffee makes my stomach hurt because of whatever's going on in there. My kid, who is a lovely little AuDHD weirdo, totally lost her shit this morning. Lots of throwing things, lots of screaming in my face. I suspect my having been not well lately is impacting her negatively, but there's not a lot I can do about that.

My family takes so much out of me... gotta get up... make everybody breakfast, get them out the door, take my shower, log in to work, deal with the tantrums of other people's badly socialized kids, fit in chores, make my kid do homework, make dinner, oh no husband had a bad day... now he's mad about the house... passive-aggressively slamming cabinet doors like I didn't already spend all day with 12 year old boys in my classes, wash the kid get her to bed, and there's still so much to do. I have no room for hobbies, because our house is way too big and my chores are never done.

I love my family, but I wish I could leave for a while. I dream of getting a little camper and just going up to the mountains where it's quiet. Teaching my virtual classes. Only having to cook things I like and that my stomach can tolerate. Having a small space that I can easily manage, easily keep clean and organized and comfortable. Being able to log-off after work, grade my papers, and then sit outside with tea and a book or, if my hands will allow it, a piece of knitting. To be able to take deep breaths that don't hurt. To do a little yoga outside, write poetry, maybe walk around town and say, ""Hello"" to people. 

When I was younger, I tended to go off on my own a lot. I think I mostly got married so I wouldn't be lonely, but now I'm looking around thinking, ""Well, what if they don't fix me? If there's nothing to treat and it keeps getting into my organs, I probably don't have too many more years. Wouldn't it be nice to die gently instead of having to be in a panic all the time until I collapse?"" and that feels awful because that would require me to abandon my husband and child which I'm pretty sure makes me an awful person.

In way over my head!,"We matched on an app about four months ago, texted for three weeks. I didn't want to meet him right away because it was clear he wanted a physical relationship and I had recently felt used by someone else.

He said he wanted a relationship, hadn't had one in almost five years. He complimented me a lot and talked about my body in a way I'd never experienced before. He talked to me about things neither of us were ready for, said he had trouble hiding his feelings from me. It started slow and respectful but quickly got spicy and I didn't ask him to stop, it felt good to be wanted. My ex-husband never talked to me like that. I felt ashamed of enjoying a man being honest about wanting my body, I felt so confused as to how I should feel about all of this.

Then we met for coffee, we hit it off immediately. He had held back two big things about himself, saying he wanted something to talk about when we met but it felt like two things that would have won me over. So why those things? My respect for him soared and I wanted to be close to him.

We went for a walk to a park nearby, he had already checked a map of my neighbourhood to find a park we could walk to and watch the sunset on a bench. He was thinking five steps ahead and I was winging it, I even wore an unflattering dress because I didn't want him to spend the whole time looking elsewhere or just thinking about my body.

When we sat down, he told me something about his past that made me cry, like full on sobbing. I didn't believe it could possibly be true (I confirmed later it is. Details are being left out because they're very identifiable, I don't imagine anyone else ever went through this same tragedy.) I could feel all the walls and defenses I had built up over the years come crumbling down in an instant. I wanted nothing more than to be there for him, he seemed like the strongest person alive. I couldn't possibly imagine going through all that and even functioning, nevermind going to work and dating and even some day wanting to be there for my two kids like he talked about.

After he confirmed I didn't want to run, we started making out and he was groping me. I've never done anything like that so quickly, especially in a public park, but the way he touched me was exactly what I always wanted. He kissed me in a way I had never been kissed. He took me home and the sex was beyond incredible. Every moment was intense and passionate, there was no awkward moments, no weirdness. It felt like I was having sex with my husband of 18 years, except not the one I had, the one I always wanted. He felt familiar and yet so exciting and intense. 

I also felt so very inadequate, the longer it went on I was wondering if I just wasn't good enough for him or why he wouldn't finish. I had never had more than one orgasm but here I was having countless and he was happily giving me more, not even thinking about himself. After over an hour we had to stop so I could go home to my kids, but he never finished. I felt terrible, like I had failed him when he was the best I had ever had by far. In one hour he had totally changed the way I felt about sex, it was monumental for me and for him it seemed mediocre.

We talked after and he said he enjoyed it, that he liked to have sex for the experience and being close, that it wasn't all about the finish. I could tell though, from the way he was talking that he would have liked it if I was better and he had finished. Since then he's only gotten better at knowing which buttons to push and I feel like I'm getting better but will never catch up, like he won't ever feel the sort of ""wow"" he gives me every single moment.

I also feel like he seduced me for sex before both of us were ready. Like the way he planned everything, maybe I'm just not used to guys planning things like that. Am I just not allowing myself to be happy? I've never self sabotaged but it feels like I might be now. Like I can't admit to myself that I deserve this or am good enough for him.

Would you stay? Yes / No? Other advice. Has anyone felt inadequate and gotten over it? Felt seduced by your spouse for sex too early but it all worked out?

TL;DR - My (43F) new guy (38M) is way better in bed and I feel like he seduced me for sex before we were ready. Feeling inadequate and also not sure how to feel about the seduction. In over my head already but he's really sweet and I'm falling for him harder than ever!",0,1740594904.0,relationship_advice,8,0.43,False
1iyultn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iyultn/rf_brewing_connections_a_love_steeped_in_coffee/,[RF] Brewing Connections: A Love Steeped in Coffee,"**His POV**

My father always told me that passion alone isn‚Äôt enough to succeed in the coffee industry. I have the privilege of managing my own caf√© and roastery‚Äîa place I built not just for business, but for enjoyment. It‚Äôs the perfect hangout spot, complete with a private lounge where my friends and I can unwind, reminiscent of the things we loved back in my rebellious days. I‚Äôve always been the black sheep of the family, the one who strayed from expectations. But now, I‚Äôm thriving in this industry. Still, if I want to prove myself, I need to go beyond just doing well‚ÄîI need to dominate.

**Her POV**

What more do I need to prove? I‚Äôve pushed beyond my limits, exceeded expectations, and yet, I still feel like I have to do more. Have you ever worked a job that felt ironic? I‚Äôm not a fan of coffee, but I enjoy the conversations it brings. I‚Äôve learned to absorb valuable insights from people, turning those into knowledge I can use. Now, I‚Äôve taken on a challenge that pushes me further than ever: securing high-profile clients and expanding the company‚Äôs reach. I have to succeed‚Äînot just for myself, but to prove to my boss that I‚Äôm worthy of the promotion I‚Äôve been working toward.

Their story begins at a major coffee expo in Manila, an event that gathers industry professionals and enthusiasts from across the country. For Gabriel Flores, this is business‚Äîa chance to make a name for himself outside of his family's influence, the son of a prominent government official. For Jacqueline Santos, it‚Äôs business‚Äîan opportunity to find new clients and prove her worth as the General Manager of a well-known coffee solutions company in the Philippines.

To them, this industry is more than just friendly competition; it‚Äôs survival. Gabby is determined to prove that he can succeed on his own, independent of his family‚Äôs influence. Jacky, the breadwinner of her household, sees this as her chance to make an impact big enough to earn an executive promotion.

They don‚Äôt start as allies. If anything, they see each other as tools‚Äîresources to be used for their own gain. Jacky identifies Gabby as a potential dealer, a client large enough to make her boss take notice. Gabby, on the other hand, sees an opportunity to manipulate Jacky‚Äôs drive, using her expertise to benefit his business while staying one step ahead.

But as business intertwines with personal ambition, lines begin to blur. The more time they spend strategizing, negotiating, and outmaneuvering each other, the more they begin to see beyond the surface. Gabby starts to admire Jacky‚Äînot just her intelligence and determination, but the woman behind the relentless ambition. And Jacky, despite her initial wariness, begins to feel something she never anticipated‚Äîtrust.

Then, everything collapses. Jacky uncovers Gabby‚Äôs manipulations‚Äîthe calculated moves, the half-truths, the ways he steered her decisions for his own gain. Betrayal stings, especially when she had started to believe in something real. Disillusioned with the industry and with him, she walks away, ensuring that he will never have the chance to use her again.

A year later, the coffee expo returns.

Will they cross paths again? Will Gabby fight to win back not just a business ally, but the woman he never realized he needed? And will Jacky ever give him the chance to prove that this time, it‚Äôs not just about business‚Äîit‚Äôs about her?

**-------------------------------**

*Gabby spots Jacky at one of the festival booths, sipping coffee. He remembers she is not a fan of it because of his panic disorder. He approaches her cautiously.*

**Gabby:** ""Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see you here again. Thought you had sworn off this industry after what happened.""

**Jacky:** *Without looking up* ""I did. But some things have a way of pulling you back, whether you like it or not.""

**Gabby:** ""Look, I know I messed up. I‚Äî""

**Jacky:** *Finally meeting his gaze* ""Messed up? You manipulated me, Gabby. Used me to grow your business while I was just trying to prove myself. That wasn‚Äôt a mistake, that was a choice.""

**Gabby:** *Sighs* ""And I regret it. More than you know.""

**Jacky:** ""Regret isn‚Äôt enough. Not for me.""

*She turns to leave, but Gabby gently grabs her wrist.*

**Gabby:** ""Then let me prove that I‚Äôve changed. Just‚Ä¶ give me a chance to show you that this time, it‚Äôs different.""

*Jacky hesitates, her emotions warring within her. Then, with a sharp inhale, she pulls away.*

**Jacky:** ""We‚Äôll see, Gabby. We‚Äôll see.""

*She walks away, leaving Gabby standing there, wondering if fate would give him another shot.*

is this the version that all you are playing? or am i tripping

Cosplayers understand the‚Å§ importance of high-quality, ‚Å£long-lasting makeup, making `waterproof black lipstick`‚Å£ a ‚Äãcommon demand.
*   **For Makeup‚Äå Artists:**‚Å£ A versatile black lipstick is a must-have in any makeup artist's kit. It can ‚Å£be used to create dramatic looks, intensify other‚Äç lip colors, or‚Äã even used as a ‚Äçbase for unique lip art.

## What to Look For in the‚Äã Perfect‚Å¢ Black Lipstick Black: A Buyer's Guide

so, ‚Äãyou're ready to embrace the darkness. But what makes‚Å£ a *good* black lipstick? Here are‚Å¢ the key factors we considered ‚Äçin ‚Å§our ‚Äåtesting:

*   **Formula ‚Å§and Finish:** Do you prefer a `black ‚Å¢matte lipstick` for a classic, velvety‚Äç look? Or a `creamy black lipstick` for comfortable wear and a subtle sheen? Perhaps a `liquid black lipstick` for intense pigment and long-lasting color? The formula greatly impacts the‚Äç application, wear ‚Äåtime, and overall look.
*   **Pigmentation:** A good black lipstick should ‚Äçdeliver opaque color in a single swipe. Avoid formulas that are streaky or require multiple layers to achieve full coverage. ‚Å§Nobody wants a sheer, gray approximation of black!
*   **Longevity:** `Long lasting black lipstick` is crucial, especially for events or all-day wear. Look for formulas that resist fading, smudging, ‚Äåand transfer.
*   **comfort:** No‚Å¢ matter how stunning the color,‚Äå a lipstick is useless‚Äã if it feels uncomfortable on your lips. Look for hydrating‚Å¢ formulas‚Å§ that won't dry out or crack.
*   **Skin Tone Compatibility:**‚Å£ While black is theoretically universal, some shades and finishes may look better on different skin tones.‚Å§ Consider whether you need `black ‚Äãlipstick for fair skin` which might prefer a slightly softer shade or finish,‚Äå versus `black lipstick for dark skin` which can embrace deeper, more intense blacks.
*   **Application:** Is the lipstick easy to apply smoothly and‚Äã evenly? A precise applicator is essential for achieving a clean, defined lip line, especially with a dark shade like black. For liquid lipsticks, pay attention to the applicator shape and size.Some prefer doe-foot applicators,‚Äå while others favor brush tips.
*   **Price:** Black lipstick shouldn't break the bank.‚Å¢ There are excellent options‚Å§ available at various price points.Our ‚Äålist includes a range of affordable and high-end choices.
*   **Waterproof capabilities** If you‚Äã need a lipstick that will last a long time,‚Å¢ consider a‚Å£ `waterproof black lipstick` since this product is‚Å¢ most likely going to be long lasting.[[Explore Top Rated black lipstick black on Amazon.]](https://thereinventstore.com/lipsticks/?kw=black lipstick black)

The relationship ended due to financial irresponsibility and some concerning behavior.

Financial Issues:
	‚Ä¢	She had $35K in credit card debt and bought a $55K car just because she liked the color, bringing her total debt to $90K (by the time she‚Äôs done paying interest). She is also 30 and lives at home with no real expenses or rent. 

	‚Ä¢	She was earning around $21K/year as a realtor and hadn‚Äôt sold a house in 4 months.

	‚Ä¢	She didn‚Äôt know how to pay off her credit card and couldn‚Äôt clearly explain how she accumulated so much debt when I asked her

	‚Ä¢	She spent on unnecessary luxuries like $60/month culligen water delivery and two gym memberships while drowning in debt. I also tried to help set up a monthly budget and she refused 3 times as she didn‚Äôt want to show me her banking which makes me think there was more debt she was hiding. I only knew of the 35k and car because she told me. She would also say that she didn‚Äôt have bad spending habits despite the debt. And she would always say she is a self made woman while she lives at home and is actively losing money everyday. 

	‚Ä¢	I helped her get a debt consolidation loan and set up a meeting for her to see a financial planner, but she was defensive and emotional about it and came home crying as he told her she needed to double the amount of houses she sold 

	‚Ä¢	She has a pattern of instability ‚Äî failed her real estate exam 8 times, has 6 speeding tickets, and has been fired from 3 jobs.

Reckless Behavior:

She ran a red light last week to get to me faster.
Once flipped off a cop while we were driving. And she constantly blurs boundaries with other men and engages and seeks out conversations with them and says she is networking for clients. 

She also went out for coffee with an old tinder flame and said they were friends. She didn‚Äôt tell me until a month later. And I voiced this saying I felt uncomfortable about it. And then she asked if she could call him on the phone a few weeks later. 

Despite all this, I cared deeply about her. She started making some changes, but only after a lot of pressure from me. I felt like I was becoming her financial coach instead of her partner.

Did I give up too soon, or was this breakup the right decision? ",2,1740594416.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Since I was placed on 4 units morning & night for insulin (I was already taking 2000mg metformin with dinner nightly), my OB said it was best to come in and have our boy at 38 weeks due to the medications I was on, his size (which was 86th percentile overall at our 36 week growth scan), and my blood pressure fluctuation which happened almost daily. I have to have c-sections anyway, so we scheduled for Feb 21 at 2pm. 

This is my third child and the third time I had a c-section but I was still a bit nervous. I opted to also get a tubal ligation since we knew this was our last baby. This was the scariest c-section of them all. The actual time it took to get my baby out seemed like forever. My husband said it was almost 10 minutes. They said my scarring was minimal inside so I‚Äôm not sure why it took that long. Usually they have babies out within 3-4 minutes. This is what my old OBGYN told me when I had my others. Then the tubal ligation part lasted forever. I was in the OR for almost 1.5 hours total. 

I was light-headed on and off and the room was spinning. They were attentive to me and reassured me that this can be normal. But it was awful. The pressure of them pushing down and pulling on things during surgery was intense the entire time. 

Then I had to spend 2 hours in the recovery room. My blood pressure was spiking. I wasn‚Äôt actively bleeding like I was supposed to. They had to keep pressing on my stomach over and over to push the blood out because it kept pooling up inside of my torso. My uterus kept getting soft and they told me it needed to stay firm. They said it would only firm up when they pressed on it. So I ended up needing shots in my stomach to help with the bleeding. 

My baby boy was great thank goodness. They estimated him 7lbs 7oz at my 36 week scan. He came out at 8lbs 13oz 20 inches long. No issues. His blood sugar was 52 which they said was fine! And it steady went up and stayed in the 60‚Äôs after that which they said was perfect. They checked my fasting number the next morning after birth and it was 85. They said it looked great. 

Overall, I was fine and baby was fine too! I checked my blood sugar at home today because I was just curious. So I had eaten scrambled eggs, 3 small pieces of sausage, 2 pieces of regular bread with butter, and 8oz of grape juice along with my cup of coffee which contained creamer and sugar. My blood sugar was 95 an hour or so later. Yay! 

I‚Äôm hoping things stay this way and I‚Äôm out of the woods with the GDM. It feels so good to be able to eat what I want and need (within reason of course - I am exclusively pumping so I‚Äôm starving lol). I just wanna say that there is hope lol! I was so depressed and just ready for that nightmare to be over with. Thank you all for helping me through it and so sorry this post is so long if you have made it to the end. üòÜüòÇ",17,1740594367.0,GestationalDiabetes,2,1.0,False

Na MODUS ako late ko na narealize.

So, may meeting sa office with external (may mga bisita ganun) bumili ako ng coffee - 25 pcs. Nag order later ako since madami nga sya. 2:30 - 2:45 pm. Patapos na yung meeting wala pa yung order ko mga bandang alas tres wala pa. Pero yung nakalagay sa FP 1-10 mins nalang mula pa nung 2:30 tumatawag ako sa rider o store pero walang sumasagot. 

May tumawag: non-verbatim ‚Äúmam, hindi po namin mapush through yung orders kasi yung online payment po namin ay nag exceed na po yung limit, pero okay naman na po yung coffee need lang po mapalitan yung payment method, pwede po bang cash nalang‚Äù 

Dahil nag mamadali ako kasi paalis na yung bisita at WALA AKONG CASH nag fund transfer ako 8080 ko sa part na yun. After kong ma transfer yung payment dumating na yung order (so sa isip ko nun, baka nga nahold kasi dumating naman yung order after kong mag bayad). 

Pero mga ilang minuto yung payment ko na una na charged (Credit Card kasi gamit ko). Kasi delivered na nga raw.

Tinawagan ko ngayon yung tumawag kanina sabi daw ang mag rerefund ay yung store. Sabi ko okay.

Maya maya tumawag yung DRIVER nung Food Panda. Mag kano daw yung sinend ko na pera (dun na ako nag taka bakit nag tatanong yung rider). Tinawagan ko ulit, hindi na sya sumasagot.

Dahil malapit lang naman sa office yung coffee shop, pinuntahan ko. Ang sabi nung barista wala daw silang sinasabi na hindi na pwede mag online payment ü•≤. Sino daw yung kausap ko, kasi kinuha lang naman daw nung rider yung coffee kasi paid na nga raw yun ng CC ko. Na MODUS AKO! 


PS: wag nyo kong ijudge kasi nagtransfer naman ako ü•≤. Nag mamadali lang talaga ako nung time na yun. ",1,1740594137.0,Philippines,0,1.0,False

She moved across the country to move in with me, so we discussed me continuing working/figuring out school and her just trying to get a job. She's applied to several places with no answer, which I understand.

However, we keep having the same argument about the chores in the house. I work five days a week in a hospital, she does not even leave the house during the day while I'm at work. I have discussed with her that I expect her to keep house if she isn't working. I thought it would be a fair trade considering I'm the only one financially supporting us. She agreed. Here recently, I've seen a lack of things being done. Examples are: dishes being piled up and moldy, laundry room being covered in clothes from where she took them out of the dryer and never put them away, miscellaneous things on the coffee table that need to be put away, leaving food out all night instead of putting it away, etc. I consider these basic and easy things to do. 

When I confront her about it, she deflects the blame basically telling me l am the one that makes a mess. Given, sometimes I do make one and I'm too tired to deal with it. This is a RARE occasion though. I'm never the one using all the dishes, or wearing a shit ton of clothes every day (I wear scrubs to work), and I certainly don't leave food out after l've cooked. It's been a struggle financially supporting us both, and we've both made sacrifices to make sure the bills were paid, but I feel more than angry that she is failing at her end of the bargain. 

She's blamed me and told me it's all my fault, that I make the messes, and I never clean up after myself. Objectively, people might think she has a point. But, I grew up with a mother that was BEYOND anal about cleanliness of a house (""We might be poor but we will never be dirty!""). I honestly cannot even think straight if my house/room is cluttered or messy. It drives me insane. I've given her time and time again to fix it and i've spoken to her with nothing but respect when it comes to this situation, but she always turns it around on me. Am I the asshole, or am I rightfully upset about her not cleaning?",5,1740594106.0,AmItheAsshole,48,0.65,False

Some history,

I've had skin issues forever and finally seemingly linked it to diet a few years back. Mainly cystic acne on face and recent years on the sides of my neck, a couple on scalp and sometimes my chest. Certain foods clearly made it worse and cause my body to ache, especially in the mornings. I've had issues with nausa for a few years now, especially mornings. Few years I've been getting especially tired after meals, this has gotten significantly worse lately. I have an issue with my fingers, the bubbles and peels. Used to only appear as tiny blisters between my fingers. Was told it was some type of eczema or dermatitis. Past year or so I noticed my nails ""receding"" or lifting which makes me think my stomach isn't doing well absorbing nutients. 

I tested positive for H. Pylori awhile back prior to starting. Was treated and tested negative. Doctors ran many basic tests to no avail but found signs of inflammtion, acid reflux and I believe gastritis through an upper endoscopy. 

I've experimented with many of the suggestions I've seen online. Adjusting my salt intake, fat intake, water intake, electrolytes, and recently cutting out dairy (also was trying raw milk for awhile). I've been mainly consuming gf steak, pasture-raised eggs, gf ground beef, and gf butter and quality salt. I do have coffee, and although I don't think cutting this will solve my horrible symptoms, I will probably try cutting it out soon as well for a week or so. Had thoughts of sibo or something similiar and have tried to help with gut mobility. Had thoughts of mold exposure and tried things to detox.

Getting some styes in my eyes makes me think maybe oxalate dumping. I tried adding tea to see if it helped slow it down. No obvious improvement. I even switched to carnivore approved soap and moisturizer, mainly tallow. 

I'm desperate which is why I'm here. My joints are in pain. My shoulders feel tight. I feel so weak and my skin looks horrible and angry. I'm irratable and miserable. Lately after meals, the food seems to sit in my gut for hours and I feel extremely fatigued and end up just sitting there for a couple hours. Genuinely feel like I'm dying some days. I felt like crap prior to carnivore, but I feel even worse lately... 

Thank you for your time and any advice. <3

I am 24F in her first semester of grad school at Kennesaw State. I don't want to say which program because I don't want to give away my identity, especially since I'm having such a hard time already (and I've already embarrassed myself) I knew it would be difficult, new city, new school, new people, but God I feel so drained and discouraged, I'm considering leaving. KSU is one of the very few (there's two more) schools in GA with my program. It's an hour away from my home in Atlanta, but I figured it'll be fine and worth it. I even have been considering moving to Kennesaw so I can work on campus and possibly be a TA. But, now I'm having second thoughts. 

I'm not sure if it's just first semester adjusting or if it's really just gonna stay like this. I feel like I lack in my classes and I feel so out of place. I'm the only POC in one of them (in-person) and this is definitely one of the reasons, but also it's like everyone knows what they're doing except me. I'm underperforming it seems. 

In my undergrad, I was very confident. I worked on campus, had friends, TA'd in freshmen classes, volunteered, was president of the Creative Writing club, etc. I haven't had stage fright and ""presentation"" anxiety in years. But yesterday, as I gave my presentation for class, I could barely speak. I'm talking hands sweating, no voice. It was embarrassing and not what I planned. It looked like I just didn't care about my project but that wasn't the case at all. I just couldn't speak and the reactions of my classmates and professor just made it worse. This didn't even happen in high school..

When class is over, everyone walks right and I walk left. Every week, I do this because I just feel ashamed to be there

It takes time to adjust to new things and places sure, but Kennesaw is just so different..it's weird. I don't want to offend anyone, truly but the vibes are kinda weird! People seem a bit ruder and it's just strange. Yesterday, I got coffee and sat down at a table with four seats around it, a dude came and put his foot on the edge of the table. If he had added more force, my drink would've spilled, but then he looks at me like I'm the culprit? Huh? 

I'm not trying to make this into a sob story or seek attention, I just want to know if anyone else has been in my shoes or have any advice for me? Thanks. Be nice? Or don't lol. ",8,1740594031.0,KSU,1,1.0,False

I've done a lot of reading on here and I'm starting to believe that diet is the problem. I'm seeing a lot of comments on what not to eat, but I'm trying to figure out what I can eat.

I'm thinking that for breakfast I can either have Greek yoghurt with blueberries or rolled oats (made with water or oat milk) and blueberries/rasberries. Is that correct? But Greek yoghurt is dairy??

For lunch/dinner I'm thinking just chicken/fish with vegetables like peppers or quinoa? And am I right that I can add seasonings and spices? I'm seeing different things about red meat, I don't know if that's something I can have or something I should cut out?

I am a big coffee drinker and I've cut down to 1 cup a day. Should I cut this out completely? I saw someone say that ginger and honey tea is ok and good for Folliculitis? Obviously with no sugar.

Please help me. What should I eat? What about snacks? Which fruits are good and which should I avoid? I've seen people saying to eat bananas, but don't they have lots of sugar?

I hate that I have to start with a semantics disclaimer, current year.

My neighborhood is working class, families, residential area of houses and such, for context. Around here most of the people under 30 are ""Libertarian Eat The Rich"" and HUGE supporters of Trump / Elon because they are going to make America rich again. They have nice things, eat out often and enjoy being financially as stable as the next guy.

I'm moving to the mountains however, as I've spent the last year hearing phrases like ""changes are coming"" and ""we can't afford veterans"" and ""disability is no reason not to work"" and ""you took an oath to serve, not live on my dime"". It goes on, but you get the idea. I'm tired of apologizing for my service to people until the 4th of July when they get mad that I don't celebrate bbq day with them.

Just the other month I was in the management office for our townhomes, the manager was making a Keurig coffee while saying ""Veterans are just so damned expensive is all"".

I did the math.

The ENTIRE V.A. used to cost each taxpayer about $60 per month to exist, right down to my monthly freeloader money. With the cuts Elon made to restore freedom it's now closer to $56.

SO - while I have decided to move and work on shoving my service up my ass to protect freedom, I do want to get some honest, no bullshit feedback from around the state.

1) What are you going to do with your $4 per month that the cuts to V.A. suicide prevention programs saved you?

2) Would you like to see the entire $60 each month?

3) Do you also feel that Elon will help Eat The Rich and make all Americans rich again?

4) Is this just my neighborhood or does most of this part of the nation want me to shove my service up my ass and stop being a freeloading veterantard? ",113,1740593853.0,missouri,100,0.88,False

1iyu2md,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iyu2md,"Tyddyn Llan - Llandrillo, Wales","INTRODUCTION: 

A couple of weeks ago I visited Tyddyn Llan, a quaint fine dining establishment nestled in a smal village in North Wales, with my partner. I can say for certain that this was one of the finest meals I've had in the UK, and I have to apologise in advance for the poor photos, I'm not a great shoot and I was itching to eat during most of the shots. 

FOOD: 

Notably Tyddyn Llan is also a hotel, though they call themselves a ""restaurant with rooms"", which isn't unheard of in the UK countryside. We had arrived the night before, but after dinner service, so our first encounter with the cooking was breakfast. It was technically a 6 course set breakfast menu (though you can take things off if you aren't up for it). I asked the waitress why it's so hearty, and she said it's because a lot of their clients like to go on a hike in nearby Snowdonia, so a big breakfast is in order. I wish I had taken pictures because it was a gorgeous meal - from in-house toast with handmade whipped butter; handmade muffins and oats, locally sourced sausages, eggs (from the chickens of a member of staffs sister) and bacon. I don't normally care for black pudding but I loved the one given to us. Even the coffee was sourced from a local roaster, which isn't common in these sorts of establishments, in my experience. 

Now for what this subreddit is for, the dinner experience. To begin with, we were taken in to the lounges and given the menus for the evening and our canapes. The lounge was beautifully decorated and felt incredibly cozy and welcoming. We were told it was recently completely renovated by the new owners, the Head Chef and his partner and Front of House Manager. 

The canapes were gorgeous and I wish I hadn't forgotten to take a picture because they had this one play on the jammie dodger, made with chicken liver & foie gras parfait, blood orange & campari jelly, and a buckwheat & fennel biscuit that was to die for. There was also a nori and uni bite that was delicious and all ingredients sourced in North Wales. To pair, we had some some of the house cocktails, though they offer a wine flight and by the bottle, we aren't heavy drinkers so held off on that. CANAPES: 9/10

Next we had the bread which was a gorgeous sourdough made with a local stout beer, served with two types of homemade butter. To say that this was my favourite restaurant bread in a while would be an understatement - it was hearty, rustic, and delicious and the mushroom butter was great. BREAD COURSE: 9/10

Following that was a dish of local scallops that was well seasoned, though I don't normally care for scallops, my partner loved it. SCALLOPS: 7.5/10

Afterwards was a dish of braised pork cheeks, orange, and walnuts. I loved the pairing of pork and citrus as I normally find pork dished to be quite bland and the acidity worked great to soften the earthiness of the walnuts. PORK: 8/10

The next dish was quite possibly one of my favourites, it was crab, melon, and beetroot. It was so refreshing I was genuinely shocked. I didn't think thise flavours would work together, but lo and behold, I fell in love with it. To me this dish was almost like eating a summers day on the beach here in the north of England. CRAB: 9.5/10

After that we had a stuffed pasta with potatoes, a cheese sauce, and coffee. This dish was quite hearty and the texture from the coffee dusting worked wonders with the relative softness of the pasta and potatoes. The additional bitterness also helped cut back the richness of the dish as well, which was nice because I normally don't care for very rich meals. PASTA: 8.5/10

Next seafood was a sole with smoke ratte potatos and a cockle dashi sauce. The fish was cooked beautifully and the sauce was divine. My only critique is that I wish the potatos had been softer as I normally prefer them that way (never cared for a roastie). SOLE: 8/10

Next up was the main, where I got the lamb and my partner got the beef and I stole some from her! I've had my fair share of lamb growing up where I did and north Wales is famous for it's lamb, so I knew it would be great. It exceeded my expectations - best lamb I ever ate. LAMB: 10/10

As for the beef, it matched up as a very equal contender with the lamb. The night before we had eaten at Ynshir, about an hour away on the other end of Eryri, and had the wagyu there, and the British Black Beef we had at Tyddyn Llan was every bit as delicious, if not matching in just how buttery soft the wagyu was. BEEF: 9/10

Following this was a taste of local cheese and a citrus tart. This was the only dish I felt was ""okay"". Both components were fine, but I felt it was uninspired visually and gastronomically I can ""see"" the idea, I just felt that it could be rethought because how it was done left a lot to be desired. CHEESE: 5/10

The pre-dessert on the other hand was awesome. A perfect blood orange sorbet and ice with perfect cinammon and sugar doughnuts that cleansed the palate and increased my desire for more sweetness to come. This was better than most FULL desserts I've had at starred restaurants elsewhere. PRE-DESSERT: 10/10

As for dessert, it was also excellent. It was a citrus and vanilla tart. Beautifully executed and oh-so pretty, and my partner was full at this point and skipped hers so I couldn't try the other option which was a chocolate one. Not much else to say: DESSERT: 9/10

There was also petit fours and coffee/tea either at the table or in the lounge if you fancied a post dinner treat, but we opted out as we were quite full at this point. Just on an overall food experience I would say that this was in my top 5-10 experiences in the last year, only being beaten out by M√Ωse, H√©l√®ne Darroze, and L'enclume, and Core by Clare Smyth, afterwards it's a bit cloudy but on a dining level it was comparable to Moor Hall, Lympstone Manor, Ynshir, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the Hand & Flowers, and Mana. Overall: 93.5/100.

SERVICE: 
The service was friendly and non-pretentious, and quite professional. It felt like they loved their jobs and wanted to truly get to know you, the only downside being that my waitress was a bit older and had a hand cast on (apparently she had injured her wrist at home), which made me a bit uncomfortable watching - I would have preferred she rest at home, but she said she wanted to be in. Maria and Emily were very nice and welcoming throughout and knew everything on the menu and drinks front and back. Nothing seemed like rote memorisation, and Emily selected some great drinks for our food, including some interesting wines from more exotic locations including local Welsh and Moroccan. Overall: 7/10

LOCATION:
North Wales/ Snowdonia is a genuine contender for the most beautiful place on Earth (albeit rainy). The drive there from Manchester was gorgeous and full of beautiful twisty and turny country and mountain rodes. The property as well is a wonderful listed property that was apparently a hunting lodge in the Duke of Westminsters estate long ago. I'm a republican (British version, not American) so I didn't really care for that tidbit. The lounge and dining spaces have been gorgeously redone and were very inviting to be in, and using them for pre- and post-dinner was a welcome addition to the service. However, our room for the night, whilst comfortable was very dated. Apparently there is a reno atex room that's quite popular, and more renovations are on the way, so that's good news as I would have opted for that instead of the room we had which looked to be inherited from the 80s. Overall: 10/10 for Snowdonia, 8/10 for the building, 7/10 for our room

FINAL THOUGHTS:
On a purely gastronomic level, there are very few restaurants in the UK that are performing at a higher level at this moment, and I've been to quite a few in the UK. Relative to Europe as well, this was one of the best meals I've had in a fine dining context. After 10+ courses, a few bottles of wine, and a perfect breakfast - I felt that the price was more than reasonable and I look forward to going back in the spring or summer, and I am shocked they don't yet have a star. I wouldn't be surprised if this became a destination restaurant sooner rather than later (North Wales as a whole is a very underrated culinary hotspot), it's very, very comparable to Ynshir. 

TOTAL PRICE PER PERSON: ¬£185 for dinner, bed, and breakfast. Alcohol was another ¬£120.
