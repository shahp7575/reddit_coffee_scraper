1o7slhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/1o7slhr/iso_eds_accountabiliuddy/,ISO EDS Accountabiliuddy,"Hey my fellow EDS’ers! You know what drives me crazy? Having no one in my life who relates to this absolute BS of a disorder! 

No one who asks how I slept, and was probably also up half the night tossing and turning on bad joints. No one who gets it when I say I’m having a bad pain day, and can commiserate when I tell them the joints in my toes have gone all wonky. No one who gets stoked over new hacks and coping mechanisms like I do - have you seen how cute compression socks can be these days?! 

I’m not here for a full-on support group, I’m looking for a one-on-one buddy to chat with on the daily. Someone I can trade tips and tricks with, vent to, relate to, listen to, and commiserate with. 

About me: 
38 year old woman, she/her pronouns. Diagnosed this year with classical EDS after 12 years of hunting for an hEDS diagnosis. I deal with a lot of hypermobility-related issues and digestive issues, chronic pain, and fatigue. 

I work hard at wellness! Dealing with this sucks, but I’m lucky that I can still function relatively ‘normally’. I’m far enough into my journey of coping that I’ve found a few things that work for me and a few things that definitely don’t. I’m also very on top of mental health and have put a lot of work into getting where I am in general. 

This is all to say that I’m not just looking for someone to whine to - I’m looking for someone who’s working hard, too, and is willing to share their journey as well. 

I’m an optimistic realist who loves plants, cats, arts & crafts, coffee, weed, reading, and more. 

If you’ve made it this far, wow. Thank you! Shoot me a chat and tell me your favourite way to eat potatoes, while you’re at it. 

Peace love cope.

It is not that there is too much to clear, it is that I have no where to put most of it.  Mother's clothes, boxes upon boxes of cards, bins of my grandmother's jewelry, and all sorts of junk with no where to go. I was tempted to put it all in the basement but that is nothing but a landfill; like kicking a can down the road and being surprised when you trip over it again. I wished she'd let me have a garage sail; selling thins from Facebook just isn't quick enough.

Tomorrow, I'll tackle it again. Whatever closet or cabinet has an inch to spare, I'll put in there. Kicking the can down the road indeed. I didn't even get to part I actually wanted to work on. Clearing my desk and reorganizing some of the furniture. On the bright side, Father will be home all day tomorrow so he can help me move the heavier stuff without having to empty things first.

Aside from that, I didn't do much today. It was sunny but cold. I took Peach out for no more than fifteen minutes simply because she wanted to chase a leave or two and go to the bathroom being the rosebushes. No writing, at least not in the daytime. I was having trouble falling asleep again because all my best ideas seem to ambush me in my bed so I wrote it all in my notes app. I don't know exactly how many words it is; I'm not going to count and it is just disjointed bits of description or dialogue that I still need to string together in the actual manuscript. I'd guess just glancing at it that it is around 300 words. Getting it out of my system helped me get to sleep. Now, I think I'll try to write as much of it down in the actual story tonight while I have my evening coffee. I'm not going to stress about word count. I'll just get done what I can.

1o7saa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mediterraneandiet/comments/1o7saa2/complete_newbie_already_struggling/,Complete newbie- already struggling,"Hi all!

I’m a newbie to the Mediterranean diet (as in, started last week) and I feel like I’m doing this all wrong. 

For context, I admittedly indulged in fast food 3-4x/week before now. Mostly red meat, rarely any fiber. I love fruit, but I just stopped eating it in the last year or so, just because I was busy. The only slight positive in my diet was that I don’t drink anything carbonated and rarely drink any juices (think orange juice, maybe 2x/year). I drink coffee with unsweetened oat milk and 2 servings Chobani creamer, then move on to water for the rest of the day. More recently, I added in sugar-free lemonade after discovering how many calories were in Sonic lemonades. Some additional background is I haven’t been like this my whole life- the past few years were an incredibly busy and stressful time, as I’m sure they were for many others, but I didn’t cope well at all. No surprise, this had led to some health concerns that I’m trying to address under my doctor’s guidance with diet and exercise. 

Anyway, the problem at hand is now I’m second guessing everything. I thought I’d made some health swaps but the Fig app (just downloaded today) is telling me otherwise; that basically none of my food is compliant with the Mediterranean diet. I bought whole grain, low carb tortillas- not compliant. Whole grain wheat thins- not compliant. Chobani zero sugar creamer- of course, not compliant. Hummus for my increased veggie intake- not compliant. 

It’s flagging most of this due to a few preservatives, genuinely not many. My main question is this- should I be preparing absolutely everything from scratch?? Last week, I made a garbanzo bean salad with feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. The app flagged my lemon juice because it was the store bought concentrate 😞 I understand that’s a quick fix, but I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed and sad now. I don’t want to waste the food I just bought. I don’t plan on eating tortillas, wheat thins, and hummus all day everyday, but I thought they were healthier swaps. 

If you read this far, I really appreciate you. I checked out every Mediterranean diet book my local library had last night, so here’s to nothing. ",2,1760575166.0,mediterraneandiet,2,1.0,False

1o7s9d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1o7s9d9/trip_report_3_weeks_in_bologna_lake_garda_venice/,"Trip Report: 3 weeks in Bologna, Lake Garda, Venice, Ravenna, Naples, Sorrento & Rome","I got a lot of useful advice from following this sub, so wanted to share our experience of 3 weeks in Italy as a couple in our 30s. 

Some useful context: this was our second trip to Italy, and we've previously been to Milan, Florence, Rome and Sicily. Our aim was to see a variety of different places, with a mix of larger and smaller cities. We love museums (particularly historical ones), interesting cultural experiences, and my partner is a keen photographer. We like food, but we're certainly not huge foodies and didn't go out of our way to eat anywhere famous or overly fancy. We also speak a reasonable level of Italian, which was helpful in some circumstances, but we found most people reverted to speaking English, particularly in touristy places. 

**Bologna - 3 nights**

Day 1: We arrived at 5pm on a flight from Spain (where we'd spent the previous 2 weeks) and caught the Marconi Express to the city. The first shuttle was overcrowded and we literally couldn’t fit with our luggage so had to wait another 15 minutes for the next one (which was also packed like sardines). Had an excellent dinner at Trattoria Nonna Griglia and a stroll around Piazza Maggiore at night. 

Day 2: We wandered the porticoes, visited Basilica di San Petronio in Piazza Maggiore, and also took a guided tour of the Archiginnasio Palace, which was worth it to have some context and fully appreciate the Teatro Anatomico. For lunch, we had takeaway sandwiches from Salumeria Simoni for lunch, which we ate while people watching in the piazza. Bologna was a really lively city and a great place to simply go with the flow. 

Day 3: We visited Palazzo Poggi in the morning (currently free as part of the museum is closed for renovations) as well as the university's botanical garden, which was nothing special (we are spoiled for great gardens in our home country). Spent the afternoon in our apartment doing laundry and catching up on a few things from back home before dinner. 

**Desanzano del Garda - 2 nights**

Day 4: We spent the morning in Bologna, visiting the Pinocoteca (an amazing collection with zero crowds!) and the Luigi Cattaneo anatomical collection. Picked up sandwiches from La Prosciutteria which we ate on the train to Desanzano. On arrival we wandered along the lake taking pictures and then had dinner at Osteria Sapore Divino. 

Day 5: We had excellent sandwiches for breakfast from Panificio Non Sole Pane, before catching the ferry to Malcesine. Malcesine was packed in the area immediately surrounding the ferry terminal, but it was easy to escape the crowds by simply heading uphill a few blocks. We visited Castello Scaligero (amazing views!), stopped for gelato, and took a ton of photos of the amazing view. When we arrived back home, there was a local street food festival happening, so we grabbed some dishes for dinner and enjoyed the live music. 

**Padua - 1 night**

Day 6: We caught the ferry to Sirmione, which we found surprisingly disappointing after Malcesine. There were huge crowds everywhere and we struggled to find anywhere to eat that didn't scream 'tourist trap', so we cut our trip short at lunchtime and went back to Desenzano. We were originally meant to be spend another night on Lake Garda, but the train strike the following day complicated our plans, so we decided to leave early and spend a night in Padua. We arrived in Padua around 7pm (due to a delay in our train leaving), so had dinner near our AirBNB and went to bed. 

**Venice - 3 nights**

Day 7*:* Unfortunately the museums we most wanted to see in Padua were closed since it was Monday, but we visited the Erementi museum (skippable unless you love local history) and the Cappello di Scrovegni (an absolute masterpiece!). We also visited St Anthony's Basilica and the Prato delle Vella. In the evening we had aperitivo with a friend who lives in Padua, before catching our train to Venice, arriving around 9pm (regional trains were guaranteed to run between 6 - 9pm). It was raining lightly when we arrived in Venice and we had to make the 25 minute walk to our B&B since the vaporetti had stopped running for the night, and we didn't want to pay €€ for a water taxi. It didn't bother us since we had light luggage, but worth knowing for anyone arriving in Venice late in the evening. 

Day 8: We were apprehensive about Venice as we struggle with large crowds, but it was the highlight of our trip! We woke up early and wandered before returning to our B&B for breakfast - there were less than a dozen people on the Ponte Rialto at 7am. During the day we wandered aimlessly around some of Venice's back alleyways, before doing the Hidden Doge’s Palace Tour (the Secret Itineraries tour was already sold out when I booked, but this was a great alternative). We had a great dinner at Osteria Ai Promessi Sposo on the recommendation of our B&B host and then got an early night. 

Day 9: We took a day trip to Murano and Burano. It was raining when we left for Murano around 9am (luckily our host loaned us umbrellas!) which made for a lovely day to explore the island as it thinned out the crowds. We visited the Glass Museum and wandered into whichever shops caught our eye. By the time we got to Burano the sun was out and the whole island felt overpacked, so we decided to cut our losses and head home - people were literally elbowing each other out of the way to get on the vaporetto, which we found disappointing. Had dinner on the Fondamenta de la Misericordia with a lightning show backdrop (thankfully no rain), followed by some of the best gelato of our entire trip at Bacaro del Gelato.   
  
**Ravenna - 2 nights**

Day 10: Up early again today, this time to explore the Ponte dell’Accademia without crowds. Venice in the sunrise is magical and we loved seeing how a city built on water functions (such as the barge boats making early morning deliveries). We visited the Palazzo Mocenigi - I’m a huge fan of historical fashion - and then wandered around Canneregio until it was time to catch our train to Ravenna. We arrived in Ravenna around 6pm, checked into our hotel, and had dinner at Osteria dei Battibecchi. 

Day 11: We dedicated a whole day to the monuments in Ravenna and were able to see all 5 sites covered by the combined ticket as well as a few other sites. All the sites were incredible but my favourite was the Neonian Bapistry, with its more intimate size. We tried piadinas for lunch at Profumo di Piadina and an excellent dinner at Trattoria Al Cerchio. Originally, we had considered day tripping from Bologna, but we were glad to be able to take our time exploring the city and pausing between monuments rather than rushing through things. 

**Naples - 5 nights** 

Day 12: We had breakfast at our hotel and then caught a regional train to Bologna followed by the high speed train to Napoli. The train was delayed by an hour (we kept randomly stopping between Rome and Naples) so Trenitalia gave us a refund for 25% of our ticket. Arrived around 6pm, and had an amazing pizza at Pizzeria e Trattoria Sannino to start our time in Naples. I was a bit anxious about having booked a hotel on the Via Toledo when we saw the crowds on our first night (a Saturday) but it was ultimately fine - the crowds thinned dramatically outside of peak periods. 

Day 13: We walked through Chiaia and then headed to Castello Sant’Elmo to check out the view. In the afternoon we had fried pizza for lunch at Antica Pizza Fritta da Zia Esterina Sorbillo, and then took a tour of the Galleria Borbonica which was fascinating. 

Day 14: Some family members recommended the Royal Palace of Caserta, so we took a day trip. We had amazing sfogliatelle at a local pasticciera (F.lli Chirico dal 1996) and then visited the palace, which was modelled after Versailles (where we visited on our last trip to Europe). The garden was a little underwhelming in comparison to Versailles, but the palace itself is equally gorgeous and with significantly less crowds! Our only regret was not bringing snacks as the on-site cafe was average. 

Day 15: Pompeii day! We arrived at 9am (tickets pre-purchased) with the aim of organising a guided tour at the information desk, but unfortunately no one else was interested in a tour that day so we couldn't join a group and ended up just hiring audioguides instead. We spent 8 hours at the park (including stopping to eat the picnic lunch we brought with us), often doubling back to see various things between the tour group crowds. Such a long day, but an amazing one. 

*Day 16:* It was raining, so a good day to go to the National Archaeological Museum, which was a perfect compliment to our time in Pompeii - we were very impressed with the quality and volume of stuff to see. In the afternoon we strolled around Spaccanapoli and Via San Gregorio Armeno to see the nativity scenes, before a great final dinner at Na Bona Furchetta Trattoria. 

**Sorrento - 3 nights**

Day 17*:* We spent the morning in Naples, so had another fried pizza and a tour of Teatro San Carlo which was really interesting. We then caught the Circumvesuviana to Sorrento after lunch. The weather in Sorrento was terrible (raining and windy) so we did some laundry and chilled out at our hotel before dinner at Taverna Dell'800. 

Day 18: We arrived at the bus stop 20 minutes before the 8:30am bus to Amalfi and were still the last people allowed to board before it filled up (so much for off-peak). I've only been bus sick twice in my life and both those times were in Italy, including this trip. Amalfi was far too overcrowded for our liking, so after taking getting a coffee and a pastry and taking a bunch of photos of the view, we hiked uphill to the Paper Mill Museum, which was blissfully quiet in comparison - and also a really fascinating tour. I've always wanted to see the Amalfi Coast which was as beautiful as everyone says, so I don't regret going - but if crowds were this bad at the end of the season I'm definitely glad we didn't go in summer! 

Day 19: We decided to skip our planned trip to Capri after our experience in Amalfi, so instead went to Herculaneum. The train we were told would stop at Ercolano was late, overcrowded, and then didn't stop there after all, so we had to go all the way to Naples and back, making it a 2.5 hour trip. Herculaneum was a much better tourist experience than Pompeii - there were no crowds at all, even with it being a weekend - but I'd recommend at least getting an audioguide, as we were disappointed in the lack of signage explaining what we were even looking at. We caught the train back to Sorrento via Torre Annunziata and had dinner at Chantecler Trattoria, followed by gelato from Raki. 

**Rome - 3 nights**

Day 20: We last visited Rome in summer 2023, and at the time I felt like the only person who didn't understand the magic, but our second visit to Rome was incredible - the weather was perfect and we didn't feel the pressure to hit all the big tourist sites. We arrived in Rome around lunchtime from Sorrento and then spent the afternoon wandering around the Quartiere Coppede taking photos of the architecture. We had dinner at Trattoria Tritone 1884, near the Trevi Fountain (which was still surrounded by people when we left at 10:30pm). 

Day 21: We went to the Capitoline Museums, which were incredible (and so blissfully uncrowded). Afterwards we wandered through the Jewish quarter and had amazing flatbread pizza at Forno del Ghetto. We saw the cat colony at Largo di Torre Argentina and had gelato from Gelateria Artigianale Corona, before wandering up to Janiculum Hill for sunset, and then back down to Trastevere for dinner. 

Day 22: We had tickets for Galleria Borghese at 11am, so spent some time in the gardens beforehand. The Villa was incredible but I think I would have appreciated it more earlier in the trip as we were definitely burned out from seeing so much extravagant stuff by this point. Afterwards we visited Santa Maria Maggiore (we ran out of time on our last trip to Rome, so had to join the queue with hundreds of pilgrims this time, but it was worth it) and then did some last minute souvenir shopping. Had an excellent final dinner at Al Gallinaccio, including some of the best roast potatoes I've ever eaten. 

Day 23: Our flight home left mid-morning, so we caught an early morning Leonardo Express to FCO, arriving in plenty of time for our flight.

**Overall reflections:** we had an amazing time and were constantly surprised (in a good way) by the diversity of Italian history and culture. That said, this trip definitely reinforced that we're not huge fans of crowds or places where the sole attraction seems to be a good view for instagram. We're already thinking about our next trip where we'll likely take the opportunity to explore more mid-tier cities - we loved Bologna, Padua and Ravenna on this trip - and some of the less famous museums and historical sites.

1o7s6he,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1o7s6he/kokomo_private_island_review/,Kokomo Private Island Review,"TL;DR: It’s an idyllic tropical island with spectacular, intuitive service, outstanding resort food, and a unique character. 9.5/10 would return. 

Strap in—this is a long one!

**Booking**

I reached out via email to request rates and availability, though I could have booked via the website. I had a few dates to ask about, hence using email. The team was prompt and helpful. They require a 20% non-refundable deposit and full payment 60 days before arrival.

**Arrival** 

Upon arrival at the international airport, we were greeted by airport greeters planeside to usher us through immigration and customs. (This was pre-booked through the hotel for $50pp.) It didn’t save us much time as the airport wasn’t very busy, but I’m told it can often save a *ton* of time, and I believe it. 

After customs, immigration, and collecting luggage, you’re loaded into a Kokomo van and driven to the other side of the airport to the private terminals and Kokomo’s own lounge to wait for your flight. 

Checked luggage is whisked away, and cold towels and juice await. Coffee, tea, snacks, and Champagne are also on offer until boarding. There are lovely bathrooms and shower rooms if you need to freshen up after a long flight. 

Note: they are serious about the weight restrictions for the aircraft, and extra-serious about the weight restrictions for helicopter transfers. All of your luggage will make it to the island—just potentially not with you if you pack more than \~25 kilos. (But you can do the entire trip in a backpack—more on that below.)

**Transit to the Island**

Round-trip transport is \~$1200—included in the price of residences, excluded from the cost of villas—is either a seaplane or a helicopter, pending the Island’s transport schedule. We were on a seaplane both ways. The flight is shared with other guests and staff—or you can charter your own (and all your luggage) for, if memory serves, \~$6k.

The flight is 45mins by plane and 1hr by heli. 

**Island Arrival**

Greeting is lovely and efficient, if a bit awkward by my standards. Guest services and whoever is most senior on the island greets all guests, luggage is spirited to your room, and you’re ushered to a stone wall that doubles as a seat while staff sing a few welcome songs. I find it deeply awkward; most others seemed to find it charming. Immediately after, you’re sat in the reception/restaurant area, given a cold towel and juice, given an orientation to the property, and then driven directly to your room. 

**Room**

Wow. More on that below.

I booked a Sunrise room at $2800/night and, due to occupancy, was upgraded to a Sunset room. The rooms themselves are identical; the only difference is that the Sunrise rooms are an additional \~5-7 minutes walk to the main restaurants, get intense morning sun (and little to no afternoon sun), and are arguably more private.

And are \~$700/night less expensive in exchange for being able to catch the sunset from your room, the proximity, and (I would argue) a slightly better beach.

Were I to go back, I am not sure I would pay the additional $700/night to ensure I’m on the sunset side because I saw most sunsets from the main restaurant bar. But if you like warm afternoon sun to shade, you may be slightly disappointed on the sunset side. (E.g., every in-room pool we saw on the sunrise side was fully or nearly fully shaded by noon, while our pool had spots of shade from palm trees around 5pm.)

Now for the room itself: it’s beautifully done. The bed is fabulous, the design is wonderful, and the layout is killer. Nearly everything is thought through. I don’t love the seemingly out-of-place mini-split AC in an otherwise beautiful room, but c’est la vie.

Nothing else to note, you can’t see from the photos online. The rooms are spectacular. You could spend days on end rotating from your living room to outdoor day bed under the awning to your personal poolside chez to your chez on the beach. 

**Not sure where to put this, so putting it here: Laundry service is provided twice daily, with items returned with the next houskeeping service. Laundry is quick, high-quality, and very good with silk, linen, and other difficult materials. This is a game-changer. I wish the property did a better job of merchandising this ahead of time, as I could have done the entire trip in a small backpack, given how quickly laundry was turned around. I cannot overstate how magical this is.**

My only two real gripes, which I have on good authority will change soon, are 1) there’s no good nightlight, and 2) the minibar setup is uninspiring for how great the room is. 

**The Property Broadly**

This is one of the most well-manicured, landscaped, and cared-for properties I’ve ever seen. The gardening team alone must be a massive portion of the 400 people who make the island run. 

Aside from F&B, the property includes a totally serviceable spa (great treatments, super reasonable prices, fine facility), brand-new and quite good gym, a slightly treacherous hiking trail, tennis, pickleball, water activities, and I’m sure more listed on the website. 

Given the ongoing construction on the property, it’s clear that ownership is continuing to invest in its improvement, which is fantastic. 

Staying for six nights felt simultaneously like just the right amount of time and far too short a stay.

**F&B**

There are three dining outlets: Walker d’Plank, an asian-inspired beach-front “shack”, the confusingly-named “Beach Shack, which is more of a casual-feel fine-dining outlet, and an Italian-accented restaurant adjacent to the kids’ club and main pool.

We visited the Italian option once for lunch and found it to be good but not great. In part due to the quality of the food, in part because of the screaming children (we traveled as a solo couple), and in part because of the lack of views.

The quality of food at the other two outlets was generally *outstanding.* For food-included pricing, I’m impressed by the quality of ingredients brought in. The quality of cooking is so good that the dining experience wouldn’t have been the limiting factor to how long I wanted to stay, which is generally what makes me want to leave a resort. For me, this is very high praise. 

That said, I would slightly temper F&B expectations. Reviews on Reddit and elsewhere have raved about the food being mind-blowing and memorable upon returning home. It’s not that good—but it’s exceptional for a resort in the middle of the South Pacific. 

Each outlet has the same cocktail list. While it’s disappointing not to have variety between outlets, the cocktail program itself is *very* good. Creative and novel recipes, great drinks, all well-balanced, none too sweet. Some might complain about the prices ($25 was the average price), but when you’re paying a min of $2800/night AND you’re in the middle of the south pacific at a resort that has a competent cocktail program, I don’t think it’s worth compalining about the difference of $5 or $10 for a very good cocktail.

The wine program could use a little work. They offer exceptional choices from the Old World, very good options from the New World, and a small but commendable selection from Australia and New Zealand. With the taxes and totally valid markup, prices for anything except Australian and New Zealand wine are fairly absurd—and even the Australian and New Zealand wine prices are quite high. I’d love to see more local(ish) wine on the list.

In-room dining is a disappointment. The menus are simply breakfast/lunch offered at the Beach Shack until 5:30pm, and some of those dishes aren’t really designed to travel. (I’m told that this, too, will improve soon.)

**Service**

This is where Kokomo excels and massively over-delivers. Literally everyone we encountered was genuinely warm, welcoming, hospitable, and tried to find a way to provide service in some way. Every time we left our room, we were asked if we wanted our room serviced, if we wanted a lift, if we needed a dining reservation, activity booking, etc. 

Everyone we engaged with on more than a surface level seemed to genuinely love their job and the resort, said very lovely things about management and ownership, and interacted with us from the perspective of professionals helping to create an experience, not as subservient. We were \[first name here\] during our stay, not Mr and Mrs. It’s a refreshing experience, and a culture that’s difficult to find at such an expensive resort; it’s also not for everyone if you want a more formal service style.

**Overall Impression**

This place is magical with an incredible physical property, fabulous people, and boundless potential. 

There are a few bumps around the edges that a bit of training and outside perspective will smooth out. The property just got a new GM, who I expect will turn what is already an outstanding property into something truly world-class. (And I expect rates will also go up commensurately!) 

9.5/10 highly recommend—particularly before the new GM improves the product such that the rates get even higher!

1o7s5fx,https://v.redd.it/j8fxc16vbdvf1,OutIn Mino Review – It Feels Premium!,"Alright, I was inspired by another reviewer in this subreddit to give my thoughts on OutIn's latest release. the Mino!

I’ve been testing the OutIn Mino for a bit now, and I’ve got to say this thing surprised me. If you’ve used the Nano before, you already know OutIn has been one of the more serious players in the mobile espresso space. The Mino takes that core idea and just makes everything tighter, tougher, and smarter. To me, it’s a legitimate next-gen upgrade worth your consideration whether you have a Nano or not!

\---

# First Impressions

The first thing that hits you when unboxing the Mino is how intentional everything feels. The packaging is compact and presented nicely: espresso unit, basket, dosing ring, tamper/spoon combo, protective bag, USB-C cable, and even a little basket-removal tool. It all seems built around the idea that you’ll actually use this outside, not just on a desk or kitchen counter.

Compared to the Nano, the Mino’s footprint is a bit smaller but denser, giving it a sturdy, almost tool-like feel. You can tell immediately it’s designed for people who are going to toss gear into a backpack, not a briefcase. The threads feel solid, the seals are snug, it has a nice heft, and the whole thing has a matte finish that doesn’t scratch easily or show fingerprints. It just feels ready to travel.

**Unboxing Pics:** [**https://imgur.com/a/2KiKO4K**](https://imgur.com/a/2KiKO4K)

\---

# Technical Specs

On paper, the numbers already look like a leap forward:

* **12 g basket capacity** (vs. 6–8 g on the Nano without the Basket Plus)
* **IP67 rating** – meaning you can rinse it, drop it, or use it in the rain without flinching. I tested this!
* **9,000 mAh battery** – roughly 5-6 full heat-and-brew cycles on a charge, and an advertised 500+(!) cycles with hot water
* **22 bar pump** – capable of real pressure, not a gimmicky “drip” at all (more on that later)
* **Fast USB-C PD charging**
* **93 °C extraction temp** with a heating cycle roughly 30 seconds faster than the Nano

In practical terms, that means you can pull richer, thicker shots, and do it faster. The Mino hits brew temperature in under 2.5 minutes from cold water, which is pretty wild for a battery-powered device. And it doesn’t just heat fast; it holds stable pressure through the extraction, which you can taste in the cup. I’ll explain why in a bit.

\---

# Espresso Quality

The larger default basket means you can push more coffee mass, which for me translates to better extraction, rounder mouthfeel, and stronger crema. It’s subtle, but the Mino’s shots have a deeper sweetness than the Nano’s, with less of that unbalanced acidity and “puckered” intensity, and more balance.

The way OutIn designed the new basket is clever. It behaves like a pressurized system without killing nuance. That means even if your grind isn’t perfect, you’ll still get that satisfying body and crema. But if you use fresh, evenly ground coffee, it rewards you with espresso that legitimately holds up next to small home machines.

The pump also sounds smoother than before, which is kind of hilarious if they actually tried to improve this. It’s less “buzz” and more refined sounding. I suspect OutIn refined the internal flow path, because the Mino doesn’t sputter or hiss as much at the end of the shot. It’s consistent from start to finish with just a little bit of sputter at the end.

\---

# Built for the Real World

This is where the Mino completely distances itself from every other portable espresso device I’ve used. Most of these devices feel like a plastic toy. Not this one. That IP67 rating is no joke. You can literally wash it under the tap, use it in the rain, or pull a shot in the sand at the beach, in a fishing boat, or wherever — without worrying about grit or moisture. I have tested this extensively. Ha!

The Nano was splash-resistant; the Mino feels at another level of fit and finish.

The USB-C fast charging is awesome. I haven’t done any deep technical tests, but it charges noticeably faster than its predecessor. It is advertised as bump-charging from 20% to 80% in 45 minutes, or fully charging in about 90 minutes which I generally agree with.

\---

# Smart Design Details

With the Mino, it seems like OutIn listened to feedback around usability and maintenance:

* The dosing ring actually fits tightly with no wobble when filling.
* The tamper/spoon combo is light but functional and fits the basket perfectly. The average person will love this. As a coffee nerd who obviously enjoys being on the bleeding edge of tech, I would obviously like to see some additional tools for this come to market.
* The basket removal tool might sound minor, but it makes cleanup a breeze and keeps you from wrecking your fingernail.
* The one-button interface is intuitive and easy.

Everything about it screams “use me outside.” The waterproof seals, tight tolerances, and smooth-threaded components make it clear this was designed for people who actually go places. The premium feel is a noticeable upgrade from the Nano.

\---

# Battery and Heating Performance

OutIn claims around 5-6 full hot-water brews per charge, and that’s accurate in my experience. With preheated water, you can get a ton more. I’m not sure about 500+, because who is actually going to test that?!

The battery is a noticeable upgrade, and not just in capacity, but in consistency. It maintains output even at lower charge levels. The last shot tastes and extracts like the first. That’s something I hadn’t experienced with these self-heating units until the Mino, which gives you confidence to bring it on longer trips without babying it. The combination of higher-efficiency heating and better insulation means it wastes less energy, and you feel that in both speed and shot quality.

\---

# Puck Prep and Shot Quality

The Mino’s pump can spike to 22 bar, but what you taste is controlled by your puck. Keep the grind fine enough to slow the flow, level the bed, use light WDT if you want to break up clumps, tamp evenly, and leave a couple millimeters of headspace and with my experience it is almost hard to make “bad” espresso.

\---

# Why 22 Bar Exists, and How Grind and Puck Prep Turns That Into a Proper Shot

I have seen people online discussing the validity of 22 bar for a device such as this. Think of the Mino’s 22 bar as headroom, not a target. A portable, battery-powered machine has to deal with all the variables of brewing away from home: different elevations, cold gear, battery sag, and a wide range of grinds people throw at it in the field. The extra pump capacity gives the system the muscle to hit and hold a usable brew pressure even when conditions are less than ideal.

What actually sets brew pressure at the coffee bed is resistance. Your grind size, distribution, and tamp create a porous “filter” that the pump has to push through. Finer grind and better distribution increase resistance, which increases pressure at a given flow. Coarser grind or a channeled puck lowers resistance, so pressure falls and the shot gushes.

Here’s how each prep step affects that regulation:

1. **Grind size**  Fine grind = higher resistance = pressure builds toward 9–10 bar and flow slows to a syrupy trickle.  Coarse grind = low resistance = pressure has trouble really climbing, and you get a fast, weak shot.
2. **Distribution and WDT**  Clumps create micro-highways for water. A quick, gentle WDT with thin needles breaks clumps and evens particle density so the puck resists uniformly. That uniform resistance lets the pump settle into a stable pressure instead of oscillating between spurts and stalls.
3. **Bed leveling and tamp**  Leveling removes low spots that invite channeling. A firm, straight tamp tightens the top layer and standardizes overall resistance. You don’t need to crush it or anything, just a consistent, straight push.
4. **Headspace**  Leave a couple millimeters so swelling grounds don’t slam into the screen and crack the surface. If the puck hits the screen, you can get edge channels and sudden pressure drops mid-shot.

So why advertise 22 bar if espresso is “9 bar”?

Because 9 bar is what you want at the puck during extraction, not the maximum the pump can produce in a closed system. Manufacturers like OutIn are quoting peak capacity because it tells you that along with their smart chip, the pump has enough overhead to reach and maintain real brew pressure across variables: coarser grinds, colder water, higher altitude, and battery voltage dropping as you brew multiple shots.

* **Altitude:** Water boils at a lower temperature, and the system can be more prone to microbubbles and cavitation in the hydraulics. Extra pump headroom helps the machine overcome those losses and still deliver pressure at the puck.
* **Field prep variability:** If someone grinds a touch too coarse, the higher-capacity pump can still push the flow into a usable range rather than giving up a sad 3-bar trickle.
* **Battery and temperature swings:** Colder conditions and lower battery state raise the work the pump has to do. Headroom keeps the shot more consistent.

In short, the Mino’s 22 bar is the ceiling. Your puck is the regulator. If you get the grind and prep even remotely right, the smart chip helps the extraction naturally land in the classic espresso zone with the extra pump headroom acting like a safety net when conditions are rough.

\---

# Real-World Use

Although I’ve only had it a couple of weeks, the Mino has quickly become my go-to for travel coffee over it's predecessor. It’s reliable, simple, and gives a real espresso experience instead of a compromise like past iterations in this space felt. I also feel like, for whatever reason, the shot doesn’t go cold as quickly but this could be placebo as the temps it reaches vs. the Nano are virtually identical.

For users who have a Nano, it may seem like you’d just be buying a minor upgrade but I’d disagree. It’s more durable, more compact, more efficient, and honestly, more satisfying to use.

For anyone who takes their coffee seriously but also loves being outdoors, it’s one of those rare gadgets that actually lives up to its marketing. It’s built like something from a premium adventure brand, not a kitchen appliance. Pull a shot in the sand at the beach, on a fishing boat, in your truck or car, or anywhere else you want the ritual of coffee.

\---

# Final Thoughts

The OutIn Mino is easily one of the most capable portable espresso makers on the market right now. It takes everything people liked about the Nano and delivers it into a next-gen package with a premium build, better battery, richer espresso, faster heating, and actual waterproofing.

The Mino doesn’t currently have a Basket Plus option like the Nano did, and honestly, it has not been much of an issue. The built-in 12 g basket delivers nuanced, full-bodied shots that I’m after. If I really need more espresso I can just prepare another shot.

For context, the Nano’s Basket Plus could hold around 16–18 g, so it leaned more toward a double-shot profile, while the Mino’s 12 g sits right in that sweet middle ground of being satisfying enough.

That said, if OutIn ever releases a Mino-sized Basket Plus, I’ll order it instantly. The idea of stretching into true double-shot territory with the Mino’s improved pump and heating system would obviously open up more options and exploration.

\--

# TL;DR

**The OutIn Mino is a rugged, premium-feeling portable espresso maker that genuinely produces a fantastic shot of espresso. It’s faster, stronger, and more refined than the Nano, with better heat control, battery life, a more preium build quality, and durability. I think the 12 g basket is fine for the general use case of this product for most people, and while a Basket Plus would be a great future addition, the current setup already makes the Mino feel like a huge upgrade from past-gen devices.**

**I’ve attached a video of the first shot we ever pulled with a random “espresso-range” grind I threw at it. It was obviously not even dialed in, extracted a bit too fast, wasn’t weighed or timed, and I still got a balanced, syrupy shot with near-perfect sweetness, a great mouthfeel, and just the right amount of acidity. Insane!**

Now I finally see everything clearly.","We broke up October 5th. I’ve known her (F27) for 5.5 years a friend (while she dated her ex, we’ll call him Sam) and 3.5 years dated. We met at a mutual job. I moved in about a year ago with her family bc my household is dysfunctional and she recognized that and her sister and family loved me. I (25M) helped around the house, took trash out, cleaned up plates after dinner, little things to help out and paid $300 rent to her Dad. Before this, I had moments of maybe we aren’t meant for each other and talked to her about that bc our differences were too great. In the beginning of the relationship she had 2 guy friends we’ll call them Conor and Brad. Conor was innocent, tall, easy going, nerdy but respectful. Brad on the other hand was always off like he wanted her for body. As a guy you pick up on little things. One day, although I shouldn’t have, I had my suspicions and she sent him a message on discord (her monitor was open) and she messaged him “Goodnight :)” again, on the surface, nothing crazy crazy but when she claimed she wanted me and only me (about three months into the relationship at this point), it threw me off guard so I grabbed my things and said I’m done. She begged me to stay and I did. We continued to date and had genuinely the best two years of our lives. It was bliss, more than a honeymoon. We bickered about little things but she always wanted to fix them/go to therapy and I said no no no. As time went on, I felt like I could never fully trust her bc I was ripping my dab pen literally all day everyday for 5 years, numbing my receptors to her personality.

She also told me that she had sex with her boss after she called off her engagement to Sam (her ex friends with Brad and Conor) bc she was at a very bad low point and he had a gf at the time. I even asked recently (past few months) if she used protection and she said no. So she could’ve had a kid with her boss and it just made me feel uneasy especially bc she would go baby sit for hours and not tell me when she’d be home bc again parents take their time etc.

To give an idea of who I was before all of this started doing down hill in the past year, I booked us an NY trip and surprised her with pedicures (bought them the day before and we just had to be in a park nearby), when we got back I had rose pedals going to my room with candles in a heart shape. I believe this was Valentines Day and crazy enough she didn’t get me anything lol

The past year is when things went down hill, just me not wanting to go out anymore, I stopped sending her goodnight memes, stopped coming up to kiss her goodnight (I was in the basement and she was on the second floor). I dropped the ball bad. Once we moved in I just felt like, “This is it!” And stopped applying myself in every aspect of my life. I got skinner, eating less, caring less, short bc of online work to make a E Com business succeed etc (which did but at what cost). I stopped holding her hand in the car etc. little bids for attention she deserved and I didn’t do.

She came to me in the past weeks and asked if I wanted to move out and take a break/space and or breakup. I said I’d rather break up (again while high) not realizing my mistake. She also asked me if I’d ever be able to trust her and I said nothing. I stayed silent bc my weed brain and my emotions took over. It was selfish. She started crying and so did I. I want her to have friends but I just don’t want to get hurt but she cut off friends for me etc (which isn’t good and I told her that but again, it was me). She stopped playing online games to make me feel comfortable and would just play with her sister who lived in another state in a different time zone. Sometimes I would ask to do things and she’d play games with her sister instead which hurt but I didn’t want to interrupt her time bc it’s important to her.

That being said, on October 6th I came back to get my stuff and brought her, her favorite coffee and I said I’m not asking for a second chance. I’m asking for an opportunity to get to know you again (I said this while getting my things from the basement and she was on the stairs). She soft smiled and said “It sounds like ur asking for a second chance.” She said “It’s not a yes and it’s not a no.” She said she needs space right now. Which is 1000% understandable bc she needs to feel like her again before us. We went outside and she hugged me first and I softly kissed the side of her head. I packed up my things and had to come back again the next day. So on October 7th I grabbed all my stuff (she was colder today), I brought her a note I typed up (1600, words ik ik, a lot to process but I took my time and ran it through AI to ensure there was no bs talk or repeating errors about the situation, no manipulation, no guilt tripping, just honest reflection and genuine love of the favorite moments we’ve shared in the start of the relationship that made me fall for her), I brought her favorite candy, her favorite cake slice, washed her Snuggie, and gave her bath bombs bc she’s in school and is going through a lot. I said “When u can, no rush. Please read the note and just please don’t throw it out.” I then showed her the mental signs of decline with weed in a relationship and that was it. I finished grabbing my things and went downstairs outside with her, she hugged me again shorter this time and I stumbled over my words to her. She said “I’m disappointed in you”. While we were talking and I said ur right. I told her I threw out all my weed stuff and got a gym membership on October 6th and have been going daily. She said it only took us breaking up for u to do that half sarcastically but real. We always used to say “I like you” and I love you but to like leads to love and when I was stumbling after she wanted to go inside bc she was cold and wanted to get her school work done I said “I’m sorry dude I like you.”

The things that keep me in perpetual motion right now are, 1. She still has photos of her ex from years ago up on her Instagram. She deleted our Valentine’s Day photos but kept one up of us kissing at a wedding with me holding her face romantically. She still has me added on FB, Insta, Snap, Steam, and one mutual server but removed me as a friend on discord (which hurt the most but again I deserved it after being so selfish). I understand she’s cresting an emotional boundary bc she can’t see my name pop up. She told me she hasn’t been eating and had trouble sleeping after we broke up. She ordered her favorite meal on October 5th but couldn’t finish it and threw it out.

I sent her sister (29F) a long text saying thank you for the trips to her state and lots of other little things just regretting aspects of the relationship I should’ve changed. I said something like, “I should’ve slapped myself 10 times in this relationship but ur sister did it for me.” I wished them both great luck in school and she replied warmly saying sometimes shitty experiences are part of us growing and said, “I want you to know that none of us in my family harbor any ill will towards you, we loved you very much. I hope you and (ex gf 27F) can eventually get back to a place of friendship, whatever that looks like for both of you. And don’t worry, I’m sure she’ll read your letter 🫶🏻 take care, and feel free to stay in touch. ♥️”.

Now that the dust is settling, I don’t just miss her dearly, I realized how badly I dropped the ball in preserving our relationship but again, my ex now asked for space and I don’t want to violate that. My plan was a light warm, mature message on Thanksgiving and my ex’s bday is right before Xmas so just reaching out and saying I hope you have a wonderful/great day or something. But again, the longer I wait, the less she’s likely to hear me out on what I’ve realized now that my brain is off weed decompressing. It was my inability to trust that scared her off. I don’t know what to do now. I’ve signed up for therapy, been going to the gym, taking care of myself, and getting back to being who I was before. Bc the weed just killed my brain power but not my love for her. It just numbed it all and I see it so clearly now it’s like night and day. I want to win her back but again the longer I wait, the worse my chances become. I told her sister I’d provide indefinite space and that’s what I’m going to do. I need some insight here. I love this girl too much to let her go. Wayyy too much to let her go. I can’t throw away years of love and traveling bc of weed and my inability to trust. I need to more than lock in. My ex now told me “We were just too different” or “We grew apart into different people” and “You’re not my person” in the final days despite her saying “its not a yes and not a no”.

The Hidden Code of Chronic Back Pain: Unlocking Your Body's Forgotten Freedom

Imagine your body as the ultimate operating system—sleek, powerful, and designed to run flawlessly from day one. But life? Life is the relentless hacker, sneaking in glitches with every bump, twist, and stress-filled day. Over time, these tiny errors compile into a massive bug log, and nowhere does this manifest more dramatically than in your back. That steadfast pillar of your existence, supporting you through childhood tumbles, adult hustles, and everything in between, becomes a silent battlefield. Chronic back pain isn't just a nuisance; it's a cry from your body's core programming, begging for an update. And here's the game-changer: techniques like Neopractik Exercises coaching offer a painless, revolutionary way to debug it all, resetting your spine to a state of effortless freedom.

In this article, we'll dive deep into the true culprits behind chronic back pain—not the surface-level strains or aging myths, but the accumulated ""tension traps"" and neural misfires that keep millions trapped in discomfort. Through real-life stories of everyday people who've broken free, you'll see how these hidden mechanisms work and why Neopractik's gentle, nervous-system-focused approach is like installing a fresh OS upgrade. No force, no pain—just profound, lasting relief. Let's decode it step by step, so you can finally understand why your back hurts and how to liberate it for good.

The Bug Hunt: How Life's Little Glitches Build a Painful Empire

Think of your back as the backbone (pun intended) of your body's software. From birth, it's adapting to the world: learning to crawl, walk, run, and endure. But every adaptation comes with potential code errors. As a child, you might fall off a swing set, shaking your spine but bouncing back with youthful resilience. In your teens, sports injuries add subtle misalignments. By adulthood, it's desk jobs, heavy lifting, or even emotional stress that piles on the bugs.

These aren't immediate system crashes. They're sneaky subroutines—tension knots in muscles, slight vertebral shifts, or fascia (that web-like connective tissue) getting tangled. Your body compensates brilliantly at first, like an algorithm rerouting data around a faulty node. But over decades, the bugs stack up, creating ""tension traps"": chronic tightness where muscles forget how to relax, nerves stay on high alert, and pain becomes a default setting.

Take Sarah, a 42-year-old marketing executive I spoke with. Her story is a classic bug accumulation tale. As a kid, she was a gymnast, twisting her body into pretzels for competitions. ""I had a few bad landings,"" she recalls, ""but I'd shake it off and keep going."" In her 20s, long hours at a startup meant hunching over laptops in coffee shops, her posture crumbling under deadline pressure. By her 30s, motherhood added the load of carrying toddlers and diaper bags. ""It started as a dull ache,"" Sarah says, ""but soon I couldn't sit through a meeting without wincing."" Doctors prescribed painkillers and stretches, but nothing stuck. Her back had become a repository of unresolved glitches: childhood strains echoing in adult rigidity, all amplified by stress-induced tension.

Or consider Mike, a 55-year-old construction foreman. His bugs began with falls from ladders in his early career—nothing broken, just ""walk-it-off"" bruises. Years of hauling materials overloaded his muscles, and poor posture from leaning over blueprints sealed the deal. ""I'd feel fine one day, then bam—sharp pain that'd lay me out for weeks,"" he shares. These stories highlight the epidemic: according to experts who've studied thousands of cases, chronic back pain affects over 500 million people worldwide, often stemming from these lifelong accumulations rather than a single event.

The real villain? Your body's protective instincts gone rogue. Evolution wired us to survive threats—tense up during a fall to brace impact, then relax once safe. But in our modern world, these responses linger, turning temporary fixes into permanent traps.

The Neural Nightmare: When Protection Becomes Imprisonment

At the heart of chronic back pain lies your nervous system, the master programmer of it all. It's designed to detect danger and deploy defenses: muscles contract like a shield, nerves fire alerts, and inflammation acts as a barrier. Brilliant for acute injuries, but disastrous when it glitches.

Here's the biology: When a bug hits—say, a slipped disc from lifting wrong—calcium floods muscle cells, fueled by ATP, to create contraction. Once the threat passes, calcium retreats, and relaxation follows. But overload, dehydration, stress, or trauma can break this ""off switch."" Muscles stay partially clenched 24/7, like a compressed spring that won't rebound. Nerves, stuck in ""protection mode,"" amplify signals, a phenomenon neurologists call central sensitization. It's as if your body can't distinguish real danger from remembered or imagined ones, keeping the alarm blaring years later.

Emotional factors turbocharge this. Stress hormones like cortisol signal constant threat, embedding tension in your physiology. Psychologists note how unaddressed traumas—physical falls or emotional blows—lodge in the spine, that literal and metaphorical core.

Meet Elena, a 38-year-old teacher whose pain stemmed from a car accident a decade ago. ""The whiplash healed, or so I thought,"" she explains. ""But my neck and upper back stayed tight, like ropes pulling me down."" Therapy revealed emotional stress from the crash had wired her nerves into perpetual guard duty. Traditional treatments—massages that hurt more than helped, meds that dulled but didn't cure—failed because they ignored the neural root. ""It was like putting a band-aid on a virus,"" Elena says.

This vicious cycle is quicksand: Pain leads to avoidance of movement, stiffness worsens, pain intensifies. Science draws parallels to outdated software code, bogging down performance. Your back, as the neural hub, bears the brunt, rippling into headaches, fatigue, and even depression as resources divert to this endless alert.

The Dual Skeleton Revelation: Harmony or Havoc?

To truly grasp chronic back pain, shift your perspective: Your skeleton isn't one monolithic structure but two intertwined systems that must dance in sync. The axial skeleton (skull, spine, ribs, sternum, sacrum) is your stable core, like a tent's central pole. The appendicular (arms, shoulders, hips, legs) are the dynamic extensions, like movable limbs on a robot.

Their harmony hinges on key junctions: clavicle-sternum connections up top, shoulder blades floating near the spine, and sacroiliac joints below. These are biomechanical hotspots, balancing strength and flexibility. Misalignments here— from a fall, bad posture, or overload—create ""biomechanical stress,"" like a pothole jarring every vehicle on the road.

When stress persists, tension traps form: Muscles lock to protect, but forget to release. It's adaptive short-term but chronic long-term, turning your body into a misaligned machine—vibrating unevenly, wearing out faster, and demanding more energy.

José, the 45-year-old plumber from our earlier example, embodies this. One awkward job under a sink twisted his hips against his sacrum, sparking a trap. ""I popped a pill and kept working,"" he admits. Months later, chronic pain disrupted sleep and work. His two skeletons were out of rhythm, the appendicular pulling against the axial like dancers stepping on toes.

Why Old Fixes Fall Short: Attacking Symptoms, Not the Source

Traditional approaches—stretches that strain, massages that bruise, meds that mask—fail because they battle symptoms without resetting the system. Forcing a tense muscle risks backlash, like yanking a stuck drawer and breaking it. They don't ""negotiate"" with the nervous system to declare the all-clear.

In contrast, Neopractik methods address the root: Unsticking neural loops, releasing traps, and restoring harmony.

The Neopractik Upgrade: A Painless Path to Liberation

Enter Neopractik Exercises—a breakthrough technique that's like debugging your back's code without a single crash. Developed from decades of study on over 60,000 cases, it focuses on gentle persuasion over force. No hammers, no pushes—just a protocol that updates your nervous system, convincing it the danger is past.

The core: Neopractik Relaxation Technique. It uses subtle nerve stimulation to reset alarms, sequenced moves to signal safety, and vagus nerve activation for deep repair. Think of it as whispering to your body: ""It's okay to let go.""

How does the Neopractika Relaxation Technique help? Think of it as someone gently loosening those tense ropes. The technique stimulates the dermatomal nerves in the skin and myotomal nerves in the muscles, significantly reducing pain signals.  

Neopractik  Exercises ,applied after the relaxation technique, capitalize on the deep relaxation achieved, making it easier to stabilize the deeper muscles, ligaments, and tendons. These exercises dissolve biomechanical stress caused by tension in the anchor points between the axial and appendicular skeleton. They do this by correcting deep posture at these anchor points, restoring the genetic centers of gravity in those areas.  

For immediate effects: Muscles ""remember"" relaxation within minutes, sharp pains vanish, and profound relief often leads to dozing off. Long-term: Movement normalizes, protection mode exits, and freedom returns.

Sarah, our gymnast-turned-executive, tried Neopractik after years of frustration. ""The exercises were so gentle—I lay there guiding my breath and subtle shifts,"" she says. ""In one session, that constant pull eased. Weeks later, I was hiking without fear."" Mike, the foreman, found his ladder falls' echoes silenced: ""No more morning stiffness; I feel 20 years younger.""

José? After addressing his sacroiliac misalignment through Neopractik's harmonic resets, he returned to plumbing pain-free. ""It's like my body got an update—everything aligns now.""

Signs you need this: Morning stiffness over 30 minutes, ""tight rope"" muscles, pain unmoved by rest, or feeling perpetually ""wound up.""

Reclaiming Your Story: From Trapped to Transformed

Chronic back pain isn't inevitable—it's outdated code begging for an upgrade. By understanding tension traps, neural glitches, and skeletal disharmony, you see the true cause: A protective system stuck in the past.

Neopractik Exercises offer the effective, painless key: A holistic reset that liberates even chronic sufferers. It's not just about pain relief; it's reclaiming lightness, mobility, and joy.

If this resonates, consult a professional and explore Neopractik. Your back's hero arc awaits—debug the glitches, and move unburdened into your next chapter. What ""stuck"" feeling will you release first?

1o7s278,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1o7s278/5_years_on_still_cant_get_my_ex_off_my_mind_and_i/,"5 years on, still can’t get my ex off my mind… and I hate it.","We met in 2020, just after the tumultuous uproar of COVID had began to die down. It’s funny how that period reoriented our lives, I can’t say mine has ever felt quite the same. 

She was living at home when the lockdowns had been enforced and had inadvertently taken the brunt of her parents pending separation, which had been exacerbated by the increased proximity. I(M) on the other hand breezed through any lockdowns due to demand of my job and the nature of my work being deemed “essential”. 

When we met it felt like kismet. I felt I had been seen, and I saw her. There was a strange amount of comfort, despite being such different people. We never grew tired of each other’s company, I’ve honestly never felt that prior or since. Our relationship wasn’t immediately sexual either, it honestly followed what would in all instances be considered “healthy”. When we did, it was deeply intense and deeply satisfying. We couldn’t keep our hands off one another through the whole relationship. Nothing has ever felt like that, nothing has ever felt like her. Nothing prior. Nothing since. We were insatiable, totally lost in one another. 

Our differences, while vast, hadn’t ever been a cause of conflict. We were polarised in almost every single aspect of ourselves. Politically, our beliefs, our family dynamics. Somehow, none of it seemed to matter in the midst of it… “love will conquer all”… but I am also realistic, and I really don’t know how we would’ve looked over a lifetime.

Our relationship began to strain once our families became involved. Her family was obviously going through the separation as mentioned prior. Her mother was overbearing and incredibly neurotic, juxtaposed to her father who was emotionally unavailable and distant. Her mother began to voice concerns about she was worried she would end up marrying me, how she would leave her and no longer be there for her. My ex had voiced her grievances about her mother, how love felt very conditional and how she had been confused by her mother’s ambivalence at times growing up. Her father, while no better, had at least been consistently aloof. From what I saw, these were people who could provide for their children financially, but never emotionally. There was a lot of baggage in this respect. 

My family was the polar opposite, I have always felt loved and supported in all regards. While my mother never said anything while we were together, she vehemently expressed the relief she felt when our relationship ended. My mother had no idea what I was thinking. She pointed out our differences in length, how it was doomed from the beginning. She wasn’t wrong, but it still landed bitterly. 

Our relationship ended abruptly, we were on a trip visiting my home town. Things had blown up considerably at home, her mother was calling and texting her incessantly. Telling her “she should be at home with her”. Eventually, her mother demanded she come back home. She was on a flight back hours later and that was the last time I ever saw her. 

We texted when she got home, I was hurt and concerned about what had transpired. I was also hurt for her. This was the first time I had clearly seen  the vast chasm that separated us… which I came to learn is something her mother also pointed out to her. It felt like everyone could see how doomed this was except to us who were in it. I went for almost a day without hearing from her, which was unusual. After a brief text exchange where I voiced my concerns, she assumed I was breaking up with her and removed me off all of her social media. 

Days later, she texted me and told me it was an irrational knee jerk reaction. Understandably, she had been suffering a lot of stress and anxiety, but granting what I had seen and heard, I said I was struggling with the volatility… We remained broken up and to this day I believe it was still the right decision. 

I can rationalise it, I can tell you all the reasons why we shouldn’t be together, why I wouldn’t want to be with her… what my life might look like had we ended up together… but for whatever reason, my mind… my body…. cannot forget her. I feel tormented. 

Nothing has ever felt like her. To this day I still feel this longing for her, her touch. My body is still driven mad by the thought of her. I’ve compared everyone since to her, and they all fall short. I’ve never climaxed like when we were together, nothing has ever felt as raw… as good… or as deeply satisfying. To this day I’m still insatiable for her… my body just wants her and I hate it. 

This is all made worse by the fact, at the end of last year we ended up coming back into contact by absolute chance. It was strangely comforting, we fell straight back into our groove. We spoke on the phone, it was all incredibly natural…it felt like it had years ago. I had these high hopes that maybe things would be different this time, maybe the years had fixed what had went wrong between us.

After a week of talking and texting, becoming reacquainted with each other, what had happened in our lives… Our messages became quite suddenly sexual after an offhanded remark. I, foolishly, shared  the feelings I still hold, that I’ve never been able to shake. I told her how I longed for her this whole time, how nothing has ever compared to her…. Then she shared back she had felt exactly the same. We spoke at length how nothing ever felt like each other, nothing ever felt as good or as right. She told me she had compared everyone else to me since and nothing compared. I sincerely couldn’t believe what I had heard. All her feelings were mine. I hadn’t been suffering alone. 

We spoke about it in depth and at length. Our minds running wild with our memories. We shared how we both had fantasised about each other while with others… We had masturbated to the memories of each other countless times. It was intense. She told me that I was the only man she’s ever climaxed through penetration… and the hell it’s been comparing others to me and everything falling short. 

We were so excited to see one another, it seemed like after all this time maybe there was some greater meaning to not ever being able to forget her. Ironically, I got quite ill with Covid when we were supposed to meet. By the time I was well enough, she had a planned family holiday to see family abroad and that delayed us from being able to see one another of 6 weeks. 

During this time, we both questioned whether it would be the right thing to do… we both had these intense sexual feelings… lust for one another… but neither of us wanted to jump straight back into an intense sexual relationship. She grew more distant over time… as did I, painfully reminded how fraught with peril the predicament was. 

A few months later, our dialogue started again. After a few days of talking, she shared how she wanted to see me, and I felt the same. Despite this, nothing ever eventuated. We suggested we meet for coffee. We organised the date, to get coffee on the Sunday. Then she ghosted me. 

I have no ill feelings towards her, and truth be told, I was also incredibly weary of where things may lead. I assume she came to the same conclusion as I did. I know it is doomed.

What I hate is that even after all this time, she’s the only one I want.. the only one my body wants. Despite all my efforts to forget her, I cannot. Nothing stirs me up inside or arouses me like she did. It’s hell. Even in my dreams I’m tormented. 

The longing for her never left… and I really wish it would. ",2,1760574538.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

You can travel visa free to pretty much any country in Kenshi(HN might complain at the border, but who cares), while irl barely, depending on if you are born a tech hunter or a cannibal in Black Finger. 

You can have a harem of royal shussy and they will even feed your ass, while Beep is bringing you freshly made sake, and Burn with Sadneil telling you stories about good old times and wonderful adventures instead of brainwashed crap about avocado toasts and Starbucks coffee. In real life a random bar fly in Eyesoket will demand you to catch a Bugmaster to join your squad, while not being a daughter of the shek queen… ah, and she can always dismiss herself, taking half of your leviathan pearls you have been struggling so much to get. 

In Kenshi you can become richer than every noble combined in a couple of days, while in real life you will be that nerd who comes to a store saying “I can’t afford that”, not those fat ass nobles and tech hunters. 

In Kenshi medical supplies cost cheaper than bread, while in real life you have to sell your father’s masterwork samurai set to get a  hiver’s prototype left arm. 

In Kenshi you don’t have to commute to work for 3 hours, stuck in traffic, in Kenshi you are the car and the bike, running faster with your scout legs than a real life Arabian horse. 

Not speaking of work life balance, since in Kenshi you can become the best smith in a week or so, and live in prosperity while in real life you work 60 hours a week in Stone Camp, and you don’t even get ration packs and protection from skimmers.

Another day off was welcome—another day to plan my next night.  I sifted through my phone, looking for any articles I could find on sleep paralysis and ways to deter it.  Most of the info was obvious but useless: form a consistent sleep schedule, reduce stress, avoid drugs and alcohol, keep a night light on for mental comfort, etc.  There were always mentions of medication or to seek medical help if needed, all of which I knew I would be too soon to seek.  No doctor would prescribe something to a guy who had only suffered two nights of this.  

Noon came along.  Nothing hopeful.  My task shifted to memory recovery.  I scrolled through my phone's photos, hoping to recall faces and the names attached to them.  Locations, vacations, work-related trips, anything to pull my recollection out of the bog.  I wrote all my contact info onto a separate piece of paper, forcing myself to connect a name and number to whoever’s face I would slide to.  

I managed to pair up a couple of people with their names, even remembered a friend's giving party, thanks to a very unflattering picture of me passed out on a couch, with my college friends writing “sucks at Mario Kart” on my face.  Actually, dorks and very innocent compared to what I would have written.  Then I came across a picture of my Mom and Dad, sitting in the living room holding up what must have been a Christmas present from me.  It was a box of clay coins I had made in the backyard with our abundant supply of red clay and rain.  My parents looked way too young.  It took me a second to realize this photo wasn’t taken with a phone.  This was a download from a digital camera.  A picture I treasured enough to keep all these years.  It was our first Christmas without Dan.  

Like Pandora's box, a flood of childhood memories burst through my head all at once.  The trip.  The accident.  Why I wasn’t there.  I had been sick; it was Easter Sunday.  My parents were still practicing Catholics.  They insisted we go to church for mass that morning, and I had woken up with the flu and fought tooth and nail to stay in bed.  They capitulated.  My brother wasn’t so lucky, and now he had to go to church, without me for entertainment.  He lied and fought to stay home with me, saying he was sick too. But my parents saw through his act and took him along.  I gave him a wave goodbye from my bedroom window as he got in the car with a tear-stained face.  That was the last time I saw him.  He was seven.  

I stared at that Christmas photo, into the sunken, tired eyes of my parents, who desperately patched on smiles for the picture I certainly must have taken.  I’m sure they blamed themselves for Dan’s death.  I wouldn’t know, though.  They remained stoic on the topic for the rest of my formative years. 

Another thought hit me with a sense of deja vu that rocked me.  I should have been with him.  I wasn’t sick with the flu.  I was, at best, suffering from allergies.  But I knew how to play it up.  I was ten; I was much more sophisticated in the bullshitting department.  A guilt bore into my stomach with a familiarity that confirmed that I had suffered from this feeling long before now.  A guilt that I had carried and momentarily forgotten.  

The rest of the afternoon was a blur, weighed down by an unease that rattled me.  All this information being revealed and connected as I pursued a resolution for my sleep paralysis felt too coincidental.  More, I needed to recall more of my time with Dan.  I knew he had to have confided in me things he would never tell Mom and Dad; surely, there was something I had forgotten from that period.  We shared the same bedroom; there is no way I never once witnessed one of his episodes. 

Hopping on my laptop, I dug through the archive of years-old photos I had.  Family photos from over a decade ago, downloaded and saved for this niche utility I never thought would be required.  One more, just one more memory-jogging image was all I wanted.  Another memory out of the bog.  A single picture popped up, of me and Dan, dressed for Halloween.  He was Spider-Man, and I was the Green Goblin.  The flash of the camera revealed us posing in our bedroom, which was a cluttered mess of costumes sprawled over a field of Legos coating the carpet.  That bedroom, its bunk bed pressed into the corner, next to the closet doors.  The switch I was blindly searching for had been flicked.  A distinct memory projected to the forefront of my mind.  

It was a week before the accident.  I woke up on the top bunk to the sound of my brother whimpering below me.  Another restless night, and I was annoyed to be losing sleep because of it.   Like a selfish kid, I tried ignoring it and putting my pillow over my head.  I hated having to save him every night.  I resented being the watchman for his episodes.  And it was almost every night.  Drifting back into the opium of sleep, I snuffed out Dan’s noise.  Then the bed began to shake.  

Frustrated, I tore off my sheets and looked below to witness my brother jolting his body limply, tears streaking down his cheeks as a scream choked him, unable to escape his throat.  This was a bad one.  I jumped from the top bunk and embraced Dan, chanting reassurances, all things my Mom taught me to do when my little brother suffered particularly bad nights.  This eased the shaking, but the whimpering continued.  I turned to him, expecting him to be fully awake again.  I saw him staring, eyes wide and red, unblinking at the corner of the room just at the foot of our bed.  Dan, hyperventilating, rustled to life as I gave him another hug and moved his head.  With a gasp, his arms came to life and wrapped around me as he shook, sobbing, into my shoulder.  

This must have been the first time I acted like a real big brother, because I recall being deeply shaken by my little brother’s distress.  That emotional singe bore into me and I found myself genuinely wanting to comfort him, something I was too selfish to care about before.  I hugged him back, promising to let him play any of my Gameboy games he wanted in the morning.  With the shaking ceasing, indicating I was helping, I continued bargaining with promises of comic books, Gameboy time, and even dibs on the Gamecube next time he wanted to play ahead of me.  He finally mellowed out, his whimpering easing to a hiccup.  I never noticed how small he was until then.  

“He said he wants to trade places with me.”  

My brother's muffled voice eeked out from my shoulder.  I remember clearly again.  I then went to get Mom, assuming he had just had an especially bad nightmare.  The rest of that night remains a blur.  Dan’s tear-stained face is the only thing I recall vividly from the remainder of the early morning.  

Night terrors, passed up from my little brother to me.  A pattern.  Something to steady myself with, even if daunting in its strange implications.  I rattled my brain trying to remember more of Dan’s episodes, what he said he saw, when they were worse than others, anything that could clue me in on if this was some odd family disease I had awoken after the accident.  I glanced out my window to be greeted by a full moon, beaming into my living room.  I turned to my clock.  

10:13 PM.  I made a pot of coffee.  A desire to avoid the inevitable sleepless night to come was all I could cling to.  Cup after cup.  A chemical cocktail of caffeine and dread to fuel my listless scanning of blurry recollections.  

Inevitably, my brain would return its fixation onto what Dan said, “He said he wants to trade places with me.”  A shiver ran through me.  I can’t imagine how horrible his episode must have been compared to mine, at such a young age.  Another thought was triggered from this contemplation: *Did he ever* describe *what he saw*?  Sitting on my couch, I stared ahead, churning my mind, as the clock ticked past 3:00 AM.  No work tomorrow.  This was the last thought I had as I nodded off in the dimly lit living room.  The single lamp in the corner watched over me, its soft light cascading sharp, large shadows across the room.

My eyes shot open, dry and wide.  The clock sat on the wall, reading 5:12 AM.  Sitting upright still, I attempted to get off the couch.  Only to discover the nightmare was happening again.  Limp arms lay worthlessly at my sides as I sat, heart racing, waiting for the clock to reassure me that this, too, would pass.  The lamp’s once calming light was now a fiend desecrating the room’s corners with shadowy vestiges for the unknown terrors I anticipated.  There was no hiding.  Directly in front of me, looming next to the TV, stood the surreal specter I had hoped to avoid tonight.  The tower of shadow reached the ceiling, its head bent to fit in the room.  Its face, a spiraling whirlpool of random eyes, was its only feature revealed from the lamp’s dim illumination.  

Bending its torso in inhuman flexibility, it lowered its head toward me.  My stifled whimpering tremored through my living corpse as I gazed into unblinking eyes, which now hovered directly over me.  Breath locked in my lungs, I choked in the familiar helplessness, waiting for the clock to ring in my freedom.  Its vertical maw opened breathlessly, revealing the cave of fangs and teeth.  In that ethereal multiplicity of voices, it said, “I know you.  Can we trade places now?”   

Ice filled my heart.  The familiar phrase lingered in the air like a smog.  I couldn’t answer.  It stood over me all the while, peering into my bloodshot eyes for a response I was incapable of uttering.  Despite my involuntary silence, my mind was ringing during the long silence.  *It knew my brother, it knew my brother, it knew my brother.*  A fiend, a presence I could not have anticipated, had encroached on me while I regained my memories.  Sitting there paralyzed, I wallowed in fear as I gazed at a family visitor I had either forgotten or removed from my mind purposefully.  Numerous eyes stared back at mine as they welled up with a deep sorrow for my little brother, a sympathetic sorrow I had never felt before. 

It left as abruptly as it came, leaving me alone in a lingering coat of sweat.  Breathing heavily, I remained sitting, my thoughts locked on what had just occurred.  The coincidence was too much, the phrase too precise.  I needed to remember what Dan saw.  I had to know if these were the same events he suffered from before his accident.  The pattern was too similar- and the end results too horrible to consider.  ",1,1760573929.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1o7rtxx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7rtxx,Why does my stomach bloat so much after eating everyday?,"(1st is before)

In the morning, or the natural state of my stomach without eating anything is fairly flat, and I don't carry a lot of fat around my stomach. However, this problem has been very persistent for a few years but I never paid much attention until recently.

Whenever I eat, no matter WHAT I eat, my stomach blows up like a balloon. Today, for one of my meals I only ate a stuffed patty and drank water, though half an hour later I noticed my stomach literally looks like I'm 4-5 months pregnant, and also I feel full and uncomfortable for some reason. Another thing is I always am gassy after I eat.

I also feel extremely fatigued after I eat if I don't drink coffee. I get really sleepy and I just want to knock out and take a nap.

I eat at a pace slower than others usually, and my diet is somewhat clean. I think my calorie intake is usually around 1600 per day?

The only reason I can think of may be lack of exercise? I'm embarassed to admit but I feel like I don't move around much besides walking short distances... should I start out by exercising more?

Does anyone have a solution or suffer from the same issue?",11,1760573894.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,30,0.63,False

I'd really appreciate your opinion on this. I heard differing opinions from OBGYNs and I'm confused as to what to do going forward.

Some history - I'm 32 years old. My periods have never been on time and it hurt too, but I never cared much for it. 5 years ago during pandemic I gained a lot of weight and it became worse. I have PCOS so I just bore with it - sparse and painful periods. I have had swelling/ inflammation in my fingers and toes - on/off for about two years ago. 
I drink alcohol only during social events and I had a little too much 4 months ago. The next two days, I was living on coffee and started getting a dull pain in my lower right abdomen, went to the ER and they told me that it was cysts. My gynac told me that I should wait for the cysts to be cleared as they were only olive and orange sized. After a month, they were cleared but my pain didn't get better. I started having pain in my lower half of the abdomen like someone was kneading my internal organs. It came in waves - also spread to my anus. Got pelvic checked and all that and the doc said that it might be endometriosis. 
She told me that I can do either BCP/OCP, BC implant, or laproscopic surgery if needed. It could be endometriosis/ adenomyosis (from TransVaginalUltrasound) or IBS. She told me with lap hysterectomy would be the worst case scenario . I don't want kids, so I was okay with it. But she went on maternity leave and I got transferred to another Doc. The new one said that we should start with laproscopic surgery eliminate endo before doing anything else. 
In the past few months, I've been even having more migraines and fatigue. 
Last time I did BCP, it was terrible for me. Until someone pointed out, I didn't even understand what was happening with me. I was so depressed. 
I asked the doc for pros and cons of surgery - they said pro is that we can find out what's happening and there is no con. I live by myself with my family very far away. I don't really have anyone to be with me after the surgery. So I'm looking for suggestions/ comments - it's hard making this decision.

P.S: Sorry for the long post.

I used Joomla long ago, probably back to version 1.0 or 1.5. That was when I worked in web development. I haven't kept up completely over the last few years, so I am not as familiar with the advancements, changes, and whatnot that Joomla has undergone.

What I am wondering is if I could still use it like a portal, so several sections holding data or information. I was thinking of finding a wiki extension to have a knowledge base related to some personal hobby stuff. Then I am thinking I would either use the internal tools to make a personal daily journal (or use an extension if needed). I could even see adding a photo gallery or something else.

But I would set Joomla as a private site, so I can control who I want to share what information with. I could see adding a section related to home things (grocery list, book or movie collection, etc.) that I would share access with my wife. But I would want to keep my journal private that only I can access. I am pretty sure Joomla has the built-in settings and tools to accomplish this.

So based on what I am hoping to do (see above), does Joomla seem like a good way to go? I appreciate any questions or concerns, and if I didn't cover something you need to know to be able to answer my question, just ask. Thanks in advance!

She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

Personally, I miss my ex. I broke up with her and I wish I hadn't some days, other days I feel relieved. Some of the times we had together were good. Other times I questioned why we were together. But now that we aren't together, I do miss her and I will continue to miss her until she becomes a stranger.

I find myself feeling nostalgic about the good times we shared. But I have to remind myself of the inconsistency, the double standards, my needs not being met, and the honest truth that she was still healing from a previous abusive relationship. She projected her ex by constantly interpreting my words as manipulating or condescending. I tried walking beside her while she healed but it wasn't healthy for me. I felt myself neglecting my own needs and wants to make sure she was alright. That's on me for not taking time for myself.

Then I think about how I used to share my mornings with her and make her coffee every morning because I liked seeing her groggy face turn to joy when I would bring it in. I did it because I wanted to and I loved doing it. Or when I would help with cooking dinner and cleaning up after and she was so appreciative. And our camping trips were always so much fun even when we were getting rained on.

I can miss the good moments but remember the reasons we weren't supposed to be together. Appreciate the fact that you had the good times but remember the reasons you broke up and that every relationship that doesn't work out is a lesson.",3,1760572751.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

They track expenses, use apps, even make cute color-coded spreadsheets… yet nothing really changes‼️
Maybe the problem isn’t the budget — it’s *how we look at our spending.*

**The 3-Envelope Rule**

Forget fancy tracking apps. (I don't mean for you to stop it, lol) Just divide your spending into three simple folders:

1. **Needs** – bills, rent, groceries, pamasahe.  
2. **Wants** – coffee runs, Netflix, Lazada or Shopee finds.  
3. **Regret** – the “sana di ko na binili” purchases (you know which ones).

**The twist?** 

Don’t track everything.  
Track **only** your Regret spending for one week.

Most people realize it’s not the “Wants” that drain the wallet — it’s those *impulse buys* that look harmless pero sunod-sunod na pala.

**Why it works**

When you focus on your *Regret List*, budgeting stops feeling like restriction.  
It becomes about **awareness** — not guilt.  
You start catching your triggers (boredom? stress? flash sale?) before they hit *Add to Cart.*

*Once those patterns are clear, your wallet actually lasts longer — without strict rules or Excel guilt trips.*

**Question:**  
If you had to list one “Regret Spend” this week, what would it be?  ",5,1760572732.0,FinancialLiteracyPH,3,1.0,False

I am starving, yet my body does not want food.

Every day breakfast is the same:

2 fried eggs cooked in butter, two english muffins toasted with butter, and then greek yogourt mixed with chopped bananas and orange segments.  It's the only thing I can stomach anymore.

And it's fine for breakfast - probably bad for butter content but you try eating an english muffin plain.  YUCK.

But then I don't eat anything after that.  I plow myself with coffee and maybe get a pizza.

My diet is shit.  There are so many foods I can't eat because the texture literally makes my gag reflex go into overdrive and causes me to puke it up or just simply be unable to swallow.

I barely eat dinner.

I ordered sushi (something I used to enjoy) and I don't even want to eat it.  I think it's depression but it's also just plain having these autistic food sensibilities that are so detrimental to my health.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me!

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish.

You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere!

I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.

Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money.

Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey?

I need some advice.","My wife has recently begun her sobriety journey. She’s been sober for 18 days as of today, and I couldn’t be happier for her. She’s been going to AA meetings several times a week, has formed some basic connections with people she’s met, and everything seems to be going well.

However, she keeps coming to me with questions that I don’t have the answer to. She doesn’t know WHY she needs to be sober. She started down this road because she was using alcohol as a coping skill, and could never stop at just one glass of wine. She crosses off many of the boxes when you look up “symptoms of alcoholism”, but in a way, AA has almost made her think that she’s not an alcoholic.

People will tell their stories. And usually, it contains stories of times they hid their drinking, or got a DUI, or stole to support their habit, went to jail, alienated their partner, etc, and she hasn’t ever done that. She’s wrestling with the fact that she’s nothing like any of the people at their worst, she just uses alcohol to deal with stress and unwind after a hard day at work, and she’s not even a mean drunk. Quite the contrary. She’s the happiest person you’ve ever met.

I told her that the reason I encouraged her to quit is because I don’t want to see her become the people she doesn’t think she’s anything like, and they probably didn’t think it would happen to them either. But she’s still wrestling with it.

Now, I think that I know she needs some better coping mechanisms to fall back on instead of alcohol. But, I can see where she’s coming from. That being said, I don’t have the knowledge to be educated on this. She’s not stubborn. As long as she has facts that she can understand, she’s very willing to change her stance on a subject if the argument makes sense to her.

I told her to find someone in AA who’s been there a long time and she can get coffee with and lay out her concerns, but, what would you say if she came to you with this?",8,1760572552.0,AlAnon,17,1.0,False

Met a girl earlier this summer and we went on five dates that all went really well. There was definitely a spark early on good conversation really getting to know eachother, a genuine connection that felt rare. It wasn’t just surface-level dating it felt like something that could’ve grown into more.

After our last date, she told me she wasn’t seeing it romantically. She was kind about it, said she’d had a great time, but that she’s planning to move to Australia for a year next year to work as a doctor and didn’t want things to get complicated.

I took it well and thanked her for being upfront, but I’ll be honest, I was surprised. I get a good amount of likes and matches on Hinge, but I haven’t really been interested in anyone else since. I see her on hinge, it was her that I felt a connection with, and it’s been hard to shake that.

It’s been a couple of months now. I’ve thrown myself into work, training, and building my startup, but she still crosses my mind. I’m not expecting anything, I just keep wondering if there’s ever a healthy way to reconnect and see if that spark is still could ignite with a bit of effort, or if that’s just wishful thinking.

I want to text her and see if she’ll meet for a coffee but im also thinking if she came back from Australia and she was single, not that I’d wait but if I was single then I definitely would reach out. Has anyone managed to restart a talking stage after some time apart — especially when timing and life plans were part of why it ended?",1,1760572536.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1o7ra8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/driving/comments/1o7ra8j/recaprutesite_a_mapbased_revision_tool_i_built_to/,RecapRute.site — a map-based revision tool I built to practice your driving test route mentally (small-city EU focus),"Hey everyone, I’m working on a little side-project called [**RecapRute.site**](http://RecapRute.site) and I’d love to share it with folks preparing for their driving test in Europe. Feedback welcome!

**What it is:**

* A browser-based “route recap / drill” tool to help **you memorise** the driving-test area in your mind. Think of it as a mental rehearsal you use *after* you’ve already driven with your instructor (or while you’re doing lessons), but when you want to “run through the route again in your head.”
* Built with small-city driving tests in mind (because I live in a tiny town in Finland), but it supports many European cities and can be customised.

**Why I made it:**  
European practical driving tests felt by far the hardest I’ve done. I couldn’t find a rehearsal tool tailored for this kind of route-practice / visual-memory work, so I made my own.

**Key features:**

* Choose your exam city and set a radius / area. In small towns the default area is larger; in big cities it’s tighter by default. You can adjust it.
* View road speed limits inside the area (fetched from OpenStreetMap). You can toggle speed-limits by category (e.g. only show 30 km/h / 50 km/h zones), and you can correct any wrong values.
* Drop pins on locations you want to memorise specially (e.g. tricky speed-limit changes, junction rules, unusual turn restrictions).
* Ask the tool to generate a random test-style route within your area. You can drag & drop to adjust it. Save the route to revisit later. It’s designed so you can “run through” in your head or switch to your mobile.
* Export / import your data (pins, routes) — no server-backend, everything is stored locally. Free to use, no login required (just remember to export before switching devices).
* Bonus: I added a bit of “mental-state / mindset” support. When I’m on the road I sometimes freeze up or lose concentration because of past feedback / anxiety. The tool tries to help by encouraging you to practice mental rehearsal, not just technical route planning.

**Limitations / caveats:**

* It’s only a complement to real driving lessons / instruction. You still have to drive with an instructor in real traffic; this is *supplementary*.
* Performance on mobile (especially in large city maps) isn’t perfect yet — it’s more smooth on desktop.
* Since there’s no backend, if you change devices you’ll need to export & re-import your data manually.

**Why it might help you:**  
If you’re learning to drive somewhere in Europe, want to internalise *where* the tricky spots are (speed-zones, weird junctions, speed-limit transitions, left/right turn restrictions), and want to rehearse “in your head” before the real test — this could be a handy tool for that.

**Try it out:**  
You can use it for free. If you find it helpful and pass your test, feel free to buy me a virtual coffee (via the donate icon). 😊

If you try it, I’d love to hear your feedback: which cities you use it for, what features are missing, performance, etc.

1o7r96p,https://i.redd.it/nrtpzzzj5dvf1.jpeg,Hot Take. Houstonfornication is the real outro for Astroworld.,"Coffee bean is a beautiful song and a fantastic moment of vulnerability from Travis. However in terms of the album itself, in my opinion, it’s the only song that doesn’t quite fit with the theme. It sounds like the song you listen to when you’re on the way home from the amusement park and back into the harsh realities of the world which does give it a nice contrast to the album. But if we’re going based on amusement park rides, Houstonfornication sounds like the last ride you get on before you leave. You’re coming to the end of the roller coaster and the adrenaline is at its peak and starting to drop. I feel like if coffee bean were a single instead and Houstonfornication were the last song it would still fit the amusement park theme. It’s an exhilarating ride start to finish.

I 22F have had this job for about a year now, when I got this job I told myself it would be strictly work and that I wouldn’t make it super friendly. I broke that rule and befriended 2 other 22F and 24F girls who I got along with super well. We hung out lots and always talked about boys, went shopping, to eat and whatever else. 
When I also got this job I was dating this guy for a while and had recently moved in with him to an apartment. Again this was all a year ago, so taking place Nov 2024. 

Now fast forward to Sept 2025 I had found out that my same boyfriend whom I was living with was literally cheating on me with 5 girls (FIVE OTHER GIRLS one who had the same NAME as me) // for 9 months (NINE WHOLE MONTHS) I don’t check his phone, and I trust him, so of course I didn’t find out sooner. 

I told my coworkers first because I found this news out on Sunday night and I had work Monday morning. I told them after work on that Monday over coffee. 
(If it matters I then I then told all of my other closer best friends In person the weekend after as that’s something you do in person)

Now as the weeks are going on I am still having to live with my now cheating Ex who (by the way) is still talking to all of these girls. Until Nov 15th. 
And, I am the type of person who wants to stay busy with work to distract myself in a healthy way. I already have 2 jobs, and I picked up a PRN job on the weekends. 

Since being single my coworker friends have been practically begging me to go out to bars and I have just told them that I am not ready yet and I am not emotionally socially ready and I would honestly be no fun, I was being honest! I told them to go without me. I didn’t want to ruin their night and be selfish. And besides; I have never gone out before like to bars or anything it is simply not my personality, but it is their personality and that is perfectly fine. 

My coworker friends have now been accusing me of being a selfish and bad friend and that I have been pushing them away, in hand off; at work they literally scold me keep in mind there are two of them and we all work the same days so I am being “ganged up on” it feels like every day of the week. 

I just feel so confused? Because with my 2 other friend groups I have been acting the exact same and they have not said that I am being a bad or selfish friend. In fact both other groups have told me to take all of the “self” time that I need to focus on me before I feel up to hang out again. 

I can’t tell, am I being the asshole? Or are my coworker friends? 

Ps. I know I really shouldn’t be getting this close to coworkers friends and I am really approaching my weeks as “this is just work” but… I just want to know everyone’s opinions because I truly want to know if I am the problem (because most times I am and I am trying NOT to be this time) ",4,1760572148.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

I just moved into a new rental that I hope to be in for many years. The living room has a perfect spot for a projector I feel like. The only problem is that mounting options are limited. I'm looking for a budget project that's 4k. I'm about 140 inches away from the screen, and the space has 115inch wide by 69 inches high space. 

There is some empty space at the mounting point for the projector screen. Any methods for mounting this in an unnoticeable way for the landlord? I'm thinking of just putting the projector itself on the coffee table and putting stickers on the floor so I can realign it when needed.

Another concern is lighting. The space is well lit. For any daytime viewing, is there a certain type of projector that would work better than others? Closing the blinds all the time would be kind of annoying.

A boot steps down onto the train platform. It is made of leather, caked with mud, torn at the toe, and made dull by time. Another quickly follows. The man is in no better shape than his boots. His hands are covered in scars and scrapes. Dirt has entrenched itself under his nails. He wears a gray wool coat, covered in smudges and stains, with a faded red lining and gold buttons that do not match, some look new off the factory line, some have seen everything he has. His trousers are the same gray wool, except that they are covered in tears, and seem to have been soaked in mud and filth. A pack lay on his back containing all of his possessions. He wears a steel helmet with abundant scrapes and dents. He no longer needs it as he is back in Dresden, the city he left so long ago, but refuses to remove it, something so deeply ingrained in him over his time. His hair is short and unkempt. His face is clean shaven as is customary for those who need to wear a mask.



He walks off the platform and into the station. Everything looks just how it was when he was there last over three years ago now. Same brick walls, same marvelous pillars, same steeples. It may have looked the same but it is not really where he left from. No cheering or throwing flowers as he and his friends get on the train and are sent away. Yes the foundations and stones are the same but the spirit of the people and nation itself have eroded. Not many are seen and those who are are solemn and quiet. The man sits on a bench at the station to think for a moment. He supposes that those in France and Britain are probably coming home to crowds and celebrations. While yes every nation lost people it feels as though Germany's losses were most severe. They have no victory to take their minds off the friends, children, or fathers they’ve had ripped away so quickly. There is only loss. That of the war, that of the soldiers, that of the civilians, that of the German pride which had carried them this far. Just loss.



No point dwelling on it now, and afterall he is back and should be happy for that at least  presumes the man as he gets up and continues on. Walking out of the station he looks for his old apartment. He saw it from a little while away. It was the same four stories of brick and mortar with a sign outfront simply with “Apartment” across it. He walked inside to see a new clerk from when he was there previously. It was a girl, no older than their late twenties at most. She had a down expression and seemed to light up when the man entered through the doors. She was short with striking features, fair skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair put into a chignon. Something about her eyes stood out to him. It looked like an empty space behind them, one that had been vacant for some time but has finally come to terms and is ready to be filled.



“Hello sir, what may I have the pleasure of helping you with today?”



“How much is a room?”



“50 Marks a month.”



“Certainly has steepened a bit.” Said the man sifting through his wallet and handing over the 50 Marks. “Is room 11 open, that was mine before I went off”



“Indeed it is.” Said the clerk turning around to look for a key. She began to speak again with waning enthusiasm as she said, “A lot of the rooms opened up when this all started and… well… let's just say the old owners aren’t coming back to fill them up. A lot of sad mothers around here.” 



“Oh I know.”



“Have you visited yours yet? They probably would like to know you’re back and ok.” Still looking through the drawers behind the counter.



“No, I haven’t talked to them much since I came down here from Leipzig.”



“Well no time like the present.” She said while handing over the key. “And what name would you like me to put that under again?”



“You can put it under Friedrich Köhler, or just shorten it to Fritz.”



“Alright you’re all set. Have a good day Mr. Köhler. I hope to see your face around.”



“Thank you, likewise.”



Fritz walks up a flight of stairs. Even after being separated from his old residence for so long he remembers it all. Every chip in the paint, every slightly cracked brick, every grain in the banister, and the light hanging from the top of the stairwell. He makes his way to the room he called home before he went away. Inserting the key into the hole he twists it and with a creek the door opens. Looking around you’ll see a small stove and cold water sink right at the entrance and going ahead you’ll see a modest bed and chair in the opposite corner, the whole thing dimly lit by a few lights. He removes his coat, places his bag with his possessions under the sink, and collapses on to the bed. Many times he dreamed of a bed while away. On Fritz’s mental list he crosses out “Bed”, now only “Shower” and “Pub” remain. Lucky enough for him the apartment has one of those two on the first floor right next to the restroom. That can be done in a moment once he is satisfied with laying down in the luxury of his bed.



The air of late November required him to return to his coat. With this he set back off, exiting the room, locking the door, and descending the stairs. Walking down the hall he found the bathhouse unoccupied to his pleasure. Within seven minutes Fritz emerged fresher than he had been in months. While no he was not spotless by any metric it was refreshing all the same. With a shirt now slightly dampened by his skin he returned quickly up the stairs to his room. He retched the pack he had carried to remove his items from it and make himself more settled in. He reached in and took out a notebook which he had documented a few experiences in, everything from describing Artillery barrages and assaults, to shooting at rats and bailing water.  A few photographs and a camera he had saved from a friend named Paul who was making a collection from all of the towns they went to during their time lay in his bag as well. One day Paul went on a scouting party to cut some British wire at Guillemont, and never returned to the German front. It’d be a shame and disrespect to Paul if he let his hard work get left behind, so Fritz took the camera and photos and finished the collection Paul started to honor him. A 37mm shell was one of the souvenirs Fritz kept. It had a design at the top with pedals sticking out at an angle, and little holes in the shell beneath each pedal. This was acquired on a raid in a British trench at Cambrai. As the old owner would not be advancing back to their old trench there was no point in letting it go to waste. A spare shirt and some socks had been provided by the army while the soldiers were handing most of their gear back. He was able to hold on to a mess kit that he was given. A few cigarettes in a tin box that had engravings of an iron cross and eagle he had received in 1915. Also in the box was an Iron Cross 2nd Class which he was awarded. Finally he had a match box, razor, standard issued knife, and a small sack with the rest of his pay in it. With now sprawled out on his chair he checked the time seeing it was now about seven p.m. After a couple more minutes enjoying his bed he left to find a place to drink.



Swiftly exiting the apartment Fritz began to walk in the direction that his old favorite pub was in. Walking beside the road he began to notice many shops or restaurants he used to enjoy now had shut doors and closed signs, and even then those that were open didn’t look in the best shape. The solemness of the mournful city returns. People quietly walk to and fro, uninterested in the doings of others. There is the same feeling of loss permeating in the air as before. Fritz pushes it all out of his mind, afterall he is back and should enjoy being back. A quick ten minute stroll later he arrived at the pub “Stadtkrug”. Opening the doors a yeasty aroma of freshly brewed beer is smelt. Many people sit and talk in small groups, and many others sit alone. Walking up he orders a Pilsner and joyfully anticipates its arrival. 



The bartender returns to his stool. He seemed to be in his thirties and by the hollow wooden thump against the ground made every time he takes a step, it’s evident that he got out of the war early. Fritz couldn’t help but let out an empty chuckle and silently think to himself “lucky bastard.” He grasped the drink in its cage of glass and slowly pressed it to his lips, ready to bask in its full glory. When he first left he was hardly at the age to enjoy drinking, especially with the example of his father still fresh in his memory and his vow to never touch alcohol. This quickly dissipated. When every day is a miracle you, naturally, wish to do everything as soon as possible in case you don’t have the chance. Him and Karl had a scavenger hunt to see who could complete everything faster, which included getting drunk and enjoying a woman. If you ever met Karl you know that he had no problem with the alcohol, while Fritz had his luck with the French women, a period of which he looks back on with shame. All the older soldiers said how awful the ration beer was.



 “What is this trench water! Back in Berlin we had real beer. “Making beer out of potatoes” who do they think we are, Ivans? Sooner or later they’ll have us drinking that disgusting backyard brew the Kosaken tries to pass for alcohol.”



 He didn’t drink it. He wanted a first experience that truly encapsulated the glories and culture, not whatever that was.  Since Karl was clearly not going to complete his part, Fritz figured he might as well finish the race that was no longer competitive of course. 



With a slight rise in elevation the golden Pilsner flowed into his mouth, and in a very short time he had officially won the competition. It was not how Fritz imagined it. During the war all of his older comrades talked about how the first thing they would do when they got home, before reuniting with their families which they held so dearly, was to stop by the pub. Fritz was so deeply excited to try this for himself, but now it seemed so flat or dry. The enjoyment and euphoria that was anticipated simply didn’t appear. Dismay washed him over and he began to lose focus on the world around him. His eyes were open yes, but he was not seeing anything in front of him. His mind was thinking no thought, and for a second it was as if he didn’t exist. Such bliss can be found in non-existence sometimes.



He felt a hand on his shoulder. A damn frog eater! He jumped forward, hitting into the wall of the trench held together by sticks, beams, and pure determination. His arm tore through the air with a raging fury to grab his shovel. In one swift motion he brought it to his head level and swung it at the Franzmänner’s head. The ensuing sounds were all too familiar, the transition from pressing into skin to hitting solid bone, to feeling it break away and shatter. Some pieces went out the side, some deeper into his head where the blade continued to push them deeper until it was solidly entrenched in the man's head. At least that's what he would have felt. What he thought he felt if he had his spade. If he was in France. If he wasn’t in the bar staring into a man's wide eyes.



“I see, still war weary. Don’t worry I was the same when I first came back. They say it shows weakness but I say it shows we’re just ready for a fight wouldn’t you agree?” He pulled over a stool from further down the counter. “What's your name?”



“Friedrich.” He responded with the cold blank tone of one who still isn't sure of their exact surroundings.



“Well Friedrich it’s nice to meet you, I'm Hans. I’m sure you’ve heard of the Freikorps.” Said the stranger with a pause and look indicating to Fritz he should respond.



“I don't know. Like the old ones? Like The War of Liberation… something with Napoleon I think.” He said in a state of unthawing from his episode, completely uncaring of what this man has to say.



“No no no, the new one. Me and a bunch of ex-German soldiers are putting together a group, a militia of sorts.”



“Listen sir, the war is over. It’s done, you heard what the politicians said the same as I did. I just want my old life back, not the trenches again.”



“Oh I heard the politicians alright. Damn traders like it more, selling us down the river, being walked on by the French and British, listening to the American lies. They’re German, they win, what don't they understand?”



“I guess so, hell I mean we got pretty close at least. Wasn’t there something about the Navy too?”



“Them, those sailors, the jews, liberals, oh and don’t get me started on the communists! The Spartacists, taking the high road, “I don’t like war,” “I’m going to go on strike like the Brits and Frenchies,” “I want more money so I'm going to stop working so the soldiers putting their asses on the line for us run out of ammo and die in the French mud!” They piss me off to the ends of the Earth! I could only think what I’d do if I had one right here.”



“I think one of my buds got a letter about that from his girl. Did they really just stop working, even on war materials? In a time like that? I’ve seen men get gunned down, torn to pieces because they didn't have enough ammo. It’s always when you have a clear shot on their officer that you find you’re missing a bullet.”



“Exactly! Give us a few weeks, no, days even and we’d have been in Paris. I mean look at you, with you in our army clearly it’s not the quality of soldiers keeping us down. We did so much in so little time that if they hadn't turned on us at our moment of triumph we would have won for sure. Think how many of our pals would still be alive if they hadn’t leashed us and pulled us away, kicking and streaming, from Paris.”



“You’re right, what's this Freikorps’ goal anyway?”



“Well to protect the Germans of course. Our people, our identity, our unity. They’re coming for us, the Tommies, the Frogs, the Bolschewiken, and the Amerikanische mercenaries! Even on the inside they’re trying to cave us, the damned Spartacists! In Latvia, where our knights first landed those ages ago, they're still fighting to keep out the Red Pests. They spread like a plague and infect everything they touch, waves of them. They’re doing the best they can, but it certainly wouldn't hurt if a few thousand hardened veteran soldiers such as yourself. You’re the prime example of a Zäher Hund you know. A true front-line pig, a real man, a guy who comes back again and again and again no matter how much is thrown at him.”



“How would one sign up for this organization if they were to go relieve the struggling garrisons in the Baltic, to protect the innocent Germans from the murderous Reds of course?”



“Well right here in Dresden we have a head of the Freikorps Hasse. I’ll try to get into contact with Hauptmann Waldemar Pabst. He’s one of us, a real man. In two days I can ask him to meet you at the Residenzschloss, he’ll point you to where you can go to reach the Baltics.”



“Thank you Hans. What about you? Are you going to the Baltic?”



“No, I’m planning on staying here, probably going to keep an eye on the socialist in Leipzig. They act up one bit, and I’ll show them that despite their best efforts I still have at least one bullet left for each of them.”



“Alright then, I best be heading out.” Said Fritz, pushing off his legs with his hands to stand up off his seat. 



“Likewise,” was the response given by Hans.



With a slight grunt he lifted himself and reached out his hand, slightly sticky from the Pilsner, which Hans didn't seem to mind as he swiftly and firmly grasped his hand and gave a firm handshake before walking off to the door. Fritzed hollered for the bartender to return as he handed him a portion of the leftover pay that he had brought with him. With that he turns and walks out of Stadtkrug’s double doors.



Walking out into the fresh November air, the coldness he had felt before seemed less piercing, to the point where he was able to remove his coat for the remainder of his walk. Something about the atmosphere had changed. Everything seemed slightly brighter than before, as if the darker clouds looming over the city had begun to subside, if only over Fritz. No one was stirring, not at this hour. There was something that seemed to push him forward, something in his step allowing him to walk more upright and powerful than on the trip there. This was not unnoticed by Fritz. He began to think of what has changed. Perhaps it was the stars providing better illumination, or was it a shift within himself? Was it the conversation with Hans, did he just need a comrade in this trying time? Possibly. Or was it the destination that he was now moving towards? Yes, on the trip to the pub he had an ending location but not a path. The previous destination was one that was unimportant and had no effect. Nothing would change if he went or did not go. Nothing would change if he went now or years from now, but now he has a deadline and a group that wants him, no, needs him like Hans said. In some way, the screws put on him by his new limitations and requirements almost willingly forces him to move forward compared to an unstructured path. Water in a river will move further and more vigorously than water in a lake as the strict constraints of the banks on either side force it to go in a direction, while a lake has no limitations, no structure, but no movement. That must be it.



It was that, or it was a feeling of running rather than being herded, running from what he knew lay inevitably on the other side of this ordeal. There was a feeling inside of him, a nibble at the back of his brain that he knew a dark shadow had cast him over. He pushed it away but could feel it like a bubble in his head, not having spilled into his thoughts yet, but taking up room in a tense balance where he wishes anything but to disturb it. But these are an issue for another time.



\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following day went by slowly, at a pace that could make even the most patient of saints wish to tear out their eyes. This was the time when Fritz truly realized his old life was gone. There was nothing to do but sleep or walk around, so that's what Fritz did. Going down the stairs he passed the lady working the entrance again. She shot him a smile and asked,



“Where are you off to? Just a morning walk?”



“Indeed I am. I figured there's nothing else much to do around here so I might as well.”



“Well if you’re bored and need something to do, would you mind getting a coffee with me? In two days when the weekend starts maybe?” 



“I would like that.” He responded as a small smile began to creep on his face. “Where were you thinking?”



“Oh I don’t know, I didn’t really think it through. I figured I should say something before the opportunity slipped away.”



“How about Kreutzkamm? With you in the shop, the pastries would be the second sweetest thing there.”



She began to blush and let out the softest, cutest giggle Fritz believed he’d ever heard. In that moment she was the only thing that mattered to him.



“Well I wouldn’t want to stop you, go on your walk, I’ll be here when you get back.”



“Will do.”



 He exited the apartment with a slight raise in his posture. He had one of the cigarettes he had salvaged as well as his box of matches, and began his walk. He took the cigarette, placing it between his teeth as he fumbled through his pocket looking for where he had placed the matches. He from top to bottom and felt them protruding from inside his coat. He pulled out the box and taking a match pressed it hard and quick against the striking strip. Nothing. It was probably the rain that had dampened them a while ago, maybe some of the phosphorus dissolved, if that happens. Maybe he just got a bad hit, he pondered to himself. He tried again, still nothing. On the third the match erupted into flames, just as they were meant to. He moved it towards the cigarette until it was smoking sufficiently. He watched the match. It burned bright with a vigor and passion, but lost it as time marched forward until it was still lit, but not enthusiastic. Perhaps it could hold on, keep burning, if just for a few seconds longer, but quickly and abruptly the wind stifled it, so Fritz dropped it and continued on. It was forgotten along the path of something greater than itself now.



As one strolled down the paths composed of stone bricks you couldn't help but notice the humorous situation they found themselves in where everyone needed so many workers that they didn't have, that there were no real jobs left. That was except for one. A paper was plastered on a wall near where he first arrived back to his city. It was stained an unkept yellow color that so often happens to paper left to the weathering of nature. On the top in big, bold letters which he could still just slightly see the letters pushed in from when the press had made its imprint said “Railway Workers Are Needed!” Under that a depiction of a large coal fueled engine chugging along forcefully in the back. In the foreground were six men, well built, with hammers. Possibly a few with pickaxes as well, it was hard to tell. They were swinging down on a track parallel to the one the train was running on. Under that in slightly smaller letters was “Apply! Work and good pay! To apply, go to Dresden Hauptbahnhof.” He stood staring at it. Contemplating its words. He stood long enough that his left ankle began to act up again like it has since the splinter pierced it, so he leaned to the right. He inhaled a breath of his cigarette smoke and continued thinking. It says good pay after all, and look, this job has no killing involved. Perhaps he should change his mind on this whole Freikorps thing? Maybe he shouldn’t go to the Residenzschloss. Yet again he had heard Hans’ words. Also he lacked any experience in the workforce, despite shooting and killing of course, that he was well versed in. It would be best just to sleep on it and in the morning he will make his final judgment.

1o7qyjz,https://i.redd.it/m3fhpwea3dvf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — Wednesday: Festival Brainstorm!,"Today, the whole school was buzzing again — this time, about the upcoming School Festival! The student council made an announcement in the morning that each class could come up with their own theme, booth, or mini show.

Our class rep, Michael, wrote “Festival Ideas” on the board, and everyone started shouting suggestions.
“Haunted house!”
“Food stall!”
“Dance contest!”

Then Penny raised her hand and said, “What about something inspired by The Navel?”
Everyone turned to look at her — and then at me.

Kira gasped. “Ooh! Like a Digital Café! With glowing drinks!”
Monique (who was listening from the doorway — since her class is next door) peeked in and shouted, “And call it Café of Sisterhood!”

Even though Carmen, Siu Ling, and Monique are in other classes, they all wanted to join in. During recess, they came over to discuss the idea with us in the courtyard.
“Hey, our class is doing a mini arcade booth,” Carmen said. “But we can totally link it to your theme — like a crossover!”
Siu Ling smiled. “Maybe you guys can have a small stage too, and we’ll help with the decorations.”
Monique grinned. “I’ll make glowing signs! I already have leftover blue stickers from my Navel posters!”

Everyone loved the idea. Penny scribbled notes like crazy while Winfrey started sketching a layout of the café. “We’ll have neon cups, ‘data-coffee,’ and maybe a small ‘Mud Queen photo zone’ next to it!”

The mention of Mud Queen made everyone laugh.
Kira said, “Yes! A fun corner where people can pose with colorful paint props — not real paint, though!”
Carmen winked. “You sure? Because we could make it real.”
I groaned and said, “No way! I’m not cleaning the floor again.”

By lunch, both our class and theirs had sort of formed an unofficial alliance — the Festival Sisterhood Pact! Even the teachers smiled when they saw us planning together.

After school, I stayed behind to help Winfrey and Kira cut out holographic letters for the signboard. The sun was setting through the window, and our desks were covered in glue sticks, shiny paper, and glitter.

“This might be the best festival ever,” Penny said dreamily.
And I agreed. With my friends, a bright idea, and a glowing cup of Navel Latte from yesterday beside me… it really felt like the start of something magical.",1,1760571607.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

I sold my last laptop (X1 carbon gen 11) because I was minimizing all my tech early this year. Had too much electronics I didn't use and often stay at home. 

I am studying Python and was using my work laptop but want to do projects on my own device. I do have a Desktop PC mid range and a Samsung Tab S10+ but prefer using a real laptop. 

I was looking at a cert. refurbished SL2 I7 16GB 512GB SSD for $300. Is it worth it at this price still possible with my use case, and i plan on keeping it for at least 5 more years? I was looking at a Macbook Air 15 m4 16gb, but prefer Windows because I also need to use VBA.

When I travel, I only bring my work laptop and tablet. Don't plan on bringing the Surface Anywhere else other than coffee shops for personal projects.

We have two services at my church and we were going to the other times. I didn’t see him again for a bit. A few months passed, our young adults group started meeting again and I saw him again and now I have such a big crush on him. I feel like I think about him every single day. I want to know if this could be a sign that God is sending me him and that he could be my future husband but I’m not exactly sure how to tell. I have never felt drawn to a guy like this before and I have NO experience with men love or dating. I’m 24 years and I have such a longing in my heart to be a mother and wife one day, but I haven’t met anyone who has made me feel infatuated the way I do with him. The Sunday at church after I realized I thought more of him than just him being handsome, I went up to him and introduced myself. Fast forward a few weeks, we see each other 3x a week at church, Bible study in a group, and at young adults. Nothing crazy though, just some small talk like I do with other young adults. I don’t think he has any idea that I view this him way and I’m not sure how to share this because again I have no experience and I want to make sure I’m honoring God with my actions. I gave him a Bible at the last Bible study group, and I left a note in it that said I’m praying for his walk with the Lord. And then I texted him on the way home because I truly couldn’t stop thinking about him. I asked him if he would like to get coffee before church on Sunday. He is out of town with family then, but he explained this and said any day after that though. Then I responded saying my schedule is open whenever so he can let me know whenever he wants to get together. He said he would let me know when he’s back in town and then I just said sounds good.

I know I mentioned I’m thinking of him a lot and I don’t mean to. I know this could be problematic. I have made it a point to pray for him every time I think of him and to pray for patience and contentment being single and that whatever I do I remain focused on the Lord first and do not idolize him in anyway. I also pray that the Lord would prepare our hearts and minds for one another, if it’s the Lords plan for us to be with one another, and that if it isn’t in Gods plan, that he would unite me with whoever my future husband is in His timing.

I have so many questions. Did anyone feel like they were sent their spouse by the Lord? I genuinely felt so drawn to him, even before the first conversation, and not in a lustful or sinful way but in a way that makes me feel protective over him and his walk with the Lord. Does this make sense to anyone else? I am also wondering if others think he could be interested in me or if he is just being kind? Does it seem like he likes me too? Does anyone think he may start to see that I like him since I gave him the Bible and asked him to coffee? And I am also looking for any advice on how to proceed in a way that glorifies God and honors him. Is it bad I asked him to coffee? Was this something I shouldn’t have done?",2,1760571502.0,relationship_advice,3,0.75,False
1o7qvy0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7qvy0,4 Days of Eating,"I'm not someone who takes pictures of every dish, but I have included some photos at each restaurant. (Though definitely not anywhere near all the food we ordered) Here's where we ate over our 4 days!

**Cote 10/10:**

Ordered the butchers' feast + Kkakdugi kimchi. On top of that, they gave us complimentary ""chicken nuggets"" because our table was running behind, and they were an 11/10.

Honestly, the whole experience was excellent. We had a midnight resy and I was worried the vibe wouldn't be right, but I shouldn't have worried. It was fantastic. 

The only thing worth noting is that I have a shrimp allergy, and a few dishes in the Butcher's Feast I couldn't eat because they use shrimp in some of their kimchis. I was only really bummed about not being able to try the egg soufflé because my husband kept raving about it! If I go back, I would definitely want to go as a group of 4 to make a bigger dent in all the food. They just kept bringing out more and more, it was never-ending!

**Liberty Bagel 8.5/10:**

Ordered the classic nova, no capers + red onion. This was a perfectly good bagel, but the system to get it is broken. Not worth the line/ hectic environment IMO.

**Joe's Pizza 7.5/10:**

Ordered the lasagna pizza and the pepperoni sausage. Solid slice, nothing special, but got the job done for a quick meal!

**Monkey Bar 9.8/10:**

Ordered the crab rangoon, double cheeseburger & steak frites all to share. Finished the night with the banana split. The burger was top-tier, and everything else was excellent as well. The vibe and our server also really brought this experience over the top. The only negative was all the Instagram girlies trying to get ""the shot"". We were right by where you walk in from the bar, and 7-8 girls stood right by our table trying to get pictures of the room. It got old... but as I'm typing, I realize this is what I get for going to the Instagram trendy places.  

**Brooklyn Bagel 9/10:**

This is my tried-and-true bagel spot that never disappoints. I usually do an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, onion, tomato & s&p, but I wanted to compare apples to apples with what I ordered at Liberty bagel. Brooklyn Bagel wins hands down. (plus I walked right in, ordered my bagel, and sat down to eat it with no fuss)

**Rubirosa: 9.5/10:**

Ordered the calamari and a half-pepperoni, half-honey pie pizza. No notes on the pizza; the crust was perfect, and the sauce-to-cheese and toppings ratio were perfect. The calamari was a little chewy. It was good, and I would order it again, but I wasn't blown away. Also love how, even though they were busy and turning people away due to long waits, they offered me a cappuccino and didn't seem bothered at all that I sat and drank it. They didn't rush us one bit, and I really appreciated that.

**Bar Pisellino:**

I'm not giving a rating because we didn't have any food. Just drinks and coffee. Wanted to include it, though, because it was such a vibe to stop in for a drink. The staff was so welcoming, and the people watching made the experience.

**Torrisi 11/10:**

Last, but certainly not least, we ended our trip with a once-in-a-lifetime dinner at Torrisi. It was everything we hoped it would be and more.

Ordered the cucumbers, Cavatelli, Maccheroni Amatriciana, and the Duck. We also had the special for dessert, an apple cheese danish.

The duck was divine. I couldn't stop talking about it. Of the two pastas, I actually preferred the Maccheroni Amatricana over the Cavatelli, but that's because I'm a baby when it comes to spice. My husband said the Cavatelli was his favorite dish of the night (if you can handle spicy, I bet you'd agree).

But what REALLY made Torrisi a chart-topping experience was the little extras and the staff. I ordered a glass of wine, and he came with two for me to taste and decide which I wanted. When we asked questions about the menu, he seemed to give genuine answers to our taste and to complement what we had already ordered. (The maccheroni amatriciana was his suggestion, and I am so glad we listened.) They were highly attentive, and it didn't feel stuffy at all. They also bring out shaved ice between dinner and dessert, AND cookies to finish the night. There was never any rush for us to finish; the entire dinner was an experience, and it's one I'll be thinking about for a long time. ",12,1760571422.0,FoodNYC,2,0.88,False

I don't think I'm a particularly interesting person, I've never wanted to be really. I'm 20 years old now, trying to study for a gardening degree. I live on my own in a small town after having moved away for studies from an even smaller town with only two shops, a bar and a torn down mental asylum. I don't text my mom or dad, frankly we never got a long well and I really dislike texting them overall.

Now I should get to the important details. I drowned in that small town about 4 years ago, I remember the burning of my lungs as my body spasmed and my heart was filled with despair. I was hateful back then and even now I'm quite an easily angered person but I try not to let it show. I didn't notice anything weird after climbing out of the lake, I was far too busy throwing up what felt like years of fast food and corner store bakery pastries. I was there for a long while, alone on a beach at dawn without even clouds to be my comrade in suffering.

After throwing up for a while I noticed my puke turned from the chunks of food I had eaten minutes earlier to sick yellow color and then my throat burned more than it ever had. Another wave pushed up my burning throat, wet and warm as I fell to my knees again and threw up nothing but blood and stomach acids. I knew then that I was dying, if not from the sudden shock of almost drowning then from the blood loss I would have laughed if my cracking throat and vocal cords would have allowed it. I remember closing my eyes and waking up back home. My face wasn't covered in sick, bile or blood like I thought it would have been but rather I was in bed in my room with a fresh set of clothes and a completely washed body.

Ever since then I've felt a bit numb, I studied my way through my media studies after which I searched for jobs for about 7 months before applying for a new school. I fell in love and got dumped, I became an alcoholic after my breakup and I now know how to sing Sinatra and Elvis pretty well at bar karaokes. The next summer after I drowned I started to drool a lot more frequently, I would wake up to a completely soaked bed I haven't wet the bed for many years and the only parts that were wet were my pillow and the bedding around it.

I couldn't shower in anything other than steaming hot water for 2 years, I started to hate the rain and I developed cynophobia. I started throwing up more often but it was never anything more than water, which was weird since I mostly drank monsters throughout all of my media studies. By the time I turned 18 I fell in love, he was a wonderful man and I had some of the best years of my life with him. We broke up after a bit over 2 years of dating, he let me down softly and my heart stung for a while since talking about him. It's odd to think that he was dating the corpse of a woman but it didn't feel like he noticed. He was alarmed by the fact I could faint easily, had breathing difficulties and threw up even more easily than fainted.

After he left me I pushed myself to learn something or find a job, I wound up working at some market stalls where my boss was definitely dodging taxes. I only got about 60€ by the end of 40 hours of work, it wasn't a lot but it was still money. Every moment I spent under the scorching sun I was pained with headaches, I felt dehydrated and suffered from sunburns easier than ever before. I had forgotten my death by this time, accepting my pillows being wet and needing more water than the average person. I only remembered my death while under cold water and by the sound of dogs.

After the summer I started my studies, moved out onto my own and that's when the nightmares began. I only remember flashes but I know very well the screams I make once I wake up. The thing is, last month I woke up from another nightmare I jolted up to scream but no sound escaped my mouth. Instead a whirlpool of water flew out of my mouth, for nearly four minutes nothing but water escaped my throat and I could only breathe with my nose. I felt my cheeks starting to crack like a water container that was overflowing but being filled with even more water. I punched my gut and the last of the water flew out, with only small droplets still in my mouth which I swallowed. I got up from my bed starting to change the sheets only to notice that it wasn't even three in the morning.

I checked myself in my mirror and saw that I wasn't sweating, there wasn't a droplet of water on my body but I looked pregnant almost. My stomach large and protruding it almost looked as if it was about to burst, I can admit I was never the lightest woman in the room. In fact I was often bullied for it but I knew this wasn't my body. I took a breath in and I swear I heard waves crash against a beach of rocks, I let the breath go and from my slack jaw I saw nearly a liter water drop out as if from a freshly opened dam or a waterfall.

I closed my mouth and decided to start changing my sheets. I haven't really questioned my status as a member of the undead for the past 4 years, that may come as a shock to you but quite frankly I couldn't care. For me, all that mattered is the fact I'm still alive in some form. I wouldn't recommend a suicide attempt as a form of finding a new meaning to life and I know that I'm not quite living anymore. Still better than being suicidal even though I am some form of water golem now. The worst of it really is the stretch marks, as if my skin is trying to hold down the entirety of the lake near where my parents live.

I visited my parents yesterday, after some awkward coffee and talking to my siblings I visited the lake again and looked into the deep waters. I saw more trash in it now, it wasn't the deep clear blue that I had tried to kill myself in 4 years ago but rather a slimey looking puddle. Filled with seaweed and trash, I couldn't help but feel connected to it somehow, as if it was beckoning me. I stepped closer to the water on the same pier that I stood at 4 years ago, my breath was short and ragged I was remembering every burning sensation of drowning. Then I saw something within the murky waters, moving like a snake but bigger.

I got on my hands and knees looking into the deep waters, then suddenly a figure crawled to meet me. I recognized those eyes of hatred, that look on her face which was filled with nothing but disgust her eyebrows furrowed with scorn and malice for everyone but herself. She tried to grab me but the water held her down, like a see-through plastic bag she pushed against the tension of the lake. I fell backwards and pushed myself away from her, I saw her screaming at me but no sound reached me, only bubbles against the tension of the water.

I got up and ran away from that beach, I don't plan on going to meet my parents for a long while. In fact I don't wanna hear about them at all anymore, I need to just finish my studies and find a good job somewhere far off. Far far away from that awful awful lake.

The only problem that I have is that I've noticed my stomach growing bigger tonight, my stretchmarks now cover my entire body and my cheeks feel scarred. I have an awful premonition of throwing up water like a geyser until my mouth erupts into a blooming flower of blood or that my stomach would explode like a long overdue pimple. If I don't update this I think you can figure out what happened to me, one last thing before I post this: I want to live, I want to become old and ragged, I want to be a mother not for some water curse but rather my own child. I want to smell like apricots and be a boring woman.

Goodnight, sweet dreams, sleep well, I'll see you tomorrow.",2,1760571310.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We have two services at my church and we were going to the other times. I didn’t see him again for a bit. A few months passed, our young adults group started meeting again and I saw him again and now I have such a big crush on him. I feel like I think about him every single day. I want to know if this could be a sign that God is sending me him and that he could be my future husband but I’m not exactly sure how to tell. I have never felt drawn to a guy like this before and I have NO experience with men love or dating. I’m 24 years and I have such a longing in my heart to be a mother and wife one day, but I haven’t met anyone who has made me feel infatuated the way I do with him. The Sunday at church after I realized I thought more of him than just him being handsome, I went up to him and introduced myself. Fast forward a few weeks, we see each other 3x a week at church, Bible study in a group, and at young adults. Nothing crazy though, just some small talk like I do with other young adults. I don’t think he has any idea that I view this him way and I’m not sure how to share this because again I have no experience and I want to make sure I’m honoring God with my actions. I gave him a Bible at the last Bible study group, and I left a note in it that said I’m praying for his walk with the Lord. And then I texted him on the way home because I truly couldn’t stop thinking about him. I asked him if he would like to get coffee before church on Sunday. He is out of town with family then, but he explained this and said any day after that though. Then I responded saying my schedule is open whenever so he can let me know whenever he wants to get together. He said he would let me know when he’s back in town and then I just said sounds good.

I know I mentioned I’m thinking of him a lot and I don’t mean to. I know this could be problematic. I have made it a point to pray for him every time I think of him and to pray for patience and contentment being single and that whatever I do I remain focused on the Lord first and do not idolize him in anyway. I also pray that the Lord would prepare our hearts and minds for one another, if it’s the Lords plan for us to be with one another, and that if it isn’t in Gods plan, that he would unite me with whoever my future husband is in His timing.

I have so many questions. Did anyone feel like they were sent their spouse by the Lord? I genuinely felt so drawn to him, even before the first conversation, and not in a lustful or sinful way but in a way that makes me feel protective over him and his walk with the Lord. Does this make sense to anyone else? I am also wondering if others think he could be interested in me or if he is just being kind? Does it seem like he likes me too? Does anyone think he may start to see that I like him since I gave him the Bible and asked him to coffee? And I am also looking for any advice on how to proceed in a way that glorifies God and honors him. Is it bad I asked him to coffee?

Joseph Smith is a Charlatan who had the audacity to claim God came to him alone proclaim all other churches were corrupt.

Mormons assert Freemasonry is the only way to get the full Resurrection that Jesus promised so simply over 2 millennia ago.

The LDS Church has siphoned off money meant for the cause of God and amassed hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars for their self-centered interests.

Mormonism is a huge corruption of what Christianity is. The Mormons can backpedal all day long with their Palm Sundays and Jeezuz name drops, but until they give up the money, the temples, and their scripture, they'll forever be an Antichrist. THEE Antichrist if you rank Antichrists by wealth..

Anyway, I'm gonna go back to my extra double chocolate mocha latte now (still can't do coffee). I hope Jesus gives me a break before he makes me sign up for another church.

1o7qsv5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7qsv5,Please help me design my living room!,"Hello! Recently moved into a Victorian house and as you can see in the photos, the setup that worked in our townhouse absolutely does not work here.

The coffee table and rug are for sure going as they're both too small for the space. We will most likely be getting a new TV and will be mounting it on the wall, so we will probably get a new stand to better hold all of our gaming consoles. I definitely want the TV on that wall.

I *might* get a mount that allows us to pull the TV out from the wall, but haven't decided yet.

Our goal is to have a layout that's ideal for both watching TV and hanging out with a group. I'm going for an eclectic mix. For example, I'm hoping to get an antique-style rug to contrast the modern couch. I mostly mention that to say that I don't need a super traditional layout, but I'm totally lost on where to even start with a rug because I can't decide how big it should be!

We painted the walls tan (I know they look gray in the photos, I swear new light bulbs are on the way to warm it up), and will be painting the trim off-white. The goal is to have fairly neutral walls/trim to contrast the more bold colors in other rooms we have planned, and to make items like the couch and (eventual) rug pop.

I'm mostly focused on the side that doesn't include the fireplace, because we need to make a plan to rip out that hideous wood stove lol. But the empty corner might become a music area with a piano.

I have attached floor plans (including a blank one without the furniture) and photos. Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

Edit: totally forgot to mention the windows. The hideous curtains will be coming down and I will be mounting new ones above the windows so they're at the proper height and go to the floor, but haven't decided on a style. The interior shutters are not original and also don't fit (you can't close them), so I'll be removing them as well.",2,1760571193.0,DesignMyRoom,4,1.0,False

Motor is a DC12V with 296rpm output, and burrs are the cheapest I found for about $7. Maximum $50 cost with filament and hardware.

It can do fine grind.

Since the motor only likes to grind when battery is fully charged. I have ordered another motor with even lower output at 161rpm. Then I can with no issues grind beans with the battery on storage charge (11.1V)

1o7qrbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o7qrbh/event_the_spiritual_revolution_or_a_riot_in_the/,"[EVENT] The Spiritual Revolution, or, a Riot in the Constitutional Convention","The First Lady sipped nervously at her coffee. It was too late for her to be drinking it. The clock ticked so loudly that it threatened to force the books off their shelves.

It wasn’t her place. That’s what everyone had told her, every day, for decades. In Junin she was the lowest of the low, a child of adultery, almost an Indian. She was a shame, the girl who reminded the people of Junin that their morally upright catholic men were in fact, filanderers and miscegenationists. Everywhere she went, there were whispers.

In Buenos Aires, she was nothing but a provincial oddity. That girl from nowhere. An actress, but without any real skill, maybe popular with las Grasas, but not a real thespian. Radio was a lower form. 

In politics, too, the actor’s union was, in the grand scheme of things, a minor player in Argentine politics. For all the power that it had over the day-to-day thinking of Argentines, it was still a marginal player. She could only do so much, a few minor concessions here and there. Wherever she won, there were always a thousand more battles to fight. More uptight Porteños in business suits or Military uniforms, so obsessed with proving their social superiority to the masses that made them rich. That made Argentina rich.

To them, she was nothing more than the queen of the Cabecitas negras. She had no memory of her father, but she knew that he would hate everything she did. Hate Everything she was. That thought gave her comfort.

She had one ally, though, stronger than any General. Wherever she went, there was Love. There was Faith. There was Justice. The people would protect her, would protect this revolution, far deeper than the French or even Russian ones, because this was a spiritual revolution. A revolution in the way people viewed themselves and each other. This was the revolution not of the state, but of the soul.

Of course, the state had to change with it. 

That’s why she was waiting here. The clock struck 6:30. They were going over, though that wasn’t surprising. They’d been behind schedule for the past 3 months.

The door burst open. “Mrs Peron…” Before her stood Hector Campora, the soft-spoken provincial dentist, his ill-fitting suit unmistakably stained with sweat. He hadn’t slept the night before. 

“Hector! What happened? Is it over?” 

He would’ve laughed under any other circumstances.

“No. Not even close. The Radicals, those…” He struggled to find the words. Eva was no stranger to obscene language, and in fact, since the inauguration, the amount of swearing in the Argentine government had gone up a thousand times, but Hector still found it awkward to speak coarsely in front of a lady. “…cowards, they are threatening to walk out unless we strike re-election from the constitution.”

Anger began welling up in Eva. “Let them walk out. There is no question about it. Re-election must be enshrined. We cannot allow them to retake power before… before our work is done.”

“Domingo won’t let them. He doesn’t want this to look so partisan that he—“

“To hell with how it looks!” Eva interrupted him. “Look outside Hector! See those people. For the first time, they have gotten a taste of freedom, real freedom. Not empty liberty! Not Freedom to starve but Freedom to live! Now they, those bastards, want to take that away. We need Juan, Argentina needs Peron!” The last word hung in the air. Despite herself, Eva sometimes called the man by his last name. Their last name. 

“You don’t have to tell me that,” Hector spoke into the silence.

“I know Hector, I know.” A moment later: “I’m sorry, I’ve just been on edge. We all are, Juan looks like he’s awaiting execution. I haven’t seen him look this bad since…” She trailed off. Honestly, he looked worse now than he did those fateful days in October, nearly 5 years ago now, when the last gasps of the infamous decade tried to remove him from Argentina permanently. 

“Domingo won’t be moved on this; he wants either a compromise or the clause removed entirely. He thinks the Radicals can be convinced to vote for it then. It would be nearly unanimous.” 

Domingo Mercante, the leader of the constitutional convention, was obsessed, Eva thought, with appeasing those damn radicals. He was too popular to be kicked out from his position as Governor of Buenos Aires Province, otherwise Eva would’ve forced the issue years ago. Now he was making it even harder to do what had to be done.

“Compromise with the radicals? So they can stab us in the back in two years time?”

“If you don’t mind me asking ma’am” Hector chose his words very carefully: “What would Juan prefer?”

“He doesn’t know what’s best for him. I don’t think he really understands what this country needs.”

“I see…”

“I’ll talk with Elena, see if she can help us with Domingo. If she can be convinced, I’m sure he’ll follow.”

Hector nodded, though his eyes drifted away from Eva’s. 

“If you think it would help… I believe that we should have the president speak to the assembly.” Hector wasn’t looking at her anymore.

“What would that help with?”

“Eva.”

“Who does that help? It doesn’t help Juan, I’ll tell you that much for fucking free!”

“We have to compromise. It’s the only way.”

“My way first. Domingo can be convinced.”

Hector gave her one of his trademark solemn looks. He was a good friend, a good ally to have, but sometimes she wondered about him. 

*********************

The Argentine Constitutional Convention has nearly broken down, as the Liberal (ish) UCR has refused to endorse the controversial Article 77, which allows for the re-election of the president. Domingo Mercante, the president of the convention, has refused to let the constitution come to a vote until a compromise is found. What that will be, or if Domingo will remain in charge of the convention, remains to be seen.",4,1760571072.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

I have such a great time talking to him. When I want to be friends with someone I usually meet them one on one. 

But I think he likes me. And I am and have always deeply confused about whether or not I have romantic feelings for someone...Like im often attracted to people but don't want/can't imagine a relationship with them. 
I like him. In what way I dunno. I'm thinking just friends because I respect him and don't want to mess with him. 

I just wanted to talk to him a lot. 
I feel this way often when I meet new people who interest me. I kind of have a bad tendency to show a lot of warmth and attention to people and then pull away when I realise we don't jell (I am naturally like this but it's confusing for others.  For me that's just getting to know someone; for others it's an unusual amount of attention to give.). 

But I can tell with him and this other girl that I really like them. I want their attention and I want to be their friend fr. 

So I couldn't resist the feeling and invited him for coffee... Couldn't invite other girl too because... I dunno I guess I could have but I don't think she cares abt him? Maybe I should have. But am I an asshole cuz I'm worried he will think it's a date? 

I don't know what's wrong with me I can't have friendships with men I'm attracted to in any degree because I'm not sure ever about what I'm feeling. 

But like also what am I supposed to do, ignore all male friendships and only hangout in group settings???

Please I'm so desperate.,"I (25F) and bf (25M) have been together for 4 years. A lot has happened that weighs on my bf now and I am desperately looking for anything to make him believe I wouldn't cheat again.

I have gone to therapy for my poor boundaries and I hate myself for the way I disrespected my boyfriend. Ever since I realized the extent of the damage I've done, it has eaten me alive and I've been putting everything into this relationship since I blocked my friend a year ago.

He was doing the best he could with how much he was hurting and I am such a bitch. I felt justified and victimized myself, but once the realization of my actions set in, it was too late. We have been getting along so well recently, but the root of the issue is it seems there is no way for him to trust me again no matter what was tried. He just suppresses it. It bubbles up in different ways, and he breaks up when he feels like he needs to escape. He says he can't be intimate without thinking about me having sex with someone else. I love him so much and we're having trouble letting each other go.

***Before I start, I never physically cheated. I emotionally cheated/had poor boundaries.***

**In the first two years of our relationship**, I was head over heels for him and I was doing my best to encourage open communication and better conflict resolution. It seemed like a lot of issues we had weren't up for discussion and he would shut down. He would stonewall me, but we would always make up in the end. It wasn't very frequent arguments until a year and a half in. We argued over the dumbest things and it started to get toxic and it felt like we had no mutual understanding. I told him that I'm scared we're on the verge of breaking up because of how poorly we handled conflicts.

I felt like I couldn't be open with him and I wish that I had just communicated this to him. I felt like such an asshole for not doing so.

This leads me to **the betrayal (emotional cheating) that started all this:**  
I got a call from a guy I flirted with on vacation YEARS before I met my bf. We rarely talked and it was platonic, but I was there for him during difficult times before. Turns out he was on the street and needed help sending out some resumes on Indeed using his account because his family and friends weren't willing to help (he has substance abuse issues) and he was running out of data on his phone. He lives in another state so I offered to help.

While I was at my boyfriends house for a sleepover (I went through hell to get my parents to let me come, very conservative) I was stressed out and responded like a fuckass to a text message I received from the guy. He said ""I love you so much thank you for helping me and I wish things had worked out between us."" My boyfriend was using my phone when that text came through, but I took my phone from him and deleted the text. Right then and there I blocked the guy on text and one other form of social media. I explained after what had happened. He obviously didn't believe me and I royally fucked up with that.  
For months after, he struggled to trust me and we fought even harder. I let him restore the deleted texts like he proposed, he said ""No it's fine, the fact you gave it to me is enough."" I though we were okay. I did my best to reassure him, let him go through my phone whenever he wanted, gave him full transparency but he lashed out on me until I couldn't tolerate it anymore. We had a massive breakup.

**Reconciliation attempt**: He came back a week after, said he is ready to forgive me and start trusting me again. He started treating me very well and I still kept letting him go through my phone as needed. He was hypervigilant with me still, because he questioned me about why I wore a sweater over my gym clothes when it was cold because he thought I was going somewhere after. He was really angry with me. I got a text in the middle of the night from my female friend while I was asleep, and I wasn't aware of it so he thought I was gaslighting him when I said I don't think I got a text message until I checked iMessage. Only a month had passed and I felt like we were never gonna get past it.

**I reopened his wounds.**  
I started to worry that he would find anything I do suspicious. I started calling my friend Jack more often for support because I started having panic attacks and wanted to talk to someone I didn't feel like I had to walk on eggshells around. He was there for me during a really traumatic event in my life and he was someone I felt safe with. I hung out with him once and didn't tell my boyfriend because we just got coffee and I realized this was a mistake.  
**I went back on my promise of transparency.** I deleted the calls I had with him because I didn't wanna make my bf feel insecure, but when he checked my phone, he noticed that my calls on messenger with him weren't in my phone log.  
He looked through the texts and saw he wasn't flirting with me but he dumped me after.  
We were limbo for a few months, and broke up for a month.  
I stopped talking to Jack as much after, and went for walks twice during the breakup to feel better because I had no other friends. 

I also didn't realize that I had a nickname from a long time ago in my chat with Jack. I used to be really fat so I named myself ""Madam thickness"" (I'm cringing so hard I was like 17), in the chat. I fucking forgot it was there so when I cleared it and changed it to my name with a flower emoji, he said ""CUTIE <3.""  
This hurt my bf even though we were in limbo. He immediately accused me of sleeping with Jack.

Despite this, we still got back together and **I did the following as he asked:**

\-I let him text Jack from my phone to see how he would respond to certain questions. We texted Jack, ""You cant call me that because I'm in a relationship."" When it finally came around to cutting him off, I hesitated because I really didn't like the relationship my bf and I had and I wanted to keep the person I felt safer with. I also didn't realize it at that moment that I developed some sort of feelings for Jack because of the emotional safety.

\-Few weeks after I blocked Jack and my bf asked me to record the call. As I blocked him, I ended the recorded with me saying goodbye and the call 4 seconds after but said ""Thank you for everything"" and started crying. I didn't want him to know that I cried but when I showed him the recording, he said I fucked the last chance I had to make this right.

**Since I blocked Jack a year ago,** we stayed together. I have been:  
\- focusing on how to make my boyfriend feel better  
\- stopped victimizing myself, and validated all his concerns  
\- soothed him during his breakdowns and made sure I didn't burden him with my own emotions  
\- let him check anything he needed (although he stopped)I still fixated on the negatives of the relationship   
  
I really gave it my all, but he still thinks I am texting Jack on the side when I am away from him and has graphic thoughts about me having sex with him.

Understandably, he has a diminished capacity to reciprocate affection sometimes. During my period, I got really upset that he told me to ""Go somewhere else for help,"" and he that me getting that upset made him relive all the trauma he suppressed. He said I was as cold as I was when I was cheating on him with Jack. He doesn't want me to unblock Jack and call him again because he thinks it will be a set up.

**Right now,** we are broken up and he said to give it a week without seeing each other so we can break the codependecy and physical aspect of our relationship. He says he doesn't want to let this go and needs me to think of something to keep going. He can't live with the weight of everything I had done last year while he was struggling to trust me again. He genuinely thinks I slept with Jack and won't believe any proof coming from the guy as he said. He said having sex with me feels humiliating and he suppressed this feeling and fights thoughts of another guys dick in my mouth. He says my reaction and the way Jack spoke to me points to us having more than an emotional affair.

He told me, ""I feel so free and good knowing I don't have to be vulnerable with you in bed or emotionally right now because it's so scary to me, but I would love to feel that again. Please find a way to fix this for me, I wish I could have forever with you.""

Please, please please please please give me any suggestions on what I can do to help him believe I won't cheat again. He isn't open to accepting anything I said about what had happened.",2,1760570940.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,0.75,False

Paid: $95

Proof: 130.5

Color: Deep Amber

Nose: Dark Cherry Cola and Oak on the nose.  The ethanol smell is punchy on this, but not surprising given the proof.  Hints of coffee or chocolate and Carmel are faint. The aroma is not incredibly strong, I’m struggling to find more notes for this one.

Palette: Very sweet up front with vanilla and oak and then a spicy rush of cinnamon as that proof kicks in.  Notes of chocolate, cherry, and strong oak on a second sip with a bit of a tobacco feel.  Toffee on the back end is pretty good, but fades quickly.   Also I took a sip of water between sips to cleanse my palette and that opened up a Carmel bomb on the next sip.

Feel:  Very creamy on the mouth, oily and viscous.  This has a great mouth feel.  Really smooth and drinkable despite the high proof.

Finish:  For as strong of a proof as this is, the finish doesn’t last very long.  I get lingering notes of Oak and caramel, but it fades quickly.

Overall- I’m really torn about how to rate this bourbon.  On one hand I absolutely love the pallet and feel… this tastes great and does an amazing job coating the pallet and feels very luxurious in the mouth. 

On the other hand, the nose and finish are weak, not saying they’re bad. They just don’t live up to the other components of this. Coupled with the fact that this bottle is approaching $100, it makes me feel like I’m not getting a complete experience for my money.  The proof, flavor, and mouth feel are excellent.  The finish and nose are where this one falls a little short I’m gonna write this a 6 out of 10. It’s a very good drink, but just falls a little short, especially given the price.

Hiya! I’m a 15 year old writer who just wrote her first story (or plot to story lol), I made a few updates and changes to the story (I still don’t have an epilogue, so bare with me on that), and I am just asking if you guys could give some advice from my story? It would help a lot!

DISCLAIMER: (this is A WORK IN PROGRESS; I’m just a girl)

In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But then, on Katie’s birthday, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, specifically Katie’s birthday party held by the soccer team, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away.

That same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma.

In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scarlett is sharp, observant, and often cynical, using biting humor to mask her vulnerability. She is perceptive and picks up on inconsistencies in her parents' behavior. 

Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Scottie’s earlier sense of humor transforms into a defense mechanism in adulthood, masking pain and her reluctance to engage with the realities of her past experiences. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss.

The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday, and the 28 year anniversary of the attack. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date.

While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in an argument, Scottie telling Trent why can’t she be what he is to Katie, which then turns into a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett.

But, at the same time, at my core I'm still the same person.

Two years ago, I was a fully believing member. However, as a result of being deeply in denial about who I was, I also suffered from crippling depression and panic attacks every couple of days. I had to be pulled mostly out of public school (it's a minor miracle I graduated on time) and I had days where, despite believing fully, I had to have a quiet anxiety attack in the bathroom between sacrament meeting and class. Talks and topics about families and marriage always felt like I was being stabbed, though I could never admit to myself why. I felt *horrible* about my porn ""addiction"" (once every two or three weeks) and had my bishop (a 70+ year old man) texting me daily to see if I had looked at it.

I was \*forcing\* myself to believe that all I wanted to do in the world was go on a mission, come back and go to college at BYU, and get married in the temple. But every time I contemplated it I just felt like I wanted to die. I tried to dive into church doctrine, reading my scriptures and reminding my family to do family study, but nothing could fill that horrible *emptiness* in my chest.

Fast forward two years, through the worst emotional pain I've ever experienced, \[TW\] >!a suicide attempt!<, a gradual acceptance of myself, and finally a deconstruction process that lasted for my entire senior year of high school, and I feel like a different person. I still have depression and anxiety, but they are no longer debilitating. I love myself. *All* of myself, including the parts of myself I hid for so many years. I got a tattoo. I drink tea and coffee regularly. I'm in a happy relationship, and we have sex with each other despite not, *gasp,* being married (and, y'know, both dudes). I'm in college and keeping up with my work without direct support from my parents. I have a whole friend group full of other queer people. I swear frequently and passionately.

And yet, at the same time, I'm still the same person. I still love books and video games and will infodump about them to anyone that will listen. I still fiercely love and support my friends no matter what. I'm still someone who will puts being there for someone in need over *anything* else, even if all they need is an unjudgmental ear. I'm still an optimistic, animated person that people say they enjoy spending time with. I still love music and miss being in a choir.

1o7qbyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/womensfashion/comments/1o7qbyi/got_complimented_on_my_asthetic_feels_like_i_hit/,"Got complimented on my ""asthetic,"" feels like I hit a personal style breakthrough (postpartum struggle)","I'll start by saying that I'm 35 years old, 4 months postpartum, still breastfeeding, and am recovering from a fashion identity crisis. I've spent the past two years or so trying to be more intentional with the clothes I buy, and nowadays I put a good deal of thought into what I buy, where I buy and how any new items will fit into my existing closet.


Obviously right now my existing closet is pretty small, because I'm still carrying 40 lbs of baby weight and nothing really fits. Between the pregnancy, the newborn trenches and a pelvic surgery that I had to have a few months before getting pregnant, I've basically been existing in various linen flowy pants and elastic waistbands for the past 15 months+. The flowy boho look was never really my style, but I think I kind of fell into it out of necessity, and also just out of general pandemic casualness. For a few years I really enjoyed being able to be **comfortable** in my clothes while WFH after spending a decade working in the fashion industry, wearing heels and blouses to work every day. 


It's been a bit of an identity crisis for me, because I've always been more of the edgy-but-put-together type. Lots of black, leather, denim, boots, earth tones, classic Americana, androgynous looks etc. But after going through all these body changes, and especially now being full of raging hormones while breastfeeding, I just can't wear the kinds of things I used to. I'm so sweaty and hot, I can't even LOOK at a leather jacket. I'm baby wearing all the time and I can't wear anything with a heel-- I need supportive, safe footwear lol. And whatever I wear needs to be nursing friendly as far as tops go ..it's a challenge to say the least. And it's been greatly affecting my sense of self for well over a year now. I'm not usually the type to wear leggings, sweats, hoodies etc outside of the house. I like getting dressed, but it's just taken a back seat to all of these things the past year or so.


Anyway, on to the complement. It was rather uneventful-- I was leaving a lactation support group with my son and decided to get coffee on the way home. The friendly barista said she liked my aesthetic and how cohesive it was (I realized then that I was extremely color coordinated, down to my phone case lol--with pops of hunter green throughout. My outfit wasn't trendy by any means-- I was wearing dark grey knit sweats with a basic heather tank, a thin navy wool cardigan with stripes, a hunter green baseball cap and UGGs. So not dressy at all, but I probably looked more put together than most who wear sweats on a coffee run.


 It made me feel really good because things have just felt like such a struggle to look the way I want to look and feel confident in what I'm wearing. Let alone feel like myself at all. But I will say I do feel confident In this outfit, and I do feel very ""me"" even though it's basically just sweats and uggs. And I put basically zero effort into it.  It got me thinking on why it worked and how I can keep replicating this energy


**What's working for me lately**

I think my outfit worked as a whole because I stuck to a limited color palette--cool tones: grey, navy, hunter green (except for the UGGs). I also noticed that the cardigan and the pants were both from Uniqlo, so they probably have a similar vibe even though I bought the items a few years apart.


It got me thinking that the key to having a defined personal style is to create a more cohesive closet that's easy to pull items from and have the items look good together. But I don't think you need to have some meticulously planned capsule wardrobe to do that.


By shopping within the same general color palette, it makes getting ready much more effortless and everything goes together more easily. I'm a lover of fashion, so I've always liked to partake in the new trends. But ever since my life really ""got real"" a few years ago I just haven't seen the benefit in buying into most of the trends that come and go. When I do that I find my purchases are short lived and typically clash with the items i already have and like to wear often.


 At this point I know what colors look good on me and what colors I gravitate towards. There are some colors that I like and look good on me, but I just don't pull them out of the closet. So I stopped buying those colors (beige, yellow, white, purple, ash, anything with those undertones and anything too bright). 


I've always been a fan of black and navy, and more classic earth tones. The color trends switch up every decade or so, but there's usually some variation of green in style (forest, hunter, army, olive) or red (maroon, cardinal, brick). Some times I'll do a pop of royal blue when its in style. The past several years I've really enjoyed browns being in style--chocolate/dark brown has been a staple; Terracotta has been a bit of a ""pop"" of color for me. There's been all shades of beige and taupe in style, but I just don't f with those ashy/ purple/pink/yellow undertones. 


The past few years I've made most of my purchases in black, navy or gray, even though the warm tone beiges were super popular. In general I know I like navy and black, and grey will always go better with those colors than a warm beige. Most of my outfits start with a black, navy, grey or denim base, and then I layer in secondary colors. Today's outfit was a grey base with navy and hunter green.


Other examples from some of my favorite recent outfits:

Grey denim, grey tank top, dark brown jacket, blue suede reboks (Grey + brown + dusty blue)

Black pants, black ringer tee, army green boucle coat, white & green sneakers (black + army + white) 

Dark wash denim + navy track jacket + navy ballet flats (Navy color drench)

Light wash denim pants & jacket, brick red flannel button up, black strappy sandals (light denim + red + black)


I think the last thing that's really working for me is to stop experimenting with where I buy clothes and really hone in on the brands that work for me-- especially right now when I don't want to invest in anything too expensive due to the body changes. I  don't want to waste money on brands that haven't proven their value to me. So if a brand has had quality issues, inconsistent sizing, bad cuts in general, I'm just not shopping there anymore. I'm also not shopping online anymore because I've had consistent issues with fabric quality not living up to my expectations, so I'm shopping in store only these days. And that's really helped reduce the disappointment and never ending return-credit- return cycle. Abercrombie, Uniqlo and thrift stores are pretty much my go-tos right now. 


Anyway this is probably a massive rambling. But I just wanted to put my findings out there for anyone who might be in a similar funk, especially a postpartum fashion funk. I think overall listening to your gut and dialing into the colors/ brands/ cuts that actually make you feel like yourself will be the best way to get back to *you*. Rather than getting swept up in a revolving door of trends and influencer picks that might make the situation worse. ",8,1760569974.0,womensfashion,1,0.9,False

1o7qati,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o7qati/how_i_fixed_my_attention_span_and_finally_got/,"how i fixed my attention span and finally got things done (no bs, just neuroscience + real tools)","Everyone’s attention span is shot these days. You sit down to focus and suddenly, it’s 3 hours later, you’ve watched 17 TikToks, Googled whether or not you should move to Iceland, and somehow ended up doomscrolling Reddit threads about productivity guilt. You’re not alone. This isn’t a lack of willpower. It’s a broken system. Our brains weren’t designed to battle 100 dopamine traps an hour. And yet, influencers with no credentials scream “Just use a planner!” like that’s gonna reverse decades of neurohacking by billion-dollar tech companies.

This post is different. Everything here is backed by top neuroscientists, bestselling authors, elite performers, and real frameworks that *actually* help you rewire your focus system and get things done. No fluff. No guilt. Just tools.

**practical attention reset tips (based on neuroscience, not vibes)**

* **The “30s delay rule” for phone addiction** Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) says a simple 30-second delay before checking your phone helps retrain your dopamine system. Just pause, breathe, and decide *why* you’re checking. This builds the prefrontal override muscle. Do this daily and your compulsions drop in a week.
* **Use “task bracketing” instead of motivation** Dr. Cal Newport explains this in *Deep Work*. Don't try to ""feel like it"". Instead, start and end each work session with the same ritual (music, lighting, tea, stretching). It trains your brain to expect focus during that time. You condition your state instead of waiting for it.
* **Visual timers > to-do lists for ADHD-type brains** To-do lists lie. They make you *feel* productive but don’t help focus. Use visual countdowns (like Time Timer or Forest app) to lock into tasks. 25 minutes on, 5 off. Real-time urgency makes your brain stay on track better than lists do.
* **Protect your “sentry node” with a zero-stimulus hour** Neuroscientist Dr. Adam Gazzaley calls your prefrontal cortex the “sentry” that protects attention. Every ping weakens it. Try 1 hour a day with zero inputs (no music, notifications, podcasts). Just work. This resets cognitive control and helps your brain remember how to focus.
* **Don’t trust your brain, externalize everything** Productivity coach Tiago Forte swears by the “Second Brain” method. Offload everything—ideas, tasks, links, into systems (Notion, Obsidian, pen and paper). Your brain wasn’t made to store. It was made to think. Free it up so it can do that.
* **Cue-controlled deep work sessions** Set environmental triggers like noise-canceling headphones, one scent (peppermint oil), and one playlist. Repetition wires your brain to associate these cues with flow state. It’s Pavlov for productivity. After 1-2 weeks, entering focus mode becomes automatic.
* **Avoid dopamine stacking during focus time** Dr. Anna Lembke (*Dopamine Nation*) warns against layering dopamine sources (coffee + music + social media tabs open). You get addicted to the stimulation, not the task. Strip it down. One dopamine source max during deep work or your brain won’t learn sustainable focus.

**top resources to fix your attention span**

* **Stolen Focus by Johann Hari** Instant NYT Bestseller. Hari interviews experts across neuroscience, tech, and education to explain *why* attention is collapsing globally. Eye-opening and full of actionable solutions. This book will make you rethink everything about multitasking, social media, and even schools.
* **Deep Work by Cal Newport (book + YouTube lectures)** This is *the* playbook for reclaiming your brain in a distracted world. Newport breaks down how elite creatives, coders, and knowledge workers build “deep work rituals” to do what others can’t. It’s intense—but it works.
* **The Huberman Lab Podcast (esp. episodes on focus & dopamine)** Huberman is a Stanford neurobiologist who explains complex brain stuff in clear, usable ways. Best episodes: “Controlling Dopamine to Increase Motivation,” “Tools for Focus,” and “ADHD & Attention.” Actual lab-tested strategies.
* **BeFreed: an AI-powered personalized learning app** If you struggle to sit through books but *still* want to master topics like focus, dopamine, and productivity, this app is gold. Built by a team from Columbia University, it turns expert books, talks, and scientific research into short podcast episodes and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You can pick 10, 20, or 40-minute formats, and even choose the host’s voice vibe. What’s wild is it learns from what you listen to and builds a personalized study roadmap over time. The app has full coverage of every book recommended in this post, plus thousands more across neuroscience, motivation, brain health, and even trauma recovery.
* **Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke** One of the most important books you’ll ever read about modern addiction and attention. Written by a Stanford psychiatrist who treats digital and substance addictions, it explains how dopamine hijacks our motivation system and how to fix it, without going off-grid.
* **Struthless (YouTube)** Funny but sharp. Struthless breaks down attention, ADHD, dopamine burnout, and self-discipline in a way that makes you feel less alone and more motivated. Highly recommended: “How I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things” and “How Dopamine Culture Is Breaking Your Brain.”
* **The Shallows by Nicholas Carr** Pulitzer finalist. This book was way ahead of its time. It dissects how the internet literally rewires your brain to crave distraction and erode long-form thought. If you’ve ever felt “mentally blurry” after scrolling too long, this book explains why.
* **Freedom app** A simple but ruthless app blocker. You schedule “focus sessions” where it disables your distracting apps (and browser, if you want). It’s painful. But it’s the training wheels your brain needs when you’re rebuilding attention habits from scratch.
* **The Tim Ferriss Show (focus-specific episodes)** Ferriss interviews peak performers and deconstructs their routines. Some highlights for attention: interviews with Cal Newport, James Clear (Atomic Habits), and Chris Bailey (Hyperfocus). Pick an episode, take notes, and try just one tactic from it that day.
* **Make Time by Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky** A playful but tactical book written by two ex-Google guys. It’s full of tiny hacks that help you design your day for focus, especially useful if you hate rigid routines or you’re a creative. Each page is like a new experiment you can try.

Let me know if you want a breakdown of how to build a “focus sprint” schedule based on your energy levels. It’s not one-size-fits-all. But with the right cues, timers, and friction blocks, even the most distracted brain can build back better.",3,1760569891.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1o7q9fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1o7q9fe/poesie_ghouls_night_collection_review/,Poesie “Ghoul’s Night” Collection review,"*Poesie “Ghoul’s Night” Collection review*

I received my set yesterday and was blown away by these scents. These are truly some of the BEST scents I’ve smelled from Poesie!
I will do my best to give you an idea of what these scents conjure up for me when trying them on my skin. 



🖤JERSEY DEVIL  - black tea, a forest of pine and cedar, sun-baked pine needles, dragon’s blood incense, moss, coastal mist

When I read the notes of this one I dismissed it, thinking it would lean too masculine for me but omg was I ever wrong. Jersey Devil is the most intoxicating scent. I want to bathe in it. I picture myself in a clawfoot bathtub in the middle of the Pine Barrens sipping a steaming cup of black tea. It starts to drizzle and I just close my eyes and inhale my surroundings. Instant calm and serenity. 

🖤MOTHMAN- red musk, black tea, tobacco leaf, warm nutmeg, an ancient mountain forest, spiced amber

Another one that surprised me! The combination of the nutmeg & amber amongst the tobacco leaf really warms this up. This made me think of being cozied up to a fireplace in a cottage wearing a comfy flannel again, with a cup of tea in hand. I’m guessing it’s the red musk note that really adds depth and a bit of a woody quality. Sexy & mysterious. 

🖤NESSIE - black tea, buttery Scottish shortbread biscuits, lakewater, highland heather, peat smoke

Nessie is special. She is truly my favorite of this collection. Poesie’s black tea note is so photorealistic to my nose and when you combine it with the shortbread biscuits and the atmospheric notes, she SINGS. The heather is slightly similar to a less earthy lavender. I know that anise isn’t one of the notes but I keep finding myself smelling it. Peat smoke brings an earthy quality to this and you truly feel as if you’re outdoors on a hunt for the Loch Ness Monster. This is an atmospheric done right! 👏🏼

 

🖤SOLAR WITCH - coffee, crisp autumn air, apple cider donuts, sunflowers, warm sandalwood, a faint whisper of hearth fire

This one truly smells just like the notes. It makes me think of a fall festival, walking along as leaves fall and smelling all of the scents nearby. When first applied, the coffee note (which I love) is pretty pronounced but it lessens over time making way for the apple. The sandalwood really grounds the fragrance and gives it lasting power. This scent doesn’t smell like a candle but would be wonderful in candle form! I want my home to smell like this. 

🖤BLACK CAT CUDDLES - sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon & black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest

First of all, I am fully obsessed with this scent. I want to smell like this day and night. This smells like a nuzzle from your ancient witch ancestor who has just so happened to take the form of a black cat. They have just come back inside from a nighttime jaunt through the forest & have hopped in your lap. You bend down and put your nose into their fur and inhale. Slightly smoky yet sweet, and completely enchanting. 

🖤SALTY GHOST - marauding marshmallows, spiced rum, an oak gangplank, grey amber

When I imbibe, rum is typically my spirit of choice and it is done so well in Salty Ghost! Marshmallow sweetens the deal but the boozy rum really shines. Oak and amber in the background make for a beautiful woody base. This is what I’d wear if planning to have a romp with a mysterious pirate aboard his ship. 😏

🖤INTROVERT GOBLIN - chai tea with extra cardamom, a cozy stack of old books, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice

As someone who is obsessed with cardamom, that blast right off the bat makes my eyes roll back in my head. As it settles it makes way for the chai which is so warm and comforting. I like that the pumpkin note is in the background and doesn’t steal the show. The marshmallow note is definitely present and adds a playful vibe to an otherwise studious scent. Makes me think of someone wearing a Catholic school uniform but with white ruffle butt panties underneath. 🤭

I know this one isn’t a part of the Ghoul’s Night Collection but I wanted to share my review anyway 

🖤DEMETER - rosy red apples baked with apple pie spices, cinnamon sticks, creamy vanilla-laced rice pudding with brulee topping

If you are looking for a realistic apple fragrance then Demeter is it. Right off the bat it’s extremely fresh, as if you just cut into an apple. As it begins to dry down the complexity amps up and all of the spicy notes come into view. After being on for a bit you definitely smell the creaminess. I’m in the mood to make an apple pie after smelling this one!

1o7q5xx,https://i.redd.it/sabpjs8ykcvf1.jpeg,What Rally Coilovers?,"Hello friendos!  
I got my ""new"" 2005 wrx about 2 months ago, and I have been fixing it up. One of the things I need to fix now is the current coilovers. In hindsight, this was obviously a VERY BAD idea, but I was really eager to go to my first rally cross event in this car... in maxspeedingrods BFO coilovers that came with it. During the event, there was a massive pothole I had hit (to avoid cones someone else had hit right before me)  and it snapped the strut.  
  
My question here is, what coilovers do you guys recommend? What I am looking for is mainly daily driving, very minimal spirited driving, and most importantly is survivability for the \~4 rally cross events a year. What I loved about the BFO's was how stiff it felt, where I can feel every tiny nook of the road. I just didn't like how expensive every scrape / bump felt towards my car lol. I do not mind adjusting the dampeners before each event (or ride height, but I heard you need an alignment?), but what I really want is rebuildability in case anything like this happens again. I have done a bit of my own research and came back with a headache lol.  
  
One that stood out to me initially, that I wanted for my other car before I crashed it, was the BC racing BR coilovers. It seems like the best ones I can get for my budget, however, I have heard very mixed reviews. I don't want to spend more then like 1500$, at the very most 2500$ but it seems like I need to, in order to get some good quality ones like bilstein b16 pss10. I heard koni yellows are really good but mainly for track use? There's just so many to choose from and I have heard good and bad about a lot of them.  
  
If need be, I wouldn't mind going to a junkyard to get OEM suspension stuff and upgrading the parts for it if that is a better alternative. I am just assuming that'll be like 1000$+, so at that point might as well get better suspension stuff you know? I just want to try and buy one brand, one set that I can always buy ""forever"" without spending that forever money. (replacing parts that break without breaking my budget of 2500$ initially). And if I can save up a bit for better ones, I might just do that, I just don't want to be stuck in that loop of having to save up to save up for a 3000$, then end up wanting to save for 4000$, then 5000$, etc. Basically, if I can buy the one time right now I'll do it, but if not I wouldn't mind going with the BC BR coilovers as just the first pair i'll get, until I can afford thousands of dollars to throw at just the suspension. Whatever I do get now, I will most likely upgrade eventually (for stage rally), only once I move to Idaho in a couple of months.

1o7q41k,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1o7q41k/help_me_make_this_recipe_better/,Help me make this recipe better.,"I made this a week ago with leftover steak and leftover pasta and it was a 9.5/10.  

Leftover steak, thinly sliced
 • 4–6 oz egg noodles, cooked
 • 2 tbsp butter
 • 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
 • ½ small onion, finely chopped 
 • 3–4 tbsp cream cheese, room temperature
 • ½–¾ cup whole milk
 • 2–3 tbsp sun-dried tomatoes (chopped; oil-packed or rehydrated)
 • ¼ cup grated Parmesan
 • Salt & black pepper, to taste

I tried it today with leftover brisket and it was a 7/10.   Im guessing I can’t substitute brisket for steak. Or can it?

What can I do to the original recipe to make it better?


Edit

I just realized that I’m stuffy.  I smelled some coffee grounds and I can barely smell it.

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR WDIS POSTS**

* Position-specific scoring rules (PPR, TE premium, 4 or 6 pt passing TD, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, std/PPR, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
* This week's opponents of your players
* Entire roster if helpful

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WE HAVE A BOT THAT CAN REFERENCE THE BORIS CHEN RANKINGS AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK**

To invoke the bot, comment anywhere in this sub in the following format:

!boristiers position [player, player, player...]

Where position is a standard position acronym (dst, flex, qb, rb, te, wr) and player, player, player... is a comma-separated list of players for that position. Here's some examples:

!boristiers flex [hunter henry, keenan allen, melvin gordon]   
!boristiers rb [matt breida, tevin coleman]  
!boristiers qb [lamar jackson]  

The bot will reply to your comment with a table of player ranks in the format of {tier}.{position_in_tier} for each of the applicable forms of scoring. If a player is not found / ranked, they'll be denoted as N/A.

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only the player name. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you would start that player.
* Remember most people know how to look up rankings. They come here for discussion, start a discussion!
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

----------------
**individual WDIS threads posted after this point will be deleted in order to keep the subreddit clean. Post here instead! If everyone sorts by new, your questions should be answered.**

# Your Morning Routine Just Got a Massive Upgrade

Imagine it's Monday morning. You open GitHub. Thirty notifications wait for you. Three pull requests need review. Five issues need triage. Someone broke the build over the weekend. Your project board looks like a tornado hit it, with tasks scattered across columns that made sense two sprints ago.

You grab coffee and start the ritual every project manager knows. Check each PR. Read the context. Assign reviewers. Update labels. Move cards. Prioritize bugs. Update status fields. By the time you're done, it's 10 AM and you haven't written a single line of code.

On October 14, 2025, that reality changed.

GitHub dropped an update to their MCP Server that fundamentally shifts how AI interacts with your development workflow. We're not talking about a chatbot that answers questions. This is AI that actually manages your project board, triages your issues, and handles the administrative work that eats your productive hours.

The automation wave everyone predicted? It's here. But here's the twist: developers and managers should both be celebrating. Because when AI handles the busywork, humans get to do what they're actually good at. Solving problems. Building features. Thinking creatively about architecture.

What follows is the complete story of how GitHub Projects automation became reality, why the Model Context Protocol makes it possible, and how to get this working for your team this week. Spoiler: the setup takes less time than your next standup meeting.

# The Secret Language AI Uses to Talk to Your Tools

Let's start with the foundation, because understanding Model Context Protocol is the key to grasping why this update matters.

Every AI tool you've used has the same frustrating limitation. It lives in a bubble. Sure, Claude can write brilliant code. ChatGPT can explain complex concepts. But getting them to actually interact with your tools? That's been a nightmare of custom integrations, brittle API connections, and code that breaks every time something updates.

Think about your development workflow. You use GitHub for code. Jira for project tracking. Slack for communication. AWS for infrastructure. Datadog for monitoring. Each tool has its own API. Its own authentication. Its own quirks and limitations. Connecting AI to all of them means building and maintaining dozens of custom integrations.

Model Context Protocol solves this the same way USB-C solved cable chaos. It's a universal standard that lets AI tools talk to any service through a common language. One protocol. One authentication pattern. One way to structure requests and responses.

Anthropic created MCP in November 2024, and the tech world immediately understood its potential. This wasn't just another API standard. This was the universal translator that makes agentic AI actually practical.

The adoption tells the story. AWS built MCP servers. Microsoft shipped ten of them. Azure, Cloudflare, PayPal, Stripe, IBM, Notion, MongoDB. The list keeps growing because MCP solves a problem everyone has: how do you let AI interact with your tools without building a thousand custom integrations?

GitHub's MCP Server became the poster child for what this standard enables. Instead of teaching AI about GitHub's API intricacies, you give it an MCP server that handles the translation. The AI speaks MCP. GitHub speaks MCP. They understand each other perfectly.

This matters more than another API because it's not about GitHub. It's about every tool in your stack speaking the same language. When that happens, AI stops being a fancy chatbot and becomes an actual teammate that can take action across your entire workflow.

# GitHub MCP Server: The Bridge Between AI and Code

So what exactly is GitHub MCP Server? Strip away the technical jargon and it's beautifully simple: it's software that sits between AI and GitHub, translating requests into actions.

You tell your AI to close stale issues. The AI doesn't need to know GitHub's REST API or authentication flows or rate limits. It just uses the MCP server, which handles all that complexity. The AI speaks in simple terms. The MCP server makes it happen.

GitHub launched the public preview in April 2025, and developers immediately started building wild automations. The official release came in September 2025, and by October, teams were reporting productivity gains that seemed too good to be true. Except they were true, backed by actual metrics and real usage data.

The server comes in two flavors. Local deployment runs on your machine, perfect for individual developers who want AI assistance while coding. Remote deployment runs in the cloud, ideal for team workflows and automation that needs to run 24/7.

Before October, the server already offered impressive capabilities. Repository intelligence meant AI could understand your codebase structure, read code files, and answer questions about implementation details. Issue tracking automation handled creating, updating, and organizing issues based on context. Pull request automation managed the entire review workflow. Security monitoring caught vulnerabilities before they reached production.

Developers started sharing stories online. One frontend engineer configured their AI to automatically request reviews from the right team members based on which files changed. A DevOps lead set up automatic issue creation whenever CI/CD pipelines failed. A security team built workflows that scanned every PR for potential vulnerabilities and flagged them before merge.

The GitHub MCP Server wasn't just useful. It was changing how teams worked. And then October 14 arrived with an update that took everything to the next level.

# The October Revolution: AI Meets Project Boards

GitHub Projects has been around for years, but most teams use it like a fancy to-do list. Create some columns. Add some cards. Move things around manually. It works, but it requires constant attention and manual updates.

The October 14 update changed the game by giving AI direct access to your project boards.

The new Projects toolset lets AI see your entire project structure. It can list all your projects, retrieve details about specific boards, and understand how you've organized your work. But visibility is just the start.

AI can now manage project items automatically. Create new items. Update field values. Move cards between columns. Add issues and pull requests to projects. Remove completed work. All without human intervention.

Why does this matter so much? Because project board management is pure busywork that drains hours every week. Someone finishes a task. They forget to move the card. Another person starts code review. The status field doesn't update. A bug gets reported. It sits in the wrong column for three days before someone notices.

Multiply that across a team of ten developers and dozens of tasks. The cognitive overhead becomes crushing. People stop updating the board because it's tedious. The board becomes outdated. Then it becomes useless. Then someone schedules a meeting to fix the board and the cycle repeats.

Now imagine this scenario instead: Your AI monitors pull request activity. When someone opens a PR, it automatically moves the related task to ""In Review."" When the PR gets approved, it updates to ""Ready to Deploy."" When CI/CD completes successfully, it moves to ""Done"" and updates the completion timestamp.

Or this: A critical bug report comes in Friday afternoon. Your AI reads the issue, understands the severity from the description, automatically creates a project card, assigns it to the on-call engineer, updates the priority field to ""High,"" and moves it to the top of the ""To Do"" column. By Monday morning, your team knows exactly what needs attention first.

The magic extends to sprint grooming. AI can analyze your backlog, identify tasks that haven't moved in weeks, suggest priorities based on dependencies and team capacity, and reorganize your board before the planning meeting. What used to take an hour of discussion now takes five minutes of review.

Smart task distribution becomes possible. AI understands who's working on what, who has capacity, and what skills different tasks require. It can automatically assign new issues to the right person and balance workload across the team.

Here's the important caveat: this power doesn't activate automatically. GitHub deliberately left Projects out of the default configuration. You need to manually enable it, which takes about thirty seconds but prevents AI from touching your project boards without explicit permission.

Enabling it is straightforward. Open your MCP server configuration. Add the Projects toolset to your enabled tools list. Restart the server. That's it. Your AI now has project management capabilities.

The time savings are substantial. Teams report spending 60 to 90 minutes per week on project board maintenance. That's four to six hours per month. Fifty hours per year. Automate it and you've just given every developer an extra week of productive time annually.

# The Diet Plan: Why Less Is More

While adding GitHub Projects support, GitHub made another crucial change: they simplified the default configuration dramatically.

Before October, the MCP server shipped with a dozen different toolsets enabled by default. Repository management. Issues. Pull requests. Labels. Milestones. Releases. Projects. Users. Files. Branches. Commits. Webhooks. It was comprehensive but overwhelming.

The new default configuration includes exactly five toolsets: context, repos, issues, pull\_requests, and users. Everything else requires explicit enabling.

This seems counterintuitive. Why offer less functionality out of the box? The answer reveals sophisticated thinking about how AI actually works.

Context provides the foundational information AI needs to understand your repositories and development environment. Without context, every other tool operates in a vacuum. This stays enabled because nothing works well without it.

Repos gives AI access to repository structure, code files, and project organization. This is the core of what developers need: understanding and navigating codebases.

Issues represent problems that need solving. Whether bugs, features, or technical debt, issues drive development work. AI needs issue access to understand what the team is building and why.

Pull requests are where code review and collaboration happen. AI can't help with development workflow without seeing PRs, understanding changes, and tracking review status.

Users identify who's doing what. AI needs to know team members, their roles, and their activity to make intelligent decisions about assignments and workload.

What got trimmed? Milestones moved to the repos toolset. Releases got consolidated with broader repository management. Labels became a separate toolset you enable when needed. Projects, as discussed, requires manual activation. Branches, commits, and webhooks are available but optional.

The performance improvements from this diet are immediately noticeable. AI response times drop because it's not processing irrelevant information. Reasoning chains become clearer because the AI focuses on what matters. Token consumption decreases, which means faster execution and lower costs for API-based usage. Decision accuracy improves because the AI isn't confused by data it doesn't need.

Think about it like workspace organization. A desk covered in papers, tools, and random objects slows you down. You can't find what you need. You get distracted by irrelevant things. A clean desk with just what you need for the current task lets you work efficiently.

Adding back removed toolsets is trivial. Edit your configuration file. Add the toolset name to the enabled list. Restart. Done. This means you get the performance benefits of a minimal default while maintaining the flexibility to expand when specific needs arise.

Enterprise teams appreciate this approach because it reduces security surface area. Every enabled toolset is a potential vector for mistakes or misuse. Starting minimal and expanding deliberately means better control over what AI can access.

# One Tool to Rule Them All: The Consolidation Story

Beyond the default configuration changes, GitHub fundamentally restructured how tools work.

The old approach offered granular specificity. Want to get pull request details? Use the get\_pull\_request tool. Need to see files changed? Use get\_pull\_request\_files. Check CI status? Use get\_pull\_request\_status. View the diff? Use get\_pull\_request\_diff. Read reviews? Use get\_pull\_request\_reviews. Check review comments? Use get\_pull\_request\_review\_comments.

Six separate tools for pull request operations. Each with its own configuration. Each requiring separate documentation. Each adding complexity to how AI reasons about what action to take.

The October update consolidated everything into one tool: pull\_request\_read. This single tool handles all pull request reading operations through a method parameter. Need details? Call pull\_request\_read with method set to ""get."" Want files? Same tool, method is ""get\_files."" Check status? Method becomes ""get\_status.""

Available methods cover every use case: get, get\_files, get\_status, get\_diff, get\_reviews, get\_review\_comments. One tool. One authentication flow. One place to configure permissions. Six capabilities.

Label management got the same treatment. Instead of separate tools for creating labels, updating them, and deleting them, you get one label toolset with three methods: create, update, delete.

Why does consolidation matter beyond tidiness? Because AI performs better with unified interfaces.

When AI needs to work with pull requests, it doesn't have to choose between six different tools. It just uses pull\_request\_read and specifies what information it needs. This reduces decision complexity, speeds up execution, and makes troubleshooting easier.

Configuration files become simpler. Instead of enabling six pull request tools individually, you enable one and get everything. Permissions management simplifies. You grant access to pull request operations once, not six times.

Faster execution happens because the AI spends less time figuring out which tool to use. It knows: pull requests mean pull\_request\_read. Labels mean the label toolset. The cognitive load drops for both AI and humans managing the system.

Troubleshooting gets easier too. When something goes wrong with pull request operations, you check one tool's logs instead of trying to figure out which of six tools failed. Error messages become clearer. Solutions become more obvious.

The developer experience improves across the board. Writing automation scripts becomes more intuitive. Reading configuration files requires less mental parsing. Teaching new team members about the system takes less time.

This consolidation philosophy extends beyond GitHub. It's part of the broader MCP ecosystem trend toward cleaner, more maintainable integrations. As more tools adopt MCP, this kind of thoughtful API design becomes the standard rather than the exception.

# Rolling It Out: Your Implementation Roadmap

Ready to set this up for your team? The process is straightforward but requires attention to detail.

Start with prerequisites. You need a GitHub account with appropriate permissions for the repositories you want AI to access. For organizational workflows, you typically need admin access. For personal projects, owner access suffices.

Authentication uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE, which sounds complicated but works smoothly. PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange, a security enhancement that prevents certain types of attacks. In practice, you authorize once and the system handles everything afterward.

For local server installation, the process depends on your AI platform. Claude Desktop users add the server through the settings panel. VS Code and Cursor have extension marketplaces with GitHub MCP Server available. Installation takes two minutes. Configuration adds another two.

Remote server deployment offers more flexibility. You can run it on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or any hosting platform that supports Go applications. GitHub provides Docker containers for easy deployment. Once running remotely, multiple team members can share the same server instance.

Activating GitHub Projects support specifically requires editing your configuration. Find the enabled toolsets section. Add ""projects"" to the list. Save the file. Restart your MCP server. AI can now manage your project boards.

Customizing toolsets for your workflow means thinking about what your team actually needs. A security-focused team might enable all security scanning tools. A small startup might stick with the minimal default. An enterprise might enable everything but restrict access by role.

Team deployment strategies vary by size. Small teams often start with shared remote servers that everyone accesses. Larger organizations might run multiple servers with different permission scopes. Some teams use local servers for sensitive repositories and remote servers for open source work.

Common pitfalls include permission issues, rate limiting, and configuration errors. Permission problems usually mean the OAuth token doesn't have the right scopes. Check your token permissions and regenerate if needed. Rate limiting happens when AI makes too many requests too quickly. The MCP server handles this automatically with exponential backoff. Configuration errors typically come from typos in JSON files. Validate your config with a JSON linter before restarting.

Testing your setup properly prevents frustrating troubleshooting later. Start with a simple request: ask your AI to list your repositories. If that works, try creating a test issue. Then update that issue. Then close it. Walk through each capability you need before deploying to production workflows.

# Real Teams, Real Results: Success Stories

Theory is nice. Real results are better. Teams across the industry are reporting significant productivity improvements.

An e-commerce startup with three developers eliminated their daily standup preparation time entirely. Their AI generates a summary every morning: what shipped yesterday, what's in progress, what's blocked, and what needs attention. The team reviews it over coffee and starts coding by 9:15 instead of 10:00.

A fintech company uses AI-powered code review triage. When PRs arrive, AI reads the changes, identifies potential issues, and assigns the right reviewers based on expertise and current workload. Complex changes go to senior engineers. Straightforward updates get fast-tracked to anyone available. Review time dropped from two days average to six hours.

A healthcare platform implemented intelligent bug prioritization. AI reads new issue reports, analyzes severity from description and affected components, checks if similar bugs exist, and automatically prioritizes based on impact and effort. Critical bugs surface immediately. Minor annoyances get batched for future sprints. The team stopped having weekly bug triage meetings.

Sprint planning changed for a gaming studio. Their AI analyzes the backlog three days before planning meetings, identifies tasks without clear acceptance criteria, flags work that depends on incomplete features, and suggests a realistic sprint commitment based on historical velocity. Planning meetings now focus on creative discussion instead of administrative sorting.

Security vulnerability tracking became automated at a consulting firm. Every PR gets scanned. AI identifies potential security issues, creates tickets for anything suspicious, and blocks merges when critical vulnerabilities appear. They caught a SQL injection vulnerability before it reached staging because AI flagged the suspicious database query pattern.

CI/CD failure analysis saves debugging time for a SaaS company. When builds fail, AI reads the logs, identifies the likely cause, checks if similar failures happened before, and either fixes simple issues automatically or creates detailed bug reports for complex problems. Developers get actionable information instead of raw log dumps.

The productivity metrics are striking. Teams report 25 to 40 percent gains in developer productivity. Not from writing code faster, but from eliminating the context switching and administrative overhead that fragments focus. A developer who spends three hours per week on project management tasks gets those hours back for actual development.

One team lead put it simply: ""We hired AI as a project coordinator and got a tireless team member who never forgets to update the board, never assigns work to someone who's overloaded, and never schedules unnecessary meetings. It's not replacing humans. It's letting humans be more human.""

# The MCP Ecosystem: What's Coming Next

GitHub Projects automation is one piece of a much larger movement. The MCP ecosystem is exploding with new servers, integrations, and capabilities.

The GitHub MCP Registry tracks available servers. When MCP launched in late 2024, a handful of experimental servers existed. By mid-2025, dozens were available. Today the registry lists hundreds of servers covering everything from databases to deployment tools to design systems.

Industry-wide adoption validates the protocol's value. Microsoft didn't just build one MCP server. They built ten, covering their entire productivity suite. Email. Calendar. Tasks. Documents. Spreadsheets. Presentations. Teams. SharePoint. OneDrive. Power Platform. They're betting big on MCP as the future of tool integration.

Salesforce launched AgentExchange with MCP at its core. PayPal, Stripe, IBM, Notion, MongoDB, and others are building MCP integrations. The goal is an ecosystem where AI agents can seamlessly interact with business tools without custom coding.

Block, Apollo, Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph joined as early adopters. These companies build developer tools, and they recognize that MCP makes their products dramatically more useful. When your code editor can talk to your deployment pipeline through a standard protocol, powerful workflows become possible.

Upcoming GitHub features expand the MCP server's capabilities further. Secret scanning integration will let AI detect exposed credentials and API keys. Agent-to-agent workflows will enable multiple AI systems to collaborate on complex tasks. Advanced security features will provide deeper visibility into vulnerability management.

The agentic development movement gains momentum with every MCP release. Agentic development means AI that takes initiative, makes decisions, and executes tasks without constant human guidance. MCP provides the foundation by giving AI reliable ways to interact with tools.

Vibe coding is entering mainstream discussion. Instead of writing precise commands, developers describe what they want in natural language and AI figures out the implementation. ""Deploy the latest changes to staging and run the test suite"" becomes a simple request that AI executes through MCP servers for GitHub, AWS, and your CI/CD platform.

Standardization wins because it creates network effects. Every new MCP server makes the protocol more valuable. Every tool that adopts MCP becomes more useful. Developers learn one integration pattern instead of dozens.

The 2025 predictions about AI transforming software development are materializing faster than expected. Not through science fiction scenarios where AI writes entire applications from scratch, but through practical automation of routine tasks that free developers to focus on creative problem-solving.

# Your Next Move

Three game-changing updates arrived on October 14: GitHub Projects automation that eliminates project management busywork, a streamlined default configuration that makes AI faster and smarter, and consolidated tools that simplify every workflow.

Waiting costs you productivity. Every day your team manually updates project boards is a day of wasted time. Every hour spent in triage meetings is an hour not spent building. Every week of administrative overhead is a week your competitors might be automating.

The compound effect of early adoption is real. Teams who implement this now gain advantages that multiply over time. Better organized work leads to clearer priorities. Clearer priorities lead to faster execution. Faster execution leads to more features shipped. More features shipped leads to happier customers. The flywheel accelerates.

Take these steps this week:

Install the GitHub MCP Server on your local machine or deploy it remotely for team access. The setup takes less than ten minutes. Enable GitHub Projects support in your configuration if you use project boards. Test with a simple workflow like automatic issue creation. Expand gradually as you discover what works for your team.

Join the MCP community on GitHub discussions. Hundreds of developers are sharing tips, workflows, and solutions. The community-built automation scripts can jumpstart your implementation.

Read the official documentation at [docs.claude.com](http://docs.claude.com) for comprehensive guides. Browse the GitHub MCP Registry to discover other tools your AI can interact with. Follow the GitHub changelog for updates and new capabilities.

Start small but start today. Pick one annoying manual task. Automate it with AI through the MCP server. Experience the satisfaction of watching busywork disappear. Then automate another task. And another. Before you know it, your workflow transforms.

The future of development isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about AI handling the tedious parts so developers can focus on the interesting parts. Building elegant solutions. Solving complex problems. Creating experiences that delight users.

GitHub just gave you the tools to make that future your present. The question isn't whether AI will change how you work. The question is whether you'll be leading that change or catching up to it later.

Choose wisely. Your project board is waiting.

1o7q259,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1o7q259/early_breast_growth/,Early breast growth.,"My mom was convinced by a pediatrician to put her 5 year old on risperidone. I took it for 20 years and was able to get off it after I left. As a result of that my prolactin was high and caused puberty to be very delayed. I had developed breast tissue that was noticeable by bullies in 8th grade. I started hrt 2 weeks ago. My breasts apparently were on an aquvilant of a coffee break cause they started growing again. Are there any girls out there that have had gone through something similar?
