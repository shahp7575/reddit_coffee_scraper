1gdjyw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1gdjyw0/pressure_from_siblings_to_see_my_dad/,Pressure from siblings to see my Dad.,"My current relationship with my Dad is: I call him once every few months, and occasionally send a text with some photos.

I would honestly like zero contact but I’m still working through the guilt. He lives 2 hours drive away.

I had a baby 5 months ago, and my 3 siblings have upped the pressure and guilt that I have to see him. I don’t want this, I worked really hard to get to a place of minimal contact, and still now the phone calls give me so much anxiety, I feel my whole nervous system in stress.

I also fear if I do a visit now I’ll have to see him again with my daughter. I just don’t know what to do? Each of my siblings brings up how ‘he’s changed’ and ‘he loves me’ and ‘he’s so sad and doesn’t understand why you don’t call and see him more’. They act like he’s a child that can’t possibly reflect on his actions and that I’m a terrible and unreasonable person.

What can I say to them to make them back off? I’m very forward and have strongly told them no and to drop it so many times, it’s not working!

And how can I work through this guilt? I feel just so yuk about this all.




Context;
I was terrified my entire childhood of my dad, he would scream, break things, trash our rooms, the house, hit me and my siblings. The screaming is an especially horrific memory for me. 

From a young kid till about my mid 20s (I’m now 35), I took on the role of caretaking him to placate him and try and keep him calm. 

I cooked, cleaned and looked after the farm animals: for more context he was also abusive to the animals so as a 6 year old I would be up at 5am in the freezing cold, down in the stables feeding the horses because I was scared he’d harm them if he got too stressed.

I would hear his car arrive in the driveway (long driveway like 1km), and as soon as I’d hear it I’d run around the house like mad cleaning and organising, and making a coffee ready for him. This often wasn’t enough and he’d still scream is there were some spoons in the sink for example.

Also, both of my sisters have gone through 10 year plus periods of not talking to my dad, so they must know what I’m talking about to some extent. ",1,1730059667.0,EstrangedAdultChild,1,1.0,False

1gdjvt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1gdjvt2/alea_jacta_est_luciapost/,Alea Jacta Est [Luciapost],"*Over the last week, all Lupo Clan heads suddenly gave up their Cornerstones... Except for three. Lucia Accardi, the mastermind behind all this; Petra Böhm, known as ""the Rock"" for her stubbornness; and Lappland Saluzzo, the traitorous last remnant of the Saluzzo Clan. Lucia already had nine of the fourteen Cornerstones in her hands, making her substantially more powerful than even the strong mages of the Celestial Union. But she still needed the last five too. The Böhms were the next step. While all the previous Clan heads were easy to ""convince"", Petra was different. Lucia knew things wouldn't go as smoothly with her as they did with everyone before.*

*So, she arranged a one-on-one meeting with Petra Böhm. Now standing in the office designed to look like the old town hall of Kabenz, the Northern and Southern Lupi meet once again. Petra maintains her usual dismissive demeanor.*

**Petra:** What do you want, Lucia?

**Lucia:** I want to discuss your Cornerstone with you.

**Petra:** The Topaz?

**Lucia:** Correct. You must have noticed that everyone's Cornerstones have been disappearing.

**Petra:** Yes, and I think you are responsible for that.

**Lucia:** You're a fast one, huh? Too bad, I'm already two steps ahead of you.

*Petra doesn't respond. After a brief pause, Lucia continues.*

**Lucia:** Well, the Laterans have gotten wind of my plans... And I have all the evidence they'd need to arrest you for it. So, either you will cooperate with me and hand over the Topaz, or...

*Petra turns around, looking out of her window into the Union's Artificial Ecosystem.*

**Petra:** The joke's on you, Lucia. I informed the military, and they are surrounding this very office as we speak.

*Lucia places her hand on her gun.*

**Petra:** Don't even try. If you threaten me, I'll call the soldiers in and they will make quick work of you.

**Lucia:** Don't lie to me, Petra. I know exactly that there are no soldiers outside.

*With Lucia having called her bluff, Petra turns around... and draws her own weapon. A bolt of light immediately barely misses Lucia who draws her own weapon and returns fire. Petra ducks behind her desk to avoid the gunshots.*

**Lucia:** COWARD!

*She jumps on top of the desk, unfinished paperwork flying everywhere. Petra rushes out and to the other side of the room, continuing to fire light at Lucia out of her staff. But Lucia already has too many Cornerstones, too much power to care about being hit by lasers. She throws a cup of hot coffee at Petra which burns her left arm and leaves her vulnerable. A quick gunshot to the leg causes her to fall.*

**Petra:** Why didn't you just... kill... me?

**Lucia:** As much as I hate you... A living Petra with the Böhm Clan under my control is more useful than a dead one with the Böhm Clan standing with my enemies. So, I will be taking that...

*She takes the staff out of Petra's hand. Its core is the Topaz Cornerstone, the Light.*

*Now, with all but four Cornerstones in her possession, Lucia turns her attention to the Garden of Recollection.*

\--

*Robin's nightmares have been getting worse every day. The worsening situations portrayed in the daily divinations from Black Swan aren't helping either. In the middle of the night, she sneaks into the Operator's office.*

*By the time morning rolls around and Exia enters her office again, the Minister of Culture and Family has created a web of red string and pictures. All of them point... to Lucia Accardi.*

**Robin:** ... Good morning, Operator.

**Exia:** Do you really have to solve crime so early in the day? I'm barely awake...

**Robin:** No time to lose.

*She points at three pictures. The Garden of Recollection, Acheron and Lappland.*

**Robin:** One of these is Lucia's next target. Acheron and Lappland can defend themselves just fine, but the Garden... has no military force or even security beyond the few Memokeepers capable of offensive magic.

**Exia:** So you're saying... We should guard the Garden of Recollection so nobody can steal the Amethyst?

**Robin:** Correct. Dedicate a few hundred soldiers to it and it'll be safe.

**Exia:** Wouldn't that just tell Lucia we know what she's planning? Then she'd be even more careful and almost impossible to catch. It's already hard to get hold of her.

**Robin:** Do you want her to become even more powerful? Must I remind you of the Amethyst's power?

**Exia:** *sigh* Fine. But you explain to the Memokeepers why we're sending the army into their archives.

I mention to the person at the register that I'm going back and forth between a coffee and a smoothie, so she makes me both, a caramel latte and a mango smoothie. After she gives me the drinks, I don't recall ever paying for the drinks, so I ask her how much it costs. And tells me it's taken care of.

I walk outside, and I'm in the parking lot of the church I grew up in (they've moved buildings since I've stopped going). There's a bouncy house, a food truck, and a few other things, so I walk around, sipping on the coffee, to see everything that was going on. There was a new daycare center in one of the buildings attached to the parking lot, somehow I knew they were the ones throwing this event. However I noticed that a handful of people from my old church were there, so I tried to avoid them.

After a few minutes, I begin walking away, but in the opposite direction of where my parents house is. It starts to rain, so I head towards the nearest building, the mall a couple miles away, I guess I walked that far in a short amount of time.

I walk in through the door closest to me, as well as several other people. I go through a few levels of a parking garage, even though the mall I went to doesn't have any in real life, before finally getting to the official shopping center. The entire thing is a maze, and I try to go and see as much of it as I can, even after it stops raining.

Most of what I see is cramped work stations. I go through a few of them, including one that was supposed to be my old workplace. It didn't look like my old workplace, though; instead, it reminded me a lot like a classroom in high school. I made my way through a couple work stations, talked to the people working there, pretending I knew what I was doing there, then left.

After a bit more exploring, which was just a lot of hallways and rooms filled with things, I realize that I don't have my backpack and drinks anymore. I freak out, and try to recall where I last saw them. I get approached by Judy Greer, who said she's been collecting things she's found, and might have my stuff.

No Helicobacter pylori identified.
II. Esophagitis with columnar metaplasia, non-dysplastic.

Second endoscopy done in 27 october:
I. Normal gastric mucosa with normal GE junction at 30 cm
II. No ulcers, no mass lesions, no strictures, no hiatal hernia
III. Normal mid and upper Esophagus
IIII. Multiple biopsies taken from the GE junction antrum body

Im still waiting for my biopsy which I assume will take weeks, but im in disbelief. I genuinely thought I would stay the same or possibly get worse due to the fact that I got globus. However, I am truly happy. The pain, anxiety, medication, diet and lifestyle change had worked to my benefit. The doctor told me that it was my lifestyle change that helped me heal, as I had smoked and drink coffee often during the summer which essentially caused my inflammation. I quite cold turkey, and I will continue to quit. 

I hope to hear back from my physician soon but my next step: stool test for h-pylori and fix my anxiety. Now that i've cleared out inflammation/GERD, I have to think about what I'll be doing in regards to my globus possibly being from stress. It goes away when I'm busy or with people (generally, when happy) but comes back when I fixate on it. It went away when I took a xanax the first time I got it, but came back after a stressful period and has stayed since. I think my endoscopy will relieve my stress, but I do this id like to take more steps and truly feel good.

We have been dating for about 10 months and have recently exited the honeymoon phase. I am fulfilled in the relationship excluding intimacy.

She has been saying no to intimacy a lot recently, and I want her to feel safe saying no, but a part of me begrudges having no control over our sex life.

For example, yesterday we had a great day. We went to grab food and coffee before heading to test drive cars for me. Then went to go pick up some birthday presents for kids she babysits. We had dinner with her parents and went back to my place after. I asked she said no, and I shook it off and put on our show to watch. After the show was over we went for a drive to pick up some beer, and had a really fun time yelling/singing throwbacks. Got back cracked a few and watched AFV compilations on YouTube. I tried to initiate again but it got awkward and I resigned to it not happening that night, and we laughed and had fun together the rest of the night. Around 3, when we were winding down for bed she tried to initiate. And it made me feel cheap. 

Our sex life has diminished from nearly every time I saw her 4-5 times a week, to 1 time a week to maybe 2 if I’m lucky. I want to reiterate that everything besides this is great, but I’ve been finding myself sexual frustrated a lot.

Stuff like this has been happening a lot recently. We have been talking about it, but I need someone outside and unbiased to give their opinion. I’m not seeking validation for my side, rather a way to find middle ground with her, or strategies to change my mental so it doesn’t affect me as much.

I barely did anything yesterday and I still fell asleep before 11pm while watching a loud movie with the lights on. Today, I slept in and again barely did anything and I got so tired mid afternoon that I basically had to choose between making myself coffee to stay awake or go take a nap. 

Does this ever end? I feel like I have a handle on a lot of my symptoms now, but this one is really starting to bother me.

I'm a 36-year-old dreamer with an engineer's mind but a poet's heart, searching for that inexplicable connection that makes the world stand still. With classic English charm and gentle manners, I've been blessed with the ability to see beauty in life's smallest moments – the way raindrops dance on window panes, how autumn leaves paint the Essex countryside in gold, and the quiet magic of a shared glance across a candlelit table.

By profession, I create and build, finding elegance in precision and possibility in challenges. But beyond the logical world of engineering lies my true nature: a romantic soul who believes in grand gestures, heartfelt letters, and the kind of love that inspires sonnets.

In quiet evenings, you might find me cycling through winding country lanes as the sun sets, imagining the hand I'd love to hold and the heart I'd cherish. I dream of sharing life's adventures, from cosy nights discovering new worlds through stories and games, to spontaneous weekend escapes where we can lose ourselves in conversation and discovery.

My heart yearns for:
- A kindred spirit who believes in the magic of love at first sight
- Someone who finds romance in both starlit walks and rainy day cuddles
- A partner who dreams of building a beautiful life filled with laughter and tender moments
- A soul who understands that true love is both passionate and gentle, fierce and tender

I promise to offer:
- A heart that beats in poetry and loves without reservation
- Arms that will hold you through life's storms and celebrate its joys
- A soul that will cherish every moment we create together
- A lifetime of morning coffees, gentle kisses, and handwritten love notes

If your heart flutters at the thought of old-fashioned romance with a modern gentleman, if you believe in the power of soulful connections, and if you dream of a love story worthy of being told for generations – perhaps fate has led you to this very moment.

Let's begin our chapter together, crafting a love story that would make Jane Austen proud. After all, the greatest adventures begin with a simple ""hello.""",3,1730058659.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

My issue is I get hungry and then I get ravenous. That’s when I make a bad choice or overeat. I used to be able to live very easily with the feeling of being hungry but now it’s pretty difficult for me.

But I'd love some input from people who typically don't eat out while traveling.

When planning this trip, our friends mentioned they'd be fine with ""going to a restaurant"" (in the native language it could be understood both ways). I took that to mean eating out once a day so we don't miss out on sight-seeing, but I misinterpreted - they actually meant one to two restaurant meals for the entire trip 😅

There aren't any dietary restrictions or financial concerns here (I know I don't get a say how other people spend their money, but they are not stingy in general). They just seem happy with carb-heavy food and supermarket meals. I'm no food snob, but I tend to prefer healthier choices and my cooking is mostly plain, but nutritionally dense. So since I cook at home and this a holiday, I really do not want to even prepare a sandwich in the morning. On top of that, to me, traveling is partly about discovering a city's culinary scene, whether that's a rundown local diner, a cool cafe or an upscale restaurant.

Our routine so far has been for my partner and me to grab a specialty coffee and breakfast, meet them for sightseeing, then head off for a lunch by ourselves and then we come back and after some time go take a walk and have a dinner, The other couple isn't upset or passive-aggressive about this, but I do feel a little bad going off without them.

So, for those who don't eat out much while traveling, how do you usually handle meals on trips? Do you want to stick with the routine from hom? And if you've traveled with friends who enjoy eating out, how did you balance things so that everyone could enjoy their preferred style of travel?",9,1730058595.0,travel,13,0.76,False

1gdjjxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1gdjjxl/to_madrid_and_back_an_insane_transcontinental/,To Madrid and Back: An Insane Transcontinental Journey,"As I sit in bed and pay back a debt incurred over the course of the last week, I'd like to share my story and maybe give someone a bit of inspiration in not stopping at reaching their transition goals, whatever it takes.

# The Context

I'm a late cracked egg: 36, Polish, and spent most of 2023 completing a complete psychosexual evaluation to get the green light for HRT. I picked up the complete diagnosis on April 20, 2024, due to COVID and health complications (three person panel), two months into my social transition, and by April 29 I started HRT. Over the holidays, I became aware that there are more options for surgical transition, including the perennial favorite, orchiectomy.

Now, the catch is that I live in Poland, which is a regressive wasteland that only got worse for trans people after 1989: Courts decided that legal transitioning must be as complicated as possible and in 1999 public health insurance stopped including gender affirmation surgeries, because we can't have nice things here. We don't exist in the Polish legal system - but what does exist is art. 156 of the Criminal Code, which states that anyone who causes grave injury to someone by eg. removing their ability to procreate face anywhere from three to 20 years in prison, with no exceptions.

You can get around it by having a magical paper from the court that states you're not actually a boy, but a girl. Here comes the second catch: The courts have invented a hack to enable legal transitions: You sue your parents! Y'see, the Civil Code allows for bringing any case before the court, including accident of birth. The procedure is humiliating, the courts may decide your evaluation is worthless and demand an ""expert"" opinion of its own (which you pay and the ""expert"" might be someone who last read about transgender people in the eighties), and it can last years.

Except I can't leverage it, because I'm married. I'd have to divorce, but a divorce can't happen unless you demonstrate that your marital life is deader than week-old roadkill on an Autobahn. In my case, I've been married for nearly 15 years to a wonderful, supportive non-binary gal who is my closest friend and most stalwart ally. We'd have to perjure ourselves, which can technically be prosecuted under art. 233 of the Criminal Code (six months to 8 years). And even if we did that, and I transitioned, my reward would be loss of custody, since the Family and Guardianship Code doesn't account for a child having two moms - we have a wonderful seven year old boy (who has switched to using my chosen name and pronouns a while back and accepted me for who I am - and so did his school, which is something I feared).

So I'm growing more feminine by the day, thanks to cyproterone and estro gel, stuck with an M gender marker in my government-mandated ID.

# The Trick

I could lay down and cry, but I never much believed in giving up, no matter how hard I'm knocked down. Being a draft mare helps (nearly 190 cm and over 100 kg of mass). At the four month mark - August - I decided to do something to get rid of my androgens permanently: For comfort, for gender euphoria, for safety from forced detransitioning, for protection against the increased risk of meningiomas due to long-term cypro use, because I lost a grandmother to stroke... You get the idea. Since no doctor or hospital in Poland would operate, and believe me, I asked, I started looking abroad.

By a stroke of luck, I came into the fold of a wonderful queer community around August, invited by a British trans girl living in Switzerland, who recommended her surgeon, a Swiss-Italian working, among other places, in Spain. The initial video consult was... An experience, as I'm not used to actually being treated like a human being by medical staff (living in the ruins of the Eastern Bloc AND being a medical kid in the 90s does your brain bad). But the takeaway was that my gender marker is no objection for orchiectomy, as Spain has saner laws - what matters is having a diagnosis, having started HRT, providing informed consent, and being able to cover the cost.

We both scrambled. Translating my diagnosis, getting a confirmation of HRT from my endo (a terrific woman extremely supportive of LGBT people), pre-flight checks (blood panel, coagulation, and electrocardiogram; had to annotate parts of the blood panel, since the lab I use - also very trans friendly - has software that only spits out Polish names for the various tests). Financing turned out to be the trickiest, as we planned to leverage my wife's corporate insurance, but delays in getting the guarantee of payment letter meant we decided to take out a loan and get reimbursed (100% coverage, but the paths are arduous).

I was at Eurofurence 28 when I got the message from the clinic offering me an October or November appointment. Since my son's birthday is in November, exactly when the operation would take place, there was only one option: October 23. Fallout fans like myself will recognize the irony - and my British friend couldn't believe I snatched an appointment a week before her (for a different surgery).

# The Journey

I had under four weeks to line up everything. Flights from Poznań to Madrid and back, both via Warsaw, because my city's airport is a backwater; accommodations that can be used for regenerating after the op; finally, friends on the ground in Madrid who could help me get around and make the experience survivable. Apart from that, I dealt with extreme emotional stress due to taking my first surgical step in transitioning - and also one that would forever leave my previous life behind. There'd be no going back - and as it turned out, that wasn't the scariest part.

I laid out an ambitious plan, knowing in the back of my head that it was crazy. Spread it out over four days to conserve money and energy, arriving on the 22nd, getting cut on the 23rd, and returning home on the 25th. Everyone I talked to said that it was crazy. Intense. That I am going to hurt myself pushing myself that hard and flying after surgery - and even with the doctor's office stating that I should be alright, I knew I was biting off a lot. Perhaps more than I have every bitten off in my life.

I filed for PTO and ensured I have no outstanding work. I had everything lined up. I cried almost daily as I was in the sixth month of HRT and my emotions, mindset, and brain were intensively rewired, as I discovered our common history, including the first trans women to undergo vaginoplasty around 1931 - Dora Richter, Toni Ebel, and Charlotte Charlaque - who survived the Nazis, the War, and lived full lives, passing away not as men, but as women accepted in their communities.

I was also scared, not of the surgery, because I spent weeks reviewing the procedures, medical publications, and watching surgical recordings to ensure I was fully informed and could give my consent. I was scared of missing the flight and missing the surgery, because I wasn't sure I could claw my way back to it and set up everything again. On the evening of the 21st or six days ago I had a near-panic attack, settled only by my trans sister, a wonderful woman who told me in no uncertain terms to listen to her and go to sleep. These few hours of rest saved me.

**October 22nd**: I left home at four, hugging and kissing my wife and my son, then grabbed an Uber. I was misgendered by the driver initially, who expected a Mike, not a Minerva, but that was easily resolved - I might be a draft mare, but my body took to estrogen like a hungry cat to a bowl of food (no points for guessing who we share our flat with). On the way to the airport, I was smiling like a madwoman, because I was on my way. I would be in Madrid come hell or high water. I packed light, with pre-packaged clothes for each day of the stay to minimize worry (I highly encourage doing that, freezer string bags are wonderful and can be compressed to take a minimal amount of space), wearing one of my favorite dresses and earrings, with online check-in complete.

I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare and went through security. One of the employees checking my bags found my Oestrogel - I took the last dose of cypro in the morning - together with my prescription, connected the dots, and smiled at me. Then she complimented my dress, and I felt all was going to be OK. Waiting for the plane I wondered if anyone was going to give me grief for my appearance not matching the documents pretty much at all, but nobody did. I made the flight to Warsaw, correctly gendered by the cabin crew, and then boarded the flight to Madrid, feeling the immensity of the moment.

The plane landed, I cleaned myself up in the final hour, and it was on to the clinic. We set up the pre-op consult for about an hour and a half after landing and I decided to take the Madrid metro to reach the clinic. Either I got extraordinarily lucky or I have a homing pigeon stuck in my head, as I managed to home in on the place with time to spare, enough to have an espresso and sign the GDPR forms well before the surgeon's arrival.

The chat was quick, we went over the procedure again, a simple orchiectomy, my future plans for vaginoplasty, and I mentioned one thing: As a child, I felt humiliated and butchered by surgeons due to phimosis surgery and horrific waking up, in the night on a dark, overcrowded children's ward, completely alone and in pain. He promised to do his best not to repeat that. I was at ease - signing consent forms, getting post-op instructions, the works - and I noted that I genuinely feel comfortable with him and his staff, being my usual, casual joking self despite spending six hours on travel already.

My wonderful friend, a cis woman who is also a staunch trans ally and promised to help me in Madrid, met me outside, and as we walked and chatted, she also showed me a part of Madrid - I hope to visit the city again as a tourist, not a patient again - and we agreed to meet the following the day. Then my other friend, a young, amazing Spaniard linked up with me and we went together for a meal, which I jokingly named the Last Supper for a part of me.

The night, however... The night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd were the hardest thing I had to endure yet. The magnitude of what I was doing started to dawn on me - I talked with my sister on the phone for an hour, crying as I poured my heart out on the eve of my first surgery. I couldn't sleep then, so I spent another hour ripping off my gel fingernails. I completely forgot to get them off after Eurofurence, and since my surgeon's chief nurse pointed out they might mess with the pulse oximeter, I cut the tips off, and used my hairclip to peel them off, one by one, from the thumb to the little finger. Nails regenerate - and I wouldn't let such a silly oversight get in the way.

**October 23rd**: Imagine waking up at 4 AM, in a dark hostel room, completely on your own 2500 kilometers from home, about to go into surgery, and the kid butchered by surgeons almost thirty years ago starts screaming in abject terror. That was the fear I had to face completely alone with nobody to help me. My sister lives in the UK, my wife in Poland, both were asleep and unreachable. So I did my best to calm that little kid inside me down, promising her that all will be all right. That this time nobody would hurt her. At five AM I finally got up, talked to one of the girls from the community, and got into a shower, letting the warm water wash away some of the pain. I spent the next hour in bed, checking messages and ensuring I had my surgery tote bag (a wonderful one I picked up at EF) prepared, my documents, and everything. At 7 AM I put on my surgery day dress - a red one with white flowers, either lilies or orchids - grabbed my things and walked out the door into my future.

We meet with my friend downstairs, and called an Uber. Since nothing is simple in my life, at 7:15 AM it turned out he's in a traffic jam and won't make it. I smashed my fist into a traffic sign in frustration, one of the only times I did it in the past months, but we were saved by a completely random taxi going down the street. From there, it was a twenty minute ride to the hospital, with me already shaken by the prospect of running late and delaying the surgery, crying in the back of the taxi. By the time we got to Vithas Hospital I was almost shaking - but we were ahead of time by a full five minutes. I was asked to arrive at 7:45 AM and we entered at 7:40, with my friend leading the charge and getting the ticket for the admissions office. I sat in the lobby with a mixture of emotions running through me, feeling Mr Lyons - the first furry gift I got from my wife 15 years ago, a silly little plush lion whom I grew to love and accept, who is a token of her presence whenever we're apart - and trying not to succumb to fears that something might go wrong.

My number came up, A007, and I was asked with my friend to sit down by a delightful administrator. At this point I was a wreck, fearing that something might go wrong at the last second - I still feel my wrecked fingernails digging into my hand as they looked for a missing document and resolved a system error, which ultimately forced me to be admitted under my deadname from the government ID.

But that's where the unexpected started. I'm from Eastern Europe, where despair is a constant companion - and I saw the administrator pen in my name, Minerva, onto the patient folder. Each stroke pushed me closer to tears until I just started breaking apart. When I got my hospital wrist band, she also asked me to hold it out once more and added my name on it, with a smile. This was an act of selfless kindness - she didn't have to do it, nobody would have thought ill of her, me least of all - but she still did it. Then we were taken up the elevator to the ward, with the other administrator smiling at me, with a clear statement that I could chill now.

I didn't chill until I was in my room, until the nurses took my pulse, blood pressure, and O2 stats, and asked me to change into the hospital gown. The funny part was that they said the surgical team would come and take me down to the block in a while, so I would be free to wait around. She popped in twenty seconds later with a smile, saying that they're here.

So I changed. As I left my clothes and put on the hospital gown, taking one last pic before the surgery, I realized that all of that pain and anxiety drained away somewhere. I was here. I was getting my orchiectomy, getting rid of the last link to the role imposed on me at birth, becoming free to live the rest of my life as a woman.

I remember that sense of peace as I pressed the call button and the nurses - this time both sweet guys, one younger, one older, came in. The funny moment came when I asked for something to cover myself up with, and they stated with the kind of smile you give someone who asked a very silly question, that I can just ride under the sheets.

So I did.

For a moment in my trans life, I was free to just lay back and let myself be taken to surgery, watching the hospital corridors pass me by, basking in a moment of peace. I think I earned points for being a good patient - and when one of the nurses took a hairnet to keep my mane in check, I just put it into a bun. I was parked just outside the surgery room and waited for a moment. Both the surgeon and the chief nurse came by to ensure that I was alright, smiling and promising that this time will be better.

*Around 8:30 AM*: When I walked into the surgical theater, accompanied by two more nurses (and a bit self-conscious due to the open back of my gown), I was struck by clarity and certainty. I have realized a few days earlier just how deep my dysphoria goes, how it has warped and twisted my relationship with my body, and I had zero doubts or reservations about the surgery. I got under the heated cover, observing everything around me as the team made last minute preparations; I explained that it wasn't anxiety, but curiosity, as I wanted to know as much as possible about the procedure.

I watched the anesthesiologist dig out a vein in my hand, as the skin became softer, more delicate, and everything buried itself deeper - and I didn't mind the pain as the cannula was inserted and they had to root around a bit to get it to fit. I was strapped in, and the anesthesiologist gave me the first drug, putting me in that woozy state. I started humming Space Oddity, but I barely got to the second line when the breathing mask came down and I fell into darkness.

*Around 10:30 AM*: I woke up in the recovery ward, with an IV of electrolytes going straight into my body, quickly regaining consciousness. I was on painkillers, a bit woozy, but clarity of thinking returned quick and I realized where I am. I felt under the covers, finding a ton of wadding to keep the swelling down and support the now-empty part of me.

I started laughing. Not aloud, it was more like a giggle, interspersed with crying. I was done. I won. I have been through surgery, I dumped the vestiges of manhood I never asked for with the help of a wonderfully gentle surgeon and his team, and now I was here, in a hospital bed, coming back and feeling so much alive. Of course I craned my neck everywhere, trying to decipher the IV contents, looking at my monitor and noting the calm, relaxed state my body was finally in, no longer at war with itself. When I was rolled into my hospital room, I spared no time updating my loved ones and friends on the situation. I was done, everything went off without a hitch, and I was recovering, experiencing a kind of calm and focus I've never felt before. I never bothered telling my blood family, who rejected me, preferring to pretend I don't exist - with the exception of my father, who is the only one at least trying to be someone more than a stranger to me.

I was calm. My friend was there too, helping me get ready to leave after the first meal in twelve hours (due to fasting requirements for anaesthesia), a bland diet that felt like fine dining. A quick checkup by the surgeon and by 2 PM I was on my way home, still weak from anesthesia and the surgery.

But I was finally past the hump. I was safe. I could live my life free of the burdens of the past.

My first experience, as I came to the hostel at 3 PM, was one of immense freedom to suffer: I didn't register that the building didn't have an elevator, so six hours after surgery I was making a climb up three floors to get to my room. Woozy, sweating, and waddling like a drunken duck, I still made it to my room. And I crashed.

Hard.

**October 24**: That night, after a week of nights when I barely clocked three or four hours to sleep, I slept for twelve hours straight, waking up at ten the next day (with a minor wake-up in the middle of the night at 4 AM, this time laughing and crying of joy).

The next day was full of hard rest, with snacks, my Spaniard bringing me a proper meal, and suffering the side effects of post-surgery industrial strength antibiotics. I wrote a letter to my British friend, who's having her surgery this Wednesday, I watched Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance, listened to music, and just rested. I deserved it. My friend popped in for coffee and a chat, to ensure I was alive, and was relieved - I just didn't get her messages as I was fast asleep.

It was good. I went to sleep thinking I'd get another good day's sleep.

**October 25**: I was wrong. The day of my return flight was about to get interesting. You see, anesthesia screws with your circadian rhythm and may leave your brain stuck on wake mode. Mine got stuck on it at 2 AM, refusing to go to sleep, so I had to work around it. I wrote another letter, caught up on gossip and chats, listened to music, milled around, before slowly preparing to leave. I was in a better shape, but still not quite up to travel at that point.

Which meant I packed my things tightly into the tote bag and my day pack, hand-washed myself, still wearing the sexy surgical lingerie from the 23rd, careful not to soil anything (as it turned out, when your son fractures his leg during ice skating, you learn how to hand-wash and dispose of waste without wrecking everything), then checked everything, checked in for my flight, and put on the final pre-packaged set: My lucky dress, muted blues with red poppies, a pink keffiyeh, and a pair of socks with a scrambled egg and bacon print (you see, in Polish, eggs mean the same thing as balls in English). I mounted up, put on my headphones, let some heroic music play and started making my way to the clinic for my pre-return checkup.

With public transit.

I don't claim to be particularly wise. I knew I made a grave error going down the Puerta del Sol station, walking down the stairs with shaking legs and sweat trickling down my back, wondering when I'm going to faint. I made it down to the subway, praying I don't keel over, and made the connecting ride.

More stairs. With stumps inside barely mollified by my painkillers and a belly feeling like someone hit it with a baseball bat. Just stairs. After stairs. After stairs, until I got to the Núñez de Balboa station and emerged about half a kilometer from the clinic. With my sister on Telegram gently encouraging me and helping me get through it, I managed to start the walk. She is an absolutely wonderful, hardcore trans woman and an inspiration. With her help and my wife on voice I stumbled up the street, one leg in front of the other, sometimes leaning on the wall for support.

I wanted to fold and cry and sit down. I made a mistake and overestimated my endurance, forgot to account for anesthesia and its long term effects. I wasn't in pain, but in severe discomfort, exhausted, insomniac, and utterly crushed. But I was also 2500 km from home, I didn't know Spanish, and I had a flight in three hours.

I moved. Every step brought me closer. I arrived with half an hour to spare, at 9:30 AM, and just sat outside the building, cooling off and resting. I was running on reserves, but I wasn't about to miss the check-in. It went wonderfully, and I even got a chance to sit down and chat with the surgeon over a cup of espresso, thanking him. Not just for the surgery, but for allowing me to face my demons and slay them. The traumas of the past just washed away into the past, thanks to the kindness the hospital staff, and in particular he and his team showed me. Despite what I just did, I got a clean bill of health, a new dressing for the stitches, and this time I called an Uber to get to the airport. It arrived with plenty of time to spare, and I slowly walked to the terminal, going through security as usual (this time, I had to take off my sneakers, for some reason), and finally sitting down with overpriced airport fare for breakfast.

The flight was delayed, but I didn't mind. I was done. I had my discharge papers, an invoice to request reimbursement, and most importantly, no burden or remnants of a past life between my legs. I was free.

I wasn't even bothered by the waiting. Half an hour for the plane from Madrid to Warsaw that departed ultimately at 2 PM, and then the connecting flight from Warsaw to Poznań, which was delayed by almost an hour - and required me to walk from one end of the terminal at Okęcie to another, some 35 boarding gates. By the end I was absolutely exhausted. I don't think I had any energy reserves left and ran on pure willpower to get home to my wife and son. I landed in Poznań at half past 10 PM, put on my best face, and helped an older lady who was traveling from Madrid to her daughter in Poznań with her luggage.

I am very open about being a transgender woman and she had this kind of weird, scowling expression as she processed it - but then smiled at me and just automatically used my pronouns. I helped with her bags, we chatted on the way out of the arrivals area, realizing we could have struck up a conversation all the way back in Madrid, then I got to meet her daughter and granddaughters, which, I feel, couldn't make heads or tails of me - at least, I think, until I bid them a good night and turned around to leave, with a huge transgender flag patch on my day pack.

I got home via Uber a little after 11 PM. He dropped me off by our hab block, and as I walked through the parking lot, I realized that I won. I was done. I was utterly exhausted and my body started shutting down. By the time I got home, I was leaning on the wall on support because I couldn't stay upright. Everything protested the treatment it received over the past four days. I couldn't believe what I did. And yet I did it.

I hugged my son the moment I got back. Then my wife basically dragged me into the bed to sleep. I fell asleep within minutes, with a smile. I won.

I was free.

1gdjjuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gdjjuv/adhd_rant/,ADHD rant ,"Well the title is a bit misleading since i was never diagnosed. However I've been struggling a lot since last year and most (if not all) of the symptoms have been present since childhood. I mean how else can I explain:

•The EXTREME hyperactivity and constant need to pace and run in the house (I'm literally pacing while I write this). Even in coffee shops I constantly leave my seat and start pacing.

•The constant mood swings. Either I'm riding euphoric waves or I want to jump in front of a car. I've been passively suicidal since the age of 13, I'm 18 now. I also have very violent intrusive thoughts I'd rather not get into.


•The constant impulsivity. I've made a lot of mistakes socially because I just can't wait and think before blurting out something offensive.
I also interrupt conversations and talk loud without meaning to.

•The forgetfulness. Well if I don't do something right now, chances are I'll forget about it for God knows how long. I forget to bring important things with me when I leave the house very often. Sometimes when I get assigned something, I do the first half and forget about the rest.

•The goddamn racing mind

•The constant difficulty when it comes to getting things done. Ik that getting out of my comfort zone is hard, but I literally find something like asking someone or for help or texting a (close) friend a monumental task. I also peed on myself a lot as a kid because I couldn't be bothered to ask, I ate half the dish (usually if it's not fastfood, even if I was neutral towards it I just couldn't)

•Repetitiveness bores me to death

•The constant procrastination that comes with my hyperactivity and racing mind. 

•I daydream and talk to myself all the time. I never stop

•The shitty attention span and inability to focus. I keep missing very obvious details and it drives me insane

•The irritability over small things.

•The constant zoning out and sidetracking. I waste so much time in the gym because I daydream between the sets, I get distracted halfway through a task.

•The clumsiness (though it was much worse when I was little)

•My speech is a jumbled mess and I keep making mistakes

•The extreme messiness and atrocious handwriting

•The need to hyper focus/fixate on something for months, it can be super specific like a historical event or a random criminal. I also hyperfocused in class, I didn't even hear my friends calling me.

•The fact that I literally tried so many times to fix these flaws but I just couldn't, I got distracted, forgot... You name it

The thing that used to confuse me is that I was very good at school. However, when I was younger I couldn't focus in class at all, though I studied at home just fine. As I grew older I started to focus in class, but I couldn't focus at home, and my grades suffered. Then there were like 2 years where everything was just fine academic wise, but during the senior year in high school I went back to struggling with studying again. I'm studying a language full time now and I'm still struggling immensely. It's also important to note that I'm extremely interested in academics, especially mathematics. This explains how I had moment of (hyper)focus.

I can't get a diagnosis right now, but thankfully I'm ""soon"" moving to a country with free mental healthcare . I still have something like a year to endure all this bs... However I'm strong and I'm confident I can do it.

I made this post because I didn't have very many people I was comfortable in venting to. My mom has a lot going on, I'm not close with my brothers (one of them was/is abusive), and I'm kinda scared I'll be seen as different if I tell my friends or the rest of my family.

1gdjik6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gdjik6/am_i_the_asshole_for_waiting_on_an_opportunity_to/,Am I the asshole for waiting on an opportunity to drop my close friend?,"I (15F) and three of my friends (all 15F) don't like another friend (again, 15F) who is in our group and hangs out with us frequently.

This girl—I'll call her Emma—and some of the people in our friend group go way back. We've known each other since elementary school, but my memories of her aren't very pleasant.

Emma was always friends with my friends. Later that turned into a friend group. My relationship with her was never horrible and never amazing. There were times when I couldn't stand her and times when I wanted to hang out with her. I can't remember her doing anything particularly bad and most of the stuff she did that annoyed me, wouldn't be annoying if someone else were to do it. 

But lately, every one of my friends agrees that she is becoming very annoying. We just went to high school, and are now seeing each other less. So I understand that she gets excited to talk about what happened to her during the week. But it has come to a point, where I know EVERY single detail of her day-to-day life and barely anything about any of my other friends. It's not that they don't want to talk about their experiences, it's that they can't because they either get interrupted or don't even get the chance to start talking.

Last week's Friday, my friend (let's call her Nancy) got home late from school. We all agreed - due to Nancy coming home late, and also wanting to stay out longer - to meet at 7:30/8. Emma persuaded one of my friends (Lydia), who didn't really know when or where we were meeting, to get there at 6. We all had to hurry, cause Emma ''didn't want to go out later, and wanted to learn when the hangout was over''. She was a bit pissy cause we got there a bit later, and texted us that she was gonna ''leave if we didn't get there now.'' At this point, I was in a horrible mood and cried (because I felt bad for Nancy to have to inhale her food in 10 minutes only to hang out with Emma, who she doesn't even like.) When I got there, Emma proceeded to yap about something about her coffee that happened, and I barely got the chance to speak. She asked us, if we really had to order anything, or if we could just leave (because she was embarrassed). We still ordered, and we stayed there until later.

Veronika (another friend) didn't have the time to come that day. She has been talking with a friend from somewhere else every day for half a year and started to pick up a bit of their accent. When that topic came up, Emma started talking about how Veronika was ''faking the accent'', when she (Emma) talked in the accent of the people she hung out with in the school after being there for 21 days. She has talked about EVERY one of us badly to someone before, but we thought that wouldn't happen again because she had been acting a bit nicer before all this. Maybe it's because we aren't with her 24/7.

Then, my friend (Lydia) started OBVIOUSLY joking, that her school was better, because they didn't have that many tests and exams, and how she had more free days, and Emma turned to her, and with a blank face (I think she was joking, but still it's a rude thing to say) said: ''at least we have friends at our new schools.'' Lydia opened up about not knowing how to make new friends a week before that, and even then, Emma kinda ignored it and talked about how much fun she was having at her school. We stayed at the Cafe until about 9/9:30 pm, so we had to hurry for no reason because there was just no way she learned anything after the hangout.

I don't know why this affected me to the point where I don't want her in our friend group anymore. I have no clue, how to stop hanging out with her because I don't want her to be left without any explanation or closure. Nobody in our friend group likes her, as she constantly only talks about herself, and shuts down other people's attempts to talk. 

Emma has done some minor stuff in the past, that annoyed all of us, but because of her inability to communicate something without getting angry at the person who is explaining their feelings to her, we never mentioned anything. And if somehow we got into a bit of a ''fight'' when talking about it, she would stare at the person she fought with with an angry and unsettling expression. Then after the person finished their point, she would not say anything. She would either be mad or pretend to be okay and hold a grudge without ever talking about it to the person's face. 

I admit, that we were sometimes rude to her in the past (like not inviting her to go with us on a trip or talking about her behind her back), but we just wanted peace. Every time she does something that isn't that big of a deal, all of the stuff she did prior (that we don't even necessarily remember) comes back, and the hatred grows stronger.

So should we drop our friend? If so, how do we do that, while giving her closure and an explanation (he problem here is, that all of us are scared to talk to her haha)? I think, that what we did wasn't ideal, but I see where we are coming from. Are we the assholes?",3,1730058469.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

We are both nurses and work together in the same unit, and also have been very close outside work. We hiked a long distance trail together, ski trips, camping...I'm close with his partner, he helped me through my divorce with my ex husband and rebuilding my new life. I'm going to his wedding in Cuba next week. My 6 y.o son considers him an uncle.

I've gotten wind that hes leaving our unit at work and going to another unit in the same hospital. He hasn't told me this, he just said he had some news to share but wanted to wait until after the wedding/trip (probably because he knows it'll be hard news for me). As a friend, I want to be supportive because I know he has been unhappy in our unit for a long time. I'm so distraught over this and feeling so much sadness/grief about it, to an extreme degree because of how attached I am to him. For more context, for 5 years we have worked 4 12h shifts in a row together, same days off, taken all our breaks/luncues/coffee runs together, worked through some hard things together. I can't imagine working without him.

I know this is normal, and it's life. People move on and change and that's just life. I guess my worry is that we won't be friends anymore when he leaves. That we will drift apart and things won't be the same. Although we have been very close in each other's personal lives for years, have a great connection, and none of my other friends work with me and I still love them the same. I'm having some serious attachment/abandonment issues here and yes I am in therapy working on this as well. 

I guess I'm looking for reassurance....will the connection survive? Will I be OK? Has anyone been through this and gotten through it? I posted this in another sub and got ripped apart, but I've always felt this sub to be a safe place to share.

Many of my conversations are based on measurements and numbers.  I'm an ESTP on the Myers Briggs test.  I exercise a lot, and would consider myself ""in shape"".

My life recently has been very ""up in the air"" -- my wife and I are having a difficult time conceiving, I'm caring for a parent with dementia.  I am also looking for a new job, and it is not going well, mostly due to procrastination and ahedonia.  I have Testosterone in the 400s and may have a varicocele, which can cause low T and therefore affect mood and cognition.  Still, I feel pretty good about myself and my life, even without noots.

I've tried different noots over the years, but recently I was looking for something to bring me out of my ""funk"".

Experience:

•	⁠Bacopa (Standard dosage, taken for 6 mo.):  After one month of use at the usual dosage, my memory definitely improved.  No acute effect, but I was able to recall sequences of numbers more easily, with a greater degree of accuracy and certainty.  Unfortunately I had to stop taking because it lowers sperm count, and I am trying to have a kid.
•	⁠Methylfolate (Standard dosage, taken for 3 days): Started a few days ago, no perceptible effect so far.  Will update in a few weeks.
•	⁠Ashwagandha (1000mg 3/5 KSM-66 blend taken for 2 mo.):  The closest thing I can compare this to is that it makes me feel like the main guy in Office Space.  I no longer have a problem saying ""no"" to things I don't want to do.  Seems to help with my lifting as well, over time.
•	⁠L-Theanine + Caffeine (100mg caffeine, 200 mg L-T): Bought the combined pill and keep them on my nightstand. I take it the second my alarm goes off.  Within 5 minutes I'm out of bed, easy breezy lemon squeeze.  Super smooth, no jitters.  Wears off around noon and I have a coffee.  The coffee without the l-theanine is noticeably less focused energy.
•	⁠Magnesium (500mg chelate before bed, taken for 4 days):  I've been so stiff for months, and could not figure out what was wrong... it was ANNOYING.  Stretching, rollers, etc, nothing worked.  It couldn't be magnesium, I said, that shit is in my mutlivitamin!  WRONG.  On a whim I got the magnesium chelate and took 500mg before bed, and I am a new man.  I have no idea if it has had any effect on my brain, but sleeping better and waking up without a sore back does wonders for your work, I can tell you that!
•	⁠Noopept (experimented with 2, 4, 6 squirts taken nasally, over the past 3 days, in the morning):  Music sounds a little better, I guess?  No real difference IMHO, at least in the acute sense.  I'll keep going with it and report back.  Edit: I did feel some irritability/sarcasm, as some of you have noted, but I figured people around me were just being annoying haha.
•	⁠Semax (4 squirts, nasally, yesterday afternoon): This shit is the shit!!  This is what I wish weed and alcohol felt like!  I was chill, listened to music, got work done, didn't want to procrastinate, planned a trip, flirted with my wife as she cooked dinner... it just felt like my day was ""ON"".  My ahedonia was gone.   I hope this shit isn't dangerous because it is awesome.  Subtle, but palpable.

Hopefully this is interesting to you, or can possibly help you in some way.  Let me know if I should try out anything else, I'm open to experimentation.  I have Zinc on order right now, and I'm also planning to try microdosing soon.",1,1730058009.0,Biohackers,2,1.0,False

So I wasn’t some punk high school kid, I was a working professional with a six figure income in a major city, with an expensive sports car to drive around in. Just something about being a young rich dick was thrilling. Oh and this was in the 90s, way before security cameras were ubiquitous, so the chances of getting caught were close to nil if you were smart, which I was.

None of my friends knew about this hobby, but a couple girlfriends did and sometimes participated. We mostly targeted cars, but occasionally some poor pedestrian out for a late night stroll. Summer time had us on the prowl for cars with a window left open. 

My pièce de résistance happened during a winter cold spell, that night a huge showstorm was to come through starting 4am and dump nearly a foot of snow. I had stocked up on eggs at the grocery story on the way home from work. I set an alarm for 3am, got out and drove around targeting the driver’s side front windshields, including some cars on my own street. The next morning I got to enjoy a hot cup of coffee watching out my window as my poor neighbors were shoveling their cars out and discovered egg frozen on their windows. ",1,1730057754.0,confessions,1,0.67,False

Last week, I made a post looking for guidance on whether Unitarian Universalism would be a good fit for me and how to attend a service. Many of you responded with kind words of encouragement, and today, I finally attended.

When I say my experience was incredible, I truly mean it. I arrived at the parking lot about 10 minutes before the service, which was scheduled to begin at 11 AM. Guest parking was clearly marked and easy to find—especially since my anxiety had me checking it out on Google Earth beforehand! The lot was packed, which was definitely not what I had expected. The campus itself is shaped like a large “U,” with a massive courtyard in the middle.

As I followed others into the courtyard, two older women approached me right away, asked if I was new, and kindly showed me to the welcome table outside the sanctuary. There, I met one of the greeters, who was incredibly welcoming. He explained how the service would go, offered me a name badge, and handed me the order of service. After that, he led me into the sanctuary and told me I could sit wherever I felt comfortable.

The sanctuary was beautiful—filled with natural light and high wood ceilings that felt inspirational. And the smell… it was like honeysuckle or fresh flowers. Just amazing. Today’s service focused on remembering our loved ones who have passed, which tied into Día de los Muertos. The music was moving, the readings from the reverend were thoughtful, and I even appreciated the part when all the new guests were asked to stand so the congregation could welcome us. Several of us stood, and the applause we received was so heartwarming. It was a wonderful feeling.

There was also a moment during the service where everyone greeted their neighbors, which I enjoyed. Several people came over to introduce themselves to me, making me feel even more at ease. After the service, they had food and coffee available for everyone. A woman came up to me and asked if I’d be interested in a UU 101 course, just to learn more about the religion and what it means. She wasn’t pushy at all, just kind and informative, so I agreed.

The course itself was great—there were a few other people joining too. The two women leading the course were knowledgeable and passionate, but never in a way that felt intimidating. Afterward, they gave us a tour of the campus, showing us a library filled with books by philosophers, social justice authors, and writings on the UU faith. They encouraged us to explore the campus freely and made it clear that we were welcome back anytime.

What struck me most was that, throughout the entire experience, no one was trying to impose their beliefs on me. It was clear that everyone holds their own beliefs, and the focus of the UU faith is to support individuals in finding what they believe in. I will definitely be back next week!

*to add** yes, they had coffee. 🤣 
It was offered both before and after the service. 
The courtyard had a covered patio and if I had to guess, I would say around 40 people were gathered, drinking coffee and eating pastries, while chatting with others. ",15,1730057726.0,UnitarianUniversalist,4,1.0,False

(TL;DR, I'm an endurance runner with a new T2 diagnosis and need guidance on how others navigate carbs!)

I'm an active runner in my early 30s, and was very surprised to receive a call from my GP last week saying that I have T2D (Fasting BG of 149 after strong black coffee; 6.6 A1C). I'm a bit overweight (28 BMI) but run 30-40 miles a week and eat relatively healthfully. I also had a recent stint in the hospital with sepsis, and I know illness can raise BG, but for now, I bought a CGM and will act as if the diagnosis is fully legit — am trying to keep carbs as low as possible, max fiber / protein / veg, etc., exercise as much as I can and do more weight training.

I have been on 500mg Metformin 2x daily for about a week, and so far, it has not effected my running. But I am worried that when I start another marathon training cycle, I won't be able to take in adequate carbs to fuel my runs and carb load the week before the race without spiking my glucose (right now, according to my Stelo, it spikes significantly with even just 20g of carbs in a high protein and fiber meal, even after a long run).

1gdj0on,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1gdj0on/a_humorous_explanation_of_the_buddhist_meaning_of/,A humorous explanation of the Buddhist meaning of emptiness.,"I was pondering the concept of emptiness or nothingness. I started to think, where did I or we or everything come from? My Christian friend said God. My Jewish friend said the same etc... Then I thought where did God come from? He must have come from something etc... and I was getting nowhere. Then I thought or came to the conclusion ""What if everything came from nothing?""  Please enjoy the following.

Ah, the enigmatic concept of emptiness that can make even the most seasoned philosophers scratch their heads in confusion. Emptiness is often translated as  ""voidness"", or ""nothingness"", and is a fundamental idea that describes how things exist. It’s like trying to explain why you walked into a room and forgot what you were looking for—except this time, it’s the entire universe!

**Philosophically**: Let’s start with the philosophical angle. Imagine you’re at a coffee shop discussing existence with a group of philosophers. One says, “I think therefore I am,” while another insists, “But what does it mean to be?” Then you throw in, “I’m not even sure if I am, or if I’m just a figment of my cat’s imagination!” Suddenly, they’re all contemplating whether cats are the true rulers of reality. In the realm of emptiness, everything is devoid of inherent existence. So, if you’re trying to figure out if you’re having an existential crisis or just need a snack, the answer might be both—and neither!

**Psychologically**: From a psychological perspective, consider how we cling to our identities. “I am a teacher, a parent, a lover of bad puns.” But what happens when you strip those labels away? You might find yourself staring blankly into the void, wondering, “Who am I without my trusty title?” It’s a bit like a midlife crisis, but instead of a sports car, you’re driving straight into the heart of emptiness or nothing. Embracing nothingness can be liberating! You’re free from the pressure of being “something.” So, next time you feel lost, just remember: even the universe is lost sometimes!

**Religiously**: Now, let’s sprinkle in some religious flavor. In emptiness it is not just about being empty; it’s about understanding the interdependence of all things. Think of it as the ultimate spiritual group project—everyone is connected, and every contribution matters, even if it’s just you bringing the snacks. And who doesn’t love snacks? But seriously, this interconnectedness highlights that we’re all part of a grand cosmic tapestry, woven together by the threads of our experiences. It’s a bit like family gatherings, where you realize everyone’s a little quirky, but hey, that’s what makes it fun!

**Humorously**: Finally, let’s not forget the humor in all of this. Emptiness can sound daunting but think of it as a cosmic blank canvas. You’re not just empty; you’re *potentially* anything! It’s like waking up on a Saturday morning with no plans—sure, you could do nothing, or you could attempt to create the world’s first pancake-flavored smoothie. Embracing emptiness means acknowledging that sometimes, life is just a chaotic swirl of possibilities, and that’s perfectly okay.

So, as you navigate the waters of emptiness, remember: it’s not about despairing over the void or ""nothingness"" but rather finding joy in the fact that the void is full of potential. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, just ask yourself: what would my cat do? They’d probably take a nap and wake up with a new existential question. 

Next time you find yourself pondering the vastness of existence, just remember: we all came from nothing, we’re all connected through nothing, and that’s just the universe’s way of saying, “Relax! We’re all just floating around here, trying to figure it out together. So, we're all made from nothing trying to figure out something.” 

And if nothing else, at least you have a built-in support group for those moments when you realize you’ve been talking to your houseplants and you actually find your connected through nothing. Welcome to the club, it's all about nothing!

  
Finally when I was a young child frustrated and crying my mother would look at me and say why are you crying over spilled milk it's nothing and in the cosmic existential meaning it and I hesitate to say but, it ""really"" is nothing. The moral of the story is ""you can't cry over spilled milk.""

And that takes us to another psychologically philosophically religious topic ""You can't cry over spilled milk.""  It's impermanent and is returning to nothingness. Till next time...",0,1730057150.0,Buddhism,0,0.5,False

Flexible deadline, but ideally completed within 1 - 2 months.

# About the Job

Hi, I’m a solo dev making my first commercial game, The Tea Maker, a shop management / visual novel hybrid game about running a tea house, with gameplay similar to [Potion Craft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210320/Potion_Craft_Alchemist_Simulator/) and [Strange Horticulture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/), and story presented through dialogue similarly to [Coffee Talk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/) and [VA-11 Hall-A](https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/).

I’m seeking an artist for paid work, ideally someone who:

1. specializes in a 2D handcrafted/illustrative storybook style
2. is comfortable drawing mainly objects like kettles, tea cups, shelves, tea leaves, and background foliage
3. can do frame-by-frame animations like water boiling or pouring into a tea cup.

I’m aiming for a bright, whimsical aesthetic/mood like the ones in[ Hoa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484900/Hoa/) or[ Dordogne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272840/Dordogne/) or[ Book of Travels](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1152340/Book_of_Travels/). I know those look different from each other, but what they have in common is high-quality environmental art in a soft, “pretty” watercolor style (that is to say I’m not looking for pixel art, comic book art, vector art, or cartoony children’s book art). If that sounds within your skill set, please comment with your portfolio, especially any pieces that fit the aesthetic I described.

# Scope of Project

I made a prototype using placeholder images cobbled together from random Amazon product listings and my limited MS Paint skills, so the initial project is for replacing all that with actual art. Please view the prototype at[ https://youtu.be/2ygEui1-52M](https://youtu.be/2ygEui1-52M) to get a sense of the scope and work items. Here’s the task list:

Key objects:

1. 3 jars of tea (green, white, black) each with two variations (lid on, lid lifted)
2. Kettle with a water pouring in animation, and a water boiling animation that transitions between 6 distinct stages from cold to boiling
3. Tea cup in 5 distinct stages (empty cup, cup with infuser, cup with leaves, cup with tea steeping in infuser, and cup with tea but infuser removed).
4. Burner with fire animation (5 - 10 frames)

Other objects and environment:

1. Water filter
2. Trash can
3. Tip jar
4. Hourglass with sand falling animation
5. (Optional/Additional) Wind chime with swaying animation
6. Interior of shop (food truck) including walls, countertop, and shelves
7. Window, curtains, awning, and outside counter
8. Background sidewalk and tree

Items that aren’t part of this job: Character art, or UI items like the dialogue box or icons/indicators.

# Payment and Workflow

Bill me per work item, and give a rough estimate of costs and time required in advance for each. I can pay via PayPal, 50% as soon as you show a watermarked sketch, and the other 50% upon delivery of a piece. I usually send payment same-day or next-day. Deadlines are flexible, but please try to reply within a week so we can resolve questions efficiently. I prefer email for billing and sending artwork, and messages on Discord for discussing details of work tasks. I’m in the EST/EDT time zone, so I may not reply immediately, but will try to by next day.

Regarding contracts – main points are that I’ll need rights for commercial use, will credit you, will not accept AI art, and need someone who can commit to the whole project, not just single pieces (for consistency in art style).

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Questions and feedback are welcome. Also, if you personally don’t do this style of art, but know someone who may be interested, please share this post with them!",7,1730057137.0,gameDevClassifieds,6,1.0,False

We have a coffee table I could sit at as well. But even then I might need a stand (also not preferred. I would prefer to sit next to my wife on the couch while she games of reads). 

So yeah. How do you sit. And do you use a stand?

I will post full recipe later when I find my log book, but the basics of what I used were full dark roast coffee beans, Madagascar vanilla beans, and roasted cocoa nibs, and honey ofc. I made a one gallon batch as an experiment flavor. I bottled it today. It was extremely bitter, almost like overly strong camp coffee. I back sweetened with a homemade simple syrup. 

But this overly bitter flavor has me a bit worried and wondering if anything I could have done, should have done, it could still do to help it; it is this is just an aging issue and I have to let it just sit for a few months. 

As far as alcohol content, it was just under 12 percent when I stopped the fermentation. It doesn't have much of an alcohol rate mostly a bad coffee taste instead of a good coffee taste.",2,1730056917.0,mead,3,1.0,False

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/h0HFFpQ)

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - “hey” does not start a conversation. ",0,1730056910.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

1gdis4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1gdis4p/thinking_of_buying_failed_cafe_looking_for/,Thinking of buying failed cafe - looking for feedback on my proposal and business plan,"# Context

I live in a city on the west coast of Canada and there is a cafe downtown which just shutdown due to the owner not being able to turn a profit at this location. They are selling the location (lease) and assets.

I have an idea on how to turn this existing location and assets into a profitable business and would love some feedback.

* What am I not thinking of?
* What should I be aware of running an owner operated cafe / juice bar?
* How difficult is it to secure a business loan at this time in 2024? 
* Any feedback at all, good and bad

# About the Previous Business

The previous business was a cookie cutter cafe that sold specialty coffees along with some generic baked goods and breakfast sandwiches. Their beans and breakfast sandwiches were purchased from another coffee company that exists downtown.

Shortly after this cafe opened another business on the same block opened up, a bakery. They offer specialty coffee and baked goods as well. The difference? This bakery has much more charm, their baked goods are made in house and offer a lot more than just your standard generic muffins and cookies. They are drawing in a lot of the same customers over this little cafe.

Part of the reason this cafe is losing money is due to the cost of staffing. This is easily taking up at least half their expenses each month. 

# My Vision

I have gotten some ballpark figures from the current owner and even if I didn't change anything at all I could be profitable from day one purely based on operating myself and not having to pay staff. They do have some dedicated regulars (such as myself) who are coming back day after day. 

The above aside, one thing this area is lacking is some light healthy food options. There are numerous other restaurants all around but they are all hearty or heavy meals. We have a tonne of bakeries, sushi, Chinese, Indian food, etc. There is a poke bowl place nearby but that is really the only healthy alternative.

I want to take away all of their food and snacks, keep the specialty coffees, and add a cold press juice bar along with some healthy vegan breakfast, lunch, and snack options. The west coast has a lot of health conscious customers and a lot of people who have adopted vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.

# The Location

The location of this business is right downtown. It is actually inside of a larger market which houses many other restaurants. The cafe is rather small and doesn't have it's own discrete retail location, it is more tucked into a nice nook near the front entrance in the open. 

There are a lot of condo and apartment buildings nearby. Most of them are recently built and are more modern and luxurious. There are also a lot of office buildings and businesses nearby. This is all within a 1-2 block radius. This market does have a bit of a reputation for being ""cursed"" for some small businesses but I think this gap is the right fit here. 

In addition, there are a couple nearby yoga studios, a high end womans fitness studio, a vegan gluten free bakery (different one than the new one that opened), and a new vegan fast food place that just opened up. I think this translates into a location where there are people looking for these kind of options.

# Numbers

The owner listed the location and assets for 85k. I have already had a preliminary discussion with him and told him the highest I could go would be half that, which he admitted seems to be in line with some other conversations he had. He is willing to let it go for 42.5k.

The owner himself is 67 years old and owns a few different cafes and restaurants in the same city. This location is a very small portion of his investment and he is willing to take a loss on it to sell it off ASAP. He is concerned with ensuring the community here (the market and other restaurants) have a business in this location that draws in some foot traffic so it is important that the new business offer coffee for that reason. He seems very interested in finding the ""right"" business for the location over the maximum return on his loss.

# My Proposal

I think it is more important to the owner to have the right person and right business in this location when taking over the lease and buying the assets. Knowing this I want to go into our next meeting with a small business plan / proposal that details the business I intend to put there. I want to use this to lower the price even further below 40k.

I don't have these funds myself so I will need to go to the bank to secure a business loan in order to purchase the lease / assets as well as equipment needed to setup the juice bar etc.",1,1730056529.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

1gdinux,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Peanutbutterandcats/comments/1gdinux/the_girl/,The Girl ,"In the heart of a small, picturesque town, where cobblestone streets wound their way through quaint, ivy-clad cottages, lived a girl of such extraordinary beauty that she seemed to have stepped out of a dream. Her name was Lila, and her presence had a way of brightening even the gloomiest of days. Her laughter was like the tinkling of wind chimes on a summer breeze, and her eyes sparkled with a warmth that could thaw the coldest of hearts.

Among those enchanted by her was Elias, a boy whose affection for Lila ran deeper than the roots of the ancient oak that stood at the town's center. To Elias, she was more than just a beautiful girl; she was a muse, a beacon of light in his otherwise ordinary world. He watched her from afar, his heart swelling with an unspoken love that he dared not reveal.

Every morning, Elias would sit at the corner café, sipping his coffee as he waited for Lila to pass by on her way to the flower shop where she worked. He cherished those fleeting moments, the way she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, the way she smiled at everyone with a kindness that seemed boundless. To him, she was perfection incarnate.

Yet, despite the depth of his feelings, Elias remained silent. He was convinced that someone as radiant as Lila could never harbor feelings for someone as unremarkable as himself. The fear of rejection, the dread of shattering the delicate illusion of her presence in his life, kept his words locked away. His love for her was a secret he carried with him, a bittersweet ache nestled deep within his chest.

And so, day after day, Elias watched and waited, his heart caught in the delicate balance between hope and despair. He dreamed of a day when he might find the courage to tell her how he felt, but until then, he would remain a silent admirer, content to love her from the shadows.",1,1730056220.0,u_Peanutbutterandcats,0,1.0,False

1gdiige,https://www.reddit.com/r/searchandrescue/comments/1gdiige/sar_overnight_exam_lessons_learned/,SAR Overnight Exam Lessons Learned,"Hi folks,

I'm a relatively new SAR tech, just finishing up my ground SAR course in Canada. As part of this course, we have an overnight wilderness survival skills exam which is also, usually, the culmination of the GSAR course - half exam, half rite of passage :)

We were fortunate to have super mild weather, but I learned a lot and made plenty of mistakes. I wanted to share those here.

**Mistake One: shelter site**

I was assigned an area with a lot of blowdown, including some big fallen trunks. My first shelter spot would have had a big log provide shelter on one side, with a tarp supported by some lashed posts providing the rest of the cover. I would have been lying with my feet downhill, which would have been fine, but the overall space was pretty small and I figured out that the prevailing wind would have blown into the shelter, not against it. I relocated to the other side of the big log, where fortunately I had a central support beam and a little hill perpendicular to the big log I had been using. Super easy: throw a tarp over the support beam, tie or weigh it down the other side of the hill, block up one end with boughs, job done. Which brings us to:

**Mistake Two: Fire strategy**

I figured I would make a small fire and be close to it, to minimise the amount of time I'm spending hunting (dry) firewood - we had snow and then a thaw so everything was pretty wet. Unfortunately, being close to the fire and having damp wood means you are going to be shooting embers frequently - and also burning holes in your tarp if you haven't covered it up with e.g. moss, boughs, etc. Due to the terrain I had to have my fire at the opening, where my head was, which meant that my feet were naturally colder, but that was not an issue due to clothing and the relatively mild weather. The main cause of my discomfort was mistake three.

**Mistake Three: Bedding**

I mentioned that hill. There was what looked like a ledge that was covered in thick moss, which would have been perfect - I was using an emergency blanket as a ground mat, which is fine if a little cold, so the damp moss wasn't a concerned - but unfortunately, that ledge turned out to be... not a ledge. So I spent the entire night lying along a slope, trying to prop my hips up with my backpack so I didn't roll. All my gear, if it wasn't stowed, would fall down the slope when I slept. Please don't make my mistake.

**Takeaways**

I used the following equipment:

* Axe
* Knife
* Tarp
* Emergency blankets x 2
* Billy can

Things I wished I had:
* Saw
* More of my homemade firestarters (coarse and fine sawdust mixed with vaseline, brown twine wick, form into a cherry bomb shape and dip in candle wax). I only had one, and stupidly used it to start my fire... just before a 2hr walk around to see everyone's shelters. I used a small tea light candle to get the second fire going, and when I woke up to an out fire I made a third using cotton balls I keep with my meds in a pill bottle (both OTC meds for subjects, and my own personal ones) plus a healthy dose of hand sanitizer. I will probably use tampons smeared with vaseline going forward.

Plus a canteen, first aid kit, food, good clothing, etc, but the above is the equipment I needed. I frequently wished my axe was a saw. For food, I ate a mix I had put together of salted shellless pistachios, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds and raisins, plus a protein bar and a snickers. I also had single serve hot chocolate and instant coffee, which was great. I only had 2L of water, but it was one night only, and so that was (just) enough.

I'm hoping to get some of my colleagues together to do a similar exercise in December, where we should have plenty of snow and -20 to -35C temperatures :)",1,1730055845.0,searchandrescue,4,0.67,False

I would make a coffee and say “a treat for mommy and a treat for my sweet boy.” He was patient and cute at first. I did this maybe 4 times, and he caught on relatively quickly.

This is most obvious when watching a video. The audio still works smoothly, but the video (or article I'm scrolling on) will freeze the screen and jump to the spot it should be. The problem does not occur when the laptop is plugged into its charger. It happens regardless of my wi-fi connection. It freezes at home, school, coffee shops, and everywhere it isn't plugged in. I've tried everything the internet offers, and it still freezes when not plugged in. This is a $2000 laptop, and it is extremely frustrating.

Virgin Red is the rewards club from Virgin. Earn Virgin Points with brands you know and love, then spend them on rewards from across the Virgin family and beyond

**What can you get with 1,000 points?**

Virgin Red has a range of rewards starting at just 200 points.
* 5 Greggs Sausage rolls (200 points)
* £5 Costa Coffee / Caffè Nero digital gift card (1000 points)
* Charity donations (1,000 points)
* Or carry on collecting and book 1 Vue, Cineworld or Showcase Cinema ticket from 1,350 points

**Retail partners**

There are lots of online retailers to click through to from the Virgin Red website and earn points from. For example you can earn 3 points per £1 spent at Boots or 1 points per £1 spent at eBay.

**8:02 AM** — Coffee warm in your hands, spoon tapping lightly on the bowl. There’s that little tilt of your head, that brief look toward the ceiling, as if something up there tugs at you. Just a glance. *Nothing’s changed.*

**8:46 AM** — Bag over your shoulder, keys in hand. You pause at the door, a quick look around. The lock clicks as you leave, steps fading down the hall. Nothing out of place, nothing left behind. You lock it all away, just like before. Makes things easy.

**6:17 PM** — The creak of the door, your soft sigh as you step back in. Bag dropped by the entrance, a long, deep breath. Settling in, slipping into the quiet like it’s a second skin. Just like every evening....*just like before.*

**8:10 PM** — Book open in your hands, thumb tracing the page, eyes steady. Sometimes you glance up, catching the ceiling vent for a second, but only a second. Just a habit, something in the back of your mind. You don’t think much of it. Neither do I.

**10:34 PM** — In front of the mirror, the brush in your hand, slow and steady strokes through your hair. Your gaze holds, focused, as you smooth each strand. Left, right, repeat. You watch yourself closely, every night, brushing until it all falls into place.

**11:13 PM** — Bed, blankets drawn up tight. You settle in, breathing slowing, muscles relaxing. Just you, eyes closed, drifting under. It’s so quiet here, so still. I've always liked it here.

**11:52 PM** — Stillness. Not a sound, not a hint of movement. Just your breaths, deep and soft, in rhythm with the silence. *Nothing’s changed.*

**12:00 AM** — My fingers press through the ceiling vent above your bed, long pale things slipping between the narrow metal grating. “Can I come down?” My whisper drifts through, soft and careful, almost tender. “Like that night in the closet, all those years ago…when you locked yourself in, all night… and I stroked your hair through the slats?” ",4,1730055266.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Prior to that, I was gonna get him coffee as a sweet gesture while I was at the coffee shop so I asked for his order and finalized with “are you sure this is your final order?” Because it changed THRICE. In his defense, I recommended another good menu item as well which he ended up choosing, but I wanted to clarify. I asked it another time for confirmation and he suddenly said “why dont you believe me?” And I just said I wanted to be sure in case you change your mind again. He was clearly annoyed.

Eventually he came to pick me up and I handed him his order. We get into this huge argument about why he can’t just respond with something simple like “yeah im really sure thats my order” or why does he have to be so irked all the time by minor questions, he called me out for saying that he feels like I’ve judged him for picking out the wrong option when I ask. I go asking him how is there even a wrong option? I just wanted to make sure before I buy it. Things got heated up and we were provoking each other very badly. I ended up throwing my own (iced) coffee at him which I deeply regret. Suddenly, I started getting anxiety and I wanted to get out of the car. He wouldnt allow it. I kept begging him to drop me off because I couldn’t breathe, and he wouldn’t allow it still. I said I felt like I was being kidnapped and need to get dropped off somewhere as soon as possible. I felt trapped. And he wouldn’t let me. He just kept driving. I was crying and screaming and he would hold the door, and I kept punching his arm out of very high emotional distress. He was adamant about not letting me go down. I screamed outside the car window, “help!”, and he just shut the windows up. It was a full walking area so he could have dropped me off at any sidewalk with no problem. 

I ended stayed the whole way through, feeling really powerless. I punched him on his right arm about 10x. He got a mild bruise from it. We eventually calmed down later on and we were okay. I apologized for what happened very much and I was very ashamed and guilty since I’ve committed domestic violence. 

Now — everytime we get into an argument he brings it up. Even if unrelated, he will find an opportunity to squeeze it into our argument. He uses it to guilt trip me. When we argued one time, he (apparently) had a photo of the bruise on his arm and made it his profile picture on discord. I used to feel very guilty and ashamed, but now I’m starting to get tired of this being held as leverage against me. 

So people of reddit, tell me, AITA for punching my boyfriend in this case? Should I still feel guilty and ashamed for this? 

tl;dr - I got anxiety and felt like i was being kidnapped in the car and ended up punching my bf’s arm 10x. It formed one mild bruise on his arm. AITA for punching him?

Welp... It got worse. I've now officially been diagnosed with Crohn's. It took them over a year to realize something I had been saying and worried about. Yeah... And now? I need surgery. I'm on a heavy course of antibiotics and I see my doctor this week to discuss the surgery. It could be something as simple as a four hour surgery and a three week recovery or I could end up in the hospital for a few weeks and my life could be heavily impacted for the next three to six months. Not sure, they need to see how bad the damage is. 

Meanwhile, I am still waiting on a disability appeal and the local organizations here for housing assistance. Why? I escaped, yes literally escaped, abusive relationship and after a few years was able to lift the geographic restriction to move my child and I out of state. 

My sister offered to help me. To live rent free in her house with her family until I could get things in her state figured out. I was hoping it would only take six months, a year at most. I was very clear in letting her know my hopes but also being honest and admitting that I didn't know how long it would really take. She said it was alright, that it wouldn't take that long. That it would be best if we moved to get away from my ex. 

I agreed and we moved. It's been a little over two years and I am still stuck at my sister's with my young daughter and there's nothing anyone can do about it. After the first year my sister said that she understood but was frustrated and wouldn't be able to help herself from making bitter comments. 

Now? She makes them almost every day, won't talk to me, and has admitted to being mad at me when I told her that I need surgery. 

A few key points here... 

1. I have assistance for food and some cash assistance. To which I do give a small portion to my sister.

2. I am a very clean person even when I'm having a bad day. While our living space might be in a bit of disarray I keep the community spaces clean.  

3. Her house is massive. We could potentially go the entire week without seeing each other. 

4. She, in fact none of my family, has ever baby sat my child albeit once when I needed someone to watch her for two hours for a procedure. 

5. I have done everything asked of me. Make coffee in my bedroom instead of in the kitchen? Fine. Keep all my canned goods in our bedroom? Okay, got it. Don't make meals that take longer than a half an hour? Sure. Don't make anything outside of american type style food, fine... Don't make any fish, period. Fine... FINE! Sorry to offend your delicate nose, have you smelled your teenagers bedroom lately!?

They decided to get a puppy... I have spent money on products to get rid of the smell of the dog's fecal matter and urine. I bought a pooper scooper. Why? If I don't clean it up, no one will unless it's in their private area (I.E. bedroom) and even then they might not clean it. I won't even go near the teenagers door let alone step in the bedroom. Piles... Literal piles... 

And here my sister is mad because she thinks that me having surgery will effect my ability to get out of her house. She thinks I can call up disability and demand that they hurry up, the same with the housing organizations. She thinks I can drive there and make demands... Like, what? She's mad that I won't do it. She's mad that I won't call every single day and pester these people.

I told my therapist about this and she laughed and said, ""Yeah, go ahead and get a restraining order against you as well."" She's a therapist that works with the county and state so she knows. 

How dare I ask my sister for help right? All I asked was if she could watch my daughter during the surgery. Oh, by the way the time that I had that procedure after I was supposed to come home and not move, at all for the first two hours then take it very easy for the next 48. Did anyone help me? Nope. 

....Then there's my ex and child support arrears. What a sick and twisted joke. He'll never be held accountable for anything he's every done. It doesn't matter how many people he has hurt, or how many laws he's broken, or what he does in general. He'll never be held accountable... 

And here I am facing the fact that I might have a very embarrassing condition would could be a red flag for cancer. Fucking cancer... Doc said, 46% chance and during the surgery they'll take a biopsy. 

I hate it here. 

The only shinning point is my daughter. I love her with all of myself. And I'm terrified that she'll be impacted by all of this. I get it, I'm thankful to my sister. I'm thankful that these programs exist. We would be a hundred percent worse off if it weren't for all the help I have been given. But... It's not easy, and it shouldn't be this hard. Peace, can I have a little of it? Nope, here's another wave of dizziness and cramps while my sister huffs and rolls her eyes at me. 

I want to nap so bad but I can't. I promised to play a board game with my daughter. She is currently nomming at me and while it's hilarious and makes me smile I still can't stop the nausea and cramps. I just want to enjoy my child.   ",0,1730055094.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

I have no aversion to something committed, I'd welcome it.. but of course that would mean two connect fully and want all the same stuff from life, at this age now, I know what I like and want in life and don't want.. although, I'm just not even interested in dating right now.. for now, seeking a good mix of friendly vibes & affection.. looking for 'the one right now' and it be great if she was someone with these preferences in life of being a childfree, petfree, own independent person 

I'm 36, Brown man, considered attractive, average dadbod, stubble to shaved-ish head with a short-medium beard, am childfree & petfree, well groomed, big on hygiene, selfcare, tattooed, professional with remote/wfh job in niche market and overall a chill, levelheaded, mature, balanced individual that's not interested in games/fakeness/deception and am interested in a straightforward real woman who's a good fit that's not worried about emotions or feelings in something like this because she understands it adds to make it better; I think emotional maturity and life experience are attractive 

I'm happy to swap pic if there's interest after you introduce yourself, we can have a lowkey coffee-walk to see if there's enough mutual interest to pursue anything further.. I'm not into online stuff and want someone in metro Vancouver to connect with. I barely use any of the apps nowadays and I am terrible at forever messaging chat not having ever met plus I keep expectations low given reddit msgs I've gotten

I'm fully unattached, ie. not dating anyone or looking really, I want consistent ongoing sitch, fun vibes, chill good thing.  I'm not looking to go out and do stuff; wanting to stay in to enjoy eachother, friendly-lovers, kept private indoors is fine, overall I'm not looking for a pseudo dating relationship but do want a good connection. I prefer a longer term situation whether we call it being casual, having fun, lovers, FWB etc

I'm not in a rush so want to enjoy a fun connection and my life until that 'right match' and something serious emerges

For something meaningful, I'm an atheist, mostly apolitical, childfree and petfree as I want to live no obligation lifestyle  freely. I'm not really into the super pronoun using acronym heavy overly politically correct personalities, but a real and not hateful person is who I vibe with.. ie. who doesn't need to over correct, is somebody who doesn't actually actively have a problem with common phrases that were ok before but now are seen as offensive, someone good natured yet not uptight about perception but cares whats in your heart

1gdi2hh,https://i.redd.it/7aegip4wgcxd1.jpeg,I Designed a Coffee Grinder  – Check Out the NECCST Series 1!,"

Hey I’m Fynn, and like many of you, I’ve fallen way too far down the espresso rabbit hole. So far, in fact, that I ended up designing my own coffee grinder because none of the grinders out there were scratching that precision itch. Now, after lots of tinkering, I’m excited to introduce the NECCST Coffee Grinder, which is now live on Kickstarter!

Here’s why I’m super stoked about it (and maybe you will be too):

Stepless Grind Adjustment Dial
Imagine never having to deal with those annoying clicky steps when you’re trying to fine-tune your grind size. This dial gives you infinite control. Switching between espresso and V60? No problem—just a smooth twist away.

Grind-by-Weight
Ever wanted to grind directly by weight with no guessing games? If you want it has an integrated scale with a touchscreen, so you can measure out your exact dose. It even detaches if you want to use it for brewing.

Low Noise
No more sounding like a jet engine at 6 AM. Your grinder should wake you up, not the rest of the house.

Zero Retention
Every gram of coffee goes into your portafilter or brewer. No waste, no stale grounds left behind.

It’s manual, so if you’re into that whole hands-on experience and love dialing in your shots, this grinder is made for you. I poured my espresso-fueled heart into it to make something that’s super precise and satisfying to use.

You can check out more details on Kickstarter (link’s in my profile), and if you have any questions, hit me up. Whether it’s about the grinder, espresso in general, or what possessed me to design my own grinder, I’m happy to chat. 😅

(Transparency: Yeah, I made this thing, and yeah, I’m promoting it, but it’s a passion project for fellow espresso nerds!)

Already tested them on the Keurig Coffee Maker, Microwave and Fridge/Freezer. Just glad I didn't get longer cords because these things are super thick! They are also 2500 watt rated which exceeds my Jackery 1000 Plus. I also like they are yellow and easy to see. Orange for Jackery inputs and yellow for outputs. So if there any electricians out there how did I do? Is this a safe setup?

1gdi13r,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gdi13r/progress_report_322_292/,"Progress report, 322 -> 292","Hi. I had hip dysplasia and diabetes type 2.
I started dieting January 1st and stuck to the diet for 3 months to get to 294. I did maintenance gaining and losing 5 pounds until October. I felt sick on the diet, like high fantasies about wanting to eat mountains of food. How great would it be to have 5 pizzas at the same time? It was pretty weird, like a cartoon on a deserted island, or being trapped in a desert dreaming of an oasis. I stopped dieting because of it.

But, just maintaining instead of binge eating was really hard. Fighting to eat TDEE instead of over eating took a long time to get used to. I read it takes the brain 9 months to rewire the reward circuit of the brain. Maybe, that is what the psychological struggle was all about. I started to feel fine in October, food wasn't a nightmare anymore.

I was 300 October 1st, and hopped on a 1,500 calorie per day diet. Now I am 292 and still losing weight again. The hip dysplasia got fixed from sitting and sleeping properly and is a huge pain relief. I also got my blood sugar under control thanks to maintenance eating and now upping how much protein I eat everyday instead of eating extra sweets. I have to say that spiced meat is not a bad compromise compared to a candy bar or a sweet coffee.

My diet plan says I will take at least 16 months to go from 41.3 BMI to 25 BMI. I have gone from a 60 inch waist to a 51 inch waist. I hope I can switch to XXL t-shirts soon, and that my pants will stay on better due to having a big belly the belt slips off all the time.

Cheers to anyone else on the long haul diet and life style change. Best wishes.",2,1730054622.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

If the laptop was open when they stole it (this is presumably what they are aiming to achieve when stealing a device - an unlocked one) then they can very easily get access to all my passwords. They could simply open the browser, click the 1Password extension and reveal any password they want, even when the laptop is not connected to a network. 

The above issue applies to the PC application and browser extensions. Both appear to be fully accessible without a master password if the PC is in use.

I have 1Password on my IOS and it always prompts me for the master password (or Face ID) before allowing me to either open the 1Password App or before autofilling a password in a web browser. This means that even if my iPhone is stolen from my hands whilst it is still unlocked, the thief could never access my passwords stored in the 1Password app. This feature seems like it should also be on the PC.

Am I missing something in one of the PC app or extension options to switch on a prompt for a master password when revealing or autofilling a password?

This is the first script I’ve ever written so I would love some brutal feedback.


“Are you are you awake? It's 3 AM. Oh, did you have a nightmare? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.


It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. No. It's okay. You're safe.

It's okay. You're safe. It's okay. Everything's alright. Everything's alright.

It's okay. It's okay. It's all good. Everything's fine. You're in a safe place.

The dream was the hard part. It's over. It's gone. And I'm so sorry that you had to go through it alone. You're safe.

Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Just take deep breaths. Long deep breaths. It's all gonna be okay.

Everything. I swear. I..It's okay. You're good. You're good.


Everything's fine. Everything's alright. You're safe. You're safe and you are loved and you are cared for. And whatever happened in that dream, it's gone.

It's over. It's not gonna get you here. It's okay to let it go. It's not gonna get you. I promise.

There's nothing here that will hurt you or that even wants to hurt you. You're safe. Okay? You're safe. I promise.

You wanna try and take some deep breaths with me? I'll do it with you. How about we do 3? Okay. So just inhale, hold, and then exhale.

I'll count it out for you. Okay. So we're just gonna inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and then exhale for 4 seconds, or more if you need to. 
Inhale. Hold. Exhale. Okay. Just 2 more times. Inhale. Hold, exhale.

One more. Inhale, Hold. Exhale. 

Is that better? I'm sure that helped your nervous system a lot.


And I'm so sorry that you had this terrible nightmare. I really am. No matter how old you get, nightmares are just one of those things where they never really seem to get any less scarier. It always seems so haunting. And it's one of those things from our childhood..really where we just go from dreaming about one thing to another.

The monsters may change, but the feeling of waking up from a nightmare, that scared and all alone kind of feeling doesn't ever change, does it? 

And I'm really sorry that you had to wake up like that, it's so scary and I know I say that a lot, but it is. They really are that frightening. So I'm really sorry, and I hope you know that now you're safe. You're in a safe place, and you're loved, and I hope you feel like you're okay.

I hope you feel like everything's gonna be okay. Like, tomorrow's gonna be a better day. I hope you feel safe enough to go back to sleep. Oh, are you are you scared of going back to sleep? You feel like you could have another nightmare?


Well, as much as I wanna promise you that you're not, I can't do that. 

I know you know that, but I also hope that you know that I really wish I could. But what I can do is hold your hand while you sleep. So even if you have another nightmare, I want some part of your brain to know that there is someone waiting for you to wake up. Somebody that cares.

Somebody that loves you. That someone will be there for you, to protect you in this world, even if I can't in another. We could stay up for a little bit if you want. We could, or you could go back to bed because it is pretty late. 

I know you're scared, and it's okay to be. You don't always have to be so tough, and you don't always have to be so strong about everything. And especially here, you don't have to pretend like you're okay with everything. 

You know that old cliche? It's okay to not be okay?

I hope when you're around me you feel that way. You really feel like it's okay to not be okay, at your best and at your worst I'm here for you. But it is pretty late, and you should sleep. it's your bedtime, isn't it?

You should sleep. It's bedtime. I know you don't have a bedtime, but what is a bedtime really? Is it just simply not a good time to go to bed? And I feel like right now, if you look at that clock and if you listen to your body, it's a good time to go to sleep.

Oh. Your mind's keeping you up? Okay. How about this. If you go to bed, we can play uno tomorrow morning.

First thing in the morning, we can play uno right after I get some coffee. But right after I get some coffee, I'm all yours. We will play UNO. My time is yours. And I promise that I will not be so competitive this time.


I know I get a little too competitive for a very casual game, but I love UNO and I love being competitive. There's just something about UNO that really brings out that competitiveness in me and I don't know what it is and I don't understand. 


I know you're aware and I know you let me win too which I absolutely adore you for that. I really do. So we could play 

oh, no.

It's okay to be scared. You just had a really frightening experience and you don't wanna go through it again. It's okay if you're scared to go to sleep. But I have another proposal for you. How about this?


I will be your local guardian. You know? And I don't know a lot about guardians. I know about the ones in Minecraft. The water guardians?

I don't what are they’re called? I don't remember. Like, sea guardians? Ocean guardians? I don't remember what they're called, but they're really blue, and they're really big, and they're scary.

You know the ones that give you mining fatigue forever until you find some milk, which that doesn't make sense because they're in the ocean. What does milk have to do with anything? Shouldn't it be like an ocean plant that you need to find? Not milk. 

That that doesn't make sense. But what I do know is they're really good guardian, and I will be a really good guardian. Even though we're not in the ocean, I will be your earth guardian. And if something comes at us, I will fight tooth and nail. And… you're laughing at me?

That's great and that's wonderful You don't have faith in me? Well that's just a little offensive and really that hurts my feelings I here I am offering to defend you and you have no faith in me Wow… that really kills my soul, you know? You don't think I'm gonna deal a lot of damage? I will have you know I will fight tooth and nail, and it's it will be gory. There will be blood.


There will be gore. And a very strong attempt will be made in your honor, to defend. Yes. A very strong one. Mhmm.


It's definitely not gonna be a KO situation. I might get KO'd, but I don't think I'll be able to KO anyone else. However… however, don't they say it's the thought that matters more than anything? Right? Yeah.

Okay. And now you're .. okay. You find this amusing? I don't know why you find any of this amusing because it's not. Here I am offering everything to you, and you… just laugh at me like I'm a jester.

This is not Among Us. I'm not the jester. There's nothing to be amused by. If you wanted to laugh, we could play Among Us. Yeah.


Keep laughing. I'll bring up Among Us. Keep laughing. Oh, no. Mhmm.


Mhmm. You never like any of my ideas, do you? No, you don't. It's fine though. I still love you, unfortunately.


Unfortunate yes, it is a very unfortunate thing. you know what? I'm not gonna sit here and argue with you about how unfortunate it is and I'm also not gonna argue with you about Among Us because I love that game and I will defend it till the end no matter what.. so I'm.. 

Oh, you wanna go for Minecraft? I don't think you should. You know what? Forget the demons, I'll fight you instead.


Right here, right now. Let's go. Let's go. No. No.


You don't wanna do that. Yeah, I thought so. Mhmm. I thought so. Wise decision.


Wise decision. Yeah. How about you just go to bed instead? Because I simply just don't wanna talk to you anymore. No.


Don't wanna do it. Just go to bed. Okay, just lay down close your eyes I'll be right here I'll be here until you fall asleep, okay? Just close your eyes and take deep breaths It's all gonna be okay. You're safe.

Everything's gonna be okay and tomorrow is gonna be a better day. It's gonna be so much better.”

1gdhxqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1gdhxqy/i_dont_know_if_i_can_trust_my_parents_or_not/,I dont know if i can trust my parents or not maybe im just over reacting,"So, two years ago i startd talking to this guy  he was (16 turning 17) at the time and i was 14. At the time the age gap wasnt that badd at the time . So him and i were in a friend group we use to never talk too mcuh in the past and the one day we just clicked. We spoke to eachother every day , we called texted , this went on or months. One day he asked me to be his girlfriend and i didnt know how to tell my parents because they are pretty strict. My mom kinda knew that he asked me so she let me date him , so she told my dad. He let it happen but the first thing he did was go through our chats. I really didnt understand why but i couldnt reject it.

(I dont really remeber everything for some reason just saying)

So my dad would frequently go through our chats and one day my friend group and i decided to hang out at her house. We were relaxing and stuff i put my leg on his and her step mom was pretty strict and didnt like it. So i stopped and when she left i put my leg on his again. Then she said i mustent then my friend told me she is going to tell my mom and the rest of the day i had such a bad feeling. ( i realised afterwards its was so fucking dumb of me to do that). So  we went to the churchs youth and abnormally my mom picked me up, i saw her speaking to my bf mom .  I instantly knew what was happening , so my mom didnt talk for me for the first few mins in the car and then she started shouting. She said that my friends parents went to meet her for a coffee and they were very upset . So my mom told me to break up with him. I didnt ... i should have at the time

My dad has really big anger issues btw , so she told my dad and he didnt speak for me for like two days. One day we were calling and my dad walking in and he looked at my screen.He asked what app is that (discord) so i said its nothing so he said go into it i did ... he took my laptop instantly. he told me to get in the car and i was shaking because i was so scared . i started crying , my mom came with and she didnt undertstand what was happening... they drove somewhere .We kinda (sextexted) idk why i feel stupid now but anyways, my parents read all of our texts and i remember my mom crying then she slapped me a few time.. got called a slut. My dad was shouting at me and took all my devices away.Later on he brought me to lounge  he made it look like he was going to punch me in the face. 

Then there was repeated pattern i get my devices back my parents find out they take it away . This happened probaby 13 times in the span of a year. My dad would always come in my room and stand stare at me for like 3 minutes striaght. He would come and look at my screen. He would go through my stuff  randomly once i was alseep and he woke me up at 3 am and started going though my  phone and laptop.  I remember vividly my whole body shaking non stop as he ligit interigted me . I use to cry every night and wouldnt understand why they cant just let me.Over time me and my bf at the time spoke on different social media playforms. I just hated my dad so much because of him. The main thing that angered me i was getting introuble all the time and this  guy who i was i with, nothing happened to him. His parents didnt give a fuck , i had to go through all this shit and he just lived his normal caual life. He kept on saying his dad will talk to my dad to give us a chance but its never fucking happened. the guy only cared about our relationship more than me , more than what was happening to me at home . He didnt care if he did he would have broke up with me. 

The girl step mom turned out to be a two faced bitch. She went behind my back telling the teacher all my problem at home and i was updating her on what happened between me and this guy at the time. btw my mom and this teacher are like besties so she was telling my mom all this fucking info. I found this out on a voice message of my teacher telling what my mom what i told my friend. So i confronted her and she said no i didnt i would never . I tried to brush it off i really didnt want to lose her , even through this was a clear sign. She started to ignore me and telll me her friends plans infront of me and didnt even invite me like wtf. So one day she said this is my last day im finishing school  we chated and( turns out it wasnt her last day she just went to a differnt fucking school. WHAT A BITCH , i found this out a few months later after me and the guy broke up )



So my bestie just told me this is runing your mental health break up with him so , i did it was really hard... we had a stituationship for a few months. He turned out to be a dick later on thats not really important ( my dad wasnt right abt him though). After a whole year and half of this truamatising shit it was over , but things never felt the same, i didnt trust my dad , at all my parents dont even acknoleged how truamatised i am and how distant i am. I disatnt my self from them because i dont trust them. My dad and i are kinda like strangers in the house we bearly talk. Ive develloped this habbit when im texting someone or something and i hear my parnets i switch app to tik tok or something, because im just so afriad of them interigating me. It feels so  akwawrd and uncomfy when he tries to hug me. I feel nevous around him always . I dont my parents at all with my devices. Sometimes i have a problem with my laptop or phone , im too scared to ask my dad so i try to fix it my self so i sit for days trying to fix my problem. Untill i get the courage to ask.. I sit and watch hi do iit because i dont trust him and i feel like breaking down and crying while he is fixing it.Even though i have no contact with my ex im just so scared of my parents. Ive had a experiences of nearly throwing up because im so anxious. I'll always had this hatered towards my dad , i dont remember all the details from last two years because it just fucked me up.

 Ive tried to ask for therapy but my mom doesntt think i need it and she wants to know why but i cant tell her cause i dont trust her as much. I trust my mom more than my dad. Even if she let me go she said i can only go to a lady at the ""church who does therapy"". Look i dont want that because i dont want them saying stuff about the bible saying ""Oh the bibles says you cant do this blah blah blah"" im kinda unsure if im christan at the moment. But like i want to talk to someone who can get me and not just say stuff about the bible saying it wrong.

First of all this community is incredible. I can't express this enough. I'm so thankful to be able to witness all your courage in your experiences and also feel seen. Your posts have helped me so much. 

tl;dr: Long contextual piece of my experience with my nMom. nMom is far away yet imminent to return, I'm going back to panic moments and even though I know what to do, I'm dreading it.  

This is so long, I'm sorry.   
  
Context: my nMom (non-diagnosed) was diagnosed with OCD when she was younger. She has had a terrible life with a lot of trauma: her dad died when she was a baby, grew up in a financially stressful environment with a detached Mom who had a golden child (her sister), later her husband/my father dies in a traumatic way (I witnessed it), remarried into a toxic marriage and divorced, had boyfriends that were pathological liars and lastly had to deal with a friend's suicide.   
  
My Mother does not know how to regulate her emotions (very much aligned with her OCD diagnosis), she obsesses over people (when in a relationship, with her partner, when not, with me). She does not know how to argue, a simple question or breeze can trigger her into a huge argument with suicide threats, packing bags, fatalist cutting ties, screams, and her favorite: public scenes. Some of those arguments would end up with her physically threatening the other person (even tho not hitting or anything), kicking the person out of the car/house, or putting herself in the way so that if you bump her she would accuse her of physical abuse. When she perceived that she was in the wrong or ""losing the fight"", she would often pretend to feel faint or that she would vomit or use the emotional blackmail card ""please, lets stop this, for papa"" or ""I am not well and this is making me worse"".  I witnessed in more than one occasions huge fights she would have with spouse/bf in which she would not let go, she would persistently call, message and most of the times drive up to wherever they would possibly be, or search for them in local cafés etc. I knew at the time this wasnt normal. I have a very vivid memory, of when I was 9-10, that my mom had an argument with my stepdad (because she was ""going out with a friend"") and she ended up taking me with her. She left me in the car, in a parking lot alone (this was during the night) and got into a nearby parked car, that I then went up to and saw her making out with another man. When she saw me knocking on the window she even cracked a joke. At that time the image of my Mom broke entirely for me. I was so disappointed but I could never say anything to her or she'd argue with me. My Gran lived with us 6 months every year (she would spend the other 6 with my mom's sister) which -as you can expect - created a very toxic environment. She was great to me, she was my fav grandmother, but the arguments between her and my Mom were very hardcore and sometimes got physical. So, fighting, insulting, guilt tripping, suicide threats, abandonment threats were part of my daily life as a kid (and as a young adult).  
  
My mom has been on anti-depressants for over 30 years. She uses her trauma (and mine ""my daughter's car accident severe injury really traumatized me"" lol) to put her emotional wellbeing over anyone's and - aligning with public scenes and recurrent arguments with strangers - she expects people to go out of their way to help her, manage her problems and do things for her. If they dont do it they are labelled as bad people. Her narrative is ""I've been through A and B, I am not well, do you want me to burn out/feel sick/collapse?"". I grew up with this. And now, at 37, I see that things like my proactiveness, my sense of humour, my need to please, my ""I'm fine"" even if I'm bleeding, all comes from a kid just trying to try to make everything ok for a bit, trying to make my mom feel better, trying to make our situation easier.    
  
She managed our finances terribly, spent way over what we could afford, so I do not remember a time in which we weren't struggling, in debt, frozen accounts or having to ask someone for money. My college loan was totally used to pay her debt (I payed off that loan with my first real corporate job). Before my 20s I started getting shitty jobs, sell things that were really valuable to me to help us with basic financial needs, but my mom would just rely on another credit or another loan from a family member, even after I gave her my low salaries in full. She would give money to her boyfriends (because they were also always financially unstable), money that we needed to eat and pay bills. 

Focusing on our relationship, my mother seemed to be a great friend/partner, when I was younger she would give me the space to confide in her with my concerns and she would support me in whatever I would be doing. I believe that at that time, she probably did care for my wellbeing - somewhat, until she used my personal stuff to hurt me during arguments. She would constantly argue with me and I had to walk on eggshells around her, specially when i moved out. After I moved out I HAD to reply to her messages, calls etc, otherwise she would call me consecutively (the record was 43 times in 40 min), if I did not reply she would drive up to my house uninvited, hysterically accusing me (public scene again) that I was always causing her a lot of stress by not replying. I had to reply and check-in constantly otherwise she would call my friends, my boyfriend and my friends parents. This would escalate if she was single at the time. Even though my mom seemed to celebrate my achievements, she would always mention loud and clear in front of whoever ""who did you learn it from"", ""just like Momma"" or ""I guess you learned that from your Mom, eh?"". My style, my tastes, my preferences are - in her narrative - things I like because she influenced me OR if she does not like them ""just to go against what she likes because I like to provoke her"". It is as if I do not have a personality, I'm just an extension of her. In social events she never asks other people questions but constantly tells the tales of her traumas and if super friendly and polite to whoever is around. People generally find my Mom super interesting and friendly. My Mom cut out all her friends, because ""I don't identify with them"". 

She does not respect boundaries, even throughout the years when I would say ""lets stop to calm down"" or say ""no"" to something. She would never respect it and guilt trip me into doing what she wanted. Now, she's in her mid 60s. After selling our house she managed to pay X debt with it, but still had Y in debt (I was shocked with the amount). Even though she and I quote ""I'm happy to start fresh and learn from my mistakes"", she managed to spend all of her money in frugalities she cannot afford, recurrently asking me for help with bills that, respectefully, she would pay off with her next paycheck and create another hole. At this time she had a great salary, but spent 70% of it on stuff for ""new business ideas"" or coffee shop pastries and stuff she didnt need. She decided to start a new business and I would recurrently argue with her because she would buy +k in stock without a plan, so - once again - I stepped in and created everything for her: the website, the socials, the business plan, even though, at the time, I was very close to burn out from job, and she knew it. She just needed to network and sell. She didnt. She sold 2 items in 5 years. She claimed she was exhausted and didnt know how to use the tools and technology. Just to be clear, she established her own company (corporate), used software and tech recurrently and - ironically - purchased all the stock online using different payment methods. I did it either way, I was guilt tripped into doing it, once again. I resented her constantly, and my bf would remind me that I needed to say no to her and rest, but she would insist and manipulate the helpful side/I need to help out of me ""oh sure honey you are so tired, you need to rest. Oh I've tried to create a campaign but I'm not as creative and fast as you so I'm not sure it will work, but nevermind that, we can see it later"". Sometimes I still think she did things with very low effort or wrong, just so she could get me to do them.

Around this time, I reached a breaking point and I understood I urgently needed to limit how my Mom dealt with me. She didnt take my limits well. So we argued constantly until, one day, she got into her car and appeared at our house (my bf and mine) during the night to demand answers. Rang the bell constantly and not would leave. My bf already had seen us argue and was already shocked, but, for the first time, when this happened he said ""this is were I draw the line with your Mom"". He comes from a healthy family environment. They care and love and speak about what troubles them, they do not argue. I went down the elevator, and led her to her car while she screamed in tears in repeat that she needed to hear that I loved her. This was highly traumatizing for me. I felt I was dealing with a stalker. It was sick and very scary. The next day I called her and said I needed space from her from some time and all the guilt tripping got worse in just that call. She, once again, insulted my in-laws (she's always been super jealous), my bf (that he should have opened the door to her, his behaviour was inexcusable and she was so disappointed), my friends and implied I was a bad person. OK. I stood my ground. She sought therapy and I later found out that she would delete her most vile messages in our text arguments and just show those messages to her therapist. Also, she would speak badly about me to neighbours and random people she met in coffee shops etc, acting like I had abandoned her. I found out because it seemed strange to me she would delete messages and - during an argument - she literally used one of her neighbours opinions to validate that I was being terrible to her. 

From that time on I feel very hurt and setback. I cant talk to her without dreading it. I don't trust her. I started therapy and archived and muted all her comms because they trigger me to a full panic. In the meantime she was laid off and was diagnosed with a burn out. She was medicated and also put the employer in court and lost, and spent all her savings - which I managed to avoid her from hysterically purchasing frugalities. This was the perfect scenario for her to drain me even more. Eventually, the money ran out and I couldn't/didnt want to support her, because she would spend my savings on shit so she mentioned her/our aunt said she could stay there for a while - this is in a different country (it seemed like a temporary relief for me). She made the decision to go and I helped: I paid for her tickets, paid for her storage room, paid for the movers and also took a day off of work to also move stuff into my storage, paid for a night in an hotel and got her assistance during her flight. I also helped her finalize existing contracts (I was her guarantor in her rental contract (I know, the risk). Since she's been there, the goal was to get better and find a job. Surprise, she didnt and keeps using the ""oh I cant use the internet for too long"" or ""i dont know how to use job sites"" excuses. 

She is now functional - went to another doctor there - and says she has been reading about toxic people and she wants us to be better. I asked her for a normal relationship of mother and daughter, in which I was the daughter, not her. She said she agreed and respected - for a while - not to overwhelm me with text messages, calls, etc. This was an illusion of course, she didnt change, she's just saying what i want to hear to get me to do things. I am still dealing with her affairs here, as a favor, yet she continues to accuse me of abandoning her because she wants me to tell her to live with us. She has no money, no house and, once again, expects me to solve everything. Now, one of her affairs in which she can get financial support, may require her to be present physically and I am already returning to panic patterns and ripping my hair out, from stress. I will never allow her to live with me, even if I become the villain in her story. I know she's been bad mouthing me to extended family and I dont give a shit. She will not live with us. It will destroy my relationship and my wellbeing, she would never leave. I recently found out - in one of her  ""I'm getting better moments"" that her psych diagnosed her with a disorder in the bipolar spectrum. She says she does not agree with that diagnosis

I'm so tired that I don't get to just have peace and that she doesn't listen to my boundaries and just deal with her own life. I'm so so tired. I just want her to leave me alone and I want the guilt to just stop.

I know I need to cut her out, otherwise I'll go crazy, but the drama that entails and the guilt I feel constantly sets me back from that decision. I'm afraid of what she may do, she knows my address but fortunately does not have my key. I hate living like this, with constant dread.

Sorry for the long text, I'm struggling with the guilt and I'm scared.I know there are horrible abuse situations and I feel like sometimes I need to get a grip, but today was not great and I needed to unload to see if it would help clear my mind, even for a little bit.  


Thanks

I also have a 4 year old girl who is very sweet but doesn't really like her brothers because they are admittedly difficult to be with at times.

Every mass is spent whisper yelling at kids to leave each other alone.

Trying to speak to fellow parishioners or our priest afterwards (today was coffee & donuts) is humiliating because my kids are SO interrupty and impatient.

I have no idea where the disabilities end and run of the mill disobedience begins. It's really hard to react when I don't know if they *can't* or *won't* behave.

I'm also getting increasingly bitter because we've now had to quit 3 different catholic schools because they say they can accommodate learning differences but in practice it just never works. We just quit a Chesterton Academy and my teens are devastated that they couldn't succeed. They loved it, they were just failing their classes. 😔We were promised a max of 1.5 hours of homework per night. Try 3- 4 hours. The workload was more than I ever had in high school, college or grad school. I don't know who these magical students are that can handle 8 college level classes at age 14 but mine most definitely can't.

Sometimes I feel like there is no place for us.  I get back home each week feeling like I've run a marathon and dreading the next time.

1gdhqvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1gdhqvs/hnwi_in_the_uk_do_you_feel_your_health_takes_a/,HNWI in the UK: Do You Feel Your Health Takes a Backseat While Traveling?,"Hello All,

Edit: Please forget the HNWI tag's. Just looking for people that travel 5\* often. Also, seems lots of people thinking I hyper fixate on a lot of the below. The simple swaps in lifestyle are quick, and usually related to something I do excessively. Like coffee and tea, I might have 10 cups a day haha! I'm not a tinfoil quack, just with a little planning, environments can be substantially healthier. For summary for anyone interest in the same things. This sub will just question your mental health. I guess the only way to enjoy life is by breathing shitty air and drinking ;).

One trend I’ve noticed is that while we take our health seriously at home—investing in organic foods, air purifiers, product choices (e.g., YUKA app), etc.—this often goes out the window when we’re traveling.

For example, I drink organic, mycotoxin-tested coffee at home to avoid the jitters and heavy metals and stick to white tea from Japan due to its lower metal levels compared to similar teas from other regions. But once on the road, I find myself facing a completely different quality: jittery coffee, processed teas, and limited choices.  (For those thinking I'm over reacting about the coffee, if you get ""caffeine jitters"" I urge you to go smash 4/5 cups of high caffeine mycotoxin tested coffee. You'll realize your problem isn't with caffine..

Recently, I stayed at an Intercontinental in Singapore, where the heavy scent and cleaning chemicals in my room affected my breathing. Although they graciously upgraded me to a larger suite, where the air quality was slightly better. The put in an air purifier that still read ""poor."". (Edit: Just to clarify, the first room air quality wasn't poor like it smelled a bit funky, it was poor as in our eyes were streaming and you could hardly breath. It was BAD).

This makes me wonder: in a 5-star setting, is it too much to expect hotels to prioritize our health? Not only us, but that staff that work there. Should top-tier providers take more active steps to ensure wellness-focused choices, or is this simply unrealistic given budget constraints? I'm not asking for the entire thing to be overhaled, but maybe the Hepa filter in the AC changed once in a while, the AQI monitored to be in normal living ranges? Not asking for a vacuum chambre here.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this balance between luxury and wellness when traveling.",0,1730053902.0,HENRYUK,27,0.17,False

# David nodded, his throat dry. He knew he should be ashamed, but the hunger within him was too potent to ignore. As they stepped out into the crisp morning air, the scent of pine and wet earth filled his lungs. The village was quiet, the only sounds the distant call of a bird and the occasional rustle of leaves.

#  

# Their search led them through the winding paths of the forest that surrounded the village, the same paths they had taken countless times as kids. The trees towered above them, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. Jane was ahead of him, her wet hair sticking to the back of her neck, her breath coming in quick gasps as she called Max's name.

#  

# As they emerged from the dense foliage, a neat cottage came into view. It was a stark contrast to the rustic homes of the village, with its pristine white paint and perfectly manicured garden. The cottage belonged to Tania, their new school teacher, a transplant from the urban sprawl beyond the mountains. She was a doll of a woman, a blonde with a certain style that was unmatched in the village. Everyone loved her, not just for her beauty but for the way she brought a touch of sophistication and charm to their lives.

#  

# Jane's eyes lit up at the sight of the cottage. ""Maybe Tania has seen Max,"" she exclaimed, hope rekindling in her voice

# David followed her lead. The neatness of the cottage was a stark contrast to the wildness of the surrounding forest, a beacon of order in a world that suddenly felt chaotic. They approached the gate, and Jane called out, ""Tania! Are you home?""

#  

# The sound of their voices echoed through the quiet, and a moment later, the cottage door swung open. Tania stepped out, her blonde hair framing her delicate features, dressed in a simple yet elegant sundress that accentuated her figure. ""Jane? David?"" she said, her voice a melodious surprise. ""What on earth are you two doing here?""

#  

# Tania's eyes widened when she took in their disheveled appearances, her gaze flickering with concern. ""Is everything okay?"" she asked, her cute button nose scrunching up with worry.

#  

# Jane's voice was tight with emotion as she explained about Max's disappearance. ""We're just trying to find him,"" she said, her eyes pleading. ""Do you think he might have come here?""

#  

# Tania's cute features softened with empathy, her pink lips forming a gentle pout. She had the kind of face that could melt the most stoic of hearts, with high cheekbones and a small, upturned nose that gave her a perpetual look of innocence. Her eyes were a vibrant shade of green, the color of the forest in the height of summer, and they sparkled with intelligence and kindness.

#  

# ""Oh, you poor thing,"" she cooed, stepping closer to them. Her hand reached out to rest on Jane's shoulder, the touch comforting and warm. ""Come in, both of you. I'm sure Max can't be far. Have you checked everywhere?""

#  

# Jane's eyes searched Tania's, looking for any sign that she had seen the dog. ""We've looked everywhere,"" she said, her voice breaking slightly. ""But he's just...gone.""

#  

# ""Come inside,"" Tania urged, her voice a soothing balm to their worried minds.

#  

# The warmth of the cottage washed over them as they stepped inside, the scent of fresh flowers and baked cookies enveloping them in comfort. Tania led them to the cozy living room, where the sun streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow on the plush couches and the polished wood floors. She sat with them, her eyes filled with genuine concern.

#  

# ""Now, tell me everything,"" Tania said, her voice soothing as a lullaby. ""When did you last see Max?""

#  

# ""

#  

# Last night, Max was right beside my bed when I fell asleep,"" Jane began, her voice filled with the ache of loss. ""He always sleeps with me, but when I woke up this morning, he was gone. His bed was cold, like he hadn't been there at all.""

#  

# Tania's hand tightened on Jane's shoulder, her eyes filled with understanding. ""It must be so scary for you,"" she murmured, her voice a gentle caress. ""But we'll find him. I know he can't have gone far.""

#  

# The three of them sat in the cozy living room. The silence was filled with occasional sniffle from Jane. David felt his own anxiety growing with every passing moment, his mind racing with thoughts of what could have happened to Max. He knew how much the dog meant to Jane, and the idea of her living without him was unbearable.

#  

# ""Last night, Max was right beside my bed,"" Jane said, her voice cracking with emotion. ""He's always there, snoring lightly, keeping me company in the darkness. But when I woke up this morning, his side was cold, like he'd been gone for hours.""

#  

# Tania nodded, her expression thoughtful. ""Did you check for any evidence of him leaving?"" she asked, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for clues.

#  

# Jane sniffled and nodded. ""I checked the whole house. There was no sign of a break-in, no open windows. It's like he just vanished into thin air.""

#  

# David's gaze drifted to the floor, his mind racing. He knew the village well, every nook and cranny, every hiding place a mischievous dog could find. ""Could he have followed someone?"" he suggested, his voice tentative. ""Maybe he saw something interesting and just...took off?""

#  

# Jane nodded, wiping her nose with the back of her hand. ""Maybe,"" she said, her voice filled with hope. ""But who would be out so late?""

#  

# Tania tapped her finger against her porcelain teacup, lost in thought. ""Well, the village can get pretty wild at night,"" she said, a hint of mischief in her voice. ""You know, with the couples and all.""

#  

# Jane looked at her, hope sparking in her eyes. ""Do you think someone could have taken him?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

#  

# ""I don't know,"" Tania said, her voice gentle. ""But I'll help you look. Maybe together we can find him.""

#  

# Her eyes searched theirs, and David felt a strange pull towards her, a sense of comfort that was as unexpected as it was intense. ""Did you hear anything unusual last night?"" she asked Jane. ""Anything that could have spooked him?""

#  

# Jane shook her head, her eyes red and swollen from crying. ""No, it was quiet. Too quiet.""

#  

# Tania's eyes narrowed slightly, her thoughts racing. ""Well,"" she said, setting her teacup aside, ""we can't just sit here. Let's get organized. We need to spread the word, leave notes, and ask around. Maybe someone has seen him.""

#  

# Jane nodded, wiping her eyes. ""You're right. Thank you, Tania.""

#  

# Tania stood, her sundress fluttering around her toned legs. ""Don't thank me yet,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with determination. ""First, let's have a little something to warm us up before we go out into the cold."" She moved gracefully to the kitchen, her hips swaying gently.

#  

# Her beauty was undeniable, a siren's call wrapped in the guise of a small-town teacher. Her blonde hair fell in soft waves over her shoulders, framing a face that could make a saint reconsider their vows. Her skin was as smooth as the porcelain teacups she had served them tea in, and her body was a work of art—full breasts that bounced with every step, a narrow waist that cinched in dramatically, and hips that curved out in a way that made David's mouth go dry. Her legs went on forever, the muscles in her calves flexing as she moved. She was a vision, a glowing beacon of desire in a town that had been starved of excitement for too long.

#  

# Jane followed his gaze, and her eyes widened slightly when she caught him staring. She knew his type—the quiet ones always had a wild streak hidden beneath their stoic exteriors. She didn't blame him; Tania had that effect on people. But she also knew that her best friend was off-limits. She reached over and pinched David's hand, hard enough to make him jump.

#  

# ""Keep it in your pants, David,"" she hissed under her breath, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.

#  

# David jerked his gaze back to the kitchen, his cheeks burning. He cleared his throat, trying to push the thoughts of Tania's body out of his mind. ""Right,"" he murmured, standing up. ""We should get going.""

#  

# Tania emerged from the kitchen with a tray, her movements as elegant as a gazelle. On the tray were three steaming cups of tea, the amber liquid sending up delicate plumes of steam that curled around their faces as she set it down on the coffee table. The scent was comforting, a blend of mint and chamomile that promised warmth and calm.

#  

# ""Here,"" she said, her voice soft as a summer breeze, ""this will help.""

#  

# They took the tea gratefully, the warmth seeping through their bones. Tania had a way of making everything seem okay, of making the world feel a little less scary. Jane took a deep breath, the minty steam filling her nose. ""Thank you,"" she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.

#  

# They drank in silence, the warm liquid soothing their frazzled nerves. When the cups were empty, Tania clapped her hands together, her eyes gleaming with purpose. ""Alright, let's get going,"" she said, her voice firm and decisive.",1,1730053890.0,JinxStorypage,0,1.0,False
1gdhq2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gdhq2p/getting_into_espresso_at_home_under_1000/,Getting into Espresso at Home (Under $1000),"Hey everyone,

So I have been learning more about coffee over the years and I have decided I want to start getting into espresso at home. I am brand new to espresso and I want a set up that is good for a mix of straight espresso as well as milk drinks. With that I need to decide what grinder and what espresso maker I need so I can figure out how much I need to save up to get everything. Because this is my first set up I am looking for something that will work well for a beginner that isn't thousands of dollars (USD), but also last me a while before needing to upgrade. I am in the US. 

In terms of grinder, I was looking at the Baratza Encore ESP. I have read it works well and I kind of know what I am getting into because I have the regular Baratza Encore for my pour over stuff. However, if there are other recommendations for espresso specific grinder I am happy to have recommendations.

For the espresso maker, I have looked at manual presses like the Flair Neo Flex or Flair Pro 2. I have also looked at the Breville Bambino Plus as it seems pretty straight forward. I know the Gaggia Classic Pro is also good, but I have read a lot of reviews saying you need to make some modifications to make it work really well and I have no idea where to begin with that. I really just want a press or machine that will allow me to learn the nuances of espresso.

If anyone has good recommendations or suggestions please let me know. This is all new to me so I would love some guidance. Thanks! ",1,1730053846.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1gdhpzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdhpzn,AIO I’m kind of an asshole. 😅I don’t want to be the asshole anymore🥲 Am I actually the asshole tho?🫣,"Some context: I have two roommates. K is the roommate I’m having problems with. K let me and Julia move into her childhood home after her parents moved out of state. However, I have furnished the house common spaces (all the chairs and tables and couches are mine) Rent is pretty cheap for a three bedroom three bathroom house. However each of us have cats. So three cats total. Julia has her cat in her room. My cat chose the office since the rooms are so close together and she and Julia’s cat don’t get along. K’s cat walks around freely because he’s used to the house already. 

Issues: 
Cat care: I pay rent and utilities and signed a lease to live there and put down a pet deposit. But I don’t live there. I live with my boyfriend in a one bedroom apartment. My boyfriend is super allergic to cats and had a small dog. I’ve debated just bringing my cat to live in this one bedroom but it would be crowded and we’d have to separate the dog and the cat in a one bedroom apartment. So I go back and forth every other day to check on her clean her litter box, make sure she has food and water, give her some medication incase she needs it because she is 15 and getting old. I love this cat a lot and the fact I’m not there every single day to see how she is does make me extremely sad and feel like a bad mom. My boyfriend and I have talked about getting a two bedroom so she can come live with us.

Halloween party: essentially what happened was my friend MJ and I wanted to throw a joint birthday party again this time it was my turn to have it at my house. We went all out decorating. Different rooms had different horror movie themes. For example Carrie was in the dining room where we made fake blood with cocoa powder red dye and corn syrup and covered the tarped out walls. Or the well we made out of some bricks from the backyard for the Ring themed living room. The party guests however I had little to no say in because MJ felt it was easiest to invite the people she was friends with considering our friend groups are pretty much the same people. Then of course I told Julia and K to invite whoever they wanted. K ended up inviting 6-7 people and MJ ended up inviting over 20 people. However I invited only 2 other people. I ended up leaving because none of the people who were invited even knew it was my birthday after 12 or wished me a happy birthday. By no fault of there’s however because no one at that party really knew me or knew it was my birthday. So once my boyfriend got there we left. But before leaving my house full of strangers I told MJ I would come for her if she didn’t shut the party down when K asked. MJ ended up passing out for a second and K had to kick out some of MJs friends. I told K she didn’t have to lift a finger and I could go and kick everyone out but she said it was fine and they left. The next day my boyfriend and I went back and cleaned the whole house. Julia and I were debating throwing a Halloween party at the end of the month. So when K texted me asking me to get rid of the brick well in the living room I asked if we could please just leave it for the month of October and use it as a coffee table till Julia and I were sure we wouldn’t have another Halloween party. K also informed me that cocoa powder attracts bugs so the tarp wall in the dinning room had to go. I agreed to take down the tarps and came the very next morning. I found the well bricks had been put back in the backyard and the tarps had been taken down. So essentially K did it herself without telling me she would do it the same day she told me, and by herself. That was honestly ok with me, I would’ve felt better if she had just said something and let me do it myself like I said I was and intended to do.

Safety: 
We live in the nice part of town where many families have family homes and kids. We live on one of the outskirts of the main city yet it’s still well populated with other homes and is definitely a suburb neighborhood vibe. The house has two cameras, one facing the front door way and the street and the other facing the garage, yard gate, road and driveway. The windows stay locked usually. Julia left the garage open on accident once and K kinda freaked out but K constantly leaves the front door unlocked. Julia also spends a lot of time with her boyfriend and stays the night at his house often aswell. her cat stays at the house too because her boyfriend has a large dog however we have a gate keeping her cat only in her room because the cat doesn’t get along with the other cats. K often opens the gate and  will just leave the house sometimes. Julia is really annoyed that she keeps opening the gate. 

The reason I don’t enjoy staying at the house is because my boyfriend is allergic to cats. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, K is also very messy, every time I’m over there to check on my cat there are dirty bras and underwear all over my living room couch, toe nail clippers and toe nail clippings on my coffee table along with half drank cups and dirty plates. It makes me really sad knowing the common areas and my stuff is being used and abused. K also uses my clothes and hair tools and sometimes doesn’t even ask me or let me know. I told her she could use what she wanted of my personal stuff if she just asked and she still struggles to ask. SO am I the asshole. I know I am for not having my cat with me all the time. And not staying to shut down what was supposed to be my birthday party. But what would you do in this situation? How would you respond? 

Essentially this situation is K needed to watch her brothers house that’s in the same city for 3 days and asked Julia in advance but Julia forgot and scheduled a camping trip with her boyfriend so K asked me to watch the house for three days where she specifically says you have to stay all the nights there. I’m having some crazy medical issues however.",4,1730053840.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Conversation led to us ending up in my car which led to me receiving a blowjob. I felt everything went well including the conversation after where she mentioned casually its been a while enjoying the company of a man like me. I assumed she was speaking of race at first so I followed up and asked. She responded that it was not race but age, virility, and other physical attributes. 

We chatted for a little while after and went our separate ways. The next day I received a message on AM from her to check my email. It was a long message stating basically she thought I was one in a million and for that she knows it won’t work because I will end up hurting her in some way. Physically she was use to older gentlemen who “matched her pace”. Mentally I kept her wanting more she stated but in the end the thought of me not being satisfied with her was the reason to not move forward.

**HSTM-Part 28 'Rattling Cages'**

  
Paulie spent the majority of the next two days playing with the alien television and browsing the channels it had to offer.  He was impressed by the amount of media it seemed to give access to, seemingly having an infinite amount of movies, shows and musicals.  The latter he had found the most oddly appealing.  The strange coruscating harmonies and warbling tritones of the alien music at once hauntingly beautiful and jarringly complex.



He supposed that with ten thousand years of working on it, there must be an absolute glut of fundamental theory and music history to catch up on.  And he was willing to sit there all day long just browsing the tube as one might have said when the door knocked loudly.



Paulie grunted in mild annoyance and spoke, “TV, Pause.  Bookmark program and standby.”  It did as he had ordered and then the screen turned a dark green as it went into low power mode.



He pushed himself up to his feet and nodded with a wide yawn.  “I'm on my way, who’s there?”



A voice answered and he moved to grab the door, “It’s Mack, let me in already will ya?”



Paulie walked tiredly over to the door, his feet dragging on the carpet.  He hadn’t been sleeping well and his diet had also been a bit on the less than fortunate side making him feel a little nauseous after a breakfast of strange greenish gummy fruits that hadn’t sat well with him.



He opened it and Mack pushed past him with a grateful nod and a glance back over his shoulder.  As he entered the center of the room he turned and Paulie was able to get a better look at the man.  He was surprised by what he saw.



Mack’s generally neat and tidy clothes were rumpled and creased.  His long greatcoat was stained with what he would have assumed was coffee if not for the alien surroundings around them.  Had the man possessed hair then it likely would have been mussy and unkempt too.  As it was, there was a wild gleam in the miriam’s large grey eyes as he nodded to Paulie and launched immediately into a tirade of words.



“It’s incredible really.  Paulie, it is everything I have been looking for for the past thirteen years of my investigation into the organised crime rings of Gike.  And here’s the kicker, it goes so much further than just this one planet..”  Paulie had to put up his hands to slow the man’s ranting.



“Hang on, hold on.. a little slower.  What are you talking about, Mack?“  He asked the overexcited alien detective.



Mack’s neck-spines chattered against each other as he shook his long neck and stepped towards Paulie imploringly.  “No, you need to listen.  You made this possible, you and that zen’kkalkian you talked about..”



“Krissh’shanibe.”  He prompted.  Mack nodded absentmindedly and Paulie ignored the man’s lack of apparent respect.  He was just excited and likely far too focused on his own discoveries to pay much attention to anything he was saying to him.



Mack waved both hands now, seemingly totally engrossed in his own narrative.  “You would not believe the information that I found on that data crystal.  Names, dates, locations.. it has everything I could have needed to pin the deeds directly on Ooounoo herself and put her away for good.  It took me almost a full day to decrypt it, but with some help from Flurn and Rozz I was able to crack it open like a gakk nut.  And oh the meat that I found inside.”  He chuckled, neck quills clattering together like dry bones.



Paulie nodded.  “Okay, that’s great.  So, when do we make a move on her ass?”



Mack lurched.  “Make a move?”  he asked.



Paulie nodded again, much more exaggeratedly this time.  “Yeah.  On.. her.. ass!”  He enunciated every syllable.



Mack turned away, his head motionless as his flexible neck didn’t move with his lower body.  Mack glanced at him and then towards the simulation screen that took up the majority of the far wall in the dimly lit room.  The alien man muttered angrily, “I can’t do anything.  Not yet anyways.”



Paulie stepped closer to the man who took a step back defensively as Paulie used his extra twenty-three centimeters of height to loom over the other man.  “What the hell do you mean you can’t?  Do all the innocent lives she and her criminal ilk have ruined mean so little to you?  You and your Greater Galactic Intercession may see us humans as dangerous savages, but I assure you.. nothing you have seen could possibly prepare you for just how savage we can be.”  he growled low in his chest as he said it, the anger and rage he had been suppressing for the last few days surfacing once again.



In the back of his mind he thought he heard a cackle and he had to shake his head to force the rage back down.  He straightened and saw Mack, the man was looking at Paulie with an expression somewhere between terrified awe and abject horror.



He raised a hand and tried to apologise as the man seemed to gurgle or cough.  “Oh, shit.. sorry Mack.  I-I don’t know what came over me there.  I just got so angry..”  He stopped as he realised that the other man was actually starting to laugh.  The sounds he had initially mistaken for fear were actually pained amusement.



Mack leaned forwards on his longer front legs for a moment, his stubbier rear legs taking up the slack as he tried to regain his composure.  “It’s okay Paulie.  I can understand a little of what you may be feeling at least, I am just thinking of how much trouble Ooounoo and her criminal underlings are in once we get the okay to go ahead on her.”  Paulie cocked his head and laughed a little cautiously along with the detective.



Mack wiped an eye with his sleeve.  “But seriously, you about made me lay an egg, and I'm not even going to get into the impossibilities of that.  No, before I can get any kind of task force put together I am going to need to run things by my superior, Major Alloen Mauk.  And he isn't exactly well known for his love of efficiency.  Damn bureaucrats.”  He muttered it again, and not for the first time that Paulie had noticed.



No, it seemed like anything that was going to happen was going to be awhile.  He shrugged and took a few steps towards the kitchen.  “Okay, well I guess you have done all you can up till this point.  Would you like a cup of iced frubble juice?  A slushice maybe?  Jakiikii showed me how to use the acoustic emulsifier.  It’s a pretty nifty little..”  Mack interrupted his speech with a waved gesture.



“No.. no.  I have to be going again, I am sorry to just drop in on you like this unannounced, but I was just too excited and needed to tell somebody I trust.”  Mack paused as Paulie frowned.



“What, you don’t trust your mates over at the complex?”



He surprised Paulie by shaking his bald head.  Large grey eyes seeming to bore into Paulie’s own.  “No.  I don’t.  There is a leak at the complex, somebody on the inside close to me has been feeding Ooounoo and her affiliates information for years.  And I think I might know who it is.”  he frowned, his thin lipless mouth becoming a nearly indistinguishable line of his smooth nearly featureless face.



Paulie shrugged.  “Okay, but I did have another question for you.”  Mack’s head rose a little, the man turning to face him with his arms folded across his chest.  “I was wondering if I could get another change of clothes, maybe a different color this time too.  I just feel a little icky wearing the same clothes for multiple days in a row.  Also, where do I wash the one’s I am wearing?  I rinsed em off in the sink yesterday and then dried them in the shower.  But I can only do that so many times before people start to notice.”



Mack smiled a little at that.  The mundane worries of the common man working to ease his own anxious mind.  “Well, that I can certainly take care of for you.  There should be an autocleaner for the clothes in the bathroom, on the wall next to the back wall.  It will look like a marked panel, but you can’t read yuuvian so it would not have stood out to you.  How many changes do you want, and is there anything you want to have changed or added to them?”  Paulie shook his head and glanced at the carpet.



“No, nothing I can think of now.”  He paused, wanting to ask Mack another question but not sure where to start.  He held up a hand as Mack took a step towards the doorway.  “Wait!  Mack.”



Mack stopped, “What?  What is it?”



Paulie shuffled a little, his bare feet tapping on the carpeted floor as he tried to think of the best way to word it.  Finally he spoke, “Well.  I have been taking this whole time I have been here.  And I am certain your society is not one where all is freely given, so I have to wonder.. who is paying for it all?”



Mack shook his head.  “You really are not a dullard.  Yes, there is a cost being incurred by your storage and feeding.  It is a price I am gladly paying for the information you have given me Paulie.  You don’t have to worry about me charging you rent, not for another month at least.  Then eight-hundred osmir a month outta-bout to cover the cost of your room and board.”  He chuckled.



Mack seemed satisfied with his answer and turned towards the door once more but again Paulie stopped him with a new idea.  “Well, I was thinking.  What if you didn’t have to, you know?”  Mack’s head cocked in an interested manner, eyelids fluttering slightly as his sensory spines chattered.  “I could get a job maybe.”



Mack straightened and was silent.  He was silent for a little longer than was strictly comfortable.  “Doing what?  Flipping khiis patties on the corner?  Not likely that you would find anything suitable given your.. unique native condition.”



Paulie took a step closer, “No, I was thinking maybe I could come and work for you?  You know, at the complex.  Doing detective stuff!” he finished excitedly.



“Paulie.  As much as that would be the talk of the market, I don’t think that is a very good idea.  I will certainly keep you in the loop on this investigation, but as for you joining the force.  No, I don’t see that happening.”  Mack said it bluntly, just the way it was in his eyes.  But Paulie was less convinced.



He argued his case, plead it as best he was able.  “Oh, come on Mack.  You could use an apocalypser as you guys have been calling me.  Just do it like you did for Jakiikii…”  he didn’t get to finish that statement as Mack moved so fast he barely noticed it.



Before he could truly process what had happened he felt cold steel pressed against his jugular, just under his chin.  It was a small pistol-sized weapon that Mack had produced from somewhere inside of his jacket without Paulie even having seen it.



“What did you say?!  What do you know about Jakiikii?  Who told you that she is doing work for me specifically!”  Mack spat, his eyes once more a little wild and his movements jerky.



Paulie raised his hands high as he stood as still as he could, “Whoa!  Hey, no need for that!”



Mack stared at him, eyes a little wild and his neck craned to stare directly into Paulie’s face.  “Who.  Told.  You.  That?”  He said, dangerously quiet.



Paulie swallowed loudly, eyes fixed on the man’s rage filled features while the gun pressed ever closer to his jaw.  He was sure that the man would be capable of pulling the trigger before Paulie could do anything to extricate himself from the situation, the man had consistently showed that his reflexes were faster than the average alien’s seemed to be.



Paulie spoke slowly so as not to cause alarm.  “She told me herself the other day.  We went on the roof and she told me about her childhood or whatever and how you had rescued her from imprisonment.  I haven’t talked to anyone but her, you and Flurn for the entire time I have been here man!”  He cried out, a little distressed given the current change in the room's mood.



Paulie saw the other man tense, and he cringed a little more.  Was this how he was going to die?  He had suffered all that he had been through, just to die put down like a rabid dog at the hands of a sleep deprived madman?



It seemed not to be as Mack nodded slightly and pulled the gun away from Paulie’s jugular making him stumble back a bit and suck in a tremendous breath he hadn't realised he had needed.  Paulie breathed heavily and then looked at Mack who was still warilly holding the gun to his side.



“What the fuck was that about, Mack!?  All I did was say..”  Mack threw up an arm for him to be silent.  And Paulie shut his mouth with a snap.



Mack seemed to look around and shook his head as he replaced the gun into a shoulder holster that Paulie had not noticed he wore.  “This is neither the time nor the place.  I WILL be discussing this with Jakiikii.  And if her story deviates from yours in any way at all, then I will be back.  And you will explain to me who you got your information from.”  He turned back towards the door and stepped towards it before stopping.  He looked back at Paulie and shook his head slightly.  “You can’t ever be too careful nowdays, there are some dark times coming Paulie.  I recommend that you learn to defend yourself, I may not always be around to do it for you.”



And with that the man opened the door and left.  Leaving Paulie feeling flustered and more than a little agitated.  What had that been about, Paulie had never seen Mack act like that before.  There was more between Mack and Jakiikii than simple mentorship.  That was for sure.



He rubbed at his throat, the phantom feeling of cold hard steel pressing into it wouldn't go away.  He decided to make something to eat to take his mind off of things, and to help him think.  Mack had been right about one thing for sure though.  Paulie needed to learn to take care of himself instead of always waiting for others to do it for him.",16,1730053312.0,HFY,3,0.94,False

Or are there specific shortcomings of either that are red/yellow flags for you that would make you consider the other one?

After a lot of soul searching my main requirements are GBW, and I would like the option to swap burrs if at some point in the future I felt like it. I do not switch between coffees often, and if I did, I could always use the 1zspresso hand grinder I’ve been using for the past 3 or 5 years. This would probably be for 2-4 drinks per day with maybe up to 10 or 15 during parties (maybe more with some espresso martinis in the mix). I primarily use a local roaster, Trax’s Guatemala Heuheutenango, a medium roast but will mix it up with other bags here and there. It may be that I don’t actually know what good coffee is, but I really really like this roast. Highly recommend it to anyone in the NYC/Hudson Valley area. DeCicco’s carries it if you’re interested. 

Anyway, which would you recommend, or alternative if there is another GBW option I should be considering at roughly this price point? I’d especially love to hear from any owners of either about pain points you’ve experienced. Thank you so much! ",1,1730053264.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So confused!,"I get a (hot) grande blonde vanilla latte with oatmilk.  It's a nice drink, sweet, but not too sweet.  I have no idea how many pumps of vanilla is normal.  I just order it standard, normally it is awesome.

Sometimes when I order my drink, I take a sip and it just tastes like coffee so I assume the barista forgot the syrup.  I tell the barista I think they forgot the vanilla syrup and they remake it, all is well.

Today I get my usual order and it tastes sorta kinda sweet like they didn't totally forget the syrup but it's less than normal.  So I ask the barista and she said the drink is correct but they changed the recipe and it's less pumps now.  Apparently if I want extra pumps I can pay for them.  She said she could remake the drink... but that she would just remake it again with the same amount of pumps so it would just taste the same.  (She wasn't going to remake my drink and add extra syrup for free.)  But I don't know how she would even ring up an order for just a pump of syrup by itself in order to fix my drink, so I shrugged and left quietly.

It seems like a hill Starbucks wants to die on?  I'm not fully blaming the barista as I get the sense that she was told to charge for extra pumps and would probably get in trouble for adding free syrup to my drink?  But it definitely was not good, I went home and added some sugar to it to make it better.  But it sucks and I have no idea what I even should order now to get the drink that I want.

I contacted Starbucks corporate and they said the recipe has changed.  But they would not tell me how many pumps used to be for a grande and what it is now.  They were very vague and just told me to contact the store manager for the recipe?  Super weird.  And they didn't give me a refund or points to make up for it.  They just said go back to the store and get a remake if I was unhappy.",13,1730053193.0,starbucks,37,0.88,False

1gdhg8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1gdhg8x/msc_world_europa_yacht_club_october_2024/,MSC World Europa Yacht Club -October 2024," 
We just returned from a seven day Mediterranean cruise from Barcelona and here is my honest opinion. I was never a big cruise person, so my experience in this area is limited to two prior cruises. This was our first MSC cruise so we didn’t really know what to expect. Based on other cruisers’ experience, we opted for a Yacht Club category cabin. The embarkation was smooth and easy. We showed up at the YC tent in the MSC cruise port in Barcelona, dropped our luggage and were escorted to the YC lounge where we waited for about ten minutes. Our butler met us at the lounge and walked us onto the ship and into the Top Sailors lounge reserved for YC members only. The entire WE ship was spacious, beautifully designed and extremely clean and beautiful. The YC area was elegant and very relaxing. Our suite was ready in about twenty minutes and the luggage was delivered to the cabin in about thirty minutes. Our cabin was spacious and comfortable and I especially enjoyed the extra space for clothing and in the bathroom/shower area. The bed was very comfortable and there was a pillow menu available upon request. Our butler was always available when we needed him via phone or What’sUp. We ordered room service a handful of times and the food was always delivered within thirty minutes. The food was really good in every restaurant, especially all YC restaurants. We also had one dinner at Chef’s Garden Kitchen at an extra cost and it was amazing. We didn’t try the buffet so I can’t say anything about the food being served there. Every person we had a contact with was friendly, professional and very polite. Here are the ports we stopped at and our favorite experiences:
-Marseille was our least favorite experience mostly because of how we were treated by the waiters at the Le Miramar restaurant on the pier (the waiter mocked our French to his coworkers thinking we didn’t understand him standing next to our table). We did enjoy the food though. The next time we will stay on the ship and skip this port altogether. 
-Genoa was great-we rented a taxi in the port and for 70 euros per person, they took us to  Santa Margherita for a coffee and pastries stop and then to Portofino for three hours to walk around, do some shopping and have lunch. The ride back to the ship was about 45 minutes. 
-Naples was our next port, so we walked out of the ship and hired another taxi to Positano and Amalfi. We spent one hour in each town and it was perfect.  The ride from Naples to the Amalfi Coast was over one hour each way but it was perfect. The cost of that ride was about 60 euros per person. 
-In Messina, we walked out of the ship into town, walked around for about one hour and took a taxi to Taormina. It was a lovely experience walking around, eating gelato and shopping for souvenirs. I believe the cost was about  40 euros per person round trip. 
-Malta was absolutely amazing.  We bought tickets for the sightseeing tour (hop on hop off bus) for 20 euros per person and rode the bus across the island (blue route and yellow route). We stopped in Mdina and got off the bus to walk around, take pictures, get some coffee and try local pastries; we also bought some gifts from local boutiques. 

Overall, we loved every experience with the exception of Marseille. We found MSC to be a great cruise line and will definitely return for another Yacht Club experience. I have to add that while the Yacht Club area was quiet and serene, the rest of the ship was extremely crowded at all times. Having stated this, the service was still fast, efficient and amazing. We travelled with our friends who sailed in the non YC category so we had several dinners with them in the non YC restaurants, we found the food in Les Dunes to be great quality and good taste. We visited the spa area as well and liked having access to different treatment rooms (sauna, spa, etc.) this area was pretty crowded as well, so we only used it once. 
When we arrived back to Barcelona on the last day, they instructed us to leave our cabin by 8 am and our luggage had to be left outside our cabin door the night before by 1 am. We had breakfast in the YC restaurant and our butler walked us out of the ship to the luggage area at 8:30 am. 
Big shout out to our favorite service staff:

I am friends with an introvert and feel like I often annoy them as I text them a few times a week and I am very open about my feelings. And as an introvert, they are not. I alot and they are more serious and stoic. 

They don't say much over text but still meet for coffee etc. They talk more face to face. 

Another mate said I am ""too deep"" and my Husband said I worry too much.

Just wondering if anyone had any friendship tips? I get very excited about getting to know people. 

Like if my friends are sad, I'll get them a coffee or sweets. One time my friend I work with said ""no more sweets"" 🫠. I know they probably thought I was annoying but I gave them sweets a few times when they had a hectic day. 

I feel like I am too intense. I just want to spread joy and sometimes I guess I am too intense and ""too much"". So this makes me feel bad about myself and hate myself. 

And then I get into the cycle of ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable"" and that weirds people out even more.

Do I have to surpress my personality?

Thank you.

[Well of Ascension AND Words of Radiance] >!Shallan's father, Lin Davar, is theorized to Philen ""Lin"" Frandeau, a Scadrian!<.

Putting this all together and stirring with a tinfoil spoon:

[All cosmere][yes, all of it]>!A Kandra, in the form of a human woman, comes to Roshar. Ishar makes a dagger out of a God-metal, probably Raysium. Ishar removes one of the Kandra's spikes. He then has Chanarach lay on top of the Kandra and uses the dagger to hemalurgically murderstab her. You've heard of Elf On A Shelf, now you have Chana In A Kandra. He removes the Kandra's other spike and replaces it with one made out of Koravellium. The Blessing of Cultivation allows this Fused Faceless/Herald to get pregnant. He then imports a Scadrian, perhaps for Connection to the Kandra, or perhaps just because he's a *skaa* and a Ghostblood and so will endure a *legendarily* unhappy marriage if The Survivor orders him to do so. This results in several offspring, including: Shallan.!<

So if you would please include the possible best setup for this budget,  I'll buy you a coffee  :)  ",2,1730052788.0,HeadphoneAdvice,2,1.0,False

Now though we are at the point where we're both sick of having to hand grind beans (especially for espresso) my partner really stuggles and it can take her a really long time to grinder her coffee in the morning when she's just got up. So we've decided it's time to upgrade to a motor. The problem is we just can't decide what the heck to order as we would like a grinder that's going to be an upgrade to the esp in cup quality as well as the obvious work flow improvements. 

We've narrowed it down to 

the df54-budget option

the df64 v2 -nice middle ground least favourite aesthetically but  seems like a good option if we wanted to change burrs in the future

The timemore 64s - joint most expensive with the niche zero but we like how it looks the most and  I've heard/read its quite good at filter (I like my light roast pour overs) I think would love to hear people's opinions on this 

The niche zero - same price as the timemore also like the look and is the forerunner at this kinda price point but I've heard may not be the best for the lighter roasts 

Opinions suggestions I've been researching and lurking for a good few months and with no way to try before we buy to compare to the c3 esp against our 4 options we're just kinda lost ",2,1730052761.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
