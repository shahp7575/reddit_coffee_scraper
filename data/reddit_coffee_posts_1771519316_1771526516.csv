Is this the best method to infuse it with Coffee or has anyone a better idea or method? 

Also how much Coffee and how strong should coffee be?

My sister is moving in with her partner in June, so a space is opening up in the sweet, cat-friendly 2bed 2bath she and I share! The house is located a few blocks from Tower Grove Park, with in-unit washer and dryer, updated kitchen appliances, a fenced in back yard, space to garden, a large basement (used for storage but the folks before us used it for an art and workout space so you could do whatever with it), and a pretty chill and responsive social worker landlord. 



🏡The room itself is carpeted, with a full private bathroom, private entrance and your own small porch, private entry into the basement, and an off street parking space. You are welcome to start moving belongings into the basement or shared spaces starting in early/mid-June after you've signed the lease🏡



👩 I am a 29-year-old barista and research intern for a non-profit. I’m looking for a mid-20s or older female roommate. My sweet older cat Margot and I are very chill, and I am looking for a lowkey, tidy roommate👩



The shared spaces (kitchen and living room) are furnished, but most of it is just stuff my sister was planning to leave, so if you want to have your own couch, kitchen table, chairs, lamps, coffee table, etc., we can get rid of her stuff easily before she moves. 



Utilities include wifi, electric, gas, and compost and is average $150 (usually spring and fall utilities are very cheap, it's peak summer and winter that run up the average). Water and trash is \~$60 every three months.",1,1771526428.0,StLouisMarketplace,0,1.0,False

I’m posting this because I finally had a ""come to Jesus"" moment with my workspace today. For months, I’ve been struggling with shaky flourishes and inconsistent ink flow, and I kept blaming my nibs, my paper, or my ""off days."" Then today, I accidentally knocked a bottle of walnut ink onto a set of envelopes I’d nearly finished, all because I was trying to work around a pile of unopened mail and three half-empty coffee mugs.



I realized I wasn't being a ""free-spirited artist."" I was just being a disaster.



The truth is, I’ve always been a bit of a slob at the bench. I thought ""true creatives"" worked in a whirlwind of scattered pens and ink splatters. But looking back at my worst projects, they all happened when I was literally cramped into a 6-inch square of space because the rest of my desk was covered in junk.



I’ve spent the last four hours stripping my desk down to the bare wood. I scrubbed off the dried ink crusts and finally organized my nibs by flex. It felt tedious, and honestly, I felt like I was wasting time I should have been spending practicing.



But then I sat down to do a simple drill. For the first time in weeks, my arm felt free. No hitting a stray stapler mid-stroke. No weird shadows from a poorly placed lamp.



I was looking at some of the professional engraving and lettering work on [bespokenj.in](http://bespokenj.in) earlier, and it hit me—you can actually see the physical space in the work. There’s a certain level of precision that you just can’t hit if you’re fighting your environment. The ""grit"" of this craft isn't just about the hours spent on the pen; it’s about the boring stuff, like keeping your light source consistent and your surface flat.



It’s not about having a ""pretty"" Instagram-worthy studio. It’s just about respect for the tools. When my nib is clean and my desk is clear, I’m not thinking about the mess; I’m actually just thinking about the letterforms.



I’m curious—do you guys have a ""ritual"" for resetting your space, or do you just power through the clutter until something breaks (or spills)? Am I the only one who didn't realize how much the physical mess was affecting my mental focus?",1,1771526353.0,bespokenji,0,1.0,False

You know those moments where you stare at code for hours, days even, and it just *doesn't make sense*? Yeah, I've been living that hell for the past week. We're talking a legacy system, built by ancient wizards who apparently coded in hieroglyphs, and a bug that only popped up under very specific, almost mystical conditions.

The task was simple on paper: a minor update to a reporting module. But as soon as I deployed it, reports started sporadically failing. Not all of them, just, like, 1 in 20. And the error? A generic `NullReferenceException` in a part of the code that hadn't been touched in years. My stomach just sank. I spent what felt like an eternity stepping through debugger lines, feeling the cold dread creep up my spine as everything looked perfectly fine, *every single time*.

I tried everything – logging, unit tests, prayer. My desk was a graveyard of empty coffee cups, and my eyes felt like sandpaper. The frustration was a physical weight, pressing down on me. I started questioning my sanity, convinced the bug was mocking me. The breakthrough finally came at 2 AM, fueled by cold pizza and pure stubbornness. I was tracing a data flow, completely by hand, on a whiteboard that looked like a crime scene, when a tiny, almost invisible detail jumped out.

It turned out, deep within a forgotten corner of the database, a `varchar` field was sometimes, *just sometimes*, storing an empty string instead of an actual `NULL` value. And the ancient code, bless its heart, was explicitly checking for `NULL`, but not for `''`. So, when that empty string came along, it happily passed the `NULL` check, only to explode spectacularly later when a function tried to operate on it as if it were valid data. The relief that washed over me was immense, like shedding a heavy, invisible cloak.

Fixing it was literally a one-line change: `if (value == null || value == """")`. One line, after days of agonizing, soul-crushing debugging. The sheer absurdity of it made me laugh, a slightly unhinged, exhausted laugh. My fingers were hovering over the keyboard, ready to commit that glorious, tiny fix.

Has anyone else ever spent an insane amount of time tracking down a bug that turned out to be something ridiculously simple? What was your most infuriating 'A-HA!' moment?",1,1771526342.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Someone has a birthday and there is cake.  Someone goes on a baking binge over the weekend and brings in cookies or something to share with the office because they don't want the temptation sitting around their house.  It's thoughtful.  It's wonderful.  There are also offices that provide free coffee and other drinks and snacks for the staff.  Packets of drink mixes like cocoa and air born to help ward off the spread of illness.  You get the idea. 

So- why is it that there is ALWAYS this one person that you never actually see that has to cut just a little piece of the cookie or donut off but leave the rest?  OR- they will open a packet of drink mix and then leave it sitting open on the counter as if they fully expect that someone else will actually want to consume their leftovers?

I’m 21M, studying computer engineering. I’m pretty serious about my goals — I don’t just want to work a 9–5 forever. I want to build something of my own in tech one day. Something real. That drive is a big part of who I am.

Outside of school, I’m really into staying active. I play different sports, train regularly, and I’m currently trying to bulk up and get stronger. I’ve been focusing a lot on self-growth lately — mentally and physically. Just trying to level up in every way.

When I’m not studying or working out, I’m probably reading (I’m really into history — I like understanding how everything became the way it is). I also love long conversations. The random ones that somehow turn deep. The 1 a.m. talks about life, the future, dumb theories, all of it.

I’ve been in a serious relationship before. I took time to focus on myself after that, and now I’m at a point where I actually want something real. I’m not looking to talk to a bunch of people or play games. I want one person. My person. Someone I can stick with and build something meaningful with long-term. A best friend and a partner.

Ideally you’re around my age, emotionally mature, kind, and also looking for something genuine — not rushed, just intentional.

We can start by talking, see if we click. If we’re both comfortable, maybe swap pictures and grab coffee or check out a cool spot in the city. Keep it simple.

If you made it this far, tell me:

– What’s your ideal first date actually like?

2. I ride a motorcycle because sidewalks are for people with no sense of adventure.🏍🔥

3. Fun isn’t something I plan, it just kind of happens when I’m around. Late-night laughs, spontaneous plans, and moments you’ll remember way too clearly.

4. Coffee is not a lifestyle, it's my bloodtype.☕️❤️

5. And when there’s energy left over, you’ll find me at the gym lifting, pushing limits, or just clearing my head.

As for the pineapple debate:

It’s sweet, a little controversial, and completely underrated. Kind of like me, honestly. Plus, if fruit on pizza makes it a salad, I’m basically a wellness icon.🤣👀

I've been thrifting for a while, nothing serious, just like a hobby when I'm bored on weekends. Went to this small secondhand shop near me, found a really nice corduroy jacket, dark green, exactly my size. Paid like $14 for it, went home, tried it on properly and found $23 in the inner pocket. Two bills and some coins. Didn't think too much about it, just felt like a lucky day, happens sometimes with old clothes.

Here's where it gets weird. I went back to the same store two days later just to browse, still wearing the jacket because I genuinely love it. And this woman comes up to me, like mid-40s, kind of frantic energy, and goes ""oh my god thats my jacket."" I was confused at first because like, she donated it? She explained she'd dropped it off by mistake, it was supposed to go in a different pile, and she'd been back twice already asking the staff about it. Okay, unfortunate, I get it. But then she looks at me and goes ""did you find anything in the pockets."" And I just. froze.

I said yeah, some change and a couple bills. She immediately goes ""I need that back, that was in there when I brought it."" And I'm standing in the middle of the store, other shoppers around, staff kind of glancing over, and she's got this tone like I stole something from her house.

Here's my issue. I bought the jacket legally. The store processed the sale. Whatever was in it at that point kind of became mine by default, right? I already spent part of it honestly, just on coffee and a snack, nothing crazy. And she's standing there acting like I pickpocketed her personally. I told her I couldn't give back what I already spent and she got louder and said I ""had an obligation"" to return found money and that she could get the store involved.

The store manager came over and honestly just looked uncomfortable and said they ""couldn't really get involved in this."" Which, fair. But now I'm the one standing there feeling like a criminal over $23 in a jacket I paid for.

It wasn’t fireworks.

It was quieter than that.

It was a Thursday afternoon and the bookstore smelled like dust, paper, and coffee grounds that had been reheated too many times. I was pretending to read a novel I’d already finished twice, mostly because I didn’t want to go home yet.

That’s when she walked in.

She wasn’t loud. She didn’t turn heads. But she carried this calm, like someone who had finally stopped running from something.

She wore a soft gray sweater that looked like it had been washed a hundred times. Comfortable. Familiar. The kind of sweater you borrow and never return.

I noticed her because she paused at the entrance. Not checking her phone. Not scanning for someone.

Just… breathing.

Like she needed the quiet.

I went back to pretending to read, but I was watching her through the shelf gap between memoirs and poetry.

She went straight to the LGBTQ+ section.

My heart did that small, embarrassing jump.

Not because she was there. But because she didn’t hesitate.

She picked up a book. Flipped through it. Smiled slightly the kind of smile you don’t give to people. The kind you give to yourself.

I don’t know what possessed me. I’m not bold. I rehearse coffee orders in my head.

But I walked over.

“Is that one good?” I asked, nodding toward the book she was holding.

She looked up.

Her eyes were warm. Not sharp. Not assessing. Just… open.

“I don’t know yet,” she said. “But it feels like it might hurt in a good way.”

That made me laugh. And she smiled like she’d hoped it would.

“I’ve read it,” I said. “It does.”

We stood there for a second too long.

And something shifted.

It wasn’t lust. It wasn’t fantasy.

It was recognition.

Like we both knew what it meant to search for ourselves in pages because no one ever handed us a manual.

She introduced herself first.

“I’m Elena.”

The way she said it, soft but steady, made me want to say her name back just to see how it felt in my mouth.

“I’m Mara.”

We shook hands.

Who shakes hands?

But neither of us pulled away quickly.

Her hands were warm. Mine were probably shaking.

“Do you come here often?” she asked, and immediately made a face. “Wow. That sounded like a terrible line.”

I grinned. “Only when I’m emotionally avoiding my responsibilities.”

She laughed full this time. Head slightly back. Guard down.

And there it was.

That tiny, invisible thread.

We ended up sitting in the small café corner of the bookstore. Talking about books at first. Then about where we grew up. Then about the first time we realized we liked girls and how terrifying and beautiful that was.

She told me she used to pray it would go away.

I told her I used to pretend it wasn’t there.

We didn’t say it out loud, but we both understood the weight of that.

At one point she reached across the table to emphasize a story and her fingers brushed mine.

Neither of us moved.

It was the softest touch.

But it felt like a question.

And an answer.

When the bookstore announced they were closing, it surprised us. We’d been there three hours.

Outside, the air was cold. The sky turning that deep navy that feels intimate somehow.

She hesitated before leaving.

“I’m really glad I walked in today,” she said.

I swallowed.

“Me too.”

There’s a specific kind of courage it takes to ask another woman for her number when you’re not sure if the spark is mutual when you’ve been wrong before, when you’ve read signs that weren’t there.

But I did it anyway.

“Would you maybe want to… get coffee again? On purpose this time?”

She didn’t hesitate.

“I’d like that.”

When she typed her number into my phone, she saved it with a heart next to her name.

Just one.

Small.

Intentional.

That night, I lay in bed replaying everything. The way she smiled. The way she listened. The way her voice softened when she talked about her first crush.

It wasn’t fireworks.

It was something steadier.

Something that didn’t feel like chaos or chasing.

It felt like coming home to a place I hadn’t known I’d been missing.

And sometimes, the way you meet someone tells you everything.

Not because it’s dramatic.

But because it’s gentle.

And you realize love doesn’t always crash into your life.

Sometimes it walks quietly into a bookstore…

1r972em,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overemployed_PH/comments/1r972em/i_work_night_shift_icu/,I work night shift. ICU.,"A few months ago we admitted a 58-year-old male. Cardiac complications. Uncontrolled hypertension. Renal decline. Newly diagnosed aggressive cancer found during the workup.

When I walked into his room, he wasn’t panicked.

He was tired.

Not sleepy.

Tired in his bones.

As I started my assessment, he looked at me and said,

“You’re a nurse, right?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Promise me something.”

I paused. “Depends what it is.”

“Promise me you won’t live like I did.”

That caught me off guard.

⸻

Over the next few nights, I learned his story.

He worked two jobs for 30 years. Slept four hours a night. Lived on coffee and drive-through meals. Missed physicals. Ignored headaches. Brushed off chest tightness.

“I thought stress was just part of being responsible,” he said.

He showed me pictures on his phone.

A small house.

“That mortgage cost me sleep for 20 years.”

A warehouse floor.

“Worked doubles. No days off for months.”

A hospital bracelet from ten years ago.

“Doctor told me my blood pressure was dangerous. I said I’d handle it.”

He never did.

“I kept saying I’ll rest when things calm down,” he told me. “Things never calm down.”

⸻

One night around 2 AM, monitors steady, unit quiet, he looked at me and said:

“You know what the worst part is?”

“What?”

“I didn’t even enjoy the years I was sacrificing myself. I was too stressed to feel them.”

Silence.

“I missed birthdays because I was exhausted. Snapped at my wife because I was depleted. Stopped going to the gym because I was ‘too busy.’”

He laughed softly.

“Turns out my body was keeping score.”

Hypertension.

Chronic inflammation.

Untreated sleep deprivation.

Cortisol through the roof for decades.

Then cancer.

“I thought disease just happens,” he said. “No one told me stress is slow poison.”

As nurses, we know better.

But we don’t live better.

⸻

One shift he grabbed my wrist gently.

“You look tired.”

I almost laughed.

“Occupational hazard.”

He shook his head. “No. That’s how it starts. You normalize it.”

He pointed to his chest.

“This doesn’t break overnight. It erodes.”

He told me he used to brag about never calling out.

Never taking vacation.

Never needing help.

“Turns out my body didn’t care about my work ethic.”

⸻

He declined quickly.

Organ systems that had been compensating for years just… stopped compensating.

On his last night, he said something I’ll never forget.

“Tell nurses this: Rest is not weakness. It’s maintenance. Stress isn’t just emotional. It’s biological. And your body will collect the debt.”

He died at 4:12 AM.

No dramatic moment.

Just a tired body that had been running on empty for decades.

⸻

I went home after that shift and couldn’t sleep.

Not because of grief.

Because of recognition.

How many of us are living the same way?

Stacking shifts.

Ignoring headaches.

Normalizing 3 hours of sleep.

Pushing through burnout like it’s resilience.

We educate patients about hypertension.

About inflammation.

About stress management.

Then we chart for 14 hours and call it dedication.

⸻

Now I nurse differently.

But more importantly, I live differently.

I take my days off.

I monitor my labs.

I sleep.

I say no to extra shifts when my body says no.

Because I watched a man die from decades of “I’ll rest later.”

Stress is not just mental.

It is chemical.

Hormonal.

Cellular.

And your body keeps score.

Every time.

Be a great nurse.

But don’t sacrifice your organs to prove it.

Someone is in your bed right now because they thought exhaustion was strength.

Don’t let that be you.

1r971ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1r971ep/being_ghosted_a_month_ago_and_still_cannot_find/,"Being ghosted a month ago, and still cannot find closure","**TL;DR:**  
I dated someone with strong initial chemistry who repeatedly pulled away after closeness. After a hopeful reconnection and a great meeting, she suddenly stopped responding altogether. I don’t know if this was ghosting or avoidant withdrawal, but the lack of communication and closure has affected me deeply, and I’m struggling to process it.

I met a girl online in October 2025. After a few weeks of chatting, we met IRL, and as there was mutual liking and chemistry, we started dating. It was intense at the beginning. We asked each other at some point, but neither of us wanted to slow down. We got intimate soon. Everything seemed to be fine.  
After the first time we were intimate, a few days later she became more distant and started to leave me on read for long hours or over a day. She kept delaying the next meeting, even though we are both local and live close. I felt something was off, so I asked her directly if I did something wrong.  
This finally got me an answer, and my gut feeling was right: she had something to say. I received a very honest and vulnerable message about her state and why we could not carry on. I accepted it and reassured her that I respected it, and that a slow pace was better for me as well. I was scared myself about how quickly things went, and in the end I didn’t mind a slow build. I felt a lot of respect for her because she opened up and was honest about it.  
We kept texting, but from that point I started to reframe this connection in my mind as a friendship. I valued the connection and her personality over romantic potential. December was a bit up and down. Sometimes she left me on read for a few days, or even a week. I did not push her or send multiple messages when I had no reply. It was not always easy for me, as I have earned secure attachment now after many years of therapy. But when communication has no clarity, I lean anxious.  
On Christmas Day, after a week of silence, I sent one message to tell her I understood the need for space and quiet, and to wish her the best. I also encouraged her in her journey. In my mind, I didn’t even know if I had already been ghosted, but I wanted to leave that message there without chasing or anything. She replied warmly and repaired the silence. We started chatting more frequently again.  
In January she asked if I wanted to meet, and we arranged it. It wasn’t stated that it was a date, and I didn’t take it as one to avoid disappointment or awkwardness. She turned up with beautiful flowers (we are both women). The meeting went great, and I was very optimistic. We both said we enjoyed it and wanted to meet again. After that, she used “next time” language a few times in our chats, so my romantic interest was awakened again.  
A few days later, the communication started to slow down again. By that time, I recognised a pattern of withdrawal after closeness. I thought she was scared and needed time to regulate, which felt understandable. I also started realising that I was doing this all alone. We never named the silences. I thought that next time I saw her, I would tell her that when she disappears without a sign, it makes me overthink. But I never got the opportunity.  
She had encouraged me to ask her out previously, so after 10 days from our meeting, I asked if she was willing to have a coffee again. I got an answer quickly, asking about my schedule (and she mentioned she didn’t have her diary with her, which I completely ignored as a red flag). I answered with my availability that same evening, and I haven’t heard a word since. Not a single line.  
After a few days, I sent a funny meme and a polite reminder asking if she was still up for the meeting, but that hasn’t been answered either, and it has now been four weeks. So I know I have been ghosted. She didn’t block me or unfriend me, which is strange. I didn’t do it either, because I couldn’t — I’m not sure why.

Two weeks later, I sent one final letter — not to restart contact, but to give myself closure. A handwritten letter, scanned as a photo, because I couldn’t find closure in silence. I didn’t accuse her of anything, chase, or beg, and I wished her well. She left it on read, or switched off read receipts.  
I have never been ghosted like this before, and I cannot get out of the spiral. I cannot find closure. I was hoping the letter would help, but now I just feel embarrassed about it. I don’t even understand what is happening to me. I feel erased and discarded. It doesn’t align with anything I believed about this person. I feel broken and shattered, and I am suffering from panic attacks. I don’t know if everything was just a lie. Nothing makes any sense. I could take a rejection, but I don’t know how to handle this.

My family has always kept a lot of things. When I was born, they bought tons of furniture at auctions, and ever since then every unused room turns into storage. We’ve had multiple houses over the years, and the pattern is the same — extra bedroom becomes storage, sunroom becomes storage, plant room becomes storage. It’s technically functional. It’s not the “trash and roaches” TV version of hoarding. They vacuum. We don’t wear shoes inside. It’s not filthy.

But it’s crowded. Overfilled. Expired food in pantries. Cabinets packed to the point of infestations. There was a worm issue in one cabinet recently. I wasn’t home at the time. When I came back, I found unopened Starbucks coffee grounds from 2017 that were solid as a rock. I peeled back the seal and found dead worms under it. I threw it away. That caused conflict.

If I throw away expired skincare that’s six years old and no one uses, my family digs through the trash and gets angry. They say things like “we bought that for you” (even if it was free) or “what if you need it later?” They accuse me of being wasteful. They always shift blame.

I have ADHD, and the clutter makes it nearly impossible for me to function. I have four desks in my bedroom. I want one. I’m overwhelmed by furniture that isn’t mine. There are shoes everywhere — probably 50–100 pairs in the house. Boxes line hallways. Two fully stocked fridges. Cabinets so full I can’t store anything of my own.

They blame my belongings. They blame my rabbits. They blame plants. They say this only started when I moved back, but they’ve always lived like this.

I left for seven months. Before I left, there was a pile of items they wanted to sell or give away. When I came back, that pile was still there. In seven months, one item sold — and it was mine.

I need to stay here for now. I don’t have another housing option. But I feel like I’m suffocating. The visual clutter and constant arguments over throwing things away are draining me. I feel like I’ll rot and accomplish nothing if I stay in this environment.

I don’t know how to create boundaries in a house that isn’t technically “unsanitary” but is chronically overfilled. I don’t know how to reclaim space without triggering fights. I don’t know how to function with ADHD in this environment.

Has anyone dealt with this kind of “functional but overstuffed” hoarding? How did you cope while living there? How do you carve out mental and physical space without burning the house down emotionally?",3,1771525364.0,ChildofHoarder,1,1.0,False

His body is your favourite poem.
Nothing could stop you from turning his pages.

When he undresses you, you feel as naked as a
classic novel in the throes of literary analysis.

He has a green thumb. He flicks it across your chest
and water-lilies grow in the starved provinces.

As far as you know, he’s everywhere: your thighs.
Your throat. The heavy lids of your eyes.

His bed is a secret library of controversial titles.
His skin, a haiku for coffee monsoons.

Afterwards, you spread yourself on the sofa, eyes closed

and lie there like laissez-faire, allow to do. Anything to you.

You play classical music on his mini brass gramophone
as he begins to put on his Kathakali make-up

and suddenly the two of you are dancing and you’re laughing
and you don’t care about anything in the world and

for a moment, between his lucid arms, as he twirls you around
in a pirouette, you forget how Baba spat paan on your face

and hit you till your cheeks burned, screaming:
BOYS DON’T KISS OTHER BOYS

you shut out the vision of your mother beating her chest
the first time she caught you with the neighbour’s son

and the look on your wife’s face the day you got married
when you said, not tonight, I’m sick

because tonight, you’re in love with the ancient language of his hips
and how he smells like pressed peacock feathers in a Thakazhi book

tonight, you need him like a vulnerable foreigner needs
his passport in a war-oxidized country

tonight, the Heavens are no longer mute spectators:
because when you make love, God utters her first word.",1,1771525344.0,Poetry,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend (24M) and I (22F) have been together almost a year. This was my first real Valentine’s Day ever (he knew that).

A week before, he officially asked me to be his Valentine (I jokingly gave him a Feb 7 deadline lol) and said he wanted to take me camping. I was excited, but slightly uneasy because I’m usually the one who handles logistics on trips.

A few days before V-Day, he asked if he could still go to a Shabbat lunch that Saturday because one of his friends is leaving for medical residency. He’s not very religious, but this friend’s family hosts sometimes and he goes occasionally. I said that was fine, but asked what time we’d leave for camping. He said 2:30pm. I told him that felt late for a one-night trip, he got a little annoyed, so I dropped it.

(Side note: I’ve never been invited to this Shabbat, but that day another friend brought his girlfriend. When I asked about it, my boyfriend said “usually only wives go” and that this girl only got invited after five years, so I should expect an invite in 4–5 years. That felt weird. My Jewish friend said that’s not really a universal rule.)

Valentine’s morning was sweet. He surprised me with flowers, two journals, flower seeds, and a handwritten letter. The letter genuinely meant a lot. Later I found out the flowers and gifts were free from the flower shop where he works. I wasn’t expecting anything expensive, but I did realize they weren’t specifically chosen for me.

We planned to leave at 3pm. When I got home to finish packing, he called and said he’d had too much wine and shouldn’t drive. He asked if I could pack his bag, load the car, and pick him up so I could drive us. I was hungry and overwhelmed, but agreed if he ordered me food (he did, which I appreciated). It still took me about an hour to get everything together, so we left well after 4pm.

On the drive, I asked to confirm he’d booked the campsite… he hadn’t. At all. Same-day reservations were closed, so we had to scramble and find something else last minute. I was honestly in disbelief.

We had a long talk afterward. He was defensive at first, then apologized and said he felt ashamed and like a loser. We stayed a second night and it ended up being really nice. Two days later, he asked me on a fully planned coffee + Getty date, which I appreciated.

Here’s where I’m torn: he is not a lazy boyfriend overall. He’s loving, communicative, supportive, and has done genuinely thoughtful things (like throwing me a surprise birthday party after I once mentioned no one had ever had one for me). I don’t question that he cares.

But Valentine’s left me feeling like I carried the mental load for something that was his idea. I really value reliability and follow-through. He struggles with time management and is diagnosed ADHD (not medicated or in therapy).

For those who’ve dated someone like this long-term: does this improve with communication and structure? Or is this just a mismatch if planning and advance preparation matter a lot to me?

I don’t want to overreact. But I also don’t want to ignore a pattern.

I'm just mentioning Americans in my title because it seems like we're some of the only people who have tipping culture at all. 

Growing up, I was always taught that tipping is for service at a restaurant. You tip at places where you sit down and someone is serving you. You also tip when someone delivers food to your home. 

My understanding was that tipping is not necessary for scenarios where you're picking up takeout from a restaurant, or when you're ordering food from a counter, because in these situations nobody is serving you.

These days, whenever I go to a coffee shop or a counter place, there's always a prompt to tip when I swipe my card. When I order food ahead on a restaurant's website, there's a prompt to tip even if I'm picking the food up myself. 

I've started tipping at counter places because of the sheer awkwardness of being prompted to tip and having a person standing in front of me, but I feel a level of resentment over being asked to tip if I'm picking up takeout.

What do y'all do in these situations?

I (22m) met this beautiful (31f) co-worker about 2 and a half months ago. From the get go we had great chemistry at work. Winks, great banter, smiles, eye contact, great share from both sides. At a new years work party we speak a lot about each other's lives. She mentioned to me she feels like she is behind her peers who are married and have families. She asks if I'm single, she lets me walk her to her uber as she leaves, she shares a lot of lovely personal detail about her life, and lastly we get each other's Instagram to keep in touch.

She accepts my request after a delay of 2 days ish, okay maybe she's just inconsistent with her instagram use, which she lightly mentioned.

A week or so later after she's back from days off from work, I suggest we meet up as it would be nice to get drinks. She comes back to me on insta and says she would love to meet up with me for a coffee. (not exactly what I envisioned, but shit I was happy she added like 5 letters to the end of my name). I told her previously I spend a lot of time doing my own stuff on a laptop in a specific coffee shop, she said she wanted to see me while I was there just for a break together. She did however say her week was very busy and she only might be able to come on this little drink. Fine.

I reply immediately like 'oh yeah sure sounds great, make sure you come to this coffee shop'. On the Tuesday. Come today, the day she suggested, and shit she doesn't say anything. I'm slightly worried again, so I text her around 10:30am 'you still up for today? :)' and yeah I sat in that coffee shop with no response to her. It's now around 6pm and yeah she hasn't even read my second message.

What you suggest I do? What do you think she wanted? She doesn't have work today to my best knowledge, so while she is probably very busy, I would've expected she would have a message to send my way to you know, say I shouldn't be expecting her. It reads to me like she is interested in me, because of the way we interact, but she doesn't actually want to meet me. I'm left wondering if the age gap (which was discussed at the work party) is making her second-guess and choose someone closer to her age. I am also baffled how I am being played with by a 31f, I thought I was safe from a lack of communication.

I don't really want anymore hook-ups, I'd love to be able to build something slowly, it's an experience I just didn't have growing up. But this seems like this talking stage is drying up. I'm just a bit depressed that I can't get into a long-term relationship, starting to make me think I am a shallow person who picks people with attraction and chemistry over compatibility. A devil on my shoulder is telling me dating is a numbers game and I should be talking to lots of women at once, and while that's reasonable I feel like some women are gonna get the short end of the stick no matter what.

We’re both huge foodies and love warm weather (tropical or dry climate, doesn’t matter!). We are based in NYC and are willing to travel anywhere, with a few criterion.

\\- somewhere with great food, wine or interesting agriculture to tour (such as coffee farms, vineyards, etc)

\\- ideally less than 12 hours flying time direct from NYC

\\- has warm weather (at least 75°F)

\\- is not solely a “beach destination”; we like to walk around and explore rather than lay on the beach all day!

\\- No safaris (we love them but are looking for something different this time!)

So far we are curious about: Seychelles, Basque Country and/or Rioja region, Greece (Crete, Mykonos, etc.), Costa Rica, Croatia.

I went for coffee to my 3 old bosses (I did a PhD and it is normal to have 3 from multiple institutions in my country). At first I told them about a vacancy that included coaching students that I found and that I was hyped about it. They were discouraging me to apply since I was going down a level and I said that I have to start with building up work hours while the vacancy states 32 hours. So they concluded I was going too fast. I responded that I should figure that out with the potential employer. We also talked about the gap in my CV, and I said I am not ashamed of it and worked hard on myself. They said I shouldn't be that negative and that I shouldn't say that on a job application (I wasn't at a job application but just drinking coffee?). It did hurt me, as I had fought hard to not be ashamed of myself anymore (I experienced a lot of bullying in my life). At the end of the coffee meeting the same person joked about negative and positive, I didn't like the joke ofcourse. It is also a repeated pattern. When I did my PhD, I received hours of criticism about a 5 minute presentation. That would escalate into joking about my hard work. For context, they called me the ideal PhD student at the end AND on my defense as I did great work.

They also needed my knowledge clearly, it was quite clear from everything they told me that they have a knowledge gap since I left. They did me an offer: coaching students one day a week, no pay and no obligation to give me a contract later on. It 'would help me experience that line of work and I could get used to working again in a safe environment'. I already supervised 12 student internships during my PhD, and I was damn good at it.

I had worked real late last night and so I came at 12:00. Told her I was on my way at 10:45 and was gonna grab a coffee and would swing by there. But when I got to the house no one was there. So I texted my cousin and asked where they were and they said they had already unloaded everything and were already at the house. I thought moving furniture and packing up was something that took hours, but apparently they were already leaving by 9:30. 

I don’t understand why this always happens to me. She said it was gonna take like two to three days and so I figured we gonna be moving a lot of things but I guess not.

My neck and armpits are darker so I'm suspecting insulin resistance, and my doctor ordered all the glucose tests plus hormone and lipids. My appointment is in June to go over everything, so unfortunately I have to wait. But the doctor did confirm she suspects metabolic disease and PCOS. Also I do have hypothyroidism so I'm on meds for that.

 I've started eating breakfast before coffee (I would starve myself before and count calories, it did nothing), and I've started going lower carb and higher fiber/protein, especially when combined with any carbs. I barely eat sweets even though I have huge cravings. I know people mention berberine and inositol in this sub, so ive started 1g a day of myo-inositol, my brain fog feels a lot better but the scale stays the same or increases.

Has anyone had a similar situation as this? And how did you manage to finally lose some weight? I keep googling and just feel so helpless at this point, I don't know if I just need to wait for the insulin resistance to  get regulated or if this is a dietary thing I'm doing wrong...

Have you ever found yourself lost in a swirl of thoughts, where overthinking takes over? It’s like being on a mental treadmill that never stops, making simple decisions feel like huge burdens. Overthinking can leave you feeling stressed and drained. But there’s hope! Mindfulness techniques can help you step out of this cycle, regain control over your thoughts, and find inner peace. Let’s look at some practical strategies to manage overthinking and live a more mindful, relaxed life.

# Key Takeaways

* Overthinking can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety, so it’s important to notice when it happens.
* Practicing mindfulness techniques, such as paying close attention to your breathing and gently noticing your thoughts, can help you break free from the cycle of overthinking.
* [Grounding](https://healthyrelaxation.com/benefits-of-grounding/) techniques such as the 5-4-3-2-1 method can help quickly ease overwhelming thoughts.
* Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine can foster a more balanced and present outlook on life.
* Spending time in nature and creating relaxing evening routines can boost your overall well-being.

# Understanding Overthinking and Its Impact

We’ve all been there, haven’t we? Your mind just won’t settle down. You’re replaying conversations, worrying about what’s ahead, or simply caught in a whirlwind of thoughts. It drains you! Let’s take a moment to understand what overthinking really is and how it impacts us.

# Defining Overthinking

Overthinking isn’t just about thinking hard; it’s like having a hamster on a wheel, your mind keeps running in circles without ever reaching a conclusion. **It often involves getting stuck in a loop of repetitive thoughts, sometimes negative or unhelpful.** You might find yourself obsessing over tiny details from the past or stressing over all the things that could go wrong down the line. It feels as if your brain is stuck on repeat, and you can’t seem to find the off switch.

# The Cycle of Overthinking

Overthinking often follows a familiar pattern. It usually begins with *something upsetting,* a stressful event, a tough decision, or even just a stray thought. That initial spark can trigger a flood of worries and doubts. Suddenly, you find yourself questioning everything, replaying past moments, and imagining the worst possible outcomes. This cycle feeds itself, with anxiety fueling more overthinking, creating a loop that’s tough to break. For example:

* **Trigger:** A critical comment from your boss.
* **Thought:** “Did I ruin the entire project?”
* **Feeling:** Anxiety, self-doubt.
* **Behavior:** Obsessively checking emails, re-doing work.

# Recognizing Triggers

One of the first steps in managing overthinking is recognizing what triggers it. What kinds of situations, people, or thoughts tend to prompt your overanalyzing? Once you identify your triggers, you can begin to create ways to handle them. Perhaps it’s a certain part of the day, a specific person, or just a particular task. Keeping a journal can be really helpful for tracking your thoughts and noticing patterns. It might feel a bit tedious at first, but trust me, it can make a big difference. Once you’re aware of what to watch for, you can prepare yourself and stop the overthinking before it starts.

# Mindfulness Techniques to Combat Overthinking

Overthinking can sometimes make you feel like you’re lost in a mental maze, constantly replaying past events and worrying about what’s to come. But there’s hope! Mindfulness gently guides you to take control of your thoughts and find calm in the present moment. It’s not about forcing your mind to stop thinking, but about changing how you relate to those thoughts. Let’s look at some simple techniques to help you feel more at ease and reduce overthinking.

# Embarking on Mindful Exploration

Start by recognizing that overthinking is something everyone experiences from time to time. It’s normal to find yourself caught in thought loops, so try not to judge yourself harshly. **Mindful exploration** [means](https://aliabdaal.com/productivity/how-to-stop-overthinking-7-simple-ways/) watching your thoughts without criticizing or attaching to them. Imagine observing clouds drifting across the sky; you see them, but they don’t distract or overwhelm you. This gentle awareness helps you understand your habitual thought patterns and their triggers, making it easier to foster positive change.

# Creating Mental Space

Imagine your mind as a room. When you’re overthinking, that room becomes cluttered and chaotic. To create mental space, try decluttering your mind. One way to achieve this is through *visualization:* picture a peaceful scene, such as a beach or a forest. Pay attention to the details, the sounds, the smells, the sights. This helps shift your focus away from racing thoughts and fosters a sense of calm. You might also consider:

* Meditation
* Deep breathing exercises
* Spending time in nature

# Witnessing Thoughts with Compassion

This is about gently observing your thoughts with kindness and understanding. Instead of getting caught up in what you’re thinking, simply recognize their presence. For example, if you notice yourself thinking, “I’m going to fail,” you might say, “I’m having the thought that I might fail.” This helps create some distance between you and your thoughts, allowing you to see them as just thoughts, not facts. Think of yourself as a scientist studying an experiment you’re curious and interested in, but not emotionally attached. Remember, [compassion](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_mindfulness_make_you_compassionate) makes all the difference. Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend who’s going through a tough time.

# Grounding Techniques for Immediate Relief



Sometimes, overthinking can feel overwhelming, and you need a *quick way* to bring yourself back to center. That’s when grounding techniques come in. They’re like small anchors that help you steady your mind when it’s racing. While not permanent fixes, they offer immediate comfort and help you regain a sense of control.

# The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

This is a timeless favorite. It’s simple, unobtrusive, and can be done anywhere, making it accessible to everyone. **Engaging your senses helps you feel more connected to the present moment.** Here’s how to do it:

1. **5:** Take a moment to notice *five* things around you. Observe details you might usually overlook, like the roughness of a wall, the subtle color shifts in a leaf, or how the light dances off a surface.
2. **4:** Think about *four* things you can feel around you. It might be the softness of your clothes against your skin, the comforting support of the chair beneath you, the gentle warmth or coolness of the air, or the way your feet rest firmly on the ground.
3. **3:** Notice *three* things you can hear. Listen closely, perhaps the gentle hum of a refrigerator, distant traffic, birds singing nearby, or your own breathing.
4. **2:** Identify *two* things you can smell. Maybe it’s the rich aroma of your coffee, the scent of soap on your hands, or the overall smell of the room around you. If nothing comes to mind, think of two different smells you’ve encountered.
5. **1:** Name *some*thing you can taste, maybe the lingering flavor of your last meal, a piece of gum, or just the taste in your mouth. If nothing comes to mind, simply pay attention to the sensation in your mouth.

# Breath Awareness Breaks

Your breath is always with you, serving as a comforting and accessible anchor. Taking just a few moments for [mindful transitions](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques) can really make a positive difference. Here’s a simple exercise you can try:

1. Find a comfortable spot, whether sitting or standing.
2. Gently close your eyes or soften your gaze.
3. Gently turn your attention to your breathing. Feel the comforting sensation of air flowing in and out of your body.
4. Just notice your breathing without trying to change it.
5. Whenever your thoughts drift (which they inevitably will), gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
6. Keep going for a minute or two. As you become more comfortable, gently extend the time.

# Mindful Reflections

Sometimes, overthinking comes from dwelling on what’s behind us or stressing about what’s ahead. Practicing mindful reflection allows you to acknowledge these thoughts without getting trapped in them. It’s about calmly observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Here’s an easy way to start.

* Take 5-10 minutes in a quiet space to relax and breathe.
* Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
* Reflect on what’s been on your mind. What concerns are you holding onto? What thoughts keep echoing in your head?
* Accept these feelings and thoughts with kindness, without judging them. Just watch them gently flow by, like clouds drifting across the sky.
* Ask yourself: Is there anything I can do about this right now? If not, can I simply let it go for now and focus on what I can control?
* Gently redirect your focus to your breathing and let go of your thoughts.

# Integrating Mindfulness into Daily Life

Practicing mindfulness isn’t just something you set aside for special moments; it truly becomes meaningful when you weave it into your everyday life. Imagine adding small moments of calm and awareness to your daily routines, making each day more present and grounded. You don’t need hours; just a few seconds here and there can really make a difference. Let’s look at simple ways to bring mindfulness naturally into your life, making it a constant, supportive part of your daily experience.

# Morning Mindfulness Practices

Start your day with intention. Instead of grabbing your phone right after waking up, try a quick [morning mindfulness](https://healthyrelaxation.com/mindful-morning-routines/) exercise. It could be as simple as sitting quietly for five minutes, focusing on your breath, or doing a gentle body scan. **This sets a warm, positive tone for the day and helps you approach challenges with a calmer, clearer mind.** It’s like giving yourself a little mental reset before the chaos of the day begins. A short meditation can truly shift your perspective.

# Mindful Eating Experiences

Eating is often a mindless activity we tend to swallow our meals without truly experiencing them. Try to transform your eating into a *mindful* ritual. Notice the colors, textures, and aromas of your food. Chew slowly and truly enjoy each bite. Pay attention to how your body feels as you eat. This approach not only makes meals more enjoyable but also helps with digestion and leaves you feeling more satisfied. It’s about turning a routine act into a mindful and sensory experience.

# Mindful Social Interactions

Social interactions can either be a source of stress or a meaningful connection. When engaging in conversations, approach them with genuine mindfulness. Truly listen to the other person, avoiding interruptions or the urge to formulate your response prematurely. Be fully present, giving your undivided attention. This creates authentic bonds and helps prevent misunderstandings. It’s about actively participating in the moment, rather than being lost in your own thoughts.

>

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* Take a moment to breathe deeply before you answer the phone.
* Pay attention to the sensations of your feet on the ground as you walk.
* Notice the colors and shapes around you as you wait in line.

# Nature as a Mindfulness Ally





It’s easy to get caught up in our thoughts, replaying past moments or worrying about what’s ahead. But did you know that nature can be a gentle, reassuring presence to help you stay grounded and find inner peace? Think of nature as a caring companion, always there to help you reconnect with the present. Let’s look at ways you can invite the natural world into your mindfulness journey.

# Connecting with Nature

Sometimes, the simplest things can make the biggest difference. **Just being** ***part*** **of** [**nature’s**](https://healthyrelaxation.com/mindful-walking-busy-people/) **surroundings can help quiet an overactive mind.** You don’t need a big adventure; even a small park or your backyard can become your safe haven. Notice the little things: how sunlight dances through the leaves, the cheerful chirping of birds, or the gentle touch of the breeze. These simple sensory moments can gently bring you back to the here and now.

# Mindful Walks Outdoors

Walking is a wonderful way to blend physical activity with mindfulness. Instead of rushing through your day, take your time and truly pay attention to each step. Notice how your feet feel as they touch the ground, and be aware of your breath and the rhythm of your body. Take in the sights, sounds, and smells around you without judgment, and simply enjoy the moment. Try to weave these mindful touches into your walk.

* Focus on your breath as you walk.
* Notice the colors and shapes around you.
* Listen to the sounds of nature.

# The Healing Power of Natural Surroundings

Spending time outdoors can do wonders for your mental and physical well-being. It helps lower stress, reduce blood pressure, and boost your mood. Being in nature offers a calming effect and a fresh perspective, making it easier to see your problems in a new light. Here are some ideas to get started:

* Visit a local park or garden.
* Go for a hike in the woods.
* Spend time by the ocean or a lake.

# Establishing an Evening Mindfulness Ritual

As the day comes to an end, establishing a calming evening mindfulness routine can help quiet your thoughts and set the stage for a peaceful night’s sleep. It’s a gentle way to signal to your mind and body that it’s time to switch from activity to rest, encouraging a sense of tranquility.

# Transitioning to Rest

Begin by dimming the lights and turning off screens at least an hour before bed. This helps your body produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Consider a warm bath or shower to relax your muscles. **Engage in activities that promote calmness, such as reading a physical book (not an e-reader), listening to soothing music, or gentle stretching.** Avoid stimulating conversations or stressful tasks during this time. This is your time to unwind and prepare for sleep. You can also try a [short meditation](https://healthyrelaxation.com/guided-meditation-videos/) to calm your thoughts.

# Incorporating Gratitude Practices

Before drifting off to sleep, take a few moments to reflect on your day and think about what you’re grateful for. This simple habit can help shift your focus from worries to positive aspects of your life. You can do this silently *in* your mind or write down three to five things you’re thankful for in a gratitude journal, anything from a stranger’s kindness to a personal achievement. Doing so can nurture a more positive mindset and foster feelings of contentment. Keep these points in mind:

* Think about moments of joy.
* Acknowledge small wins.
* Appreciate your relationships.

>

# Setting Intentions for Tomorrow

Instead of dwelling on what happened today or stressing about what’s coming up, try setting gentle intentions for tomorrow. Pick one or two things you’d like to focus on or feel good about. This isn’t about making a strict to-do list, but about guiding your thoughts and actions in a positive direction. For instance, you might aim to be more present during conversations or take a moment for [deep breaths](https://healthyrelaxation.com/meditation/breath-trainer/) during a busy day. By setting these intentions, you’re actively shaping your mindset and giving yourself a sense of purpose for the day ahead.

# Continuous Mindfulness Practice for Long-Term Benefits

Nice job starting with mindfulness! The real transformation happens when it becomes a regular part of your routine. Think of it like working out a single gym session won’t make you fit, but consistent effort does. The same applies to your mind. Let’s discuss how to turn mindfulness into a lasting habit.

# Adapting Mindfulness to Your Needs

Life evolves, doesn’t it? So should your mindfulness practice. What worked well last year might not fit now. Maybe you had plenty of time for long meditations, but today you’re balancing work, family, and side projects. No worries! **The secret is versatility.** Instead of abandoning mindfulness, find ways to adapt. Shorten your sessions, explore new techniques, or steal moments during the day for a few mindful breaths. The aim is sustainability, not perfection. 

# Building Resilience Against Overthinking

[Mindfulness](https://healthyrelaxation.com/stop-overthinking/) isn’t about completely eliminating overthinking. Instead, it’s about reshaping your relationship with it. Think of it as nurturing a mental muscle. With consistent practice, you’ll become more aware of when you’re spiraling and gently steer yourself back to the present moment. Learning to surf is a good analogy; you’ll still fall sometimes, but you’ll also improve at riding the waves. Over time, overthinking will hold less influence over you. You’ll recover more quickly from stressful situations and approach challenges with greater clarity. Here are some ways to build resilience:

* Practice regularly, even when you don’t feel like it.
* Be patient with yourself. It takes time to develop new habits.
* Celebrate the little wins along the way. Recognize your progress, no matter how small.

>

# Fostering a Compassionate Mindset

Mindfulness isn’t just about paying attention to your breath or senses. It’s also about fostering *compassion* for yourself and for others. When you’re mindful, you start noticing your thoughts and feelings, including the negative ones. Instead of judging yourself harshly, approach yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember, everyone faces struggles at times. Extending that compassion to others can deepen and enrich your relationships. Give these a try.

* Practice self-compassion meditations.
* Offer a kind word to someone who is struggling.
* Volunteer your time to a cause you care about.

# Embracing Mindfulness for a Clearer Mind

Ultimately, dealing with overthinking is about finding your own rhythm through mindfulness. It’s not an instant fix, but a journey that helps you take control of your thoughts. By practicing these techniques, you can create a more peaceful space in your mind. Remember, it’s okay to experience moments of doubt or worry; what truly matters is how you respond to them. With patience and regular practice, you can learn to step back from those racing thoughts and find peace in the present. So, take a deep breath, give yourself grace, and start weaving these mindfulness techniques into your daily life. You’ve got this!

There is a FA at my office that I think my team is involuntary making super uncomfortable and I don't know what to do about it.

I work in a team of about 15 people where everyone is super nice, we all get along great and share a lot about our personal life during our coffee breaks. We're a mixed group (ages 30 to 55, about 50/50 guys/women) but  everyone either has a long-term girlfirend, is engaged, married and/or has children, and most people are quite active in different sports. So naturally out conversations often revolve around activities we did during the weekend with our partners/families.

Enter ""Albert"". Albert is a textbook FA. Late 30s, geek/gamer type, balding, zero friends, zero life outside of work. His only activities on the weekends is going for a walk alone. The only thing he does during his holidays is go to his parents' for a month.

At first the team really tried to include him in all the conversations, asking him about stuff just so he would open up and feel included. But Albert has the social skills of a cactus, and would always steer the conversation back to work related things, because work is literally the only thing going on in his life. I can literally feel his pain when everyone talks about all the stuff they did over the weekend with their partners/families/friends and he knows he has absolutely nothing to contribute. Nobody in the team judges or cares that he's FA, but I know he feels super uncomfortable in these situations. Lately he joins us less and less during breaks and just stays at his computer saying he has work to do.

Since I know some people here have been in a similar situation, I ask for tour advice. Is there an appropriate way of handling this situation? How can we make him feel included and not super self-conscious? What would you like from others in this situation?",3,1771524584.0,ForeverAlone,1,0.8,False

34 year old guy in Michigan looking to connect with someone who is confidently childfree and actually wants that lifestyle long term.

I live a pretty balanced life. In the warmer months I’m usually outside hiking, grilling, on the water, or finding random adventures. When winter hits I switch into reading, binge watching shows, good coffee, and staying warm indoors mode. Hybrid job with weird hours but flexible, so I can travel or plan mid week escapes.

5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, brown hair. Non smoker, social drinker, no drugs.

Personality wise I’m laid back, sarcastic once comfortable, and big on consistency. I like real conversations that can bounce from ridiculous to deep without warning. Physical touch is definitely my love language.

• Is truly childfree by choice
• Wants a real connection, not pen pals
• Has a sense of humor
• Values communication

Conversations flowed without rehearsal. I could sit next to a stranger in class, crack a small joke, and suddenly we would be walking to the coffee shop together. It was easy to belong. Easy to laugh. Easy to find “my people.” Even random evenings near the campus café or wandering around aimlessly felt full of possibility.

Back then, I didn’t think twice before being myself.

Now, in my pre-final year, the faces are familiar  but the comfort is not. The same people I once felt closest to now feel distant in a strange way. Not strangers. Not enemies. Just… turbulent. Like relatives you love but can’t fully relax around.

I hesitate before speaking. I measure my words. I calculate reactions.

Because somewhere along the way, I was taken for granted : deeply, repeatedly. And it changed something in me.

Today two of my close friends broke up. I spoke to him. I knew what to say, or at least I tried. But when it came to her, I felt blank. She once told me my existence was enough for her. That she loved my presence in her life. And yet a year later, I was invited to her home not because I mattered but because my presence made it easier for her to introduce her boyfriend to her family without suspicion.

That realization still stings.

It’s strange how someone who used to praise your existence use you so bad sometime later. 

And now I feel like I am losing the “giver” I used to be. The version of me who would look at someone, smile, and end up talking for thirty minutes without fear. The version of me who didn’t analyze every sentence afterward.

Now even a five-minute conversation feels like a test. I replay words in my head. I wonder if I overshared. If I was too kind. If I’ll be misunderstood. If I’ll be hurt again.

I miss the simplicity of being open without armor.

And it scares me.

Is this what adulting feels like?
Is this just a bad phase?
Or have I actually lost myself somewhere between loving too much and protecting myself too late?

I don’t think I’ve become cold. I think I’ve become cautious. But caution feels heavy when you used to be free.

Maybe I’m not losing myself.
Maybe I’m just grieving the version of me that didn’t know better.

I hope the warmth in me isn’t gone.

# Understanding Overthinking and Its Impact

We’ve all been there, haven’t we? Your mind just won’t settle down. You’re replaying conversations, worrying about what’s ahead, or simply caught in a whirlwind of thoughts. It drains you! Let’s take a moment to understand what overthinking really is and how it impacts us.

# Defining Overthinking

Overthinking isn’t just about thinking hard; it’s like having a hamster on a wheel, your mind keeps running in circles without ever reaching a conclusion. **It often involves getting stuck in a loop of repetitive, sometimes negative or unhelpful thoughts.** You might find yourself obsessing over tiny details from the past or stressing over all the things that could go wrong down the line. It feels as if your brain is stuck on repeat, and you can’t seem to find the off switch.

# The Cycle of Overthinking

Overthinking often follows a familiar pattern. It usually begins with *something upsetting,* a stressful event, a tough decision, or even just a stray thought. That initial spark can trigger a flood of worries and doubts. Suddenly, you find yourself questioning everything, replaying past moments, and imagining the worst possible outcomes. This cycle feeds itself, with anxiety fueling more overthinking, creating a loop that’s tough to break. For example:

* **Trigger:** A critical comment from your boss.
* **Thought:** “Did I ruin the entire project?”
* **Feeling:** Anxiety, self-doubt.
* **Behavior:** Obsessively checking emails, re-doing work.

# Recognizing Triggers

One of the first steps in managing overthinking is recognizing what triggers it. What kinds of situations, people, or thoughts tend to prompt your overanalyzing? Once you identify your triggers, you can begin to create ways to handle them. Perhaps it’s a certain part of the day, a specific person, or just a particular task. Keeping a journal can be really helpful for tracking your thoughts and noticing patterns. It might feel a bit tedious at first, but trust me, it can make a big difference. Once you’re aware of what to watch for, you can prepare yourself and stop the overthinking before it starts.

# Mindfulness Techniques to Combat Overthinking

Overthinking can sometimes make you feel like you’re lost in a mental maze, constantly replaying past events and worrying about what’s to come. But there’s hope! Mindfulness gently guides you to take control of your thoughts and find calm in the present moment. It’s not about forcing your mind to stop thinking, but about changing how you relate to those thoughts. Let’s look at some simple techniques to help you feel more at ease and reduce overthinking.

# Embarking on Mindful Exploration

Start by recognizing that overthinking is something everyone experiences from time to time. It’s normal to find yourself caught in thought loops, so try not to judge yourself harshly. **Mindful exploration** [means](https://aliabdaal.com/productivity/how-to-stop-overthinking-7-simple-ways/) watching your thoughts without criticizing or attaching to them. Imagine observing clouds drifting across the sky; you see them, but they don’t distract or overwhelm you. This gentle awareness helps you understand your habitual thought patterns and their triggers, making it easier to foster positive change.

# Creating Mental Space

Imagine your mind as a room. When you’re overthinking, that room becomes cluttered and chaotic. To create mental space, try decluttering your mind. One way to achieve this is through *visualization:* picture a peaceful scene, such as a beach or a forest. Pay attention to the details, the sounds, the smells, the sights. This helps shift your focus away from racing thoughts and fosters a sense of calm. You might also consider:

* Meditation
* Deep breathing exercises
* Spending time in nature

# Witnessing Thoughts with Compassion

This is about gently observing your thoughts with kindness and understanding. Instead of getting caught up in what you’re thinking, simply recognize their presence. For example, if you notice yourself thinking, “I’m going to fail,” you might say, “I’m having the thought that I might fail.” This helps create some distance between you and your thoughts, allowing you to see them as just thoughts, not facts. Think of yourself as a scientist studying an experiment you’re curious and interested in, but not emotionally attached. Remember, [compassion](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_mindfulness_make_you_compassionate) makes all the difference. Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend who’s going through a tough time.

# Grounding Techniques for Immediate Relief

https://preview.redd.it/l980d2aarhkg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=00e5cd01f8371e3e093d6aa3960309718e2b3490

Sometimes, overthinking can feel overwhelming, and you need a *quick way* to bring yourself back to center. That’s when grounding techniques come in. They’re like small anchors that help you steady your mind when it’s racing. While not permanent fixes, they offer immediate comfort and help you regain a sense of control.

# The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

This is a timeless favorite. It’s simple, unobtrusive, and can be done anywhere, making it accessible to everyone. **By engaging your senses, it helps you feel more connected to the present moment.** Here’s how to do it:

1. **5:** Take a moment to notice *five* things around you. Observe details you might usually overlook, like the roughness of a wall, the subtle color shifts in a leaf, or how the light dances off a surface.
2. **4:** Think about *four* things you can feel around you. It might be the softness of your clothes against your skin, the comforting support of the chair beneath you, the gentle warmth or coolness of the air, or the way your feet rest firmly on the ground.
3. **3:** Notice *three* things you can hear. Listen closely, perhaps the gentle hum of a refrigerator, distant traffic, birds singing nearby, or your own breathing.
4. **2:** Identify *two* things you can smell. Maybe it’s the rich aroma of your coffee, the scent of soap on your hands, or the overall smell of the room around you. If nothing comes to mind, think of two different smells you’ve encountered.
5. **1:** Name *some*thing you can taste, maybe the lingering flavor of your last meal, a piece of gum, or just the taste in your mouth. If nothing comes to mind, simply pay attention to the sensation in your mouth.

# Breath Awareness Breaks

Your breath is always with you, serving as a comforting and accessible anchor. Taking just a few moments for [mindful transitions](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques) can really make a positive difference. Here’s a simple exercise you can try:

1. Find a comfortable spot, whether sitting or standing.
2. Gently close your eyes or soften your gaze.
3. Gently turn your attention to your breathing. Feel the comforting sensation of air flowing in and out of your body.
4. Just notice your breathing without trying to change it.
5. Whenever your thoughts drift (which they inevitably will), gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
6. Keep going for a minute or two. As you become more comfortable, gently extend the time.

# Mindful Reflections

Sometimes, overthinking comes from dwelling on what’s behind us or stressing about what’s ahead. Practicing mindful reflection allows you to acknowledge these thoughts without getting trapped in them. It’s about calmly observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Here’s an easy way to start.

* Take 5-10 minutes in a quiet space to relax and breathe.
* Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
* Reflect on what’s been on your mind. What concerns are you holding onto? What thoughts keep echoing in your head?
* Accept these feelings and thoughts with kindness, without judging them. Just watch them gently flow by, like clouds drifting across the sky.
* Ask yourself: Is there anything I can do about this right now? If not, can I simply let it go for now and focus on what I can control?
* Gently redirect your focus to your breathing and let go of your thoughts.

# Integrating Mindfulness into Daily Life

Practicing mindfulness isn’t just something you set aside for special moments; it truly becomes meaningful when you weave it into your everyday life. Imagine adding small moments of calm and awareness to your daily routines, making each day more present and grounded. You don’t need hours; just a few seconds here and there can really make a difference. Let’s look at simple ways to bring mindfulness naturally into your life, making it a constant, supportive part of your daily experience.

# Morning Mindfulness Practices

Start your day with intention. Instead of grabbing your phone right after waking up, try a quick [morning mindfulness](https://healthyrelaxation.com/mindful-morning-routines/) exercise. It could be as simple as sitting quietly for five minutes, focusing on your breath, or doing a gentle body scan. **This sets a warm, positive tone for the day and helps you approach challenges with a calmer, clearer mind.** It’s like giving yourself a little mental reset before the chaos of the day begins. A short meditation can truly shift your perspective.

# Mindful Eating Experiences

Eating is often a mindless activity we tend to swallow our meals without truly experiencing them. Try to transform your eating into a *mindful* ritual. Notice the colors, textures, and aromas of your food. Chew slowly and truly enjoy each bite. Pay attention to how your body feels as you eat. This approach not only makes meals more enjoyable but also helps with digestion and leaves you feeling more satisfied. It’s about turning a routine act into a mindful and sensory experience.

# Mindful Social Interactions

Social interactions can either be a source of stress or a meaningful connection. When engaging in conversations, approach them with genuine mindfulness. Truly listen to the other person, avoiding interruptions or the urge to formulate your response prematurely. Be fully present, giving your undivided attention. This creates authentic bonds and helps prevent misunderstandings. It’s about actively participating in the moment, rather than being lost in your own thoughts.

>

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* Take a moment to breathe deeply before you answer the phone.
* Pay attention to the sensations of your feet on the ground as you walk.
* Notice the colors and shapes around you as you wait in line.

# Nature as a Mindfulness Ally

https://preview.redd.it/zi8yc12krhkg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=abe7f1bfed608c59fa94d60b41db30e6e688ddd7

It’s easy to get caught up in our thoughts, replaying past moments or worrying about what’s ahead. But did you know that nature can be a gentle, reassuring presence to help you stay grounded and find inner peace? Think of nature as a caring companion, always there to help you reconnect with the present. Let’s look at ways you can invite the natural world into your mindfulness journey.

# Connecting with Nature

Sometimes, the simplest things can make the biggest difference. **Just being** ***part*** **of** [**nature’s**](https://healthyrelaxation.com/mindful-walking-busy-people/) **surroundings can help quiet an overactive mind.** You don’t need a big adventure; even a small park or your backyard can become your safe haven. Notice the little things: how sunlight dances through the leaves, the cheerful chirping of birds, or the gentle touch of the breeze. These simple sensory moments can gently bring you back to the here and now.

# Mindful Walks Outdoors

Walking is a wonderful way to blend physical activity with mindfulness. Instead of rushing through your day, take your time and truly pay attention to each step. Notice how your feet feel as they touch the ground, and be aware of your breath and the rhythm of your body. Take in the sights, sounds, and smells around you without judgment, and simply enjoy the moment. Try to weave these mindful touches into your walk.

* Focus on your breath as you walk.
* Notice the colors and shapes around you.
* Listen to the sounds of nature.

# The Healing Power of Natural Surroundings

Spending time outdoors can do wonders for your mental and physical well-being. It helps lower stress, reduce blood pressure, and boost your mood. Being in nature offers a calming effect and a fresh perspective, making it easier to see your problems in a new light. Here are some ideas to get started:

* Visit a local park or garden.
* Go for a hike in the woods.
* Spend time by the ocean or a lake.

>

# Establishing an Evening Mindfulness Ritual

As the day comes to an end, establishing a calming evening mindfulness routine can help quiet your thoughts and set the stage for a peaceful night’s sleep. It’s a gentle way to signal to your mind and body that it’s time to switch from activity to rest, encouraging a sense of tranquility.

# Transitioning to Rest

Begin by dimming the lights and turning off screens at least an hour before bed. This helps your body produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Consider a warm bath or shower to relax your muscles. **Engage in activities that promote calmness, such as reading a physical book (not an e-reader), listening to soothing music, or gentle stretching.** Avoid stimulating conversations or stressful tasks during this time. This is your time to unwind and prepare for sleep. You can also try a [short meditation](https://healthyrelaxation.com/guided-meditation-videos/) to calm your thoughts.

# Incorporating Gratitude Practices

Before drifting off to sleep, take a few moments to reflect on your day and think about what you’re grateful for. This simple habit can help shift your focus from worries to positive aspects of your life. You can do this silently *in* your mind or write down three to five things you’re thankful for in a gratitude journal, anything from a stranger’s kindness to a personal achievement. Doing so can nurture a more positive mindset and foster feelings of contentment. Keep these points in mind:

* Think about moments of joy.
* Acknowledge small wins.
* Appreciate your relationships.

>

# Setting Intentions for Tomorrow

Instead of dwelling on what happened today or stressing about what’s coming up, try setting gentle intentions for tomorrow. Pick one or two things you’d like to focus on or feel good about. This isn’t about making a strict to-do list, but about guiding your thoughts and actions in a positive direction. For instance, you might aim to be more present during conversations or take a moment for [deep breaths](https://healthyrelaxation.com/meditation/breath-trainer/) during a busy day. By setting these intentions, you’re actively shaping your mindset and giving yourself a sense of purpose for the day ahead.

# Continuous Mindfulness Practice for Long-Term Benefits

Nice job starting with mindfulness! The real transformation happens when it becomes a regular part of your routine. Think of it like working out a single gym session won’t make you fit, but consistent effort does. The same applies to your mind. Let’s discuss how to turn mindfulness into a lasting habit.

# Adapting Mindfulness to Your Needs

Life evolves, doesn’t it? So should your mindfulness practice. What worked well last year might not fit now. Maybe you had plenty of time for long meditations, but today you’re balancing work, family, and side projects. No worries! **The secret is versatility.** Instead of abandoning mindfulness, find ways to adapt. Shorten your sessions, explore new techniques, or steal moments during the day for a few mindful breaths. The aim is sustainability, not perfection. 

# Building Resilience Against Overthinking

[Mindfulness](https://healthyrelaxation.com/stop-overthinking/) isn’t about completely eliminating overthinking. Instead, it’s about reshaping your relationship with it. Think of it as nurturing a mental muscle. With consistent practice, you’ll become more aware of when you’re spiraling and gently steer yourself back to the present moment. Learning to surf is a good analogy; you’ll still fall sometimes, but you’ll also improve at riding the waves. Over time, overthinking will hold less influence over you. You’ll recover more quickly from stressful situations and approach challenges with greater clarity. Here are some ways to build resilience:

* Practice regularly, even when you don’t feel like it.
* Be patient with yourself. It takes time to develop new habits.
* Celebrate the little wins along the way. Recognize your progress, no matter how small.

>

# Fostering a Compassionate Mindset

Mindfulness isn’t just about paying attention to your breath or senses. It’s also about fostering *compassion* for yourself and for others. When you’re mindful, you start noticing your thoughts and feelings, including the negative ones. Instead of judging yourself harshly, approach yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember, everyone faces struggles at times. Extending that compassion to others can deepen and enrich your relationships. Give these a try.

* Practice self-compassion meditations.
* Offer a kind word to someone who is struggling.
* Volunteer your time to a cause you care about.

# Embracing Mindfulness for a Clearer Mind

Ultimately, dealing with overthinking is about finding your own rhythm through mindfulness. It’s not an instant fix, but a journey that helps you take control of your thoughts. By practicing these techniques, you can create a more peaceful space in your mind. Remember, it’s okay to experience moments of doubt or worry; what truly matters is how you respond to them. With patience and regular practice, you can learn to step back from those racing thoughts and find peace in the present. So, take a deep breath, give yourself grace, and start weaving these mindfulness techniques into your daily life. You’ve got this!

For the last 8 years I have high blood pressure. I was up around 160/110. With meds, I could get it down to 145/100. Cutting out salt and caffeine, I could get it down to 140/90. I had a lot of success by standing for an hour or two with my legs spread slightly apart and got it down to 125/80

Finding out the body sorta have a second heart in your calve gave me an idea to work out more on my glutes and calves.

Here is the actual neuroscience of what is happening to us.,"For years, I genuinely thought there was something fundamentally wrong with me. Every single day, right around 2:00 PM, I would hit this invisible wall. The brain fog would roll in so thick that I’d just sit at my desk staring blankly at my monitor, rereading the same sentence five times without comprehending a single word. I used to beat myself up over it, thinking it was a lack of discipline, burnout from working too hard, or just the inevitable reality of getting older.

I was so tired of feeling like a zombie every afternoon. Out of sheer desperation, I started digging into the actual neuroscience of what happens to our brains on this stuff, and I realized my afternoon slump wasn't a character flaw. It was a biological tax I was paying for how I treated my body at 8:00 AM.

Here is what I learned, and it completely changed my perspective on my daily habit. When we wake up, our bodies naturally begin to elevate cortisol to help us shake off sleep. But when we immediately dump a massive coffee into our system, it triggers the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This forces the adrenal glands to release a heavy spike of stress hormones, specifically epinephrine (adrenaline) and even more cortisol, directly into our bloodstream. We aren't actually creating energy; we are inducing a state of artificial, chemical stress.

But the real culprit behind the 2:00 PM crash is adenosine. Adenosine is the neuromodulator that builds up in our brains and makes us feel sleepy. When we wake up, there is still residual adenosine floating around. Because caffeine’s molecular structure is so remarkably similar to adenosine, it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds directly to those adenosine receptors. It acts as an antagonist, essentially picking the lock and blocking the actual adenosine from getting in.

The problem is that your brain doesn't stop producing adenosine just because you drank coffee. It keeps building up in the background all morning. When the caffeine finally begins to metabolize and detach from those receptors early in the afternoon, that massive backlog of accumulated adenosine comes rushing in like a flood. That is the brain fog. That is the crash. It isn't true fatigue from a heavy workload; it's a biochemical dam breaking.

I realized that to fix the afternoon slump, I didn't need another cup of coffee or a nap. I needed to let my body clear that residual morning adenosine on its own. I decided to delay my first intake of caffeine by exactly 90 minutes after waking up to give my natural waking mechanisms time to do their job before I blocked the receptors. The difference has been staggering, though the adjustment period has been incredibly humbling.

Has anyone else experimented with pushing their first coffee back 90 minutes? What were your withdrawal symptoms like the first week?",2,1771524198.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Note, the DF64 is out of consideration. A friend has one and the noise from it has ruled it out.  I have a partner that is pretty sensative to sounds and I'm confident they will not enjoy the DF64. Friend also had a lot of problems with alignment, despite trying to rotate the burrs and doing all the things recommended. They had to order shims.  Maybe the SSP burrs solve some of these issues, and swaping to the DF64 with SSP burrs is within price range.

90% of the time these will be used for espresso. I tend to use this espresso bean: [JBC Coffee Twisted V9 espresso](https://jbccoffeeroasters.com/product/twisted-espresso/) as they're about 2 mi from my house and I can usually get 12oz bags for $13-16. Quality is usually very good and it behaves, largely, like a well balanced medium roast. I've used the V.9 for a V60 many times, and with good results, in addition to using it with my existing Breville Barista Pro.

I'm inclined toward the Mahlkeonig due to the fact that I doubt I'll adjust the grind that often, and from reviews it seems to deliver the kind of espresso shots I prefer (sweeter, thick, lots of texture) well from medium roast beans, and that describes most of what I do for espresso.  

I think I'll keep my upgraded baratza encore for grinding cold brew and maybe pour-overs. That said, if I buy a bag of single-origin light roast for the V60, I can adjust the Mahlkoenig and leave, which isn't a big deal since I'll likely keep grinding those beans until the bag is gone, usually a week at most.  Then I revert to espresso grind settings.  JBC's espresso roasts have been fairly consistent, so dialing in after a new bag hasn't been hard, at all.

  
Also, if anyone has any must-get accessories for the Silvia, please LMK.  I already have a good scale & WDT tool.  I'll probably need a new portafilter and tamper tool, as mine are specific to the Breville.",1,1771524182.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Hello all, long time lurker, first time poster.

By no means am I a writer, but I *am* a thinker, and I do a lot of brainstorming for my job. And just love brain dumping.

[Boox Palma 2 inside the writer deck, designed my Un Kyu Lee](https://preview.redd.it/hlq8u8tmphkg1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caf98723629ad5303e8d3f9a4a3b01b459ecf7ff)

I fell down the writer deck rabbit hole about a year ago. I’ve owned the Palma 2, discovered Un Kyu Lee x Micro Journals, and eventually found his files for the writer deck. I got a 3D printer… and the rest is history.

I wanted to share this with you all because I’m genuinely excited every time I use it. I did the bare minimum: printed using the files he provided, bought the recommended keyboard, and just put it all together. I don’t even have matching screws, I literally just used whatever I had laying around the house.

In the past, I’d usually brain dump in a Field Notes notebook, but I always felt slowed down by handwriting. With typing, I’ve realized I’m a lot faster, and my fingers let my thoughts flow more naturally.

With that said, I just wanted to say what’s up and finally make my first post.

Plenty of convenient bus lines are a short walk away and the light rail is a 10 min walk from our house.  
  
In thinking about what kind of roommate/living situation we are looking for, we’d like someone who is open-minded, considerate, a direct communicator, generally tidy, and especially experienced and interested in co-living or building community as a household, and queer/lgbtq friendly! We are a medical resident (Maya) and PhD student in anthropology (Nafe). Maya spends most her time at the hospital (primarily day shifts but \*sometimes\* at night) and Nafe works from home but is often out on many adventures or at her screenprinting studio. We both like to spend time outside, listen to music, have friends over/out of town visitors, dance, go to the movies, and cook/bake!

Intended Major: dual major for English and Secondary Education.

Academics: college GPA 4.0, high school gpa 4.02W/3.7ishUW

Testing: SAT is 1320, first applied last year as test optional, got waitlisted and submitted my score out of stress. 

Coursework: 9 APs, eight tests: one 5, three 4s, four 3s, one 2 (not submitting that one 😭), in honors college at my current school and had 26 credits before entering college, not 56 credits but only 47 are transferable, also honor roll at high school

Honors & Awards: didn’t add because I haven’t gotten any in the past semester here but they have my last app where I got second place in a Muslim regional quiz bowl comp, a yearbook award, first place in a Chinese art comp and the ap honors award or smth

I went for coffee to my 3 old bosses (I did a PhD and it is normal to have 3 from multiple institutions in my country). At first I told them about a vacancy that included coaching students that I found and that I was hyped about it. They were discouraging me to apply since I was going down a level and I said that I have to start with building up work hours while the vacancy states 32 hours. So they concluded I was going too fast. I responded that I should figure that out with the potential employer. We also talked about the gap in my CV, and I said I am not ashamed of it and worked hard on myself. They said I shouldn't be that negative and that I shouldn't say that on a job application (I wasn't at a job application but just drinking coffee?). It did hurt me, as I had fought hard to not be ashamed of myself anymore (I experienced a lot of bullying in my life). At the end of the coffee meeting the same person joked about negative and positive, I didn't like the joke ofcourse. It is also a repeated pattern. When I did my PhD, I received hours of criticism about a 5 minute presentation. That would escalate into joking about my hard work. For context, they called me the ideal PhD student at the end AND on my defense as I did great work.

They also needed my knowledge clearly, it was quite clear from everything they told me that they have a knowledge gap since I left. They did me an offer: coaching students one day a week, no pay and no obligation to give me a contract later on. It 'would help me experience that line of work and I could get used to working again in a safe environment'. I already supervised 12 student internships during my PhD, and I was damn good at it.

1r968mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1r968mi/my_coworker_walked_out_of_my_office_mid_sentence/,My coworker walked out of my office mid sentence after accusing me of being too quiet.,"I (29f) work with a bunch of men. I am the only girl at the office, which can be more than frustrating at times. But these people have the social skills of a piece of cheese.

There's one coworker in particular (28m), who really aggravates me. When I first got hired he didn't introduce himself for the first two days. There's only three of us working here at the warehouse all day and I didn't even know he existed until he came into the office one day to talk to my boss, and even then, he never introduced himself at all, even though I learned later that he and I would be working together pretty closely. I found that extremely weird but thought that maybe he was just shy.

Time goes on, and the more I get to know him, the more I realized he is genuinely not a nice person at all. He was so rude to the girl who I replaced, he made her go on stress leave, and she was eventually laid off. He's almost got in multiple fist fights with the truck drivers that come into the warehouse and makes racist comments towards them, (I notified HR). He leaves his nasty nicotine pouches around the office, never says hello or good morning when he comes into the office, never asks how anyone is doing and just completely lacks decorum.

The only conversation he ever tries to make, is when he is bragging about how much money he has, how much money his friends have, or things that he has recently bought that he thinks will impress people. Whenever you try to give up a piece of information about yourself he just either completely ignores you, or tries to make up a lie to relate to what your saying. For example, several months ago, I brought up the news headline, that Robert Munsch, the beloved children's author, is going on the assisted suicide program in Canada, and he said ""My cousin is actually neighbours with Robert Munsch so my family and I are really upset."" like COME ON. Another instance I was talking to my boss about my upcoming music festival trip. The festival is quite large in Canada, a lot of people attend every year, and many people know about it. He interrupts me telling my boss about my plans, by saying; ""My neighbour is actually the owner of PK sound, and he really wants me to go. I'd have access to all the VIP sections and stuff, I just don't want to go dance in a forest naked."" For those who don't know PK sound supplies speakers and sound solutions for many different festivals and concerts. Even if that's true, that his neighbour is the owner of PK sound, how annoying could you possibly be? To interrupt someone by bragging and telling me that you would never go to something I pay a lot of money for and enjoy going to every year, is just rude.

Eventually his behaviour got really old and tiring, and I've resorted to only talking to him if I absolutely have to. He comes into the office and I turn around and get back to work, obviously not wanting to chat. I never say hello or good morning to him, never say good bye, and never tell him anything about myself, and when I have to talk to him abut work stuff I keep it polite and short.

This morning he walks into the office to make a coffee without saying anything and I didn't say anything either. Both of us just sat in silence and I continued my work. All of a sudden he says ""You're a quiet one hey?"" and this just set me off. I said ""What do you want to talk about?"" and he was like ""I don't know, your so quiet though."" and I said, ""Well, if you feel like you want to get to know someone, the first step is to ask them something about themselves, maybe say hello in the morning once in a while? I tried to chat with you in the beginning and..."" I didn't get to finish my sentence because... you guys... he just walked right out. Didn't even hear what I had to say just walked out mid sentence shutting the door behind him.... LIKE WHAT THE HELL?! What a weenie.

Anyways, just thought I'd share the audacity of this man with you guys. I think we all have a person like this in the office and would love to hear about how everyone handles them.",9,1771523838.0,coworkerstories,3,1.0,False
1r967nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1r967nv/how_to_reset_your_motivation_system_naturally_the/,How to Reset Your Motivation System Naturally The Psychology Behind Burnout and What Actually Works,"okay so here's the thing nobody talks about. your motivation isn't broken, it's just been hijacked by a system that profits from keeping you exhausted and overstimulated.

i spent months researching this after realizing i couldn't finish a single task without checking my phone 47 times. read like 15 books, binged neuroscience podcasts, talked to actual researchers. turns out our brains literally weren't designed for the dopamine assault we're putting them through daily. social media, junk food, constant notifications, they've all rewired our reward circuits to crave instant hits instead of meaningful progress.

the good news? you can actually reverse this. it's not about willpower or discipline or any of that toxic productivity BS. it's about understanding how your brain's motivation system works and stopping the things that are actively sabotaging it.

**here's what actually moves the needle:**

* **do a proper dopamine detox, not the fake internet version**
   * most people think dopamine detox means sitting in a dark room doing nothing. that's not it. dr. andrew huberman (stanford neuroscientist) explains on his podcast that it's about reducing the HIGH spikes of easy dopamine so your baseline resets. cut out the stuff that gives you instant gratification with zero effort: endless scrolling, junk food binges, binge watching shows.
   * start with 24 hours. just one day where you don't touch social media, don't eat processed sugar, don't watch netflix. read, walk, cook actual food, be bored. your brain will HATE this at first because it's used to constant stimulation. that discomfort is literally your dopamine receptors recalibrating.
   * i use an app called **one sec** for this. it adds a breathing exercise before you open addictive apps. sounds dumb but it breaks the automatic reaching for dopamine hits. creates just enough friction to make you conscious of what you're doing.
* **fix your dopamine baseline with boring lifestyle stuff**
   * sleep is non negotiable. dr. matthew walker's book **""Why We Sleep""** is legitimately terrifying and will make you respect your sleep schedule. when you're sleep deprived, your prefrontal cortex (the part that helps you make good decisions and stay motivated) basically shuts down. you're running on fumes and wondering why you can't focus.
   * cold exposure actually works. i know it sounds like bro science but there's real research behind it. 2-3 minutes of cold shower increases dopamine by 250% and it lasts for HOURS. not the fleeting spike you get from scrolling, but sustained elevation that actually helps you do hard things.
   * **the book: ""Dopamine Nation"" by dr. anna lembke** (stanford psychiatry professor, literally wrote the book on addiction). this one is INSANELY good. she explains how we've created a dopamine deficit state by constantly chasing pleasure. includes actual case studies and a framework for resetting your reward system. made me realize how much of my ""laziness"" was just a depleted dopamine system trying to protect itself.
* **relearn how to do hard things**
   * your brain needs to remember that effort feels good. not in a toxic grind culture way, but in a ""i built something and it matters"" way. the problem is we've trained ourselves to avoid any discomfort.
   * try **habit stacking**. james clear talks about this but the neuroscience checks out. attach a new behavior to an existing habit. after you brush your teeth, do 10 pushups. after you make coffee, write for 5 minutes. your brain already has neural pathways for the first habit, so you're piggybacking on existing motivation circuits instead of trying to create willpower from nothing.
   * check out **centered app** for deep work sessions. it combines gentle accountability with focus timers. tracks when you get distracted, helps you notice patterns. way less aggressive than those apps that lock you out of your phone but actually effective for building focus muscle.
* **understand the motivation comes AFTER you start, not before**
   * this is from behavioral psychology research and it's a game changer. we think we need to FEEL motivated to start doing something. completely backwards. motivation is a result of action, not a prerequisite.
   * the **2 minute rule**: just commit to doing something for 2 minutes. usually you'll keep going because starting is the hard part. if you don't, that's fine too. you're still building the neural pathway of following through on commitments to yourself.
   * **""Atomic Habits"" by james clear** breaks this down perfectly. won't lie, everyone recommends this book but there's a reason. it's not fluffy self help garbage, it's actually based on behavioral science research. focuses on systems over goals, which is exactly how you rebuild sustainable motivation instead of relying on bursts of inspiration that fade.
* if reading full books feels overwhelming right now, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls from neuroscience research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. you type in something specific like ""i'm burnt out and can't focus on anything,"" and it builds a learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. the depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. built by AI experts from Google, it's less about grinding through self-help content and more about making the science behind motivation feel accessible when you're too tired to read. plus the voice options (including a surprisingly soothing one) make it genuinely easy to stick with.
* **get your reward system working properly again**
   * celebrate small wins intentionally. sounds cheesy but your brain needs to learn that progress feels good again. finished a task? take a genuine moment to feel satisfied before moving to the next thing. we've lost this because we immediately jump to the next dopamine hit.
   * **practice being bored**. seriously. boredom is actually when your brain does its best problem solving and creative thinking. but we've eliminated every moment of boredom from our lives. waiting in line? phone. sitting on the toilet? phone. your default mode network (the part of your brain that processes experiences and generates insights) never gets activated anymore.
   * try the **finch app** for gentle habit tracking. it's less punishing than other habit apps, uses a cute bird metaphor. tracks your mood alongside habits so you can see patterns. helps you be compassionate with yourself while still building consistency.

the thing is, resetting your motivation isn't about becoming some productivity robot. it's about remembering what it feels like to genuinely WANT to do things instead of forcing yourself through sheer willpower or shame.

your brain's reward system evolved over millions of years to help you survive and thrive. it got completely overwhelmed in like 15 years of smartphone evolution. you're not lazy or broken. your motivation system is just exhausted from being constantly exploited.

I'm really happy for her but I'm also concerned because I know some things about her fiance's financial situation that worry me.

Her fiance is a nice guy but he's terrible with money. He has around $60k in credit card debt, no savings, and has mentioned multiple times that he's excited to finally be financially stable once they're married. My friend makes good money as a nurse and has her life together financially.

Last week we were having coffee and she was talking about wedding planning. I asked if they'd discussed a prenup and she looked at me like I was crazy. Said that's for rich people and they don't need one because they're in love.

I probably should've dropped it but I didn't. I told her that based on what I know about his financial situation, she should really protect herself. That combining finances with someone who has that much debt and no money management skills is going to cause serious problems. I said without a prenup she's basically taking on responsibility for his poor financial decisions. She got really upset. Said I was being judgmental and that I clearly don't believe in their relationship. That marriage is about supporting each other and his debt will become their debt and they'll work through it together. She said I was being a terrible friend for suggesting her marriage will fail.   
I tried to backtrack and said I wasn't saying they'll definitely divorce, just that it's smart to protect yourself legally regardless. But she was already hurt and the conversation ended badly. Her fiance found out about what I said and texted me saying I need to apologize and stop trying to interfere in their relationship. My boyfriend thinks I overstepped and should've minded my own business but I was genuinely trying to help her avoid what I see as a huge mistake.

Now she's barely talking to me and I'm wondering if I was wrong. I wasn't trying to say her marriage will fail, I was trying to say she should protect herself just in case. But maybe that's the same thing? Am I the jerk for bringing this up when she didn't ask for my opinion?",54,1771523423.0,AmITheJerk,50,0.97,False

There was a wall on the east side of the city, tucked behind a shuttered jazz club and a bakery that only opened on Sundays. It wasn’t famous, not tagged with murals or declarations of love. Just a slab of concrete, weathered and cracked, where people wrote things they couldn’t say out loud.

That’s where they went.

Nia and Devin met in college. They were two firestorms wrapped in soft skin. They loved like they were building something eternal, but somewhere between the job offers, the miscarriages, the silences, and the nights spent facing opposite walls, they lost the map.

They didn’t break up in a blaze. No screaming, no betrayal. Just a quiet agreement: We’re not good for each other anymore.

But the love didn’t die. It just got buried under the rubble of unmet needs and unspoken apologies. They both moved on and got married. Both married to loving supportive spouses that trusted them.

Year One

They saw each other at a mutual friend’s birthday. She wore the scarf he gave her three winters ago. He brought her favorite wine, pretending it was for the host.

They talked. Laughed. Walked to the wall together.

She pulled out a piece of chalk from her purse. He raised an eyebrow.

“One hash mark,” she said. “For not crossing the line.”

He nodded. “For not pretending we’re still us.”

She drew it. A single white line.

Year Three

They met for coffee. Just coffee.

She had someone now. So did he.

But when she leaned in to hug him goodbye, her breath lingered on his neck. His hand stayed on her back a second too long.

They didn’t kiss. Didn’t confess.

Later that night, he drove to the wall. Drew the third mark.

Year Five

They cuddled once.

It was raining. Her car broke down. He picked her up. They sat in his apartment, soaked and shivering.

She curled into him like she used to. He held her like he never stopped.

But when her lips brushed his collarbone, he whispered, “Don’t.”

She pulled away. “I know.”

They didn’t sleep together. Didn’t stay the night.

She went to the wall the next morning. Drew the fifth line.

Year Seven

They stopped meeting.

Not out of anger. Just out of mercy.

They knew the ache would never leave. That some loves don’t fade, but instead they just get folded into the architecture of who you are.

But they also knew the kind of people they wanted to be.

Not the kind who stole moments from other lives. Not the kind who made excuses for old flames.

So they let go.

Year Ten

She beat him to the wall.

He arrived minutes later, saw the tenth mark already there.

He smiled. Touched the line with his fingertips.

She had written something beneath it this time:

Still love you. Just not like that because I can’t.

He added his own:

Still love you. Always like that. But I won’t.

They never saw each other again.

But every year, one of them returned.

And the wall kept growing.

A monument to restraint. To memory.

To the kind of love that doesn’t ask for more.

Just asks to be remembered.",1,1771523394.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1r960de,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/1r960de/real_branded_bun_review_not_sponsored/,"REAL Branded Bun Review, NOT Sponsored","Got tired of all the posts about this mediocre food truck so I went back to grab 2 more and give you all an honest review.

First time, I tried the nutella and the mac & cheese. Nutella tasted off to me, with a weird fruity note; probably an off-brand which would be fine if they called it something other than the brand name. Also, the sweet buns (at least the nutella one, idk about the others) are NOT as filled as the savory ones. I did not realize this when I was ordering. Overall it wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad. Just kind of meh, decent enough treat for a bad day. 
The mac one was not it at all. The pasta inside was way overcooked and mushy, and the cheese was nearly flavorless. All it tasted like to me was bread and mush, and I don't think their sweet bread recipe mixes well with the mac and cheese. I want to believe that they make these from scratch (even if they make them at home and freeze them), but this one tasted supremely frozen to me. Bar for bar frozen mac and cheese from like Walmart. Would not get this one again.

This time, taking others' suggestions, I grabbed the sausage pepperjack jalapeño and the meatball parm. The sausage one is quite nice actually, the ratio of meat to cheese to bread is pretty spot on. They skimp out on the jalapeños but I'm pretty used to that from places, I think they just think most people can't handle it lol. If I were to go back, this is the one I'd get.
The meatball parm is also not horrible. It's a little too sweet for my taste and a little lacking on seasoning, but it's also a solid choice. This one also tastes frozen, but it's not bad per se. Kind of like a frozen lasagna.
I also grabbed an iced coffee, which is pretty generically good. For the price point, I'd definitely go here instead of Dunkin. It's $4 for a decently sized cup.

Overall, not amazing. It's kind of overpriced, especially for the blandness and the frozen taste. If you really want to try it, get the sausage pepperjack, it's the only one I've had that I think is more than decent. I also wouldn't spend money out of my real wallet here, this is a dining dollars only food spot for me. The coffee is definitely worth it if you're just looking for a plain iced coffee (I added milk, and they have sugar too), the price for that is actually quite good compared to their food prices.

Let me know what you guys think of it also.. maybe I just picked the wrong buns or maybe it's just not my thing, idk lol. 

Edit: They do not seem to be homemade, and you can buy them cheaper directly from the source if you want them. They're $18 for 6 online, as opposed to $9 for 1 here. There is a minimum order amount of $80 but that gets you a shit ton of buns, whereas here that would get you maybe a dozen. Idk where they source some of them from as this only has a select few, but the images look the same for those as do the flavors. They probably source from more than one place, this is just what I could find.

Context : I come from a poor, single parent household. We moved to England when I was around 9 and then for familial reasons we moved to Spain during the height of covid and before I had finished off my GCSE'S.

I missed out on work experience because of said covid and though not diagnosed very likely suffer from adhd and certainly anxiety (Particularly social.). On top of that I still don't fluently grasp the Spanish language. As my only source of learning it has been, being thrusted into the Spanish equivalent of GCSEs and A-Level. (Which I am still currently struggling and trying to pass. It's all been very high stress.) Just, trying to absorb whatever I could/can while keeping up at least passing grades.

  
Anyhow, despite studying like this I don't see a plausible future for myself in anything ? I am excellent at literature (and a deep lover of it !) plus I have a passion for the visual arts (Particularly a skill in illustration that I've been cultivating since 11. Not that I feel I am anything remarkable.) but have no idea how or what jobs those two could possibly, viably turn into. Especially one that would, help, at all to drag me out of the poverty I grew up in.

I know I could always just.. idk pick some kind of high paying job to study for but, I feel I'd be miserable and also not very good at it, having a job without passion, only for the money just, feels hollow to me and I'd rather not.

But, I don't know what else to do. Especially in this economy. I don't know where to go or where to start and, I almost feel there is no good, sustainable future for me in anything. Maybe I'll just work retail or a coffee job for the rest of my life.

If she knocks on your door, there are five rules you must follow.","I live in an old New England town. Legend has it that for 300 years, it has been haunted by Zuriel the Witch. 

We learn about Zuriel on school grounds. 

Older kids teach the younger, voices low and eyes glimmering: she will knock on your door in the form of a traveller asking for a glass of water. You will know it’s her because despite claiming that she is terribly thirsty, she will not touch the water you offer her. 

There are five rules you must follow when Zuriel knocks on your door. 

1. *You must let her in.*
2. *You must be friendly at all times.*
3. *You must not show that you are afraid of her.*
4. *You must not let her out of your sight.*
5. *You must not let her past the first room of your house.* 

When someone dies in a domestic accident, whispers circulate that they received a visit from Zuriel and didn’t follow the rules. Some claim to have met her and survived, but because she changes appearance every time, accounts are impossible to verify.

Many grownups would deny believing in Zuriel, but when entering a house in our town, one will usually find a glass and bottle of water kept by the front door - just in case a stranger stops by.

I am a skeptic. Or rather, I used to be until recently. 

Sure, Zuriel scared me as a child. When I heard someone knocking at my parents’ door, I would run to my room and lock myself in. Zuriel never came. 

As I got older, I did my research on her.

It turns out that a woman by the name of Zuriel really lived in our town: according to historical records, she was a “maiden of most ill-favoured countenance” who lived alone at the edge of the woods. Long suspected of being “troubled by an unclean spirit”, she was much disliked by the townsfolk. They complained that she “continually intruded upon their property”. 

In 1734, after Zuriel had not been seen for weeks, a pious old woman went to check on her: she found Zuriel’s decomposing body lying in her shed - her throat cut almost to the bone. Although some young men had been heard declaring they would “rid the town of the foul witch”, they were never prosecuted.

This haunting nonsense was the result of a sad page of History, I concluded. 

After I married and moved into a new house with my husband, he insisted on keeping a glass and a bottle of water by the front door. I did not want to, but I figured it wasn’t a matter worth fighting over.

Last Friday, at around 3pm, I had just put my son down for a nap when I heard knocking at the door. I absentmindedly opened the door to a woman of about forty whom I had never seen before. She was in hiking clothes. Not surprising - the area is known for its nature trails. 

“Hi, can I help you?”

“Hi, I’m so sorry to bother you - “

A stylish bob encircled her pleasant face. Even with sweat pearling on her forehead, she looked polished. I thought she must have come from a big city. 

“ - may I ask you for a glass of water? My bottle is empty and I am so very thirsty.”

She smiled at me apologetically.

A hiker asking for a glass of water. That’s it.

*You must let her in.*

“Of course. Please, come in.”

“Oh, that’s so kind of you. Are you sure I am not bothering you?”

“No bother at all.”

She bashfully walked through the door I held open for her.

A split-second thought crossed my mind: slam the door in her face!

I didn’t, of course. In the blink of an eye, the hiker was inside my house. 

She hovered by the entrance politely.

I turned towards the kitchen, then remembered the glass and water bottle sitting right next to me. 

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

Well, why not.

As I poured the water, she glided from the entrance to the couch and sat down. I did not like that. She must have noticed, because a flicker of guilt tightened her features.

*You must be friendly at all times.*

I responded with a bright smile, handing her the glass. That’s when I noticed that she had no backpack. No pouch. Not even a water bottle. 

I took a deep breath to push down the panic that had started swelling up. I sat in front of her.

“You’ve been hiking?”, I chirped. 

“I just did the mountain loop,” she replied enthusiastically, “It was so pretty!”

Without drinking any of it, she set the glass on her lap.

“It’s one of my favorites,” I responded.

Her fingers gripped the glass. She didn’t drink it. 

“And it’s such a nice day today”, I continued. 

“It was lovely. Almost too hot.”

Her face beamed with sweat. A drop rolled from her forehead to her chin. It fell into her lap. She still did not drink. 

My eyes snapped up to her: she was staring at me staring at her. 

*You must be friendly at all times.*

I laughed a horrendous laugh: “Yeah, I love it when it’s hot.”

She laughed along. Inside me, the adult woman disappeared, and I became that little girl who wanted to lock herself in her room again.

“Have you been in the area before?” I asked, forcing my voice to sound even.

“It’s my first time visiting,” she responded cheerfully. “Have you been living here long?”

“I was born here,” I said. Then, fearing I was lacking in amiability, I exclaimed, ”Wouldn’t want to live anywhere else!”

“Of course. Such a lovely place. And everyone seems so nice.”

Her gaze shifted to a framed photo of me, my husband and my son.

“What a cutie…” she whispered, narrowing her eyes. 

Revulsion twisted my stomach. Smash the frame in her face!, I thought. I didn’t, of course. I sat perfectly still and pushed out a timid “Thank you.”

She turned to me with a proud smile: “You know, I have a son the same age. He’s with his dad now. Unfortunately we’re divorced, but we maintain a good friendship. That’s so important for a child.”

“Oh! Yeah, so important…” I stammered, taken aback.

She stood up, leaving the glass on the coffee table. “Well, so sorry for bothering you. I’ll be on my way before it gets dark.”

A wave of relief rushed through me. “Of course, no bother at all.”

She trotted to the front door. I had to stifle a laugh: awoken from a bad dream, I was back in the land of the living. “Hope you enjoy the rest of your trip!”

Her hand pushed down the door handle, then let it back up. “One last thing,” she said, “may I use your restroom?”

Cold dread enveloped me before her words even reached my brain.

*You must not let her past the first room of your house.* 

“I’m sorry but- the restroom is out of order.”

“Is that so?” she asked, as she breezed right back to the seat in front of me. “Why?”

My pulse went wild.

“It’s clogged. We’ve had an awkward accident earlier.” I cackled.

She winked. “Whoops! I can have a look if you’d like. I’m pretty savvy with small repairs.”

“Oh no, you don’t have to. There’s a public restroom right across the street, in the park.”

I pointed at the window. My hand trembled: it was already dark outside. That was impossible. Sunset was supposed to be hours away, and she hadn’t been in my house for more than a few minutes. 

“I would love to repay your hospitality,” she insisted, eyes wide and eager.

“My husband is about to come home from work. He will do it. You know men - “ I leaned towards her, displaying the most conniving smile I could muster “They like to feel useful.“

She played along. “I get it. Since my husband left, I've had to learn to do it all by myself.”

“I admire your independence.” 

“Thank you for saying that. It means a lot.”

She seemed genuinely flattered. I was not doing too bad, I thought. 

A piercing cry arose from upstairs.

“Mooommyyyyy!!”

My son had woken up. He is an anxious baby - at two years old, he has only just started to sleep on his own. Whenever he wakes up and doesn’t find us, he goes into a panic. 

I almost shot from my seat, but managed to reel myself back in.

“Don’t you want to go to him?”, she asked me gently.

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

“That’s okay. He needs to get used to it.”

“Moooooommyyyyy!!!!”

He had a way of sounding like something absolutely terrible was happening. Which it was.

“MOOOOOMMMYYYYY-”

His voice broke. But he kept on screaming. What if he was actually hurt? 

She sat perfectly still, grinning at me. 

“Are you sure he’s okay?” Her question sounded somewhat like a threat. 

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

I nodded vigorously: “We’re training him to sleep on his own.” 

Listening to the pleas of my hurting baby was near-unbearable. I reminded myself of all the people - all the children - who had died in tragic circumstances: he broke his neck tripping down the stairs … she choked on her food… the little one drank from a bottle of bleach … “They were visited by Zuriel,” the rumors always said, “And they didn’t follow the rules.”

“I’ve never seen a mother like you,” she said.

I ignored the provocation. “How about your little one?” I had to raise my voice over my son’s cries. “Does he sleep on his own?” 

She lit up at the mention of her child. “He sleeps like an angel. My daughter, on the other hand, is like yours. She wanted to be held all the time.”

“You have a daughter, too?”

“Yes, I do,” she snapped, as if I was doubting her.

My son abruptly went silent. That alarmed me even more: why did he stop? I furiously wanted to go check on him.

“See?” I said instead, “He calmed down.”

“You’re a very interesting woman,” she responded, and shuffled forward. Her knees almost touched mine. “I’m really enjoying getting to know you.”

I did not budge, swallowing my disgust. “Me too. It’s nice to see a new face around here. Maybe… “ I jumped into the abyss. “... maybe we could be friends.”

Her eyebrows shot up, her eyes widened, her lips parted.

“I would love that,”she breathed. A rush of emotion flushed her cheeks. A web of red veins flared beneath her skin, then began to swell, morphing into elongated red warts.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“What- what do you - what did you think of the hike?”, I spluttered, desperate to fill the silence.

“It was amazingly lovely,” she trilled, while one of her eyes turned gray. “What else do you suggest I do in the area?”

I held on to that question like a life raft. “If you love nature, I would recommend the national wildlife refuge and paddleboarding on the river -” 

Her hair vanished one by one, leaving only a few dishevelled clumps on a bald head.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“ - a walk downtown is great for shopping. Aunt Rita’s Kitchen serves the best clam chowder in town - “

Her teeth blackened. Strands of yellow saliva stretched between the upper and lower arcade. 

I waged war against every one of my muscles to not look away.

“- for culture lovers, the local museum has great artifacts - “

One side of her face went moldy. A worm wriggled out of her ear and slid inside her eyesocket.

I smiled hard.

“ - and let’s not forget the Civil War battleground - “

A slit appeared on her throat, from side to side. Dark blood came pouring out, inundating her clothes, my couch, my carpet. Her head fell backwards - the wound was spread apart like two halves of a steak, exposing her sliced-off windpipe. Only a thin layer of skin kept the head from rolling away. Yet, from an absurd angle, her one eye was still set on me.

My smile did not falter.

“ - you can always catch a performance at the Arts Center - “

The lights flickered. 

“ - my personal favorites are the dance shows - “

All the lights went out with a pop, except the overhead light. It flickered desperately.

The thought of being alone in the dark with her was so terrifying my heart nearly stopped. 

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

I thought about my son sleeping peacefully in his crib. The sun rising on the ocean. A fluffy kitten drinking from a bowl of milk.

“ - for drinks there’s a little bar by the river - “

The lights went out.

I opened my mouth to scream. 

In the blink of an eye, the lights came back on. 

I sucked in the scream before it could ring out.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

She looked like a preppy forty-year-old lady hiker again. No sign of a neck wound. Her clothes were clean, so were my couch and carpet. Outside, the day was bright again. 

I allowed myself a breath of relief. Maybe this was it. I passed the test. She would be gone now.

“Thank you for that,” she said softly. “Since there’s so much to do around here, maybe I should stay a few more days.”

My throat tightened. “What a great idea.”

“Hmmm…” She looked around the room, pensively. “Do you have a guest room? I would love to stay if you’ll have me.”

Despair hooked its fingers into my insides. 

“We don’t have a guest room unfortunately. I would have loved to have you stay with us.”

“That’s a shame. What if I slept on the couch?”

“I would not want you to be uncomfortable.”

“I don’t need much. This looks perfectly comfortable.”

“My son is a rambunctious kid - .”

“So? Didn’t I tell you I am a mom too?”

“Yes -”

“You don’t believe me?”

“Yes, of course -”

I was losing ground, and I felt my energy leaving me. 

“It almost sounds like you’re making up excuses not to have me. Didn’t you say you wanted to be friends?”

“Yes, of course -”

“Mommy…”

I had not heard him come in. My son was standing in the doorframe. He clutched his teddy bear, chubby cheeks streaked with dried up tears. 

She looked just as startled as I was.

“He must have climbed out of his toddler bed,” I said, forcing cheerfulness. I held out my arms to him. “Honey, come here!” 

Instead, he directed his unsteady little feet towards her.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“Hello, little man!” she exclaimed, baring her teeth at him.

I was now trembling from head to toe. 

She stretched out her hand and wiggled her long-nailed fingers.

My son wobbled closer to her.

I wanted to scream, yank him away from her, run - but because I didn’t know what the right thing to do was, I sat still - paralyzed. 

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“Would you like me to stay here with you?” she said in a cringe-worthy baby voice. 

“No! No! Say no!” I yelled inside my head. 

My son gave her a toothless smile. That smile of pure delight only little children are capable of. She widened her grin. Pushed her demonic hand further towards him.

The room around me started shaking. Every nerve in my body twisted. 

My son put his teddy bear in her outstretched hand - like a friendship offering. 

Time stopped. 

Her mouth trembled, smile morphing into a sorrowful grimace. 

She gripped the teddy bear and brought it to her heart… Finally, she let out a long, painful breath.

“I am sure your child wants his mommy to himself,” she finally murmured. “I’ll be on my way.”

She slowly rose and set the teddy bear on the couch.

“It was great to have-”

“Thank you for your kindness.” 

She ever so lightly stroked my hand with her fingers. And then, just as swiftly as she came, she was gone.

It’s been seven days since she visited. I’ve been watching my husband and son like a hawk, expecting them to trip, fall, get burned or some other terrible thing. No one got hurt. 

Life is beginning to feel normal again.

But around 3 p.m. every afternoon, I feel a pang of pain on my hand, right where she touched me. ",1,1771523025.0,u_MrUnheimlich,0,1.0,False

Current recipe (standard orientation):

* 14 g medium-fine coffee
* 200 g water at 93°C / 199°F
* Rinse paper filter
* Add coffee, start timer
* Pour 50 g water, swirl to bloom
* At 30 seconds, pour to 200 g, gentle stir 5 times
* Cap and let steep until 1:30
* At 1:30, press slowly for \~30 seconds, stopping at the first hiss

I’m enjoying the clean cup and lighter body, but I’d like to push it a bit more toward a naturally sweet, “tea-ish” profile without losing too much clarity.

**Questions for you all:**

* Would you adjust grind coarser or finer for more sweetness in this style?
* Any favorite ratios for lighter roasts when you want that delicate, tea-like AeroPress cup?
* Do you find longer or shorter steeps work better for this kind of profile? 
* Also has anyone ever combine Tea with coffee to bring new flavors to your pallet? if up you have how did you make taste sweet?

Thanks in advance for any advice and for keeping this sub such a helpful place for AeroPress experimentation.

I (25M) went on a first date with this girl Emma (24F) from Hinge two weeks ago. It was fine, not terrible but no real spark. Coffee date, we talked for about an hour, it was pleasant enough. I texted her after saying ""thanks for meeting up"" and she said ""we should do it again!"" I said ""yeah maybe"" which I thought was pretty clear that I wasn't super interested. I didn't text her again and she didn't text me so I figured we were on the same page. Then yesterday my friend sends me a screenshot of Emma's Instagram story. It's a picture of a coffee cup with the caption ""Coffee dates with bae ❤️"" and she TAGGED ME in it. From our date. Two weeks ago.

I checked her Instagram and she's posted multiple stories referring to her ""boyfriend"" and has changed her profile to say ""taken 💕""

I DMed her like ""hey I think there's been a misunderstanding, we went on one date"" and she replied ""I know! I can't wait for our next one 😊"" I said ""I don't think we're a good match, I'm not looking to pursue this"" and she responded ""Lol okay babe whatever you say 😘""

Now she's commenting on my Instagram posts with heart emojis and changed her profile picture to a photo someone took of us at a mutual friend's party BEFORE we even matched on Hinge.

1r95u7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r95u7t/is_this_the_end_21m_21f/,Is this the end? (21M & 21F),"Hello,

I am a senior college student, 21M Seven months ago, I was broken up with. This breakup was kind of out of the blue. Random Saturday night, phone call, ""this is over"", hang up. Our relationship was nearly perfect in my opinion, but of course, there were some failures from both of us.

A little backstory: We met through a mutual friend and first talked in a bar. The connection was instant, and conversation flowed easily and quickly with plenty of laughs and smiles. This was her first experience with a relationship, and my first true love. I used to be a ""player,"" I guess lol, but this girl was the first person I truly saw a future with and genuinely loved. A month later, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and it went smoothly from there for about four months. We spent time together and never faded our connection. I walked her through her ""first time"", taking an immense amount of time making sure she was comfortable and talking her through everything. This process was about a month long, and I honestly wish someone had done this for me.

During the semester, our relationship was perfect. Once the semester ended and summer came, I undertook two internships along with a part-time restaurant job. Balancing this with a strict gym schedule and time with friends and now a girlfriend was very tough. I became inconsistent with my relationship with her in some ways, such as texting and the frequency with which I was seeing her. Although my love never faded and still pictured a future with her. Fast forward after a couple of mess-ups with my communication, and she broke up with me. Of course, she said she still loved me, but was overwhelmed with emotional stability (her first relationship), and this kind of intense love was taxing on someone unfamiliar with it.

Went no contact for around three months and then had a phone call, during which the first half hour we talked about the failures. Then unexpectedly, we stayed on the phone for another hour and a half and talked about life and everything going on with each other. Like nothing ever happened, our spark was definitely still there. We then went no contact for another three months until she saw me in a bar. She looked completely shocked that she saw me (I probably did too), and she left the bar. We locked eyes for around five seconds. She then texted me five minutes later, apologizing for the shocked look and that she hoped I would have a good night. A week later, I went on a date with a new girl, we went to a coffee shop, and my ex-girlfriend was there. Completely out of the blue.

It has now been a month since that happened.

Closing: I love this girl with every bone in my body. She loves me as well. Most days, I hope it was just the wrong timing and that we just needed time apart to grow and mature, respectively. I have undergone immense growth emotionally. I would do anything to see her again, just for a conversation. ",1,1771522987.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Related question: Is this [1,518]-word short story bagoad? bad? good?","Here came a young man, stepping inside a library, kicking the snow off his feet. He was wearing a topcoat, a hat, and holding an umbrella. He stood there on the welcome mat for a moment, staring at his feet, before he finally moved, first in small circles and then, stopping, seeming to see someone on the top floor, he smiled, walked deeper inside the library.

Who he saw was an angel, floating near the ceiling. Had seen her floating in the sky and followed her in here, and no one was even trying to catch her except him! But reaching the top floor, he couldn't find her, so maybe, he figured, ah, maybe someone else—wait—that beautiful woman over there at that table, was she her? 

The young man approached her, but when she looked up at him from her book, he bent down to fiddle with his shoes, smacking them with his palms, which were sweating, and muttered: ""These things …! Ah they, they really""—he gulped, cleared his throat—""they …"" He groped for the right word, something that would get her, would capture her heart or something, quickly!—""*They miscarried!*""

The woman was taken aback. Miscarried? She blinked, not wanting to flip out, not here, no, not in the middle of the sidewalk, where people rushed about past them, but wow. Miscarried. So. She set her teeth: So he thought the two miscarriages were funny. Wow. So he'd do anything to get under her skin, or no. No he *had* already done everything, and now, watching him crouch there hunched over his shoe—miscarried!—she snapped shut the book in her hands, held it up and slammed it down against his head while wailing and *ugh!* This child! She was stuck with a *child!* Who she beat with this book over and over—*miscarried!*

When she stopped, the man got up and, his face flushed, his brows fluttering, he grabbed the umbrella, thrust its tip against her stomach. It opened and slammed against her face, throwing her backward  into a crowd, where she got swept along in the rush. Stumbling, spinning, getting a view of moving legs of bobbing heads of hats, she grasped for the shoulders around her to keep from falling, but then found herself in the arms of an old man who was carrying her along, his face inches away from hers. He smiled. His teeth were stained. Brown. His breath stunk. 

""Oh!"" he said, his steps brisk as he carried her off the curb and across another street, and clapped a palm on his mouth, saying into it: ""Sorry! I had a whole lot of coffee today! Big day, so I had to get myself fired up you know? I'm taking an antidepressant—Wellbutrin? Have you heard of Wellbutrin? Well, it's an antidepressant *and* a stimulant, so, you take that and wash it down with coffee, and it gets you fired up, I suppose, but why oh come on …"" By now his palm was covered with spit so, turning a corner out of the crowd's path and heading into that forest there in front of him where they'd finally be alone, he wrapped the woman with his free arm and clapped his other palm on his mouth and continued: ""Sorry about that. *So*! why was I drinking a ton? Well, my son—but I don't want to spoil it for him! It's silly, I know, but I always worry that, by speaking something into world, wrestling it out of my head and inserting it into reality, what I say will have a modifying effect on reality itself, even though I *know*, rationally, that it won't! Here we are.""

In a forest, he let her fall to the ground on her back at a door—a shack door—and he strode over her and opened it to go inside. 

And she lay flat out on the grass where she had no idea what was, what … what even was this? Why did she have to keep it going? *Did* she? But God willing—what was she saying?—God willing she would roll over on her side to face the shack, which she now glanced towards.

Framed by the open door, the man stood there with his back towards her, thrust a hand in his pocket, and pulled a phone out to make a call.

""David! Yeah. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry, no. No I don't think I'm going to make it."" He looked back over his shoulder at her, then looked away. ""Yes. And this one might be my magnum opus. No! *No!* Do you really think—? David, I want to see you get married—I was fucking mixin' pills all night tryin' to keep myself fired up! You think I was doing that for my health? *No!* There won't be anyone like her! *Yes*. Yes. Her. She's beautiful. An angel."" 

While he talked, she pushed herself up from the ground and looked around to find she was in a circle of grass surrounded by trees. No, it was closed off by them, because where was the path? She wondered if there even was one. But then how did they get here? Yeah. How? She couldn't remember. Couldn't even remember what happened today. God willing, though, she would remember, maybe, maybe the path was somewhere here: She trudged along the trees looking for it, looking for a reason to go on, hearing a voice, yes, somewhere deep in the woods, a voice, or was it two? Yes, two, it was two voices! 

She jumped up, shouted: ""Hey!"" and ran in their direction towards the woods, slipping through the dark forest, scrambling through the trees and bushes, yelling, ""*Help! Help!*"" as their voices got louder, and up ahead a light shined through from between two trees, which she passed through and emerged out of: Ah! Sunlight! And underfoot, grass. Ah.

This was another circle of grass. Where there was a shack.

Inside: The old man, speaking into his phone. Turning around. His face dropping. He said: 

""Oh my God! Hold on, David, I'll call you later, sorry,"" and hanging up he crossed over to her and waved at her clothes, which (she saw, looking down) were torn, muddied, covered with blood. ""What the Hell happened? Where'd you—? Jesus! Can you *stop* running away?"" 

He grabbed her hand, dragged her into the house up the stairs and into her room, where he said: 

""Just get some rest. There we go. Sleep. For an hour, at least. Please. Okay?"" 

But from her pillow, his wife just blinked, her face aged, forehead wrinkled, cheeks hollow. God. He wished to Hell she'd just die, for her own sake, and left the room closing the door behind him, locking it this time, because she was just going to leave again if he left it unlocked. Which reminded him of her bloody clothes, her wounds—*her*, this crazy woman, what the Hell happened?

Making his way to the front room, breathing heavily, it came to him that, well, with her like this—his magnum opus, he used to call her, but now!—what now? 

He sighed and dropped down into the chair facing the window and let out a breath, a tired breath, maybe,—yes, it was that, wasn't it? The tired breath of an old man. Or, rather, the breath of a tired man …? Or—? He pushed the thought out of his mind before it spiralled out of control (he could go on like this for hours), and then forced himself to keep his mind on what had happened, on his wife's torn clothes, covered with blood and mud, and how was he going to explain that to her doctor?

Oh fuck it! He jumped to his feet, made up his mind to take a walk. Didn't matter if his wife went crazy in her room because *he* was going to go crazy sitting here in *this* dark miserable damn room, sitting here unused, misused, dis—and enough, he told himself as he snatched his coat off the back of a chair and grabbed his hat and stormed out of the front door and down the sidewalk, *enough* with all these sentence analyses. Just needed to keep this going, no matter what. Couldn't stop, no, couldn't stop, couldn't stop.

Yes, analyses, the young man knew, frivolous analyses of the type that he was drowning himself in, they, they really …! They …! The young man groped for the right word as he peered from behind the library's potted plant at the woman sitting at that table there. He wondered if she knew what the right word was. If he wrote down the sentence he was working on on a piece of paper and gave it to her, would she be able to fill in the blank? 

ANALYSES, THEY REALLY … ? 

But would that be plagiarism? Plagiary? Well, it didn't matter, anyway. He didn't want to look like a weirdo in a front of her, so that idea wasn't feasible. Viable. Permissible.

📍 3/F, M.T. Building, Lopez Jaena St, Mandaue, 6014 Cebu

🕕 12PM - 9PM

I would like to preface this by saying that I really ***really*** wanted to like this place. As someone who likes Jane Austen shit, Bridgerton stuff and vintage feels, Elinor looked like what I'm just looking for on paper. That—and coupled with the high reviews on Google—made me have certain expectations for this place.

My bad, I probably expected too much.

**Disclaimer**: we had this experience on Valentine's Day, so I always give establishments the benefit of the doubt when their service is shitty on days when everyone goes out to eat (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.). There were definitely a lot of people who arrived and I think the waiters were not prepared for the volume.

Let me just point out a few things before I rate the food:

🖊**️History**: This used to be an old space turned Airbnb as indicated in this Keeta article [here](https://keeta.ph/belonging-at-elinor-a-congregator-of-creatives-and-a-travelers-dream-straight-from-the-victorian-era/). And then it recently became a restaurant.

🖊**️Getting there**: You'll find Elinor on the third floor of this super yellow building. There are signages to help you in finding the place, but the flight of stairs going up is very steep. Be careful with the landing!

🖊**️Parking**: there is parking at the back of the building, but it has limited slots. In addition, the ground is not developed, so please wear something comfortable when you come here (be careful when wearing stilettos).

🖊**️MOP**: cash, Gcash and cards are accepted

🖊**️Smoking area**: 4th floor (pero init daw kaayo)

**What we ordered:**

**On Coffee**

Google reviews say that coffee here was 'good' and 'superb', and there is a claim the coffee here was by The Daily Grind.  It is unfortunate that my SO and I are coffee enthusiasts because we deemed our coffees abysmal.

☕**️Flat White (₱130)**: Barista flow was less than ideal. The portafilter was not cleaned before it was used for the next shot. They used pre-ground coffee. No calibration. Milk was over-steamed; you could hear the steaming from the other side of the room, and even with a crowd inside. And the most glaring lapse: a 8oz cup was used which means: this is not a flat white, this is a latte. So the result is a steaming cup of very hot latte with milk texture that is uneven *(nag-tibogo*l per the local dialect) and because the ratios are all wrong, the heated milk overpowers the coffee so much you can't taste it. Actually, the heat overpowers everythinggg. ⭐

A place that does not know the difference between a flat white and a latte is not worth money for coffee.

☕**️TDG Signature (₱180)**: Better than the flatte above, but nothing mindblowing. It's a cold white brew. ⭐⭐⭐

🧆**Beef Tapa (₱200):** Rice tasted burnt. Tapa tasted under-seasoned and had a tough texture. Only thing they did right was the egg. ⭐⭐⭐

🧆**Beef Salpicao (₱350):** Rice also tasted burnt. Beef was tough and lacked seasoning; there's a bit of garlic in there, but I'm missing the olive oil. It's more of a bistek than a salpicao. It's served together with a sunny side up egg and some atchara. To its credit, the egg was ok. ⭐⭐

**Other things to rate:**

🖊️Service: ⭐⭐

Waiting time: 45 minutes (I will chalk this up to Valentine's Day)

Bus time: 6:50 minutes

(Apologies for rambling, but I had 45 minutes of wait time to observe oof)

Floor staff was generally unorganized. Despite the number of customers, there was no one up front keeping tabs on who arrived first, so some groups who arrived later were seated first before those who arrived earlier. Only one or two people knew what was going on. One waiter would say one thing (kitchen was closed for orders), and another waiter would be surprised. I also did not notice a POS system in the area, so waiters were relying on torn notepads for the table seating.

There was no floor strategy/structure on serving the tables. A common strategy in F&B is to have every waiter have ""posts"" or their own jurisdiction (so people on the first quadrant was assigned to waiter x, second quadrant to waiter y, etc), but here, you'll have 1 waiter do the bussing, 2 waiters to take the orders, then another one to serve.

There was a time when the waiters argued on what item should be served to table 7. For this one, though, I would not put the blame on the waiters since the group changed tables without informing the staff (in any restaurant, please let the staff know that you are moving tables! They are keeping tab on your tables, not necessarily on you.).

Kudos to the two waiters though who tried their best to keep the place running even with the number of people!

🖊**️Pricing**: ⭐⭐⭐

Coffee and food pricing is comparable to other coffee shops offering the same, may even be lower than some (lower than the price points of Tightrope, Commonly Uncommon and Dosage, but similar to the price points of say, Kvyn's Coffeebar, 8th of September and some items on Cafe Brindle).

Still, the wine pricing is higher than others (like Garden of Envy) and the markup is a bit higher than the industry standard of 30% on sales. Let's take for example Chevalier Blanc, which is on [D+B Wines for P630](https://dplusbwines.com/collections/less-than-p1-000/products/chevalier-brut-blanc-de-blancs?variant=45411111698581) but sold here at ₱1,200–that's 47.5% markup on sales. Also, if I'm buying wine by the bottle at the price point of Elinor, I'd appreciate it if they indicated the years.

I tried posting on AskGayBros where it seems to come up a lot but it kept getting removed - maybe they somehow know that I'm actually bi... Anyway, mine was done with local anesthesia 6 weeks ago. While it was definitely an uncomfortable recovery and I'm still not 100%, I'm glad I did it. More info and pics below if you're interested.

**Some background:** I had a ton of gastro issues as a kid due to an unhealthy diet, which resulted in a medium-sized perianal skin tag developing at the back part of my anus that I lived with for years and years. Doctors assured me it was harmless and purely aesthetic, but wiping sucked and took forever, and I was always soo self-conscious of how it looked recently as a bottom. Finally in my 30s, I got the courage to ask my PCP, who referred me to a colorectal surgeon. Everything was covered under insurance since I associated it to mild pain and discomfort from it being in the way. All in, my cost was about $700 total (USA).

**Removal (Week 0):** I was honestly pretty nervous. I had heard that some tags needed a more involved surgery, especially if the tag is integrated with an external hemorrhoid. The doctor came in, took a look, and said it would be a fairly straightforward removal and could be done right in the office. I forgot to take a before picture, but it was just a chunk of exposed skin about 0.5 inches in size.

I agreed to just get it over with. He started with a local anesthetic shot right at my anus. That was by far the worst pain, but only lasted for about 5 seconds. Then he got out the scalpel, secured everything in place, and made the cut. I couldn't really feel anything down there at this point, just pressure. Then he applied silver nitrate to treat and cauterize the wound. Again, no pain. I put on an ice pack in between my underwear and pants and headed home.

Everything slowly started wearing off about 30 mins later, which peaked around an hour or two later. I was advised that I could do pretty much anything that felt comfortable, showering, working, but nothing high intensity (not that I'd want to). I rested a lot on the first day, alternated Tylenol and Advil, and it was probably the most painful day of recovery. The next morning's poop was no joke either. Lots of blood and lots of pain. Luckily I've gotten into a pretty regular schedule helped by coffee and/or tea in the morning to get things moving. If you deal with constipation, it may be a much different story. Then I would use the handheld sprayer in the shower to clean everything off, which helped a lot! A sitz bath is another option I was recommended to try but never did.

**Week 1 Recovery:** Days 2-3 were similar in overall pain level. Very uncomfortable throughout the day and a lot of inflammation. Tylenol and Advil didn't help much as the pain was more of an annoyance rather than true pain at that point. Ice packs were also just annoying to get positioned correctly, so I gave up on those. There was slow continual bleeding so I kept swapping out new sections of gauze (which wasn't necessary, but helped me feel like I wasn't just bleeding into my underwear all day).

Towards the end of week 1, I started noticing a smell, sort of like rotting fish. I was worried it was getting infected. There was also an unpleasant dark gray substance all around the wound. I called the doctor, who assured me that infections are very rare given the use of silver nitrate, which was probably the cause of the smell from that cauterized skin in the process of coming out. It was sort of like a wet scab that was slowly falling off. Really gross, but pulling on it only made it hurt more. Luckily, it came out just after the one week mark.

**Week 2 Recovery:** Week 2 was much better. The consistent pain had stopped and it only hurt to poop. The smell dissipated by the end of the week and all the gross gray globs finally came out, exposing bright pink new skin. Bleeding continued but stopped by the end of week 2.

**Week 3 Recovery:** There was only slight pain when pooping and sometimes mild bleeding afterwards, but otherwise no maintenance needed. I could finally wipe well enough that I didn't need to immediately shower afterwards. And I finally realized how much easier it was to wipe compared to when I had the skin tag in the way. I also noticed that the swelling started to go down quite a bit.

**Week 4 Recovery:** Everything started to finally return to normal. I was really scared given how inflamed the area was the past month, but now everything was shrinking back. The area was still sensitive to the touch and still healing, but overall looking much better.

**Week 5 and 6 Recovery:** By the end of week 5, it no longer hurt to touch or push on the area. I cautiously started using a vibrating toy and it went ok, but there was some mild discomfort. Now at the end of week 6, I'm slowly building the confidence to try more, but I can tell the area is still very sensitive. I'm pretty confident I'll be able to bottom again by week 8 or so, but we'll see.

If you're morbidly curious, I have pictures from Weeks 4, 3, 2, 1, and day after here (very NSFW!): [https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1qxxz5l/33\_male\_usa\_skin\_tag\_removal\_progress\_over\_4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1qxxz5l/33_male_usa_skin_tag_removal_progress_over_4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Overall, its no joke - the first 4 weeks suck. But the way I see it, that month of pain was completely worth the next 50 years of easier poops. I thought it wouldn't be that big of a difference, but WOW, it's crazy going from sometimes 10+ wipes a poop to now only 1 or 2. And obviously as a bottom, I am no longer self-conscious. That's not to say its a problem if you do have a skin tag - it is harmless after all, but if you've been debating getting it removed, hopefully this will give you more confidence to decide whether its worth it for you!",1,1771522562.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

A quick operational tip for any business owners running a fleet of 10+ vehicles. Up until last year, our end-of-month accounting was an absolute nightmare. My desk was buried in faded, coffee-stained gas receipts from a dozen different local stations. Drivers would lose them, forget to write down the odometer readings, and our bookkeeper was spending over a dozen hours a month just chasing down transaction data.

We finally decided to centralize everything and moved our entire fleet over to the **Ricochet Fuel** card program.

**The Administrative ROI:**

* **Zero Paperwork:** The physical receipts are entirely obsolete. All transaction data routes directly into a single digital dashboard.
* **Hard Constraints:** We programmed the cards to only authorize fuel purchases. It automatically declines in-store purchases (snacks, drinks, etc.), which instantly cleaned up our expense reports.
* **Automated IFTA Reporting:** For the larger trucks, the system automatically captures the state-by-state data needed for our fuel tax reporting, saving our CPA a massive headache.

This led me to a line of thinking about how lava lamps could be improved with safety mechanisms to prevent this type of thing. This is already a solved problem in the world of space heaters, so I started there.

Space heaters use either a tip over switch internally or a pressure switch on the bottom to cut the power if the unit tips over. This switch is simply wired in-line with the hot wire, so there's no bypass. These switches are fairly cheap, between $5 - $15 each depending on your vendor, and probably under $1 each if installed in a factory setting.

It seems to me this same kind of thing could be implemented into the base of a lava lamp. A tip over switch could be installed internally such that the outward appearance is unchanged, if there's enough room. A pressure switch could also be installed in the bottom, and it would be visible when lifting the lamp up, but wouldn't be visible once the lamp is upright. A pressure switch is a more compact mechanism, so it would fit in even the smallest of lamp bases.

I was hoping to find a commercial product that was simply a platform with a pressure switch in the bottom that a lava lamp could be placed on, but I haven't been able to find anything like that (I have a coffee mug warmer that works this way, just powering a heating element instead of a lamp). Seems simple enough to build, so I might give that a try.

While we're at it, might as well build in the dimmer switch that these lava lamps all seem to need, eh?

BTW, for anyone interested, I also found out in my research that there's two different types of tip over switches, one that's shaped like a U with a metal ring around it, and the bottom part of the U is non-conductive, and the vertical sides are conductive. The other uses a steel ball in a plastic cage, and the steel normally bridges two conductors to pass the current along if the device is upright, but will roll out of place and break the circuit if the device is tipped. So both use gravity as the primary control mechanism, and are fairly simple in design.

Other approaches that I've considered but seem overly complicated or not viable: vibration sensors that kill the power if there's too much vibration (might have a lot of false positives from people walking by), motion sensors that kill the power if they 'see' the lava lamp fall over (again, how would you prevent them from seeing other movement in the room?), camera with visual analysis watching for the lava lamps to fall over (way more complex than it needs to be).

**He teases you, but it's never mean spirited.** This isn't just playground behavior. Relationship expert Matthew Hussey explains in his work that playful teasing is actually a form of emotional intimacy. When a guy teases you about that embarrassing story you told or gives you a hard time about your music taste, he's creating a private dynamic between you two. It's his way of saying ""we have something special here"" without being vulnerable. The key difference? It never crosses into disrespect. He's not mocking your insecurities, he's playing with surface level stuff because he feels comfortable around you.

**He gets weirdly specific about future plans.** Not the vague ""we should hang out sometime"" that never materializes. I'm talking about ""there's this new Thai place opening next month, you'd love their pad see ew based on what you said about hating peanut sauce."" When someone's genuinely interested, their brain unconsciously projects you into their future timeline. According to behavioral psychology research, this future oriented language indicates investment. He's mentally making space for you in his life, even if he hasn't fully realized it himself.

**His body literally turns toward you in group settings.** Forget analyzing his texts. Watch his feet and torso when you're both in a group. Social psychology studies show that we unconsciously orient our bodies toward what we're most interested in. If you're at a party and his chest faces you even when he's talking to someone else, or his feet point your way across the room, that's involuntary attraction. Our bodies betray us before our words ever do. It's some primal limbic system stuff we can't really control.

**He remembers throwaway comments you made weeks ago.** Not just the big stuff, the random details. You mentioned your mom makes this specific casserole when you're sick, and three weeks later he asks how you're feeling and references it. Or he brings up that obscure band you mentioned once in passing. This isn't about having a good memory, it's about you occupying mental real estate in his brain. Research on memory and attraction shows we unconsciously prioritize and store information about people we're drawn to. Your words are sticking because he's actually listening on a deeper level.

If you want to go deeper on dating psychology but don't have the energy to read through entire relationship books, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's built by Columbia alumni and pulls from relationship experts like Matthew Hussey, psychology research, and dating coaches to create custom audio content based on your specific situation. 

You can type in something like ""I'm an introvert trying to read attraction signals better"" and it'll generate a learning plan with podcasts tailored to you. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's even this smoky, conversational tone that makes listening way more engaging than reading dense psychology papers. It's made understanding this stuff way less overwhelming.

**He finds excuses for physical proximity that aren't overtly sexual.** Sitting close enough that your legs touch. Touching your arm when he's emphasizing a point. Fixing your necklace clasp or brushing something off your shoulder. Matthew Hussey calls these ""plausibly deniable touches"" in his book Get The Guy. They're ways of testing physical chemistry and creating intimacy without the risk of outright rejection. It's essentially asking ""is this okay?"" without words. These small touches release oxytocin, the bonding hormone, and if he's initiating them, he's trying to build that connection.

**His friends act weird around you.** They smirk when you show up. They make inside jokes that clearly reference you. They suddenly disappear when you two are talking. This is honestly one of the most reliable signs because his friends know. Men tell their close friends when they're into someone, and those friends can't help but be fucking obvious about it. If his crew treats you differently than other women in the group, it's because they've heard your name in private conversations.

**He gets slightly awkward or flustered sometimes, especially early on.** Confidence is attractive, sure, but perfect composure around someone you're into? That's actually unusual. Real attraction creates nervous system arousal, literally the same physiological response as anxiety. According to research in attachment psychology, when we're around someone we're genuinely interested in (not just physically attracted to), we experience vulnerability that can manifest as awkwardness. If he occasionally stumbles over words around you, seems unusually self conscious, or laughs a bit too hard at something that wasn't that funny, his nervous system is revealing what his mouth won't say yet.

Look, the reality is that modern dating is complicated. We're fighting against evolutionary biology that didn't account for texting anxiety and social media stalking. We're navigating social scripts that tell men to pursue but not too aggressively, and tell women to be receptive but not too available. It's exhausting.

But understanding these genuine behavioral indicators can cut through the noise. They're rooted in psychology and biology, not pop culture nonsense about playing hard to get or waiting three days to text back. If you're seeing multiple these signs, there's likely something real there. And if you're not? That's valuable information too. You deserve someone who's unambiguously interested, not someone you need to decode like the fucking Rosetta Stone.

The most important thing is trusting your gut while staying grounded in observable behavior. Your intuition combined with these psychological patterns will tell you way more than overthinking ever will.",1,1771522126.0,RelationalPatterns,0,1.0,False

**Preface**

My partner and I are based in Germany and sometimes joke that we cycle so that we can eat more. So, everything you’ll read from here is written from a German perspective and by someone, for whom starting at 9.00 is already early. Our daily distance is usually between 50 and 80 km, mostly around 65 km. We are very leisurely cyclists. If you’re a seasoned road cyclists from SEA or any more mountainous region than Northern Germany, some things in this guide might seem very obvious to you.

**Traffic in Taiwan**

When coming from Germany, Taiwanese traffic is overwhelming, chaotic and a lot more relaxed all at the same time. Average speed is a lot slower than in Germany. In and around cities traffic is quite slow due to frequent traffic jams and traffic lights. On narrow, winding roads cars and trucks will either wait until they can overtake or at least give you a warning. However, be wary of coaches and busses – those usually drive like crazy and you should be hyper focused when they are trying to pass you as they will not care about cutting you off. While German drivers often give you the feeling that they are at least okay with (and some even willing to) accidentally kill you because you dare to cycle on the road, that never happened to us in Taiwan. In contrast to Germany, I’d also estimate that trucks usually drive on the left lane, if there are two lanes for each direction, thus giving you more space on the bike.

**Peculiarities of traffic**

The road signs in Taiwan usually give the distance to the next township border, but not to the actual town center. While a sign in Germany saying “Munich – 22 kilometers” means that you’ll reach the very central Marienplatz in 22 kilometers, the same sign in “Taiwanese” means that you just crossed the border of the township (comparably to “Landkreis”). The next city with 7-11 can still be very far away. Keep looking for signs that say “Central Jiji – 15 km” to know how far the next bigger town is.

While in Germany nearly every one-way road can be used by cyclists in the opposite direction, that’s not the case in Taiwan. In some smaller lanes you might get away with it, but usually there’s a reason why a street is one-way only. We tried to shorten the way to the hotel in Keelung by going against traffic. Even pushing the bikes was annoying, because there were no sidewalks, but a lot of traffic. So, stick to the given direction.

When there’s a line at a traffic light, you can pass by the waiting cars and just ride to the front of the line. At all bigger crossings, there’s usually a painted box for scooters and cyclists to wait.

Sometimes, there will only be a flashing light at intersections instead of a traffic light. Orange light usually means that you have the right of way, while red light means that you have to give way to passing traffic.

**Random acts of kindness**

Taiwanese people are extremely kind. On of the cutest things is that strangers will just randomly shout “Jiayou”, meaning “You can do it” or “Don’t ive up”, while you’re struggling to climb that hill. Whenever you’re contemplating your route choices, a random Taiwanese person will appear and cheer on you. People in cars or on scooters will also wave, give you thumbs up or encouragingly honk at you while passing.

It also occurred that people would give us fruits or other snacks for free, when they saw us with the bikes.

**Taking the train**

You can push your bike as it is onto local and fast local trains. Just go to the ticket counter and buy a ticket for yourself and your bike. It’s not possible to reserve bike spaces in advance, however we always got a ticket. The ticket will indicate whether you have to board the first or last car. Some coaches have bike racks where you hang your bike, while on others you just park it in front of you. All elevators we used were spacious and usually fit two bikes very neatly, some fit even three bikes. When entering and exiting the platform area, staff were usually already waiting to open the bigger ticket gate for us.

If you want to take your bike on the TRA Express trains or on the HSR, you have to pack and probably also disassemble your bike. We haven’t done this, so I don’t know how much space there is for a bagged bike. I’ve once took the HSR without a bike and luggage space seemed very limited, so the local trains might be a better option.

**Route planning**

Take some time – either before you arrive or each night before the next stage – and plan your route for the next day. Take some time to go through blogs and roam Maps and Streetview to find the route that suits your cycling style best. Otherwise, you might miss the best parts of Taiwan.

If you’re a seasoned road cyclist and want to encircle Taiwan as fast as possible, then the National Cycle Route 1 is probably your best option, however you will share the road with cars and heavy trucks for most of the time.

If that’s not you, please take the time to look for alternatives. The NCR 1 has more than a dozen branches that will lead through more remote areas. We did some of them and they were usually great. There’s also a number of other sign-posted routes like “Cycle Route 45”, however we usually stumbled upon those by accident. Maybe they are routes developed by the local township? I have unfortunately no idea how to get the gpx of those routes or if there’s any overview of those local routes. That’s a shame because our planned tracks followed some of those routes and they were usually great.

However, the best resource for great routes in Taiwan is the blog “Station in the Valley”. Nathan Miller and Mark Roche started a project to collect the 100 best climbs for cyclists in Taiwan, akin to the 100 best climbs for mountaineers. Their routes were a really good alternative to the National Cycle Routes: Calm hinterland roads, without much traffic, great scenery and leading you off the beaten path. They will provide you with a gpx, info on traffic, where to pick up supplies and so much more. If you ever find a promising route on Maps, go and check on “Station in the Valley”. As for me, they had info on all streets that I wanted to cycle.

Other than that, we used a mix of Komoot and Google Maps, which worked really well. Google had the tendency to venture off the numbered county roads and provincial highway and suggested taking some tiny agricultural roads to skip a few kilometers. In those cases, we decided to ignore Google. It also loved to send us to various streets called “Dumpster Truck roads”, where they were digging for sand. Don’t. So, when using a Google route, check it beforehand to make sure there are no weird shortcuts.

If you’re still unsure about traffic conditions: Google Streetview has mapped the whole country. Additionally, this website by the National Traffic Coordination shows you all ongoing construction works, road closures and you can even access the live footage from all the traffic cameras on National Highways. From a German, data privacy-savvy perspective, that’s of course absolutely horrible, but for cycling it was amazing.

**Indigenous people of Taiwan**

The great thing about cycling in Taiwan is that you will very likely go through many villages that have an aboriginal majority. You will notice them by the churches that suddenly pop up, as most aboriginal tribes in Taiwan are Christian. The west coast and Nantou County both have a big share of indigenous population.

If you want to learn more about their history and culture, I can fully recommend the National Museum of Prehistory in Taitung. The name is debatable, but the exhibition is great. One part features archaeological findings and the first settlements in Taiwan, the other half dives into modern aboriginal history, culture, struggles, politics, religion. It’s awesome, believe me. The exhibition is state of the art with many interactive elements, games and it’s fully translated into English.

Going through all the remote villages also gives you the chance to taste some of their native cuisines. We tried and can recommend:

There are many more places, but we didn’t get the chance to try them. If you’re interested, contact the Hualian tourist information, they are trying to position the county as a slow food, slow travel destination.

Once a year, there’s also the Fali Fali festival in Matalin Cultural Park in Yuli Township. If you happen to cycle there, when the festival takes place, definitely cancel your plans and stay for the day. The festival brings together indigenous musicians from Taiwan and Austronesia. It’s a great celebration of their culture and brings also many food stands from indigenous cooks together.

We happened to pass by on accident and stayed for the whole day. The music was lovely, but our highlight was definitely to try all the different food offered.

**Climbing**

Remember that whenever you go up, you’ll also have to go down at some point. That might seem very obvious, but what can be a nice, long but modest climb can be a very steep, curvy downhill on the other side of the mountain. Carefully check the gradient of your planned route and make sure you’re comfortable with the downhill.

At least for us, Komoot tended to drastically over-estimate gradients. Where Komoot saw a gradient of 20 or 25 %, we in reality only 10 % or maximum 12 % incline. So, take Komoot numbers with a grain of salt.

If you’re not used to climbing and your knees start to hurt, try moving your saddle forward. Apparently, that gives you a better angle, according to our bike shop owner. We tried and it worked.

**Taroko Gorge**

Taroko Gorge is definitely one of the top tourist attractions in Taiwan, however it was badly damaged in an earthquake in April 2024. Renovation is ongoing. Highway No 8 leads all the way from the visitor center to Tianxiang Recreation center, the whole ride is around 25 km with a bit of elevation. Especially in the beginning there are quite a few tunnels to go through, however most with light.

So, can you cycle there? Short answer: Yes, you can. Should you? That’s a different question.

The road is open, however only for certain times. In December 2025 those were: 6.30 – 8, 10.00, 12-13, 15.00, 17.00-17.30. Check here for the current times: https://www.taroko.gov.tw/. You can pass the roadblocks at the visitor center and at the Tianxiang Recreation area only during these times. If you miss them, you have to wait for the next slot. Between 17.30 and 6 the next morning, the road is closed for all traffic. You can pass by car, bus and by cycle. However, on the website the administration warns of frequent rockfalls, landslides and asks to refrain from all unnecessary trips.

Is your cycling trip necessary? That’s what you have to make up on your own. We rode all the way from the visitor center to TianXiang Recreation area and honestly, I’m still a bit conflicted. Because, honestly, the ride was amazing. Even though all hikes are still closed, the sheer view from the road is already breathtaking. The highway is just a marvel of engineering. And while those opening times might initially sound off-putting, they are the biggest gift for cyclists. We passed the first roadblock at 7:55 in the morning, just before closing time. Then we had two hours where we had the road all for ourselves. All cars had to wait until 10.00 for the next opening. Given the super narrow road, I was quite relieved that I didn’t have to share it with cars or even buses. There was an occasional construction truck, but for that we’d just stop.

The temple at Tianxiang Recreation area is open for a visit as are some of the small shops there. However, the whole parking lot has been taken over by monkeys, which became very, very bold. We decided not to leave our bikes there, as we were afraid that the monkeys would fiddle with them. In the end, we left them at the bridge that leads to the temple and had lunch there without getting robbed by monkeys. 

**Suhua Highway**

In short: Go and ride it, at least the part between Hanben and Nanao! For the remainder, take the train, but please, ride from Hanben to Nanao.

The Suhua Highway, also known as Provincial Highway 9 between Hualien and Sua’o, is somewhat infamous: The most stunning views of the ocean and cliffs vs. near-death experiences in the tunnels. It’s part of the NC 1, but many guides tell you to skip it. The Giant tour groups apparently even force cyclists on the train. So, should you ride it or skip it?

As always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. There are sections, which I would never ever ride – however I am also quite risk adverse, and there are sections which were the most beautiful part of our trip. Since 2020 new tunnels have been opened that now divert the majority of traffic from the old Suhua Highway. That leaves those parts of the old Highway as a de-facto premium cycle path. However, some parts are still shared with main traffic but without nasty tunnels.

So, what are your options if you want the view but not the traffic?

Option 1 – you don’t want any cars: Take the train from Hualien to Hanben, get off there and cycle approx. 30 kilometers to Nanao. Check before the traffic website to make sure that the tunnels are not closed which would result in lots of cars. But if all tunnels are working, you will have the whole road for yourself. Take enough snacks, as there is nothing until you reach Nanao. From Nanao take the train to Dongao and then continue to cycle to Suhao. Keep in mind that while you are following the coast, there is quite some elevation to cover.

Option 2 – you’re okay with some cars: Take the train from Hualien to either Horen or Heping station. When we booked the train tickets, they didn’t let us exit at Horen, so we had to get off at Heping. We then tried to backtrack to Horen with the intention of going all the way to Daqingshui Recreation Area. However, the old highway was blocked due to rockfall, and we didn’t feel like taking the tunnel, which does have a separate bike lane. I’ve heard that this stretch is extremely beautiful, so you should definitely see if the road is open again. The view from Heping onwards is nevertheless amazing. Continue all the way to Nanao, take the train to Dongoa and then continue to Suhao.

**Provincial Highway 21**

If cycling up to Wuling seems too exhausting and Alishan has too many coaches for your likings, but you still want to go in the mountains, that Provicinial Highway 21 is a great alternative. Mark Rutte from “Station in the Valley” called it a “climb that also non-climbers can confidently approach”. As that sounded like us, we decided to go for it. The southern part of Provincial Highway 21 will lead you from Shuili Township to the Tataka Visitor Center at 2631 m high. The trip is 80 km long one way. You technically could continue from Tataka to Alishan and further to Chiayi, however, we decided to stick to 21.

However, as we’re slow and not experienced climbers, we decided to do this as a three-day thing: one day from Shuili to Kalibuan village, staying there overnight, riding to Tataka without luggage, going back to Kalibuan for another night and then descending on third day back to Shuili and further.

For us, that was definitely the best option. Even 40 km straight uphill were a totally new experience for us and somewhat meditative. In the end we didn’t make it all the way to Tataka and at 2300 meters high decided to turn back. Neverthelesss, it was still a great ride with amazing views.

From Shuili onwards there is quite a bit of traffic with dumpster trucks, as they are exploiting sand from the river. The road is quite narrow without a real shoulder, so be careful there. However, after passing through Xinyi township, their number greatly reduces. You can also try to get through this stretch between 12 and 1, as most truck drivers will have their lunch break then.

The last 7/11 is at the intersection to Kalibuan, after that you’re more or less on your own. There are few tea houses on the road, but those were closed when we passed. So, make sur that you have enough water as there will be no opportunity to fill it up.

Keep in mind that there’s a gate at the 110-k marker, which is closed from 17.00 to 7.00 the next morning, so make sure you’re on time when going back.

**East Rift Valley: County Rd. 197 and 193**

When travelling along the West coast, provincial highway 9 (through the East Rift Valley) and 11 (along the coast) seem like your obvious choices. However, those also mean lots of traffic. Nicer alternatives are County Rd. 197 and 193 that will lead you through the East Rift Valley with minimal traffic. Compared to other roads, they are quite flat, there afre frequent villages with coffee places, police stations for water and toilets and some small shops. The view is amazing: rice paddies, mountains to your left and right.

The 193 is also a great alternative, as the bridge over the Matai’an River close to Guangfu on Provincial Highway 9 was still closed when we travelled there.

That only applies to Yuemei village, though. In December, the northern part of 193 between Yuemei and Hualien Bridge/Provincial Highway 11, was closed for car traffic due to construction works. The workers let us pass, but we soon discovered why there was no one else there: Whole lanes have been washed away, and the ground seemed quite unstable. If we had known this before, we probably would have taken the 11, but alas, as they let us through … The road that was still there was great to ride, but I wouldn’t do this during or after rain.

**Food and drinks**

Taiwan is the country of convenience stores. However, that’s only true for the denser populated areas. You will definitely find stretches without a convenience store for 20 or 30 kilometers. That’s why we always had some emergency snacks with us.

No stores, coffee places or anything else can happen:

* Provincial Highway 9 between Jiaoxi and Pinglin. The first opportunity for a break is the lovely Deer Deer Coffee after 27 km, where you should try the fried rice. We didn’t, because we’re idiots and misunderstood the menu. But the owner was nice enough to bring us a small portion of fried rice to try after another customer ordered it: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/rFuKzvaakh2mYJ6V6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rFuKzvaakh2mYJ6V6)
* Country Road 199, after you pass Mudan. There are few restaurants on the way, one in Xuhai (however that’s off the track if you want to pass to the West coast), but you have to reserve them. The first 7/11 will be in Daren
* Provincial highway 21 up to Tataka once you pass the 7/11 in Kalibuan

And even if you are in more populated areas, the next convenience store might not be on your route if you try to avoid major roads.

**Stray dogs and monkeys**

A lot more annoying than cars are stray dogs. They shouldn’t bother you in the cities, but on country roads you will definitely encounter them. Most will not give a shit about you and just lay wherever they are or watch. In that case we always tried to just go around them.

Whenever you see them from a distance, make yourself tall on the bike and try to look very confident. Don’t look at the dogs, just ignore them. For us, that usually did the trick.

What if they bark or come after you? Luckily that only happened once to us, but afterwards we felt uncomfortable for every other dog. For that first time, we just tried to cycle away as fast as we could while also shouting at the dog. We later learned that apparently trying to flee is the single worst thing you can do, as this activates their hunting instinct. The internet suggests stopping and putting your foot on the ground. Try to dismount the side of your bike that does not face the dog. We did this in a village with some village dogs, and it worked. They were immediately confused and ran away. However, I’m happy that we didn’t have to test that advice in the middle of nowhere.

Monkeys shouldn’t be a problem, as long as they are in the trees. However, if they decided that a rest stop, bench or bridge is their home now, I would definitely stay away. Signs also tell you not to look them in the eye as they can get aggressive then. And honestly, the Taiwanese monkeys look like they know that they would win in a fight with you and that they are looking forward to the fight. So, stay away from the monkeys!

Enjoy your cycling trip!",6,1771521998.0,taiwan,1,1.0,False
1r95dir,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/1r95dir/listening_to_your_body_goes_beyond_eating/,Listening to your body goes beyond eating!,"I'm not fully sure if this is helpful or even allowed. I'm new to this sub and I hope I'm not violating any rules so please feel free to remove my post if it's not appropriate here! 

I have really struggled with eating enough in the past. I had to force myself to eat anything and mostly only did it when I realized I was going to crash otherwise. I often realized I hadn't eaten much by the end of the day and tried to even it out by eating very calorie dense foods late at night to sort of ""make up"" for it making me feel bloated and sleep badly. 

I tried listening to my body and eat more throughout the day but it was hard and I could barely make out the hunger cues between all the mess. 

I became quite sick last year and was very unwell, to the point that I had to stay at home for a few weeks and my husband had to take time off work to look after the children. I was unable to do anything beyond basic household tasks and mostly just passing the time. I was really feeling terrible but for the first time in many years I was able to really listen to my body. When I felt tired I rested. I sat down and put my legs up for a couple of minutes or took a short nap. I would have just drank a bunch of caffeine or powered through otherwise. When I felt thirsty I would drink water or make myself a tea. I would have put that off in favor of getting something done otherwise. When I felt like walking around I walked around. Otherwise I would have forced myself to continue sitting at my desk. And suddenly I felt hungry! Practically for the first time in my life. 

Eventually I got better but I kind of stuck with a lot of the stuff I discovered. I take a break if I'm tired instead of drinking coffee. I walk around when I feel like walking around. I drink water when I feel like drinking something, not when I get a headache. I go to sleep at night when I feel tired instead of lurking around until midnight doing nothing productive or enjoyable. And it's been a lot easier to feel hungry and eat sustainably throughout the day day since instead of cramming everything into a big dinner or waiting until I'm shaking from low sugar. 

I just wanted to say that I was only able to listen to my body when it comes to eating when I was also listening to it when it came to everything else. If I'm tired, stressed, overstimulated or thirsty I still very much miss hunger cues. Only the extreme effects like feeling faint/dizzy get through to me. 

That's all I wanted to say

1r95azh,https://v.redd.it/3mn1lmctjhkg1,1Essay Legit Check: What I Paid vs What I Got,"Hiii again besties 💀 at this point the mods should just give me my own flair bc I'm literally the product tester nobody asked for. Another week, another paper, another L in my bank account.

Saw 1Essay popping off on my feed with mixed reviews so I had to see what the hype (or hate) was about. Here's the breakdown:

# The Math 📊

What I Paid:  
Ordered a 6 page Psychology paper on cognitive behavioral therapy (thrilling stuff I know). Paid $160 bc I wanted a ""TOP WRITER"" like a fool who believes in dreams.

What I Got (Initially):  
Opened the file and almost choked. Bestie. BESTIE. The first page was just... words arranged in rectangle format? Like technically sentences but they weren't saying ANYTHING. It was giving ""I have to hit 6 pages so here's the same point rephrased 47 times"" energy.

I actually laughed out loud. Then cried a little. Then laughed again bc what else can u do.

# The Revision Arc 🔄

Okay so I hit up support like ""bestie this ain't it"" and prepared for war. But honestly?? They were kinda chill about it? Sent it back to the writer and within 24 hours I got a completely different paper.

And when I say different I mean DIFFERENT. Like who wrote the first one, the writer's little cousin?? The revision actually had structure and examples and made me think ""wait do I actually understand CBT now??""

# The Final Product

Okay so the revision was genuinely solid ngl. Good sources, actual analysis, flowed nicely. I added some of my own sauce (aka changed like 5 words) and turned it in.

Got an A- besties. AN A-.

But the fact that I had to FIGHT for it?? The emotional labor?? The anxiety of waiting for the revision while my deadline got closer?? That should be factored into the price.

# The Verdict

Legit? Yeah they're legit. They won't ghost you or steal your money.

Good? Depends on luck tbh. If your writer wakes up and chooses violence you're getting that first draft. If they wake up and choose excellence you're eating good.

It's like gambling but with your GPA instead of money.

# Comparison Time

Killer Papers was SO much more consistent it's not even funny. Like KP would NEVER send that first draft mess. They had standards. 1Essay is giving ""we have standards... sometimes... depending on the phase of the moon... and if the writer had coffee.""

# Final Rating

⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for the revision, ⭐️ for my mental health during the 24 hour wait)

Would I use again? Maybe if I had a backup plan and extra time for revisions. But if you need something perfect on the first try?? Keep looking boo.

Also can we talk about how ""1Essay"" is such a confusing name?? Like do they only write ONE essay?? Do I have to order in bulk?? The branding is not branding.

Anyway drop your experiences below if you've tried them!! Was I just unlucky with that first draft or is this the vibe?? 👇

As the title says I’m backseat passenger on a long road trip and I’d love company. I’m here for a (sfw) good time. I’ve been going through a lot lately (no I don’t want to discuss) and I just want to find a connection where conversations for now are easy, surface level and don’t need constant effort. I am easy going, marginally sassy, extroverted and kind. If you are the kind of person who thinks one upping someone is flirting - or hating on things I like is cute - I am not for you. 

Unfortunately I do love 

•hotdogs

•whiney man music. 

•the same pair of b&w checkered vans even though I have like 30 pairs of other vans and a billion other shoes.

•iced coffee all year long. 

•dive bars. 

•taking over a touch tunes. 

•collecting new tattoos. 

•yelling at the tv when my baseball, football or hockey team are on. 

•starting my morning at 4am to be in the gym.

•trying new things and failing at them badly 

•buying concert tickets with no pre plan. 

Unfortunately I don’t love: anime, video games, or intricate board games. 

What am I seeking: Something easy, causal, and low stakes. I want SFW, easy flowing conversations. I don’t want it to feel like I have to try. I don’t respond to “hey” or “hi” type messages.

1r95afg,https://i.redd.it/1d4ybwmtjhkg1.jpeg,Gushing and Gushing,"Hi someone encouraged me to gush about my F/O so here it fuckin' goes: 

This is Enzo Ferrara, a 33 year old professor of psychology who lectures at NYU.

I used to work part-time at the Italian restaurant his parents own, a place he naturally frequents, and that's exactly how we met. It wasn't the most beautiful meeting in the world. I slipped while carrying someone's order, and he very stiffly asked if I needed a hand (... I said no). 

He's often difficult to read. His body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are all quite flat, but it's never an intentional thing. Others can find it offputting or read it as cold, but I find his presence incredibly grounding and cathartic. He likely has autism, but never cared enough to look into it professionally, as a diagnosis wouldn't do him any good at this point.

In his field, he's known for his scientific journals, which amongst other things, has mainly covered the many shades of depression. He's struggled heavily with the disorder in the past, and has put his blood, sweat, and tears into dissecting and destigmatizing the illness. In general, he's a massive mental health advocate, and believes in his heart of hearts that mental illnesses and disorders should be treated with the same care and respect as their physical counterparts. 

The persona I draw 100% represents me. We have the same personality, hobbies, career, etc. He's me and I'm him. I just thought that'd be worth noting before moving on. 

I used to HATE vaporwave until I realized it's totally some shit he would enjoy. I've bought many vaporwave albums since then and listen to them constantly, though I can't quite get into shoegaze. We also both like smooth jazz and nu/progressive metal. Other than that, he thinks my taste in music is absurd and constantly makes fun of me for it (I secretly like it). 

I'm currently working hard to become a certified ethical hacker. I'm very proud of how far I've come. I think Enzo is an impressive, accomplished guy, and it drives me to keep getting better so we can flourish in our respective fields and become unstoppable together. I also just want to impress him too, really.

I'd like to imagine him grading student papers while I work/study alongside him. Jazz playing in the background. Lots of coffee. Complaining at each other. Nudging each other's feet under the table when we get bored. 

This guy has been my absolute muse. Accepting that Enzo is my F/O and not just an arbitrary OC has honestly changed me for the better. I'm more confident, talkative, driven, and passionate than before. I wish I could write so much more, but Jesus, this has already become absurdly long. I'm just so damn grateful I found a community I can share this with. ",2,1771521796.0,yumeshipping,0,1.0,False

I’ve gotten way way too isolated and introverted in my 30’s. Trying to force myself out of my bubble and make some friends or chats or whatever comes my way. Got myself a nice cup of coffee and trying to push through the Thursday tasks  

About me:

Web Developer by day. I read a lot. 15 tattoos and already want more. Former barista and coffee roaster so obsessive over coffee. Workout to keep the mental demons at bay. Always in all black clothing (not a phase). Dog dad. Horror and metal music fan. Sober and vegetarian but not annoying about it. I’m not judgy, open minded, curious and hopefully a good friend!

**Surgery**

**Part Two**

I woke up in recovery. A clock on the wall told me I was only out for two hours, 9AM-11AM. The surgeon had blocked off three hours for the surgery alone, but it seemed the surgery went quick (later learned it took about twenty minutes; he’s *very* good). I was unconscious longer than the actual surgery. My wife received a text message about me going into and out of surgery within the same minute, not even giving her a chance to take a quick nap.

Lucidity was still outside my grasp and it wasn’t until 12PM that I felt mostly normal, anesthesia undoing its hold steadily. My wife came in and I barely remember what happened after, but I do recall my surgeon calling my wife on the phone about my surgery; then they hung up and he called again and talked to my wife about a different patient as though I was them, and hung up again. 

Weird, I know.

They took me into a semi-private room shared with a guy who was worse off than me at the time, but his optimistic demeanor was far beyond mine, a curtain separating us. I barely felt pain except for the incision site, but I’d say that’s because I was on a painkiller, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. It was still less than I expected for someone digging around in my entrails. Besides that, mentally I was the same (thus far).

My surgeon’s Fellow came in and talked to my wife and I. She said everything went well, no complications, etc., and if we wanted to, they could discharge us *that day*.

I’m sorry, what?

I know nothing about medicine besides spending countless hours online learning about digestive issues, nutrition, fitness, etc. for the last twenty years or so, but my gut reaction was to say no. Which we did. It felt really “wrong.” Another thing she said was that she wanted to transition to a soft GI food diet already, skipping the first two steps. Another round of “this feels wrong.”

For the type of operation I received, usually you start on clear liquids (water, apple juice, Gatorade, chicken broth, coffee, Jell-O, etc.) for a couple days; full liquids (milk, fruit/vegetable juice, Ensure, pudding, etc.) next for the same amount of time; then soft GI foods (moist/soft meats, nut butters, certain heavily cooked vegetables, mash potatoes, white bread, eggs, rice, bananas, etc.) for four-to-six weeks then introduce other foods you once ate slowly to test the waters. 

Doing it this way ensures your gut is working the way it should. If you can do clears but find out not fulls, you stay on clears for a bit, then try fulls later. You repeat this process until you can handle them all well. You do the same thing once you transition to other foods after the soft GI food diet. Throwing shit into your stomach from the get-go is a good way to fuck things up.

So, even though everything seemingly was working properly, my wife and I told her we’d stay at least one night, but she was a doctor, so we listened about the food. We were still cautious, my first “meal” was chicken broth and orange juice, then my second, later that day, was a PB&J. I’m typically a fast eater, unless I’m doing something else while eating (scrolling on social media, reading, writing, etc.).

Now, I had to eat slowly, chew thoroughly, and take small bites. It was against my very nature, but I was/am horrified of blockages. I hadn’t have a PB&J in many years and although they gave me sugar free jelly and the white bread didn’t have that nostalgic moist texture, it still tasted good and was difficult not to devour in five seconds.

The remainder of the day is a bit hazy, but I do remember speaking to my nurse, at various times, who had been working the floor for thirty years and made jokes I didn’t understand but was kind and seemed to actually care about me as a patient. Sometime before dinner or after, I met a stoma nurse and she showed my wife and I how to change a bag, hygiene, etc.

While the day went on, I hadn’t noticed I hadn’t urinated all day. Surgery so short they didn’t cath (catheterize) me. Due to the anesthesia and my pre-existing neurogenic bladder (nerves are screwed, due to that I have a large bladder and can’t tell when I have to pee) my body didn’t alert me. Even with 1000+ ml urine in my bladder (a normal bladder usually will tell you that you need to piss around 400 ml) the medical staff thought it was fine. Once again, what did I know? They’re the experts.

Night came, wife went back to the hotel room, and I slept terribly.

Early-breakfast was a banana, then later-breakfast was scrambled eggs, cream of wheat mixed with apple sauce, and decaf coffee, the last two weren’t good but food was food. My wife returned around brunch time, and my nurse and surgeon’s Fellow prepared us for discharge. I ordered a turkey burger for lunch and afterwards we said our goodbyes to the staff, left the hospital, stopped at Panera Bread for food for my wife and a decaf coffee for me (the only other option was Starbucks and their coffee is awful), and went to the hotel.

We decided to stay one more night and leave the next morning, two days earlier than expected. My wife and I were excited for not only how good the surgery went but also saving money by not having to stay longer than planned.

Unfortunately, while this was going on, we hadn’t noticed things inside me had stopped moving, but that was a normal symptom for the type of operation I got so we weren’t too concerned. We watched more *Law and Order*, ordered dinner, another PB&J for me, and it wasn’t until around 6PM or so did my wife notice I was very distended, six months pregnant looking. She thought it was my bladder and after an hour of peeing/trying to pee, there was no relief. 

She called the on-call nurse about the issue and they said they’d push it to the overnight physician, the latter would call us back.

An hour went by, no call.

Wife called again and was told the same thing.

Another hour, no call.

A third try and the nurse was very empathic and frustrated with the doctor. They said they’d have it a “priority” or something so the doctor *had* to see it.

One more hour, no call.

Now, it was a little before 10PM. I was exhausted, living on little sleep and one day out of the operation, and didn’t care what was going on with my body. Sleep trumps all for me almost always, and I’d deal with whatever was happening within me tomorrow morning. 

I was annoyed, to say the least, like a toddler forced to do something they really don’t want to do. If I could’ve pouted, I probably would’ve. Just wanted *sleep*, to leave that place, to *go home*. Yet, if this ER jaunt calmed my wife’s mind, then so be it. I’d only take an hour at most and we’d be back in bed. No work or anything the next day, so I’d still be able to sleep however many hours.

Fine.

Okay.

She was adamant something was wrong, so I relented.

# Emergency Room

From the hotel into a night of \~10°F temperatures to the shuttle, then to the vacant ER waiting room where a bored-looking receptionist checked us in and told us to wait until they called me back. It had only been ten hours since I was discharged from the same hospital. 

An old woman in layers of various matted fake fur and a dull violet gown asked us for cigarettes before walking outside. The receptionist talked loudly on her phone. Fox News played on the TV. 

A skinny guy in blue scrubs and a mask opened a door, brought us back into a small room, asked the usual questions, and we went back to the waiting room.

A frigid draft blew every time the sliding doors opened for the people like us who went out in the cold night before a record breaking snowstorm (Oh yeah, that was coming, too). 

Finally, they took us into the not-busy ER and had me lay on the bed in one of the small alcove rooms, wife on the chair against the wall. Again, I answered the nurse’s questions, the same ones I had been asked during Post-Op and before Surgery. We got through it, the short nurse paged someone on a cheap-looking Android phone/beeper, and a stranger came in with a bladder scanner.

They scanned my bladder but there wasn’t a lot. They did this three times and thought they weren’t doing it right. A different medical person came in and did the same, but found I was holding, I think, about 600-700 ml of urine. So, the choice was made to cath me.

Cool. Let’s get this over with.

I’ve been cath’d before. It does hurt and is very uncomfortable, but it’s not the worst thing I’ve been through. Except in this instance, it wasn’t simply: lube the cath, push it through, and voila, piss. 

Not at all. 

This was the beginning of the pure, utter agonizing pain.

They failed to cath me twice and on the third attempt I had clenched my abdomen, inciting a profound, sharp, impossible-to-describe pain in my stomach and sternum. It was insane—most pain I’ve ever felt in my life and will never forget. Fifteen out of ten on the pain scale. I hardly ever cry or show emotion, pain or pleasure. People would say I’m stoic or indifferent, monotone and unfazed by life; feeling and emotion mostly lost to me, an insignificant tinge in an otherwise still, quiet pond. 

But I fucking *writhed* and *sweated* and *cried* and *vomited* and *shouted* and to my utter horror, this torture lasted for *hours*.

Hours.

And it was at this moment my trusty depersonalization apparently decided to go on vacation, and I was thrown to the fucking wolves.

Thanks defense mechanism.

The medical staff tried to calm the pain with two doses of fent (fentanyl) but it only relieved it for twenty minutes or so. They gave me oxy (oxycontin) but I threw it up. Then they gave me dilaudid (opioid painkiller), which staved the agony for about an hour. 

What topped this shit sundae was that none of the night shift doctors/surgeons were returning the ER staff’s calls. They needed orders approved to help me but the doctors were taking their good ol’ damn time doing whatever they do at midnight on a weekday. At some point, the cath was gone and I was rolled to a CT scanner and was pushed in, and it gave us an answer to what the hell was happening.

I had an ileus, a common side effect (about ⅕ of patients get it) from the surgery, something that literally not a soul told my wife and I could happen after my bowel operation. An ileus is when your bowels simply aren’t awake, still slumbering from the anesthesia. 

It wasn’t that they were working somewhat or sluggishly, they weren’t working *at all.* And the immense pain was all the food/fluids I had eaten (that the doctors said was safe to do after surgery) before, gas, and stomach bile trapped inside me.

I know it sounds like it wouldn’t hurt that bad, but anyone with severe trapped gas or themselves who had an ileus once will know it’s insanely painful. It could’ve been lessened if I had stuck to clear liquids, but not prevented since it wasn’t the contents causing the pain but my intestines; could’ve been better if we weren’t urged to be discharged; could’ve been a whole lot better when the ileus happened and I was already in the fucking hospital with nurses and doctors and pain meds a button press away…

Could’ve

Should’ve.

Would’ve.

The ER folks *still* couldn’t reach the colorectal staff, and they couldn’t give me more painkillers without approval, so for *several more hours* I spent in Hell until finally my mind was done being conscious at sometime early morning. Within that time, the colorectal folks finally did their job.

Through blissful unconsciousness there were flashes of the world around me: gray hallways, the bed moving, going into and off an elevator, the bland gray-blue room and huge khaki curtain covering the only window; someone shoving a NG Tube up my nose to get down my throat into my stomach to vacuum its contents; the failed attempt of being cath’d *again* before being successful; my teeth chattering and shivering; my crying wife somewhere in the mix…

Don’t remember much more than that.

She called the on-call nurse about the issue and they said they’d push it to the overnight physician, the latter would call us back.

An hour went by, no call.

Wife called again and was told the same thing.

Another hour, no call.

A third try and the nurse was very empathic and frustrated with the doctor. They said they’d have it a “priority” or something so the doctor *had* to see it.

One more hour, no call.

Now, it was a little before 10PM. I was exhausted, living on little sleep and one day out of the operation, and didn’t care what was going on with my body. Sleep trumps all for me almost always, and I’d deal with whatever was happening within me tomorrow morning. 

I was annoyed, to say the least, like a toddler forced to do something they really don’t want to do. If I could’ve pouted, I probably would’ve. Just wanted *sleep*, to leave that place, to *go home*. Yet, if this ER jaunt calmed my wife’s mind, then so be it. I’d only take an hour at most and we’d be back in bed. No work or anything the next day, so I’d still be able to sleep however many hours.

Fine.

Okay.

She was adamant something was wrong, so I relented.

# Emergency Room

From the hotel into a night of \~10°F temperatures to the shuttle, then to the vacant ER waiting room where a bored-looking receptionist checked us in and told us to wait until they called me back. It had only been ten hours since I was discharged from the same hospital. 

An old woman in layers of various matted fake fur and a dull violet gown asked us for cigarettes before walking outside. The receptionist talked loudly on her phone. Fox News played on the TV. 

A skinny guy in blue scrubs and a mask opened a door, brought us back into a small room, asked the usual questions, and we went back to the waiting room.

A frigid draft blew every time the sliding doors opened for the people like us who went out in the cold night before a record breaking snowstorm (Oh yeah, that was coming, too). 

Finally, they took us into the not-busy ER and had me lay on the bed in one of the small alcove rooms, wife on the chair against the wall. Again, I answered the nurse’s questions, the same ones I had been asked during Post-Op and before Surgery. We got through it, the short nurse paged someone on a cheap-looking Android phone/beeper, and a stranger came in with a bladder scanner.

They scanned my bladder but there wasn’t a lot. They did this three times and thought they weren’t doing it right. A different medical person came in and did the same, but found I was holding, I think, about 600-700 ml of urine. So, the choice was made to cath me.

Cool. Let’s get this over with.

I’ve been cath’d before. It does hurt and is very uncomfortable, but it’s not the worst thing I’ve been through. Except in this instance, it wasn’t simply: lube the cath, push it through, and voila, piss. 

Not at all. 

This was the beginning of the pure, utter agonizing pain.

They failed to cath me twice and on the third attempt I had clenched my abdomen, inciting a profound, sharp, impossible-to-describe pain in my stomach and sternum. It was insane—most pain I’ve ever felt in my life and will never forget. Fifteen out of ten on the pain scale. I hardly ever cry or show emotion, pain or pleasure. People would say I’m stoic or indifferent, monotone and unfazed by life; feeling and emotion mostly lost to me, an insignificant tinge in an otherwise still, quiet pond. 

But I fucking *writhed* and *sweated* and *cried* and *vomited* and *shouted* and to my utter horror, this torture lasted for *hours*.

Hours.

And it was at this moment my trusty depersonalization apparently decided to go on vacation, and I was thrown to the fucking wolves.

Thanks defense mechanism.

The medical staff tried to calm the pain with two doses of fent (fentanyl) but it only relieved it for twenty minutes or so. They gave me oxy (oxycontin) but I threw it up. Then they gave me dilaudid (opioid painkiller), which staved the agony for about an hour. 

What topped this shit sundae was that none of the night shift doctors/surgeons were returning the ER staff’s calls. They needed orders approved to help me but the doctors were taking their good ol’ damn time doing whatever they do at midnight on a weekday. At some point, the cath was gone and I was rolled to a CT scanner and was pushed in, and it gave us an answer to what the hell was happening.

I had an ileus, a common side effect (about ⅕ of patients get it) from the surgery, something that literally not a soul told my wife and I could happen after my bowel operation. An ileus is when your bowels simply aren’t awake, still slumbering from the anesthesia. 

It wasn’t that they were working somewhat or sluggishly, they weren’t working *at all.* And the immense pain was all the food/fluids I had eaten (that the doctors said was safe to do after surgery) before, gas, and stomach bile trapped inside me.

I know it sounds like it wouldn’t hurt that bad, but anyone with severe trapped gas or themselves who had an ileus once will know it’s insanely painful. It could’ve been lessened if I had stuck to clear liquids, but not prevented since it wasn’t the contents causing the pain but my intestines; could’ve been better if we weren’t urged to be discharged; could’ve been a whole lot better when the ileus happened and I was already in the fucking hospital with nurses and doctors and pain meds a button press away…

Could’ve

Should’ve.

Would’ve.

The ER folks *still* couldn’t reach the colorectal staff, and they couldn’t give me more painkillers without approval, so for *several more hours* I spent in Hell until finally my mind was done being conscious at sometime early morning. Within that time, the colorectal folks finally did their job.

Through blissful unconsciousness there were flashes of the world around me: gray hallways, the bed moving, going into and off an elevator, the bland gray-blue room and huge khaki curtain covering the only window; someone shoving a NG Tube up my nose to get down my throat into my stomach to vacuum its contents; the failed attempt of being cath’d *again* before being successful; my teeth chattering and shivering; my crying wife somewhere in the mix…

Don’t remember much more than that.

**Surgery**

**Part Two**

I woke up in recovery. A clock on the wall told me I was only out for two hours, 9AM-11AM. The surgeon had blocked off three hours for the surgery alone, but it seemed the surgery went quick (later learned it took about twenty minutes; he’s *very* good). I was unconscious longer than the actual surgery. My wife received a text message about me going into and out of surgery within the same minute, not even giving her a chance to take a quick nap.

Lucidity was still outside my grasp and it wasn’t until 12PM that I felt mostly normal, anesthesia undoing its hold steadily. My wife came in and I barely remember what happened after, but I do recall my surgeon calling my wife on the phone about my surgery; then they hung up and he called again and talked to my wife about a different patient as though I was them, and hung up again. 

Weird, I know.

They took me into a semi-private room shared with a guy who was worse off than me at the time, but his optimistic demeanor was far beyond mine, a curtain separating us. I barely felt pain except for the incision site, but I’d say that’s because I was on a painkiller, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. It was still less than I expected for someone digging around in my entrails. Besides that, mentally I was the same (thus far).

My surgeon’s Fellow came in and talked to my wife and I. She said everything went well, no complications, etc., and if we wanted to, they could discharge us *that day*.

I’m sorry, what?

I know nothing about medicine besides spending countless hours online learning about digestive issues, nutrition, fitness, etc. for the last twenty years or so, but my gut reaction was to say no. Which we did. It felt really “wrong.” Another thing she said was that she wanted to transition to a soft GI food diet already, skipping the first two steps. Another round of “this feels wrong.”

For the type of operation I received, usually you start on clear liquids (water, apple juice, Gatorade, chicken broth, coffee, Jell-O, etc.) for a couple days; full liquids (milk, fruit/vegetable juice, Ensure, pudding, etc.) next for the same amount of time; then soft GI foods (moist/soft meats, nut butters, certain heavily cooked vegetables, mash potatoes, white bread, eggs, rice, bananas, etc.) for four-to-six weeks then introduce other foods you once ate slowly to test the waters. 

Doing it this way ensures your gut is working the way it should. If you can do clears but find out not fulls, you stay on clears for a bit, then try fulls later. You repeat this process until you can handle them all well. You do the same thing once you transition to other foods after the soft GI food diet. Throwing shit into your stomach from the get-go is a good way to fuck things up.

So, even though everything seemingly was working properly, my wife and I told her we’d stay at least one night, but she was a doctor, so we listened about the food. We were still cautious, my first “meal” was chicken broth and orange juice, then my second, later that day, was a PB&J. I’m typically a fast eater, unless I’m doing something else while eating (scrolling on social media, reading, writing, etc.).

Now, I had to eat slowly, chew thoroughly, and take small bites. It was against my very nature, but I was/am horrified of blockages. I hadn’t have a PB&J in many years and although they gave me sugar free jelly and the white bread didn’t have that nostalgic moist texture, it still tasted good and was difficult not to devour in five seconds.

The remainder of the day is a bit hazy, but I do remember speaking to my nurse, at various times, who had been working the floor for thirty years and made jokes I didn’t understand but was kind and seemed to actually care about me as a patient. Sometime before dinner or after, I met a stoma nurse and she showed my wife and I how to change a bag, hygiene, etc.

While the day went on, I hadn’t noticed I hadn’t urinated all day. Surgery so short they didn’t cath (catheterize) me. Due to the anesthesia and my pre-existing neurogenic bladder (nerves are screwed, due to that I have a large bladder and can’t tell when I have to pee) my body didn’t alert me. Even with 1000+ ml urine in my bladder (a normal bladder usually will tell you that you need to piss around 400 ml) the medical staff thought it was fine. Once again, what did I know? They’re the experts.

Night came, wife went back to the hotel room, and I slept terribly.

Early-breakfast was a banana, then later-breakfast was scrambled eggs, cream of wheat mixed with apple sauce, and decaf coffee, the last two weren’t good but food was food. My wife returned around brunch time, and my nurse and surgeon’s Fellow prepared us for discharge. I ordered a turkey burger for lunch and afterwards we said our goodbyes to the staff, left the hospital, stopped at Panera Bread for food for my wife and a decaf coffee for me (the only other option was Starbucks and their coffee is awful), and went to the hotel.

We decided to stay one more night and leave the next morning, two days earlier than expected. My wife and I were excited for not only how good the surgery went but also saving money by not having to stay longer than planned.

Unfortunately, while this was going on, we hadn’t noticed things inside me had stopped moving, but that was a normal symptom for the type of operation I got so we weren’t too concerned. We watched more *Law and Order*, ordered dinner, another PB&J for me, and it wasn’t until around 6PM or so did my wife notice I was very distended, six months pregnant looking. She thought it was my bladder and after an hour of peeing/trying to pee, there was no relief. 

She called the on-call nurse about the issue and they said they’d push it to the overnight physician, the latter would call us back.

An hour went by, no call.

Customers expect quick service, seamless payments, and zero friction. At the same time, owners need better control over operations, costs, and performance. That’s why cloud-based POS systems are becoming the go-to solution for modern coffee shops in 2026.

Unlike traditional systems that rely on a single device or local server, cloud-based POS technology stores data securely online. This simple shift brings powerful advantages.

**1. Access Your Business Anytime, Anywhere**  
One of the biggest benefits is remote access. Whether you’re at home, meeting a supplier, or planning expansion, you can check real-time sales, monitor performance, and review reports directly from your phone or laptop. It’s like carrying your café in your pocket.

**2. Real-Time Sales and Reporting**  
With cloud-based systems, data updates instantly. You can see your busiest hours, best-selling drinks, and daily revenue without waiting for end-of-day summaries. This allows you to make quick, informed decisions — like adjusting staff during peak hours or promoting slow-moving items.

**3. Automatic Updates and Security**  
Traditional systems often require manual updates and maintenance. Cloud-based POS platforms update automatically, keeping your software current without interrupting service. They also offer secure data storage, protecting sensitive business information from loss or technical failure.

**4. Seamless Integration**  
Modern cafés rely on more than just a till. Online orders, delivery services, and digital payments are now standard. Cloud systems easily integrate with these tools, creating a smooth flow between front-of-house and back-of-house operations.

**5. Scalability for Growth**  
Planning to open another location? A cloud-based system makes expansion easier. You can manage multiple sites from one central dashboard, compare performance, and maintain consistent pricing and menus across locations.

**best restaurant point of sale system** solutions built on cloud technology do more than process transactions. They streamline workflows, reduce errors, and provide valuable insights that help coffee shop owners stay competitive. When everything runs in sync, service becomes faster and more reliable.

In a fast-paced city like London, flexibility is everything. A cloud-based POS system gives café owners control, clarity, and confidence. It reduces operational stress while improving customer experience. For modern coffee shops looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, switching to cloud technology isn’t just smart — it’s essential for sustainable growth.",1,1771520910.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

I am now at the business end of planning a 18 day trip and would love some advice on our schedule so far. We are flying from the UK and used to live in Yokohama, so have some pals we will visit, although we are staying in hotels throughout

  
Day 1 (18/3): Flight from Manchester

Day 2 (19/3): Arrive to Narita 12pm, Narita Express to Yokohama. Check in hotel near Sakuragicho. Explore and get dinner in Noge

Day 3 (20/3): Minato Mirai, Yokohama station area, Yoshimuraya, Craft beer tour 

Day 4 (21/3): Kamakura, Daibutsu, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, Kita Kamakura temples, Enoshima for sunset

Day 5 (22/3): Shinagawa Flea Market, Yokohama FM vs Kawasaki F in Tokyo

Day 6 (23/3): Travel to Kanazawa (via Tokyo, on the Shinkansen) Omicho Market, Museum of Comp Art

Day 7 (24/3): Kenrokuen, Kanazawa Castle, Higashi Chaya District

Day 8 (25/3): Travel to Tokyo, Airbnb in Sangenjaya. Explore Sancha

Day 19 (5/4): Travel home

  
We are aiming to keep the travel/hotel move days free from big plans and don't love heavy planning, although with the nature of the trip we want to make sure we avoid box ticking and unnecessary travel around the cities.

Questions:

We are deciding between the 7 or 14 day JR pass and not sure whether it would be cost effective, we've used the calculator and both options look like we might just break even, so we are leaning towards the 14 day:

7 day: Activate on Day 12 to be used on Tokyo-Hiroshima, Hiroshima-Fukuoka, Fukuoka-Beppu return, Fukuoka-Osaka (Y50000)

14 day: Activate on Day 5 to be used on Yokohama-Tokyo return, Yokohama-Kanazawa, Kanazawa-Tokyo, Tokyo-Hiroshima, Hiroshima-Fukuoka, Fukuoka-Beppu return, Fukuoka-Osaka (Y80000)

  
Is there something we are missing in terms of each stop and making things efficient but fun?

Should I keep going?,"Here came a young man, stepping inside a library, kicking the snow off his feet. He was wearing a topcoat, a hat, and holding an umbrella. He stood there on the welcome mat for a moment, staring at his feet, before he finally moved, first in small circles and then, stopping, seeming to see someone on the top floor, he smiled, walked deeper inside the library.

Who he saw was an angel, floating near the ceiling. Had seen her floating in the sky and followed her in here, and no one was even trying to catch her except him! But reaching the top floor, he couldn't find her, so maybe, he figured, ah, maybe someone else—wait—that beautiful woman over there at that table, was she her? 

The young man approached her, but when she looked up at him from her book, he bent down to fiddle with his shoes, smacking them with his palms, which were sweating, and muttered: ""These things …! Ah they, they really""—he gulped, cleared his throat—""they …"" He groped for the right word, something that would get her, would capture her heart or something, quickly!—""*They miscarried!*""

The woman was taken aback. Miscarried? She blinked, not wanting to flip out, not here, no, not in the middle of the sidewalk, where people rushed about past them, but wow. Miscarried. So. She set her teeth: So he thought the two miscarriages were funny. Wow. So he'd do anything to get under her skin, or no. No he *had* already done everything, and now, watching him crouch there hunched over his shoe—miscarried!—she snapped shut the book in her hands, held it up and slammed it down against his head while wailing and *ugh!* This child! She was stuck with a *child!* Who she beat with this book over and over—*miscarried!*

When she stopped, the man got up and, his face flushed, his brows fluttering, he grabbed the umbrella, thrust its tip against her stomach. It opened and slammed against her face, throwing her backward  into a crowd, where she got swept along in the rush. Stumbling, spinning, getting a view of moving legs of bobbing heads of hats, she grasped for the shoulders around her to keep from falling, but then found herself in the arms of an old man who was carrying her along, his face inches away from hers. He smiled. His teeth were stained. Brown. His breath stunk. 

""Oh!"" he said, his steps brisk as he carried her off the curb and across another street, and clapped a palm on his mouth, saying into it: ""Sorry! I had a whole lot of coffee today! Big day, so I had to get myself fired up you know? I'm taking an antidepressant—Wellbutrin? Have you heard of Wellbutrin? Well, it's an antidepressant *and* a stimulant, so, you take that and wash it down with coffee, and it gets you fired up, I suppose, but why oh come on …"" By now his palm was covered with spit so, turning a corner out of the crowd's path and heading into that forest there in front of him where they'd finally be alone, he wrapped the woman with his free arm and clapped his other palm on his mouth and continued: ""Sorry about that. *So*! why was I drinking a ton? Well, my son—but I don't want to spoil it for him! It's silly, I know, but I always worry that, by speaking something into world, wrestling it out of my head and inserting it into reality, what I say will have a modifying effect on reality itself, even though I *know*, rationally, that it won't! Here we are.""

In a forest, he let her fall to the ground on her back at a door—a shack door—and he strode over her and opened it to go inside. 

And she lay flat out on the grass where she had no idea what was, what … what even was this? Why did she have to keep it going? *Did* she? But God willing—what was she saying?—God willing she would roll over on her side to face the shack, which she now glanced towards.

Framed by the open door, the man stood there with his back towards her, thrust a hand in his pocket, and pulled a phone out to make a call.

""David! Yeah. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry, no. No I don't think I'm going to make it."" He looked back over his shoulder at her, then looked away. ""Yes. And this one might be my magnum opus. No! *No!* Do you really think—? David, I want to see you get married—I was fucking mixin' pills all night tryin' to keep myself fired up! You think I was doing that for my health? *No!* There won't be anyone like her! *Yes*. Yes. Her. She's beautiful. An angel."" 

While he talked, she pushed herself up from the ground and looked around to find she was in a circle of grass surrounded by trees. No, it was closed off by them, because where was the path? She wondered if there even was one. But then how did they get here? Yeah. How? She couldn't remember. Couldn't even remember what happened today. God willing, though, she would remember, maybe, maybe the path was somewhere here: She trudged along the trees looking for it, looking for a reason to go on, hearing a voice, yes, somewhere deep in the woods, a voice, or was it two? Yes, two, it was two voices! 

She jumped up, shouted: ""Hey!"" and ran in their direction towards the woods, slipping through the dark forest, scrambling through the trees and bushes, yelling, ""*Help! Help!*"" as their voices got louder, and up ahead a light shined through from between two trees, which she passed through and emerged out of: Ah! Sunlight! And underfoot, grass. Ah.

This was another circle of grass. Where there was a shack.

Inside: The old man, speaking into his phone. Turning around. His face dropping. He said: 

""Oh my God! Hold on, David, I'll call you later, sorry,"" and hanging up he crossed over to her and waved at her clothes, which (she saw, looking down) were torn, muddied, covered with blood. ""What the Hell happened? Where'd you—? Jesus! Can you *stop* running away?"" 

He grabbed her hand, dragged her into the house up the stairs and into her room, where he said: 

""Just get some rest. There we go. Sleep. For an hour, at least. Please. Okay?"" 

But from her pillow, his wife just blinked, her face aged, forehead wrinkled, cheeks hollow. God. He wished to Hell she'd just die, for her own sake, and left the room closing the door behind him, locking it this time, because she was just going to leave again if he left it unlocked. Which reminded him of her bloody clothes, her wounds—*her*, this crazy woman, what the Hell happened?

Making his way to the front room, breathing heavily, it came to him that, well, with her like this—his magnum opus, he used to call her, but now!—what now? 

He sighed and dropped down into the chair facing the window and let out a breath, a tired breath, maybe,—yes, it was that, wasn't it? The tired breath of an old man. Or, rather, the breath of a tired man …? Or—? He pushed the thought out of his mind before it spiralled out of control (he could go on like this for hours), and then forced himself to keep his mind on what had happened, on his wife's torn clothes, covered with blood and mud, and how was he going to explain that to her doctor?

Oh fuck it! He jumped to his feet, made up his mind to take a walk. Didn't matter if his wife went crazy in her room because *he* was going to go crazy sitting here in *this* dark miserable damn room, sitting here unused, misused, dis—and enough, he told himself as he snatched his coat off the back of a chair and grabbed his hat and stormed out of the front door and down the sidewalk, *enough* with all these sentence analyses. Just needed to keep this going, no matter what. Couldn't stop, no, couldn't stop, couldn't stop.

Yes, analyses, the young man knew, frivolous analyses of the type that he was drowning himself in, they, they really …! They …! The young man groped for the right word as he peered from behind the library's potted plant at the woman sitting at that table there. He wondered if she knew what the right word was. If he wrote down the sentence he was working on on a piece of paper and gave it to her, would she be able to fill in the blank? 

ANALYSES, THEY REALLY … ? 

But would that be plagiarism? Plagiary? Well, it didn't matter, anyway. He didn't want to look like a weirdo in a front of her, so that idea wasn't feasible. Viable. Permissible.

Then they wonder why she loses interest after a few dates or never texts back.

I spent months going down the rabbit hole on this. Read attachment theory research, listened to relationship psychologists break down what actually makes women feel drawn to someone, watched way too many Esther Perel videos at 2am. And here's what nobody tells you: attraction isn't about perfection. It's about making her nervous system feel calm around you while keeping that spark alive. It's biology mixed with psychology, and once you understand it, everything clicks.

The wild part? Society tells guys to be either the ""nice guy"" or the ""bad boy"" when the real answer is neither. And yeah, your past dating failures probably weren't even your fault. We're never taught this stuff. But here's the good news: you can learn it.

The foundation: emotional safety isn't boring

Most guys think being ""safe"" means being predictable and dull. Wrong. Emotional safety means she can be her full self around you without fear of judgment or sudden chaos. It's about consistent behavior, not consistent personality.

Attachment theory explains this perfectly. Dr. Amir Levine's book ""Attached"" breaks down how our nervous systems are literally wired to seek secure connections. When someone has inconsistent behavior (hot and cold, emotionally available then distant), it triggers anxiety in her brain. But when you're steady? Her nervous system relaxes. That's when real attraction grows.

This book is genuinely one of the best relationship guides I've ever read. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and he explains why some people become ""anxious"" in relationships while others are ""avoidant."" The insights will make you rethink every past relationship. You'll understand why she pulled away, why your ex was clingy, why that girl you liked kept sending mixed signals. Game changing read.

Here's what emotional safety actually looks like:

• You say what you mean and follow through. No games, no testing her, no disappearing for days to ""seem mysterious."" That shit just activates her stress response.

• You can handle her emotions without getting defensive or trying to immediately fix them. She vents about work, you listen. You don't take it personally or offer solutions unless she asks.

• You have boundaries and you communicate them clearly. Secure people aren't pushovers. They just express needs without drama.

• You're not threatened by her success, friends, or independence. Insecure guys try to control or diminish. Secure guys celebrate.

The addiction part: keep the mystery alive

Now here's where guys mess up. They think once they've established safety, they're done. They become totally predictable, stop growing, stop surprising her. And she gets bored.

Esther Perel talks about this brilliantly in ""Mating in Captivity."" Perel is a psychotherapist who's studied desire for decades, and her main point is that desire needs space and mystery. Too much closeness kills attraction. The most magnetic couples maintain some separateness, they have their own interests, friends, goals. They don't merge into one person.

The book absolutely destroyed some of my assumptions about relationships. I always thought closeness equaled intimacy. Nope. Desire needs a little distance, a little uncertainty about what the other person is thinking. It's why novelty and spontaneity matter so much. This might be the most insightful relationship book you'll ever read, no joke.

How to maintain that pull:

• Keep developing yourself. New hobbies, new skills, new experiences. When you're constantly evolving, she stays curious about you.

• Don't be 100% available all the time. Have your own life, your own plans. Not in a manipulative way, just genuine independence.

• Surprise her occasionally. Not with expensive gifts necessarily, but with spontaneous plans, new date ideas, switching up your routine.

• Stay a bit unpredictable emotionally while being consistent behaviorally. She should know you'll show up (behavioral consistency), but she shouldn't be able to predict exactly how you'll react to everything (emotional variety).

Master your own emotional regulation

This is the real secret sauce that nobody talks about. If you can't regulate your own emotions, you'll never make her feel truly safe. When you get triggered and lash out, or shut down, or need her constant reassurance, it puts her nervous system on alert.

If you want to go deeper into relationship psychology and dating but don't have time to read everything, BeFreed is a personalized audio learning app that pulls from books like ""Attached,"" relationship experts like Esther Perel, and research on attraction to create custom podcasts just for your goals.

You can tell it something like ""I'm an introvert who struggles with dating and I want to learn how to be more magnetically attractive,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan specifically for you, drawing from top relationship psychology books, expert interviews, and research. You control the depth too, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with real examples and context when something really clicks. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's made learning about relationships way more digestible and less overwhelming than trying to read everything yourself.

Other regulation strategies that help:

• Physical exercise. Your body holds stress and anxiety. Moving it out through workouts, running, sports, whatever, makes you way more emotionally stable.

• Therapy or coaching. Seriously, the stigma around this is stupid. Having someone help you process your shit is valuable as hell. Even just a few sessions can shift your entire perspective.

• Meditation or breathwork. I know, I know. But even 5 minutes a day of just breathing and noticing your thoughts changes how reactive you are.

Communication: the actual cheat code

Most relationship advice focuses on what to say. But how you communicate matters infinitely more. When conflict happens (and it will), your response determines whether she feels safer with you or more anxious.

Dr. John Gottman's research at the Gottman Institute found that successful couples have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. But more importantly, they handle conflict without criticism, contempt, defensiveness, or stonewalling. Those four things, which he calls the ""Four Horsemen,"" predict relationship failure with scary accuracy.

You can find tons of free resources and videos from the Gottman Institute on their website and YouTube channel. They break down exactly how to fight fair, repair after arguments, and build intimacy through communication. I've probably watched their stuff more than any Netflix series at this point, and it's helped me avoid so many stupid arguments.

Better communication habits:

• Use ""I feel"" statements instead of ""You always"" accusations. ""I feel unheard when I'm talking and you're on your phone"" vs ""You never listen to me.""

• Take breaks during heated arguments. When you're flooded with emotion, your brain literally can't think clearly. Say ""I need 20 minutes"" then come back calmer.

• Show appreciation regularly for small things. Thank her for making coffee, for listening, for existing. Positive deposits in the relationship bank account matter.

• Ask questions instead of making assumptions. ""What did you mean by that?"" is so much better than deciding what she meant and getting mad about it.

Be genuinely interested in her world

This seems obvious but most guys fail at it. They ask surface questions then wait for their turn to talk. Real interest means curiosity about how she thinks, what she values, what her experiences have taught her.

When she feels truly seen and understood by you, not just desired, that's when the deep attachment forms. That's the ""addiction"" part, though it's not really addiction, it's secure attachment that feels amazing for both people.

Ways to show real interest:

• Remember details she mentions and bring them up later. She mentioned a big work presentation next week? Ask how it went.

• Ask follow up questions that go deeper. Don't just nod and say ""cool"" when she talks about her passion for painting or whatever. Ask what draws her to it, what she's learning, how she got into it.

• Validate her perspective even when you disagree. ""I see why you'd feel that way"" doesn't mean you have to agree, just that you respect her viewpoint.

• Share her excitement about things that matter to her, even if they don't naturally interest you. Support her goals like you'd want her to support yours.

The truth is, becoming the kind of guy women feel safe with and attracted to isn't about tricks or tactics. It's about genuine personal development. Working on your emotional health, communication skills, independence, and capacity for intimacy. That's what creates real magnetism. And weirdly, when you focus on becoming that person, the right person tends to show up and stick around.",1,1771520015.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Anyways I've owned it for about 15 years, only wrenched on it myself. 

 it's in the middle of winter Canada, so exterior temp is cold.

So I have a yonaka rad and it's been leaking out of the rad cap for a while. I top it off but I'm sure air gets in once in a while. Yesturday late at night On a short drive I wasn't getting heat for the first time. Then this morning going into work I stopped for coffee, I wasn't getting heat then after getting the coffee I saw the temp gauge going up, caught it when it was maybe just below the red at the top and

So I threw the heat on max and was driving gently then all of a sudden the temp gauge dropped to whee it should be (assuming tstat opened up) not sure if just air in system or failing thermostat.


So question is

Do you guys also think it's air in the system? Im going to bleed it and if it rises again after bleeding it I will have it towed.  Don't want to overheat it and warp the head. 

Any thoughts are welcome? Going to take side roads home so if the temp gauge does go over half I can pull over immediately opposed to the highway. 


I work 100 kms from home and that's where I presently am. I have CAA so I can get it towed but it will take hours. 

I was going to leave work and see the coolant level and bleed it on an incline with the heat on blast for ten minutes. If  temp goes up above normal  I'll call the tow truck? (To change t stat at home)

Said heart palpitations were normal for women in their mid 30s and we notice them more. Said I was fine. 

I wore my Apple Watch for the first time in years just so I could try and monitor my hr. 

I am still having heart palpitations, chest tightness and chest pain. 

I can upload the EKG from ER when I get home this evening.  

I guess I am asking what my next steps should be? I can feel the heart palpitations and the increase in hr. I can also check it on my watch and confirm my hr is up and down.

A lot of you ordered from me, became returning customers (thank you😭💖), and helped spread the word. But even more than that, three big things came from that post.

2. I had the opportunity to move my business into a fully licensed commercial kitchen, which still feels a little unreal (it’s been about a month lol, still very new). This means I can bake more, be more consistent, and finally expand beyond what cottage law allowed.

3. I applied to the Toledo Farmers’ Market after many of you encouraged me to go for it and as of yesterday, I was accepted!!

**Why This Pick?**

Sacramento has lost their last 14 straight games, and are just 4-10 ATS in those outings, friends – that statistic alone should be enough to bet the opposite way. In addition, the Kings are both abysmal on defense and without two of their best scorers this evening (Sabonis & LaVine have both been ruled out…) Just before the break, Sacramento found a way to lose by nearly 30 to the Utah Jazz. On the other side, Orlando has won 3 of their last 4 games and 5 of their last 8; despite being on the road here, I’m more than confident that they bag a double digit win this evening.

1r948m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingRecovery/comments/1r948m2/restriction_in_bed_and_bed_food_addiction_what/,"“Restriction” in BED (and BED + “Food Addiction”): What People Mean, What Helps, and What Hurts","In binge eating spaces, the word **restriction** is used in multiple ways. People often argue while talking about *different* things. This post helps translate what “restriction” might mean and how to think about it when BED overlaps with “food addiction” / “ultra-processed food addiction” (UPFA).

---

## ✅ TL;DR (high-yield)
In BED conversations, **“restriction” can mean at least 4 different things:**

1) **Dietary restraint (mental restriction):** rigid rules, forbidden foods, “I’m not allowed.”  
2) **Dietary restriction (physical restriction):** actually not eating enough, skipping meals, long gaps.  
3) **Post-binge compensation:** “I binged so I’ll fast / eat tiny tomorrow.”  
4) **Selective boundaries (abstinence/harm reduction):** avoiding *specific* trigger foods/behaviors (often UPFs) **while still eating enough overall**.

**Restriction is not always bad**—but *the wrong kind* tends to worsen binge cycles.  
For many with BED, **undereating + rigid rules** increase binge risk.  
For some with strong “addiction-like” patterns to specific UPFs, **targeted boundaries** may reduce binges—*if they don’t become global deprivation or obsessive rule-making.*

---

## 1) The two “restriction” concepts that get mixed up most

### A) **Dietary restraint (a.k.a. mental restriction / rules)**
This is the **intent** or **cognitive effort** to limit eating—often to control weight/shape—**even if the person isn’t consistently under-eating.**

Examples:
- “I can’t have carbs.”
- “I’m only allowed 1200 calories.”
- “If I eat sugar, the day is ruined.”
- “I should ‘save’ food for later.”

### B) **Dietary restriction (a.k.a. physical restriction / undereating)**
This is **actually not eating enough** or spacing food so far apart that you become physiologically primed to binge.

Examples:
- Skipping meals
- Fasting
- Long gaps (e.g., coffee all day → ravenous at night)
- Eating portions that leave you persistently hungry

**Key point:** You can have high “restraint” (lots of rules) without consistent “restriction” (undereating). Many people bounce between the two.

---

## 2) What “restriction” usually means in BED treatment conversations
In evidence-based BED treatment models (like CBT-based approaches), “restriction” typically refers to patterns that **increase deprivation** and maintain the binge–restrict cycle:

- Skipping meals / fasting
- “Making up for” binges the next day
- Rigid food rules that create “forbidden food urgency”
- All-or-nothing thinking (“I blew it, so binge”)

A common clinical target is **regular, adequate eating** (structure without dieting).

---

## 3) Intuitive Eating (IE): “restriction” includes *mental restriction*
In Intuitive Eating conversations, restriction often means:
- **Physical restriction** (undereating)
- **Mental restriction** (“I’m not allowed,” moralizing foods, diet mentality)

IE is often trying to reduce the “scarcity effect” and rebound eating that can happen when foods are forbidden.

**Important nuance:** IE does *not* require “zero structure.” Many people use gentle structure (meal planning, regular meals) while reducing rigid rules and shame.

---

## 4) BED + “Food Addiction” / UPFA: when “restriction” might help (and when it backfires)

### The overlap is real
Research reviews suggest a sizable subgroup of people with BED also meet “food addiction” criteria on common measures, often reported around **~42–57%** in some BED samples (varies by study and method).

### So shouldn’t restriction be “good” for that subgroup?
**Sometimes—but only if we define it precisely.**

Here’s the distinction that keeps people safe:

### ✅ “Helpful restriction” (better called **boundaries**)
This is usually:
- **Selective abstinence** (avoid a *small set* of reliable trigger foods)
- or **harm reduction** (planned, limited exposure)
- **while still eating enough overall** (no meal skipping, no fasting)

Examples:
- “I eat 3 meals + planned snacks, and I choose abstinence from *my* specific trigger UPFs because they reliably trigger loss of control.”
- “I don’t bring my trigger foods home, but I’m not restricting calories.”

This approach is sometimes discussed as a potential option for people with UPFA/food addiction features, but it’s still debated and individualized.

### ❌ “Harmful restriction” (deprivation + rigid restraint)
This is:
- global dieting
- under-eating
- escalating forbidden-food lists
- post-binge compensation
- morality/shame rules

Examples:
- “No carbs, ever.”
- “I binged so I’ll fast tomorrow.”
- “I’m only allowed X grams of food.”

Even in people with food addiction traits, **global deprivation often increases binge drive**.

---

## 5) The “Blended / Integrated” approach (middle-ground model)
Some clinicians and researchers argue that the abstinence-vs-moderation debate is too polarized, and that **some patients benefit from a blended plan** that combines:

### Core BED stabilizers (often CBT-informed)
- Regular eating (reduce deprivation)
- Reducing “pathological dietary restraint” (rigid rules)
- Coping skills for urges/emotions
- Addressing shame/avoidance patterns

### + Addiction-informed tools (for those who truly need them)
- Selective abstinence from a **small** set of high-risk trigger foods
- Harm-reduction options for others
- Environmental design (availability, routines, friction)
- Relapse planning without “all-or-nothing” collapse

**Blended model goal:**  
> “Adequate nourishment + flexible eating for most foods, with targeted boundaries only where loss of control is reliable and severe.”

This is *not* a DIY moral code. It’s a pragmatic “what works without causing harm” strategy.

---

## 6) A practical decision aid: is this restriction helping or hurting?

### Likely **helpful** (boundary)
- You **do not** skip meals or fast
- You feel more stable (less obsession, fewer binges)
- Your “forbidden list” is small and specific
- You can still eat a wide variety of foods
- If you slip, you return to your plan without “might as well binge”

### Likely **harmful** (diet cycle)
- You’re under-eating, delaying meals, or fasting
- You’re increasingly preoccupied with food
- Your forbidden list keeps growing
- Slip-ups trigger “I failed, so binge”
- Shame is driving the rules

---

## 7) Language that prevents confusion (recommended)
Instead of saying “restriction,” try one of these:

- **“I restricted calories / skipped meals”** (physical restriction)
- **“I’m using rigid food rules”** (dietary restraint)
- **“I’m compensating after a binge”** (post-binge restriction)
- **“I’m using a recovery boundary / selective abstinence”** (targeted trigger management)
- **“I’m doing harm reduction”** (planned moderation)

A helpful template:
> “When I say restriction, I mean ___ (skipping meals / rigid rules / post-binge compensation / selective abstinence).”

---

## 8) Safety notes (please read)
- If you have a history of anorexia or severe restrictive patterns, **abstinence-style rules can be risky** and should be handled carefully with a specialist.
- If “boundaries” are increasing obsession, shame, or rigidity, it may be a sign the approach needs adjusting (or you need more support).

1r9478h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9478h,How do we navigate a world where we all participate indirectly in injustice?,"All of our phones and computers have elements that are rare, and often found in places like Central Africa where the poor and children dig with their hands as slaves, so that we might have our devices or our cars.

Companies like Zara, SHEIN and many more source their materials from child laborers in Asia, Africa and the Latin America; even North America. They know and do nothing. 

Big chocolate companies like Nestle, Hersheys and Mars have failed to end the use of child laborers in Africa who cultivate and farm cacao beans which are distributed eventually landing in the warehouses of these large companies. Again, they know and do nothing.

In the Bible God reveals himself as a God of justice.

Deuteronomy 10:18 - God is described as the one “who executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.” 

Psalm 146:7–9 - the Lord “executes justice for the oppressed, watches over the sojourners, upholds the widow and the fatherless.” 

In Isaiah 1:16–17 - God rebukes the Israelite for the failure to do these things. He says to ”Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow’s cause.”

So I think it’s obvious that God expects his people, us the Church, to be vigilant and active in injustices all around us. While it’s not possible for one person to be active in all the injustices in the world, as they are too many, the body of Christ can and ought to in unity take the fight against injustices and to stand with the oppressed.

So how can we when we are all indirectly implicit? We all have phones, computers, clothes, coffee, chocolate…. Some of these things are necessary for living in this modern world, others are not.

I’ve wrestled with this. Especially as a tech nerd. 

I came to the “temporary solution” that while none of us Christians can fully avoid being complicit however indirectly and innocently, we can choose to cut of things that are unnecessary.

For me, my phone and computer are necessary. But I can choose to buy clothes from local vendors who have them made in the good old USA, or even thrift or learn to make my own.

Same with coffee, and chocolate. I don’t need to buy unnecessary chocolate from companies that willingly use child labor.

I’ve come to a solution that keeps me indirectly complicit while at the same time taking a stand to boycott that which I deem unnecessary. 

In this case it’s become a matter of necessity. I can choose buy clothing and chocolate from morally clean sources, but I cannot do so with my much required electronics, therefore I can choose to cut out Zara, SHEIN, Hersheys, Mars and Nestle for moral reason, and keep my iPhone and MacBook because my necessity outweighs the moral imperative.

Oh boy.

I’m not gonna give up on electronic, but at least I can take a stand against its use of child labor. And at least I can take a step further with clothing and sweet treats.

So how do those of you who have wrestled with this particular issue come to a certain solution? Perhaps some of you have gone hillbilly and abandoned all products of the modern world, and I suppose then I cannot ask you anything other than to say that you are the better man/woman.

In 2021 I moved out of state and I recently came back home and rejoined the friend circle. When I rejoined, I was playfully flirting with my now partner. At the time, I was not aware that they opened up their relationship and became Polygamous. They made that choice two years ago. He then asked me out and it threw me into a three day panic attack. I even called his wife (my friend) to be sure that what he was saying is true. 

She confirmed that they are poly and that she actually has a girlfriend who is another friend of mine. She also gave me full permission to sleep with her husband if I wanted to. And I always thought he was attractive, but I never thought of him in this way. 

We went on one date where it was more so me asking for information on how this whole relationship dynamic works and they classified their relationship as “kitchen table polyamory”.  As a few more dates continued, I found myself liking him more and more and eventually falling in love with him. I suppose in this relationship, I am considered “mono-poly” as I prefer monogamy but I’m OK with him having a wife. I did inform him that if there was ever a third that I would be done and I would consider that cheating.

I find myself being possessive and needy. But I tend to just get over that with a good nap. I really only get to see him once a week as our schedules are so busy at the moment.

I truly want to enjoy this relationship however, when I think about how I’ll never have the option to marry him, I am deeply saddened. Sometimes I think about just calling it off now rather than waiting until another person shows interest in me. He knows I want a marriage, and he said he would be happy seeing another person fall in love with me, and I with them. But idk he’s pretty much everything I want in a man. And that is hard to find. I worry that I’ll never find my own partnership. I don’t wanna settle into a 4 bedroom house with them, that’s what he wants. Where he and his wife have their own rooms and the secondaries have their own rooms too. 

I long for a marriage that’s relatively traditional. Where I wake up every morning next to my partner. where we help each other around the house. A relationship that builds overtime with shared challenges and major life events like buying a house together for example. I don’t really want kids and I’m never gonna be a stay at home wife. I guess a modern dual income no kids lifestyle. 

I don’t really have a question. I’m more so wanted to talk about what I’m going through and see if anybody else can relate or has advice on something like this.. 

I will also say that his wife and I are good friends and we try to have monthly coffee dates where we catch up and talk about the relationship. ",2,1771519460.0,polyamorous,3,1.0,False
